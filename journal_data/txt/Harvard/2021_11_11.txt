After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The year was 2012. I was ten years old, sitting in a Starbucks in an unremarkable suburb of northern Chicago. Snow piled in bluish mounds outside the window, and I etched a hasty star on the fogged glass. It was January. Half-frozen customers stumbled into the store and shook frost from their hair, grumbling for Pike Place Roast and a caramel macchiato with no whip, please.
For such a bleak scene, I was alarmingly invigorated. I was writing a poem on a Post-it. It was about dogs. Between sips of hot cocoa, I marveled at the words scrawled on that yellow square. I was thrilled about the poem. It was an exceedingly bad poem.
My foray into poetry began with intuitive things. Animals and seasons, flowers and roads. Things I could touch and observe. As years passed, I turned to poetry to probe the less obvious: my inherited history, the liminal space I occupied between cultures. Feelings of smallness and largeness, of compression and infinitude. Poetry became an entry point into explorations of gnarly and vital ideas — personhood, mortality, my complicated capacity for feeling.
At a certain point, it dawned on me that I might actually have a knack for the craft. In late middle school, I started submitting to local contests and, to my initial surprise, heard back. In the coming years, I was published in a smattering of literary magazines geared toward younger audiences. When I entered high school, I participated in national competitions. In the mail came certificates, occasionally medals. My senior year, my poems flew me to Miami for a week of fully financed masterclasses and, ultimately, earned me a ticket to the White House — a trip that never happened because of the pandemic, but that was an honor nonetheless.
***
It was surreal to be celebrated for something as personal as my words. And yet, despite its perks, sharing my writing through institutionalized avenues had its downsides. As the years progressed, the exhilarating abandon with which I had written poems became colored with tinges of apprehension.
With every accolade I won, the more I became attuned to — perhaps even obsessed with — the faceless reader on the other end. The critic. The consumer. The literary jury. Elements of my writing that had once come naturally became confused and performed. Even though I tried to fight it, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was molding my writing to others’ praise. I had privileged my audience to the point of losing myself.
When I began my freshman year at Harvard, poetry naturally took a back seat. None of my classes were poetry workshops. Between extracurriculars, coursework, and a digital social life, carving out personal time to write became increasingly challenging, if not impossible. By the time summer came around, I realized I had moved farther and farther away from the genre. The distance allowed me to realize how unhealthy my younger writing years had, at least in certain moments, been.
It didn’t matter that my passion for poetry had faded. I could handle that. Eventually, though, my faith in the honesty of my own words faded, too — and that I could not accept. Shortly before my sophomore year of college, I resolved to quit creative writing.
***
My resolution coincided with a summer trip to Korea. Perhaps it was the abrupt shift in landscape or lifestyle, or the sheer boredom of the two-week mandatory quarantine upon arriving in Seoul, that led me to the spontaneous decision to join stan Twitter. It seemed like a way to put my intellectual anxieties behind me and revel in a space that was just for fun, no strings attached. Like other users, I crafted an anonymous account. I used my favorite anime character for a profile photo, and used an alias for my username. I followed random accounts that boasted eclectic interests ranging from wild mushroom picking to libertarian economics.
After the two-week quarantine, I was free. Korea’s superb public transportation allowed me to explore at least one city per day. On the subway, as the metropolitan landscape blurred metallic against the window, I would open the blue bird and scroll.
Under my alias, I fell in love with a complicated digital ecosystem. No one used their real names. The anonymity liberated us; we were bolder and more spontaneous, more creative and compassionate. In those two-hundred-eighty-character messages, I felt at liberty to externalize my most spontaneous and at times most vulnerable revelations. As I traversed Hong-dae and Itaewon, Gangnam and Dongdaemun, I was afforded oblique, enigmatic glimpses into the minds of strangers.
Every night in the maddening heat of August, minutes before I fell asleep, I would share a single image or thought with my followers. A white rose, blooming from the side of a mountain, that was so gorgeous it seemed like a biological glitch. The nostalgic romance of Korean convenience stores with their iconic aisles of snacks and toiletries and colorful non-perishables. The stars in the rural sky, yet to be marred by light pollution, resembling an arc of glowing rubble suspended in the dark. How small I felt looking up, yet also how sure, as though the ground beneath me were still for the first time.
***
Sending words into cyberspace was thrilling. The anonymity allowed for a radical suspension of judgement. For the first time in years, I had found a space that permitted me to think out loud. I began resisting the impulse to edit my thoughts in real-time and, gradually, reclaimed a part of myself. In the place I least expected, I was writing again. My tweets, strange as it sounds, read like fragments of poems. I realized, later, that they were poems in themselves.
If there’s anything I learned from that summer in Korea, it’s that I will always be writing poems. In retrospect, everything was a poem: The brackish breath I took gazing at the Hangang. My post-midnight trek across the technicolor alleys of Seoul. The melancholic awe I felt staring at the crashing ocean, blurred passersby murmuring softly as the sky turned pink. A poem, I came to understand, is a quiet shock of sight. A feeling of urgent wonder. That disquieting revelation that the world may still be good, after all.
Ultimately, I did not turn back to poetry because it was comforting or interesting. I turned back because it allowed me to say something essential about myself.
My stan Twitter account still exists. It will for a long time. Grim as it sounds, my account will likely outlive me. That thought once brought me to the brink of despair — now, I regard it neutrally, almost with tenderness. The account has hundreds more followers than my journalism account, a fact I find amusing to no end.
I was surprised and mildly disturbed to find that some of my followers initially thought I was in my mid-thirties. (Was it the semi-formal language?) Many of them correctly assumed I study the humanities. They know I have a twin (who, of course, has remained anonymous in our discourse.) They know my favorite shows and artists. They know I love Earl Grey and big cities and solitary walks in twilit suburbia. They know I listen to indie Korean music, have inchoate aspirations to study the law, and am flirting with the idea of spending two years of my twenties traveling the world.
Protected by our digital aliases, we spoke about fandoms and entertainment, about trivia and art. But if you read between the lines, it became clear that we were trying to talk about ourselves.
***
A few months ago, I thought about dissolving my account. As my cursor hovered over that red button, I thought of the people I had met. Yes, I only knew curated versions of who they were, but there were real people on the other end. The grace and warmth they had extended to me affirmed that. Among the people I connected with, a few remain vivid in my mind: A business major from Indonesia who spent her Sundays sprawled in the park near her apartment, flipping through ‘80’s Japanese comics. A Seattle-based litigator who hated the South of her childhood and was pooling money to visit Korea. A recent high school graduate from the Philippines who dreamed of becoming a nurse. A sports manga-obsessed 23-year-old from the Bay area who lit up every time I asked about his grassroots music label.
During those few months, I built a sparse digital constellation. Tiny apertures into my obsessions, my fears, the erratic largeness of my dreams. That is all these people will ever know. And that is exceedingly enough.
It has been half a year since I left Korea to begin my sophomore year of college; a decade has passed since that slow January in 2012. And yet, in an obscure corner of my mind, it is still snowing. I am still sitting in the middle of nowhere, Illinois, my hand hovering over a Post-it. I am ten years old, and the people around me shake frost from their hair. The yellow square rests against the lacquered mahogany table, and I am alone, immersed in my own unyielding faith in the words on that throwaway paper.
It is a bad poem and I am thrilled to have written it, to have pulled it irrevocably into the world. I hope I will always linger there, in my winter of bad poems. Because to step out of that season would be to end a good thing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m deeply concerned about the troubling rise of empathy politics amongst liberals and progressives on social media and on Harvard’s campus. We’re living in an era where YouTubers with millions of subscribers like Shane Dawson brag about being empaths and companies like Jubilee start entire empathy campaigns. They create video series rehabilitating notorious racists and invite trans people and members of other marginalized groups to debate their existence — all in empathy’s name.
This trend takes on its own unique shape at Harvard. Amongst Harvard students, empathy merch and posts on Instagram stories abound, stating or implying that if we only felt more empathy for each other, we could solve the world’s problems and amend political cleavages.
But what if I told you that the empathy hoodies students sport as they walk past houseless people in the Square is actually contributing to their dehumanization.
The empathy advocates have placed the cart before the horse. Our society leaves billions of people across the globe without basic human needs such as shelter, health care, nutrition, and clean water because it was built by white supremacist, capitalist imperialists that devalue the lives of everyone except rich white men and prioritize profit above all else.
To be clear, I do not write against the concept of empathy itself, but rather its centering as a necessary, critical, or sufficient component to helping people or to making the world a better place. I believe that this centering of empathy is shallow, counterproductive, and deliberately milquetoast. In fact, it actively serves the interests of those who wish to uphold systems of oppression.
The belief that feeling other people’s emotions is a critical or necessary step in helping them is toxic because it implies that you need to experience someone else’s pain to help them. Yet this is not necessary, as simply valuing other people’s lives should be enough to convince you to listen and help.
This selfish idea has disastrous consequences for oppressed people as they become reduced to helpless victims. We see this manifest through the spread of increasingly graphic trauma porn (such as starving children and dying refugees) that exploits vulnerability to garner donations.
Ironically, empathy activism actually furthers the devaluation of poor and oppressed people because it transforms them into spectacles of victimhood and suffering. It also promotes white saviorism as it views privileged people and their capacity for kindness and generosity as the main agents of change in society, even though these people often directly and materially benefit from the oppression they are supposed to end.
Even the assumption that emphasizing is always possible poses a problem. Some people's experiences are just so far removed from your own that it is simply impossible to imagine or understand them. How can a cis person walk in the shoes of a trans person? How can a white person understand what it means to navigate the world in a Black body? While they can start by consuming the writings and art of marginalized people based on their lived experiences, privileged people who attempt to empathize with others face incredible difficulty. After all, they have grown up with a racist, sexist, and classist media that has asked them to empathize primarily or exclusively with cishet white men while portraying marginalized peoples as laughing stocks, dangerous or subhuman. Thus, most attempts at empathizing amount only to selfish projection.
Empathy advocates also seem to forget that not all people feel empathy, or at least not to the same extent. Empathy advocacy is often ableist because it implies that feeling other people’s emotions is necessary. This idea contributes to the stigma that neurodivergent and sociopathic people are dangerous and immoral. It is also misguided because becoming enmeshed in other people’s emotions can sometimes make it difficult to provide the support and care they need. Thus, empathy is not even always desirable.
In fact, empathy is often weaponized against oppressed people as they are asked to show compassion and understanding for the individuals who perpetuate their oppression. Privileged liberals often call for conversations where oppressed people’s basic human rights are debated, and ask that afterward oppressed people remain civil, agree to disagree, and sing kumbaya with those who just argued against their right to exist. Refusing to pick a side in situations of injustice and instead focusing on empathy and civility is in fact not empathetic, but a cruel and insipid cowardice.
As a community, we must unlearn the prioritization of empathy and instead, learn to center a deep appreciation for marginalized people and their autonomy. All political projects should start from this point, centering the most oppressed among us as the greatest agents of change because they understand the systems of oppression that enshackle them. After all, they are the only people who truly know what it feels like to deal with them.
Of course, there is a space for empathy in activism and liberation movements, but it can never come before a fundamental appreciation, value, and concern for the lives of marginalized people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As seniors reflecting on our time at Harvard, and as students deeply committed to public service and activism, we realize these past three years have been some of the most chaotic of our lives.
Through our work with the Phillips Brooks House Association and a number of progressive student groups, we have joined our teaching fellows and course assistants on the picket line; we have occupied the admissions office to demand an ethnic studies program; we have rallied for Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuels and the prison industrial complex; and we have mourned the loss of several radical faculty of color who were denied tenure, including Professors Cornel West and Lorgia Garcia-Pena.
And, of course, we have been living through a catastrophic pandemic. We thought that witnessing the failures of our political, economic, social, and public health systems would teach us a lesson: that it is our obligation to build a better world together, one where we interact with ourselves and each other in more just, equitable, and caring ways. We hoped that when we returned to campus, we would be greeted by this shared understanding that all of us must do better.
Instead, we returned to a state of post-pandemic amnesia, where our classmates and peers are, understandably, desperate to forget and move on from the death and destruction we have experienced. With the protection and security of our biweekly Covid tests, it’s become easy to pretend that the pandemic is over, a feeling only exacerbated by the apparent resuming of “normal life”: in-person classes, fully-functional dining halls, and social gatherings. But through this act of forgetting, we risk ignoring the lessons the pandemic continues to teach us.
Though the relative privilege and safety of the Harvard bubble might convince us otherwise, we are still living through the pandemic, and its disastrous effects continue to reverberate, especially for the most vulnerable among us. Workers who have carried the University through the pandemic — cleaning, cooking, and otherwise caring for students — are persistently sidelined, as the financial interests of the university take precedence over their well-being.
Dining halls are still reported to be monumentally understaffed despite the recent contract agreement between UNITE HERE Local 26 and the University, with some workers sharing that they are pulling 16-hour shifts and 90-hour weeks. Custodians, who were denied access to personal protective equipment at the beginning of the pandemic. Harvard has repeatedly justified blatantly anti-worker behavior — threatening pay cuts, cutting healthcare, and refusing to accede to union demands — by invoking the economic exigencies of the pandemic.
It could not be clearer how dishonest these claims are. Just last month, the Harvard Management Company reported that the University’s endowment has soared to more than $50 billion — the highest it has ever been — and that it concluded fiscal year 2021 with an operational surplus of more than $250 million.
It is also clear to us that Harvard has shirked its responsibilities to not just those inside its gates, but also to those outside them. Its plan for continued expansion into Allston has been ambiguous at best, leaving residents and local politicians in the dark. Harvard owns a third of the land in Allston. As its expansion into the area drives up rental prices, Allston residents are demanding answers; President Bacow has refused to entertain them, citing his busy schedule.
At the same time, working at PBHA over the last year and a half has shown us just how much communities are struggling. During the pandemic, as students across the city were forced out of schools, PBHA operated our annual Summer Urban Program, supporting hundreds of youth — most of whom are low-income — academically, socially, and emotionally. At a time with high unemployment rates, we responded to requests for food support from more than a hundred families. And amid the housing crisis, we mobilized to give out grants to families at risk of eviction.
As we geared up in-person programming for the fall, we continued to witness the ruinous impacts of the pandemic — and, importantly, Harvard’s failures to act. In an August 2021 email, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana welcomed students back, urging us to “stay focused on the world beyond our campus.” As he writes, “we saw injustice, inequality, and human suffering during the pandemic that we cannot and should not forget.” But, somehow, even as the pandemic rages on, we seem determined to forget. To act as if the world has not shown us the pernicious effects of our self-serving ways.
The world has profoundly changed, whether we like it or not. And as much as we are excited to be back — to walk through Harvard Yard and wave at friends, to sit together at the Smith Center and laugh like we used to, to be in classrooms again and learn from our favorite faculty — we are also worried that we have learned nothing from the last 18 months of tragedy, ones that have revealed just how starkly social inequality persists.
Being at Harvard has taught us both many lessons on how to be, think, and act. One of Harvard’s lessons that we refuse to learn, however, is how to shirk our responsibilities to one another. Instead, we beg you all to think differently, to toss post-pandemic amnesia aside, and to take up the call of public service.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year, undergraduates at Howard University discovered mushrooms, mildew, and black mold within their dorms. Some students say these glaringly unhygienic housing conditions have led to severe health consequences, including respiratory issues and “coughing blood.” Beyond concerns of subhuman housing, this semester Howard students have dealt with a weeklong WiFi outage, spurts with no running water and air conditioning in muggy dorms, and classroom eyewash stations that spit out putrid, yellow water.
Faced with seemingly unfazed administrators, students took to occupying the Armour J. Blackburn University Center in tents on Oct. 12 to demand the university address their housing concerns. They have not left the building since. Some protesters say they prefer the tents to sordid dorms.
The nearly month-long sit-in has attracted the support of Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Corey Booker (D-N.J.), and Rep. Ayanna Presley (D-Mass.). We add our support to the mix. No student should be forced to live, let alone complete a degree, in such objectionable conditions.
Yet Howard’s own administrators don’t seem to agree — or, at the very least, don’t seem entirely cognizant of who exactly is at fault for the continued disruption. Just last week, the university’s official Twitter account responded to the protest with a tweet stating that some Blackburn Center subcontracted employees had been fired by their company Sodexo, Inc, as “an unintended consequence” of the occupation. The obvious implication? Workers had lost their jobs because of the protest, and students better cut it out “to avoid more repercussions like this one.” Though passive-aggressive, the university’s message is clear: Accept the shrooms or bear the burden of others’ lost livelihoods.
We find the tweet’s framing absurd and quite frankly suppressive. Not only does it blatantly shift guilt and responsibility for a corporate decision made by a $25 billion company to a handful of young demonstrators, but it also appears to suggest that student needs and workers’ rights are mutually exclusive. Safe university housing isn’t an unreasonable expectation, let alone incompatible with employees’ job security (particularly when tuition and meal plan money are collected at the start of each school year).
Indeed, any of us would be outraged if a landlord failed to address black mold in our apartment; suing would certainly be reasonable. Attempting to guilt-trip demonstrators into conceding their demands through a false oppositional narrative, and by painting basic hygiene expectations as unreasonable, is dishonest and coercive.
Currently, Howard has a ten-year plan to renovate its campus. We understand that not all universities can complete ambitious renovations at the pace Harvard does. Because of America’s past and present racist realities, historically Black colleges and universities like Howard lack the financial heft of historically predominantly white institutions like Harvard. We would be remiss not to acknowledge the long and ugly history which disadvantages schools like Howard but happens to favor our institution.
Despite that notable wealth gap, Howard doesn’t exactly appear to be in an extremely dire financial situation either. The Vice President’s alma mater is perhaps the most financially secure historically Black university in the country, with an endowment of over $700 million as of 2020. Last year, the university also enjoyed a fundraising boost after receiving two of its largest donations ever: a $10 million gift from the Karsh Family Foundation and a whopping $40 million from author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott allocated, in part, to improve campus infrastructure.
These cash injections don’t dissolve the many structural barriers — such as a declining alumni pool and the diversion, for decades, of deserved state funding — that disadvantage HBCUs. But it does mean that university administrators must have the means to do better, at least by offering stop-gap measures.
An eternal occupation is, of course, untenable. If Howard wants to end the Blackburn Occupation, engaging with students instead of blaming them for a billion-dollar corporations’ hiring and firing decisions seems like a good start. One of the protesters' demands is a town hall with the university president, which he has yet to agree to. A substantive town hall attended by both protest leaders and President Wayne A.I. Frederick is crucial to convey good faith from the University — and no, a town hall on the crisis like that held for Howard parents in late October, where no live questions were taken, doesn’t count.
This situation highlights broader issues with subcontracted university labor and private equity-managed campus housing. Academic institutions, including our own, too frequently use a lack of direct labor affiliation to deflect institutional responsibility for workers who, full-stop, work for us. Relying on companies with a solid track record of safely housing students would also be preferable to continuing to rely on Corvias — a corporation with a shady history including mold-induced long-term health issues birthed in its residences.
Howard owes its students more. We hope that the university’s top administrators will recognize this and move beyond shady tweets and their current hostile approach to student protest.

I’m in a metal bathroom stall at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The walls are vibrating, the bass so deep I can feel it thrumming through the grayscale-tiled floor into my feet and snaking up to my chest. My eyes are closed and the bottom of my phone is pressed up close to my ear. I am not listening to the garish pop music coming from the walls, sung live to a concert full of screaming people a few doors down. Through my phone’s tinny speaker, I am listening to a Phoebe Bridgers cover of Bo Burnham’s “That Funny Feeling,” grasping onto the tendrils of her voice, fighting to catch every last drop of its sound.
The song is six minutes long, and I ride the length on repeat like a wave, waiting for each crest, the capstone line: “Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown / A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone / Total disassociation, fully out your mind / Googling ‘derealization,’ hating what you find.” The more I focus on the words, the less I feel the world tilting around me.
Recently, I have been surprised by the extent to which the pandemic has gradually and silently fallen out of everyday discussions. I don’t mean masks and Covid-19 tests. I’m talking about how the world imploded on itself, how what we used to call normal was thrown into a stark, strange, nostalgic light by Zoom screens and overfilled hospitals. Lives lived within a 100-foot radius, empty city streets at rush hour.
It is impossible to delineate a collective pandemic experience, and I would never want to try. Mine involved my being hit with a fractured snowball of change — my parents’ divorce; moving twice to their two new apartments; a monthslong relationship-that-never-was; seven-hour Zoom sessions with construction blaring outside; more identity crises and episodes of disillusionment than I can count. I began to see that we are all defined by the cracks and breaks, things between more than the things themselves.
The first time I listened to “That Funny Feeling,” I really did Google “derealization.” What I found eerily echoed something that kept happening in my own life, starting around when the world shut down in March 2020: “when you persistently or repeatedly ... have a sense that things around you aren't real,” as well as distortions of space, physicality, time, and clarity. These symptoms, when they come to me, are usually accompanied by something else: a recurring, throbbing pain in my chest, as if a band is wrapped tightly around the sinew next to my heart.
My therapist calls these all signs of anxiety. I know, logically, that she’s right, but to me they’re more like warning signals: “Wake up, look around, pay attention. Shit is crazy.” If I listen closely enough to these warnings, I can realize the absence of any sort of intrinsic reality. If I unravel people and situations down to their atomic levels, I can understand that everything — everything — is made up, and I can escape having to grapple with sadness and pain. I can retreat back into my head, safe with the knowledge that I have transcended it all.
In the middle of the pandemic, I’d walk out onto the street at night and stare at a neon sign for so long that it stopped being real in my mind; the yellow-green light sizzled and fell apart. Dinner with my dad’s new girlfriend? She seemed nice, she made him happy, I could tell. But I could convince myself that wasn’t me sitting there next to her at the table, that wasn’t my life.
Everything was a danger, my mind thought, because how could it not be? My rational self knew that change was the only real constant. But all I wanted was for all the change to stop.
***
The worst is over now, people keep saying. Normal is in sight, we can feel its light grazing our skin. Vaccinations are up, cases are down. Let’s go back, please, to the way things used to be.
But the neural pathways in my brain that force me up into anxious waking dreams are too deep, too well-oiled by the past 19 months. My bouts of derealization have opened a window into the feeling that everything is infinitely more strange and constructed and complicated — beautiful, even — than our rational selves let us be cognizant of in our daily lives.
Perversely, I have become a little bit addicted to this feeling. I cannot help but want to derealize, zoom out. Not only because it protects me from the sadness and pain of reality, but because on some level I believe that my derealized surreality is more true than anything else. Given the devastating, mind-twisting time we’re coming out of, doesn’t derealizing almost make more sense?
But as much as part of me wants to live on that level all the time — to retreat into myself and watch the world play out its from afar — I am beginning to understand that it closes me off from so much: conversation, connection, any sensation that is not a panicky ache in my chest. I don’t want that kind of life. I’ve been working on pulling myself back down.
***
I’m at dinner at Annenberg, and I am too tuned in. I can feel every click of a fork, every whisper of insecurity flickering between the people at the table over, every wave of color in the chandelier above my head. My chest starts to throb, then to tighten; it hurts. It’s too much, it’s all too much.
I tell myself sternly: listen up. You’re at college now. Your life is starting. Get a grip. No more space-time warps, no more sizzling neon signs. I link my hands behind my back and pull my shoulders back as hard as I can, half-wishing my chest would split open so the pain would go away. I swim laps at the Mac, take a nap, massage the side of my neck, ice skate in mindless loops, do a vinyasa flow, meditate.
Or if I can’t, if I have to stay and finish my meal and go through the rest of my day, I stare into space and negotiate with reality instead. I repeat to myself: this isn’t back then, this is now. You’re here, you’re safe. Nothing is hurting you, except for your mind. I swear. And sometimes, when I’m lucky, the pain starts to fade, things start to come back into focus. In those moments, I am practically in awe; it seems too good and too simple to be true.
I have found a strange sort of freedom in where I am now — a space between the real and the surreal. Walking down a crowded street, I can feel my feet on the concrete and the sun on my face again. I see neon signs flicker. I watch light deconstruct into particles on my skin.

Adams: artsy, queer, and performing-arts focused population with occasional provocative theatrical performances. Eliot: preppy, blue-blooded schmoozers. Kirkland: home of the jocks. Lowell: the studious. The Quad: tight-knit community with a lot of Black and Hispanic students and an emphasis on activism.
These were just some of the reputations that Harvard Houses had from their inception in the 1930s to the end of the 20th century. Harvard House reputations, once well established on campus, no longer hold anywhere near the same grip on the student imagination — if you ask a student today about the former image of their House, they’d probably only be able to recall hearsay or rumors.
All of that changed in 1995, when then-Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett ’57 introduced housing randomization as a replacement to the longstanding preference-based housing system, which marked its 25th anniversary during Housing Day in 2021.
The 1994 “Report on the Structure of Harvard College,” presented to Jewett in the year leading up to the administration’s decision, provides clues as to why the committee ultimately proposed the switch to randomization. The report argued for the implementation of housing randomization, citing “the educational disadvantages of a housing system that does not reflect the richness and complexity of the student body, and the distractions to students and the negative stereotyping of Houses.”
A History of Housing at Harvard
The concept of a housing system is the brainchild of Harvard President Abbott L. Lowell, Class of 1877, and began in 1930 with the intent to combat the effects of socioeconomic inequality that the previous off-campus housing scheme had made blatant. “So far as subjects of concentration, pecuniary means, and residence in different parts of the country are concerned, each house should be as nearly as possible a cross-section of the College,” Lowell wrote in his 1927-1928 Report of the President and the Treasurer of Harvard College. Despite this move towards greater equality, a caveat still remained: until 1971, an application system, in which House deans interviewed students before they were admitted to reside in the house, determined student housing.
In 1971, the application system was abandoned in favor of the preference system which gave students the opportunity to rank their housing choices. This fostered homogenous communities within each House and the ensuing development of strong and well-known House reputations, as students with similar backgrounds or interests tended to rank the same Houses in their housing forms.
In 1977, the number of choices permitted was decreased from 12 to four. Since not all blocking groups would be able to get one of their four choices, some students would have to be randomized, which allowed for more diverse houses.
Lowell House Faculty Dean David I. Laibson ’88, who lived in Mather as an undergraduate, says that when he was in College, blocking groups were allowed to rank their top four housing choices and then received a lottery number. If space was still available in a group’s first choice House by the time the administration got to their number, they would be assigned to that House. If their lottery number was not considered in time, they would be given their next choice, and so on, with a small number of students not being placed into any of their four choices.
Though well-defined reputations for each House existed, they were not comprehensive — not every student in Kirkland was an athlete, not every Adams resident was involved in the arts scene. In Laibson’s words, houses “were not completely homogeneous.” Nonetheless, the reputations persisted. “My impression is that there was enough of a tilt that it actually meaningfully affected the culture of these places,” Laibson says. In 1990, under Jewett, ordered choice was abandoned in favor of non-ranked choice in an effort to increase housing diversity.
Under the non-ranked choice system, the Crimson reported that about 90 percent of blocking groups received one of their four choices, while 10 percent were randomized for housing. A former Currier House resident, Sarah J. Cooper ’97, was part of the 10 percent in her class, and covered the ongoing campus debate on randomization while a reporter for the Crimson, compelled by the personal relationship she had with the change.
Cooper recalls that at the time randomization was announced as replacing the non-ranked choice system, those who had been part of the 10 percent reacted to Jewett’s 1995 randomization announcement with the sentiment, “Well, now you get to feel like we did” — that is, deprived of choice. As an editor at The Crimson, she was frustrated about her regular commute from the Quad. Still, despite her initial disappointment, she recalled that Currier “ended up being a nice place.”
Others in this 10 percent who were put into a house without their input similarly ended up enjoying their time there, including current Adams House Dean and former Currier resident Mercedes C. Becerra ’91. “In the end, honestly, I think we won the lottery because Currier was so awesome,” she says.
Ultimately, Cooper believed that Jewett’s switch to total randomization achieved greater fairness by moving away from the “not equal” treatment of subjecting 10 percent of blocking groups to Houses in which they did not select, while the majority of blocking groups were free to enjoy one of the Houses they had chosen.
With the reputations of each House firmly cemented and the assumption of overall agency in one’s living arrangements known throughout the student body, Jewett’s 1995 spring announcement that the College was switching to a system of totally randomized housing for rising sophomores, beginning with the class of 1999, was met with waves of surprise and anger throughout students. While reasons for unhappiness in the face of randomization differed, a general feeling of one’s independence being overstepped by the administration prevailed on campus.
This shift to randomization, deeply controversial at the time, has remained largely unchanged, with the only significant adjustment being that in 1999 the maximum size for a blocking group was reduced from 16 people to eight.
Student Backlash: The End of House Community? 
“Randomization will not lead to a substantial integration in Harvard’s social life, and it will destroy any sense of a house community,” a 1995 Crimson Editorial entitled “Randomization Will Not Work” wrote. The piece continues, “administrators are concerned about the high numbers of Black and Hispanic students in the three quad houses.”
J. Lewis Ford ’97, who chose to live in Pforzheimer House, recalled the role that the Quad played in generating a feeling of belonging for him on campus. “The three houses in the Quad were sort of the center of a Black community,” Ford says. “As a Black student ... in a predominantly white institution, that was a really important and a very valued, treasured community and space that we had.” As a result, Black students who sought to be “centered with the Black community” would list the Quad houses on their housing forms, according to Ford.
In addition to his affinity for the Quad, Ford felt that the randomization system “removed individual agency”; The Crimson’s 1995 editorial similarly asserted that the administration exhibited “paternalism” in assuming that Harvard students were incapable of managing the responsibility of choosing a House. “We’re in college. We go to Harvard,” one anti-randomization student told The Crimson in 1995. “We’re supposed to be the leaders of tomorrow, but apparently we’re too stupid to choose where we want to live.”
They were not alone in their grievances: according to an Undergraduate Council poll at the time, 82 percent of students opposed the administration’s decision. Students wrote letters to presidents of Harvard Clubs throughout the U.S., a petition was created against randomization which garnered over 1,000 signatures, and over 200 students gathered outside University Hall to protest the decision.
“No dice throw,” “If you choose, we lose,” “Don’t test chaos theory on us,” and “82% can’t be ignored,” were all slogans used in the Housing Choice rally, according to a Crimson article covering the event. Students chanted into the air: "We won’t lose our right to choose” and “Hey, Dean Jewett, you’d better not do-it.” Ford, a speaker at the 1995 protest, echoed the same sentiments he did today when interviewed for the Crimson’s Housing Choice rally article 25 years ago: “As a member of a minority community on campus whose numbers are less than 8 percent of the College, it’s often difficult to have my voice heard.”
An Adams resident tutor at the time expressed what he saw as the implications of randomization with a real-world analogy. Randomization “would be like taking all the gays and lesbians in San Francisco and New York and relocating them in even numbers throughout the United States,” he said, describing how he viewed Adams and Dunster.
Randomization Today: A Highly-Lauded System
Nowadays, the House reputations are mostly gone. “I think they persist in the tiniest ways,” Laibson says. “It’s really just a miniscule vestige of things that existed back then.”
Becerra sees some of these hallmarks of the old character of Adams in the building today. Many of the facilities reflect the arts-focused history of the house, from the tunnels with murals to a former underground swimming pool that was converted into a theater. Additionally, traditions like Drag Night, which is still celebrated at Adams, are a holdover from the large queer population that used to reside in the House.
Current Pforzheimer House Dean and former Quincy resident Anne Harrington ’82 says that “having a sense of a house that has its own specific history and traditions is fine, so long as that history and those traditions don't in any way seem to exclude anyone in the community.”
Harrington called the former preference system “unhealthy” in the way it separated different communities at Harvard. She believes House archetypes forced students to choose between identities.
Becerra upholds that a random system is beneficial because it exposes students to more diversity. “When students come to Harvard, one of the things we want is for students to meet people of all types to become citizens of the world and a huge part of the Harvard College experience is living with people who are different from you,” Becerra says.
Ultimately, the randomization system provides a feeling of flexibility for students, according to Harrington. “Houses then are freed to evolve and reinvent themselves and become the communities that represent the needs of the student body in that moment,” she says. “It’s been very freeing.”
And while the less narrow reputations of Houses due to randomization may confer new benefits on residents impossible under Housing Choice, Ford still defends the opportunities that the old housing system afforded him and other undergraduates. “I think it was a chance for people to have agency over a major decision in their life, and to have an opportunity to explore and grow and create their own identity,” he says.
Laibson noted that while randomization facilitates the “aspiration of getting to know a broad group of people,” the burden is ultimately on the student to do so.
Regardless of the way in which you are sorted into your House, Laibson implores students not to “make the mistake of only hanging out with the people you know well,” emphasizing the value of the “education you get in the dining hall.”

Capitalism has tainted everything that would be beautiful and precious in this world, but wait until you hear this... It’s even begun to infiltrate our very conception of time, yet another instance of how consumerism is chipping away at our collective grasp on reality until we are nothing but shadows of what we once stood for, doomed into lives of complete submission to the Man.
Walking through the Yard, I witnessed students and tourists holding red and ornament-adorned Starbucks holiday cups and sporting puffer coats, scarves, and beanie hats — attire entirely inappropriate for the moderate temperatures outside. I’m a good Ec 10 student, and I know not to confuse correlation with causation, but this was some pretty damning anecdotal evidence of Starbucks’s grip on our seasonal consciousness. Many times I had to restrain myself from yelling: IT IS 50 DEGREES OUT. WAKE UP. REMOVE YOURSELF FROM STARBUCKS’S HOLIDAY SIMULATION. YOU ARE IN A DYSTOPIA CONTROLLED BY A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR COFFEE COMPANY.
It’s high time we dull the jingle bells.
Seasons are no longer measured by the changing of the leaves, a dip in temperature, or the first snowfall. Those “seasonal” hallmarks will be but relics of generations past. Instead, time is dictated by Starbucks’s inevitable rollout of their annual holiday menu.
Big Brother, Starbucks, has mastered the ability to artificially expedite the passage of time for millions through the premature release of their holiday drink specials, no later nor any earlier than Nov. 4, 2021. An arbitrary date, innocuous, even? You thought. We can only infer that this date was calculated by an amalgamation of hundreds of algorithms to identify the perfect point to induce holiday-spirit without cannibalizing sales from Christian Girl Autumn, but also not late enough to risk missing out on the millions of potential profits preying on America’s seasonal depression with the convenient solution of an overpriced sugar cookie latte determined to give you some serious bowel issues about midway through.
I cannot in good conscience claim to be immune from Starbucks’s Machiavellian attempts to coerce me into believing that winter began on Nov. 4, just as I had been compelled earlier this year into believing that fall started on Aug. 24, demarcated by the release of the infamous Pumpkin Spice Latte. I am not perfect nor are my “higher-than-average levels of self-control” (re: my unofficial admissions file) any match for the carefully named, mouth-watering holiday flavors designed to drill into the depths of the human psyche’s pleasure centers: Peppermint Mocha, Iced Sugar Cookie, Toasted White Chocolate Mocha, Chestnut Praline, Caramel Brulee, and Irish Cream Cold Brew.
But, dear reader, a few sips into my velvety Peppermint Mocha on Nov. 4, I had a realization that made me spit my beverage onto the storied sidewalk of Harvard Square. My chest seized with the dissonance between my 60 degree surroundings and my tastebuds, which, thanks to Starbucks, screamed SANTA.
Horrified by what I had done, I deposited my near-full drink into an empty trash can. Passersby scrutinized me, perhaps abhorred by my ostentatious display of wastefulness, but at that moment they could not have understood how my actions fit into the larger constellation of rebellion against holiday consumerist culture. By transacting with Starbucks in the form of $6.50 and a seasonal latte on Nov. 4, I knew I had chosen the road more taken, failing literary giants, my parents, and society alike.
When I told some of my more myopic friends about the concept behind this piece, they assured me that the issue was “not that deep.” To which I replied verbatim with a “Brave New World” quote I had memorized for this inevitable disagreement: “I ate civilization. It poisoned me; I was defiled.” Civilization is a Peppermint Mocha.
Now, look. I don’t want escapism. I don’t need the mawkish happiness of artificially-early-onset seasons. If this article conjured up uneasy feelings for you — perhaps, flashbacks to scenes from “The Matrix,” the classes you’ve taken on subliminal messaging in advertising, or China’s single time zone, that is no coincidence.
Reader, I hate being a pawn, and you should too.

If that means giving up Starbucks’ holiday specials until Thanksgiving is over, so be it. To appropriate the language of climate change activists, it’s time to “turn back the clock.” Join me in abstaining from these seasonal offerings and order banal Starbucks vanilla lattes until Black Friday, when you too can partake in these sweet, sweet seasonal delights without the tainted conscience that comes with complicity in the Starbucks Holiday-Temporal-Industrial Complex’s late-stage capitalist reconstruction of time. Take the red pill and ditch the red holiday cup, it’s time to show Starbucks that you’ve read “1984.”

Leigh K. Sharpless ’23 and Jerry S. Yang ’23 believe your phone can help you understand how you’re feeling. Monolog, the journaling app they created during their pandemic gap years, is designed to do just that.
With Monolog, a user can describe their day through text or speech. After a few logs, the app will notice trends across their entries and identify how they’re feeling about certain events,  places, or people. One post on Monolog’s Instagram page reads: “This month, your discussion of Mom is correlated with higher anxiety than it was last month.”
Monolog tries to differentiate itself from other mental health apps by using natural language processing, a technology which allows devices to understand text and spoken words like humans do. According to the app’s sleek, purple website, Monolog is meant to be quicker than traditional pen-on-paper journaling and more accessible than therapy. Its tagline reads: “Understand your Emotions. Understand your Trends. Understand your Story.”
The idea for Monolog came out of observing trends in declining mental health during the pandemic. “From celebrities like Simone Biles dropping out of the Olympics due to mental health reasons, all the way to physicians and providers calling this a national state of emergency related to mental health, we were seeing more and more people caring about this,” Sharpless says.
Sharpless and Yang found that this trend also applied at Harvard, particularly last fall, when they observed that morale among students living on campus was low.
“When we came back, we noticed that there was this general sentiment of lethargy and confusion and lack of enthusiasm,” Sharpless says. “It was quite evident that Covid had taken its toll on people.”
Seeing a need for a tool to manage mental health struggles, Sharpless and Yang decided to take the year off to develop Monolog. Using Yang’s background in natural language processing, the co-founders were confident that they could approach tracking mental health differently.
Monolog’s technology is designed to quantify and draw conclusions from the way users talk about particular subjects.
"We’ve trained a model to pick out topics specific to what we’ve seen in journaling a lot,” Yang says. “So you can see this trend in terms of how you talk about a specific person and what tone you’re using over time.”
The model also identifies how positively or negatively the user discusses the topic. Over time, users should be able to identify trends in their behavior that might not otherwise have been clear.
“It felt like a pretty natural way that we could add value on top of conventional journaling,” Yang says.
Over the next few months, Yang will be continuing with Monolog and Sharpless will be phasing out of the startup. Right now the app is operating in a closed beta; some of the functionality Yang and Sharpless describe is still in development.
"I think we’re not where we could be in terms of products that actually are effective," Yang admits, but he’s optimistic for the future, planning to add features in conjunction with user feedback.
In the long run, the team hopes Monolog will become an “all-encompassing wellness platform,” Sharpless says. “The place you go for personalized journaling, for personalized content recommendations, or maybe articles about specific topics that you’ve talked about in your journaling.”
Sharpless describes the app as an essential compromise between intensive and lax strategies to address mental health challenges. She adds, “We’re trying to make that middle ground, more convenient, more handheld approach to helping people understand themselves.”

Students walking in and out of the Widener Library’s Loker Reading Room this past Thursday afternoon may have overheard a mouth-watering description of Empadão de Galinha (a Portuguese analog to chicken pot pie), or the etymological breakdown of the Latin word for bald eagle, or a lively interpretation of the Biblical story of the Miraculous Catch of the Fish. These anecdotes were mere details that janitor Mauricio S. Cunha touched on while illustrating his fascinating life story and artistic calling. Tucking all 6 feet and 4 inches of himself into a chair in the corner of Widener Library’s second floor, Cunha recounted his upbringing, passion for the arts, and love of his work in a rich, lyrical voice.
Cunha has served as a janitor for Widener, Lamont, and Pusey libraries for the past 16 years. He moved to America in 2002 and first saw Widener as a tourist when visiting Harvard with his family. When he walked in, he thought to himself, “This is the place I would like to work.” He identifies art and history in every aspect of his job, from the contents of recycling bins to the architectural elements of each library. Leaning forward and clasping his hands, Cunha begins, “My life is an artist’s life” — and, indeed, he is also an avid painter and visual artist.
“Here, Widener, is the great icon,” he lifts his hands up, motioning around to the intricate frescoes and the ornate marble. “Right? It’s a neoclassical building, beautiful.”
“I see the architecture; I see everything in my life as art: that’s the artist’s vision,” he says. Born in 1958 in the small town of Itanhandu, Brazil, Cunha was the second of four children. He says he inherited the artist’s gift from his mother, who was a pianist and a painter. “Since I was a kid, I was always curious to draw. I used to watch my mom painting, mostly she painted landscapes. She’d paint a road with mud, and you could feel immediately the mud on the road,” he smiles. “I learned a lot of skills about art from her — to see art itself in other things, not just a canvas or painting or drawing.”
Growing up, Cunha remembers being surrounded by music. Some of his earliest memories include his parents dancing together to American classics singers like Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, and Frank Sinatra. “All the American singers were in my home,” Cunha says. “I used to say that America was born inside me.”
In his own work, Cunha makes it his mission to paint all different elements of the visual arts, and notes that he is especially inspired by Rembrandt. “Rembrandt was the most complete artist ever. Why? Because he did the architectural stuff. Animals, anatomy, people, landscape, everything.”
But Cunha classifies himself as more of a surrealist, drawing on his experience of the psychedelic rush of the 1970s in Brazil, and his passion for Pink Floyd. “I am a surreal guy. I do surreal stuff, that’s my original stuff,” he says while pulling out his phone to show us an original painting. Butterfly wings in saturated hues expand off the back of a fairy-like creature, which flies across a cactus-dotted desert below a sky full of colorful planets. He believes that what makes a true artist is their sensibility: the ability to see all the beauty around you and manifest that inner appreciation outward. He says, “It’s not just about learning — it’s from the inside out, from the heart.”

Lightbulbs caged in yellow metal frames line the edges of the white tent in the Kirkland courtyard. Up above, a bright and expectant moon gazes down on the gatherers. It is Halloween night, and the air carries the mild chill of  impending November. Students congregate around the small cluster of tables underneath the tent. One by one, they walk up to the light blue typewriter sitting on one of the tables and mark themselves present. Tonight was the end of an era, but by chance, a new beginning as well.
“It’s 11:59!” A cry rises  from the crowd, “Goodbye, Pole Week.” It is  a bittersweet ending, but such is change.
Eager volunteers pass around a chalice — a large plastic Animal Crackers jar shaped like a bear — for the night’s ceremonyr. They take turns plucking pieces of paper from the jar and tossing them aside. Finally, the last volunteer reverently lifts the final slip and slowly, delicately unfolds it. It is  the moment they had all been waiting for. The air is thick with suspense, excitement, and the smell of Pinocchio’s pizza.
“And the new Week is…” They draw out the words in  ceremonious drama, “CHANCE!” he crowd erupts into chants: “Chance! Chance! What are the chances?”, seamlessly settling into the new theme of their lives for the next week.
The latest addition to the lineup of cultish Kirkland activities, this is the Kirkland Choosening — the weekly Sunday night ceremony that inaugurates a new theme for the week as soon as the clock strikes midnight. In the subsequent days, enthusiasts are tasked with finding clever puns or references to the theme. Some share pictures in group chats and on social media, like a post-swim selfie during Pool Week; others show off their spirit in the dining hall, parading around poles for Pole Week.
Possible themes are  placed into the animal cracker jar by the leadership, the self-proclaimed “Council of Elders,” who brainstorm easily punnable words to draw from each week. Three members of the Council, Adam V. Aleksic ’23, John L. Sanchez ’24, and Leo S. Fried ’23, explain the Choosening  in succinct and crafted monologues: “Every week, it’s a week. Two weeks ago, it was Pool Week. Last week, it was Change Week. This week, it is Pole Week.”
Recounting the Change Week festivities, the Elders speak one by one:
“We changed our mind.”
“We changed our clothes.”
“And changed our answers on midterms.”
“We changed our friends.”
“We played with change.”
“We paid for things with spare change.”
“We changed a lot of change… by bending it.”
“And then we exchanged it.”
Indeed, the “Week Week” Instagram  chronicles students’ weekly pun-based adventures, from playing pool with pool noodles to a polarizing poll pitting Pole against Poll. The page has been ramping up its creativity and increasing its following, now up to an impressive 129 followers, as of publishing. Attendance at the Choosening ceremony has also  increased over the course of a few short weeks, going from around 20 people at the start to 72 on Halloween. These new disciples of the Week Week are now enjoying pizza and other refreshments at the Choosening, which recently began receiving funding from Kirkland House.
Like all classic grassroots cults, the tradition started with four people in a basement in need of some fun. Sanchez’s gap year endeavor of  learning about a new topic each week based on a word he randomly chose from a jar inspired the Choosening — the founders decided to apply this ritual to having fun with multi-meaning words. A month later, the Week Week fervor has permeated all corners of the House and even stretched outside of Kirkland, with residents from other Houses drawn to the alluring new pastime. The Council of Elders is always recruiting, encouraging people from both inside and outside of Kirkland to join the Choosening and participate in the weeklong shenanigans. After all, the more members, the stronger the cult.
Kirkland is currently in the midst of a flourishing Chance-themed week. They’re taking chances. They’re listening to Chance the Rapper. They’re rolling dice, flipping coins, and calculating the chances. And they’re asking you, dear reader, to follow the wise words of ABBA and “Take A Chance On Me.”
The Boston Regional Intelligence Center is housed within the Boston Police Department’s headquarters, a boxy, four-story structure made of glass and concrete wedged between two city parks. It was established in 2005, the height of the War on Terror, to keep Boston safe from foreign enemies. The BRIC is a “fusion center,” a site of information sharing between local and federal law enforcement, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In essence, the BRIC is a magnifying glass — through it, what’s observed by a city cop can also be observed by numerous federal officers.
The BRIC is also something of a black box. Its unit has established a system of thousands of cameras throughout the Boston area, which officers can use alongside video analytics software to track specific cars and people. These cameras operate 24/7, but their exact purpose remains unspecified; they are simply there to identify threats. The BRIC also operates several databases containing the private information of thousands of Boston residents, some of whom were not accused of criminal offenses; they were simply identified as threats.
In November 2015, a 17-year-old student at East Boston High School, who has been publicly referred to as “Orlando,” was found to be a threat. The year before, Orlando had immigrated to the United States from El Salvador, alone and without documentation, in search of his father. According to a later report, he and another student had “attempted to start a fight” in the school cafeteria, “but were unsuccessful.” He was subsequently identified via security camera footage by a school police officer, who had also heard rumors that he might be in a gang. The officer wrote up a school incident report about the episode, noting in the last line that, “this incident will also be sent to the BRIC.”
Orlando didn’t realize that the BRIC had his information until nine months later, shortly after he turned 18, when he was arrested by ICE officials. They found him at his father’s home and took him to an immigration detention center, a facility that looks like a prison but whose inhabitants, because they are not citizens, have even fewer rights. Immigrants can be kept in detention indefinitely and without bond; Orlando waited there for over a year. When he finally got to immigration court, lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security made their case: Orlando should be deported because he was a member of MS-13, a federally-identified gang.
Their evidence against Orlando came from a file in a BRIC database that collects information about suspected gang members. Orlando’s file included the school incident report and pictures of him wearing a Chicago Bulls hat, which officials had obtained from his Facebook (the Bulls, aside from being a popular sports team, share a symbol — bull horns — with MS-13). It did not include any alleged criminal offenses.
Though Orlando and his lawyer maintain that he was never a gang member, he eventually agreed to his own deportation — as reported by WBUR, after being detained for so long, he was too depressed to continue fighting the case against him.
Away from the spotlight, there were other Orlandos. Between 2016 and 2018, immigration attorneys around Boston noticed a surge in cases where DHS relied on the BRIC gang database to deport their clients. Many had been identified as gang members when they were younger than 18, often through incidents that occurred at school.
Information in the gang database acquired from Boston public schools includes — as in Orlando’s situation — school incident reports, which document misbehavior in school or well-defined criminal activity. It also contains intelligence reports filed by Boston School Police, which document any “activity that is documented for intelligence gathering purposes or for the sole purpose of reporting observations.” This activity can include where a student is seen, who students are seen with, or what students are wearing, on or off campus.
Reports about adolescents in the BRIC gang database also include those filed by BPD officers, who usually write reports about people they stop, and sometimes about those whom they merely observe. Some Boston residents, typically young men of color, report that they have been consistently stopped by BPD officers from their early teens on.
The federal rule dictating how fusion centers like the BRIC function stipulates that they can collect information about someone “only if there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal conduct” and the information is “relevant” to that criminal activity. Lawyers and advocates have argued that many of the files entered into the BRIC do not meet this standard.
In 2019, WBUR reported that BPD officers and ICE officials had been communicating extensively via email about specific undocumented immigrants in Boston, often with the intention of finding civil immigration violations for which the resident could then be deported.
Recent public records requests filed by immigrant and civil rights organizations reveal that school police officers in Boston engaged in a similar pattern of behavior. Before recent changes, school reports were supposed to be sent up a bureaucratic chain of command before reaching law enforcement. But, as suggested by Orlando’s case, communications between school police officers and officials from the BRIC were often much more direct. Lawyers say hundreds of documents yielded from their organizations’ public records requests show that officers directly emailed officials from the BRIC and from ICE on specific students of interest. A Boston Public Schools spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but school officials have in the past repeatedly stated they do not share information with federal authorities.
Over the past two years, the landscape of policing in Massachusetts has changed. Boston School Police, who are now only referred to as employees in the Office of Safety Services, lost their police powers under Massachusetts’s 2020 Police Reform Act. They are no longer uniformed, no longer have squad cars, and can no longer arrest students or file intelligence reports. The reports they can file are limited to alleged criminal offenses, medical emergencies, and missing students; they cannot include information like citizenship or ethnicity. Meanwhile, Boston’s Trust Act, updated in December 2019, limits the information law enforcement can share with ICE. An amendment to BPD’s rules governing its gang database now raises the bar for the quality of information needed to establish gang membership.
Advocates have welcomed these changes. Still, some are waiting for Boston to make concrete plans for better-funded social services and avenues toward restorative justice. They have yet to see whether the reforms passed will be enough to disrupt the decades-old, entrenched systems of policing and surveillance they are meant to address — a system that takes for granted that certain children should be seen as threats.
In 1974, the Boston School Committee, the governing body of Boston Public Schools, began preparing for an invasion. Months earlier, federal District Judge W. Arthur Garrity had blown up the Boston school system. He ordered the schools to desegregate; as he wrote at the time, the city “must eliminate all vestiges of the dual system ‘root and branch.’”
For decades, Boston had had a significant Black population. In the first half of the 20th century, millions of Black refugees from the South, fleeing racial violence, flocked to the North. There was a train line connecting Florida, the Carolinas, and Virginia to Northeastern cities. Over five decades, 50,000 stayed on the line until Boston. The city was likely far from what they’d imagined. They were forced into segregated communities and denied the same access to public resources and schools as white residents. Brown v. Board came and went in Boston; Black residents who protested de-facto school segregation and poor educational conditions were violently cracked down on by the Boston Police Department.
In September of 1968, BPD began a two-week occupation of the Gibson School, an elementary school in the predominantly Black neighborhood of Roxbury, after a group of parents from the school complained to the School Committee that the Boston School District was providing their children with an inferior education. In response, the School Committee sent in the police.
That year, BPD officers were deployed all around Roxbury to suppress Black students and parents protesting the quality of their schools. On Sept. 26, after hundreds of Black students held a rally to demand equality, BPD broke up the crowd by beating protestors with nightsticks. These officers removed their badges so that they couldn’t be identified. A Black Boston high schooler at the time told the Boston Globe, “If you want a bloodbath in Boston, keep the white police in Roxbury.”
For years, the School Committee had operated under the premise that Black children, foreign to Boston, should be contained. In 1974, following Garrity’s ruling, the prospect of their entrance into white schools called for a special strategy.
“We need adequate police protection,” remarked a school committee member at a meeting on January 1, 1975 while discussing demands the committee would make of the governor. “Give that to him in a short paragraph and say the burden is too heavy on Boston and the trend will be that Boston will be predominantly black. ‘Now, what are you going to do to help us?’”
A 1975 letter from a white South Carolinian to Boston’s then-mayor Kevin H. White expresses the fears of many white parents at the time: “You will find that as the Negro integrates, so will the rate of crime. You will find your schools almost completely segregated within itself … I don’t envy you and the people of your city in the years ahead.”
Citing potential violence from Black students, White and the school committee deployed half of BPD’s entire police force inside schools in the first year of desegregation; in the second year of desegregation, the figure rose to 70 percent.
In reality, the majority of violence in the first years of school desegregation came from white parents and white police. In October, the National Guard was called in to enforce the desegregation order over white protestors. Inside schools, police disproportionately targeted Black students; in-school suspensions and arrests of Black students, which spiked in the first years of integration, became so severe that a lawsuit was filed against the School Committee to end rampant discrimination against Black students.
This mass deployment of officers was unsustainable; in the late 1970s, a “safety and security” force was deployed inside Boston Public Schools to ease the strain on BPD. By 1982, this force had become Boston School Police. Until summer of 2021, school police officers were Special Police Officers designated under Rule 400a of the BPD, meaning that they were deputized but lacked the training of a full police officer — they needed only 160 hours of training, in comparison to the approximately 800 hours required by a full-time police academy.
Still, Boston School Police possessed many of the same powers as BPD. They could arrest students and file reports. They were uniformed and had squad cars. In at least the first few years of their deployment, they had radios directly connecting them to BPD. Effectively, Boston School Police existed to extend the BPD’s reach inside schools, combating threats from within.
A 1979 phone call to the Boston Police begins:
“Caller: On (name) street there is a gang of teenagers playing tag football under these new lights. Can you get them out of here please?
Police operator: Yes, ma’am.
Caller: Thank you.
Police operator: You’re welcome.”
Another starts as follows:
“Caller: There’s five or six kids out here. I wouldn’t say kids. They’re grown-ups. They’re playing out there and they’re making a lot of yelling so we can’t listen to the T.V.”
And a third:
“Caller: Hello, I’m calling from (address). Get these kids off the steps. It’s going wild here.
Police operator: What are they doing?
Caller: These kids are getting wild again, getting lousier.”
In response to each of these calls, BPD dispatched its newly-formed Anti-Gang Patrol. The Anti-Gang Patrol was created in July 1979 to combat a surge in gang violence; a 1982 Boston University Law School report on police treatment of juveniles notes that in 1979, 30 percent of all 911 calls in Boston “involved gang disturbances or activities.”
Here is how Boston law enforcement defines a gang currently:
“A gang is an ongoing organization, association, or group of three (3) or more persons, whether formal or informal, which meets both of the following criteria:
1. Has a common name or common identifying signs or colors or symbols or frequent a specific area or location and may claim it as their territory and
2. Has associates who, individually or collectively, engage in or have engaged in criminal activity which may include incidents of targeted violence perpetrated against rival gang associates.”
This definition has always been broad. From its inception in the late ’70s, fears about gang violence in Boston largely revolved around “disruptive youth gangs,” or groups of kids who didn’t belong to large, formalized gangs. In documents from the ’70s on, “youth gangs” and “gangs” are used interchangeably. As Matt Kautz, a PhD candidate at Columbia University who studies the origins of school police in Boston, put it, “there’s this substitution between what might constitute an organized gang, and what is just a group of young people together.”
That same BU report, describing the actions taken by the Anti-Gang Patrol, notes that, during its first ten days of operation, “the gang unit responded to 1,015 complaints, dispersed 1,258 groups of youths, arrested 166 disorderly youths, and took 131 youths into protective custody for detoxification.” The report does not mention any arrests of adults. The Anti-Gang Patrol was disbanded a few months later, but the BPD’s strategy of targeting “youth gangs” remained.
Most of these youths were Black. Christopher Winship, a sociology professor at Harvard who worked with Boston Police in the ’80s and ’90s to develop community policing strategies, notes that “virtually all gangs in Boston are Black.”
Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, phrases it differently: “The Boston Police Department could classify many different organizations as gangs,” but only seems to do so “when they are made up of predominantly Black and Latino people.” BPD did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding alleged racial profiling of youths in their policing practices.
In 1989, a lawsuit was brought against BPD for a “policy to ‘search on sight’ certain young, black persons in Roxbury.” Documentation of the lawsuit describes that BPD also had “a secret list of ‘known gang members’” of 750 people. People on the list were “searched on sight,” which the lawsuit describes as “a proclamation of martial law in Roxbury for a narrow class of people, young blacks, suspected of membership in a gang or perceived by the police to be in the company of someone thought to be a member.”
A judge in the lawsuit found BPD’s actions to be unconstitutional. But the secret list of “known gang members,” and BPD’s harassment of Black communities in Boston, remained.
By the ’90s, following press attention around BPD’s stop-and-frisk tactics, Boston’s Black community reached a breaking point with BPD. Winship wrote in a 1999 report that, “the Boston Police Department was in desperate need of an overhaul to deal with all the negative publicity.”
As part of its attempt to remedy its relationship with local communities, BPD pledged that it would develop a more targeted strategy. In 1996, BPD developed Operation Ceasefire, “an innovative collaboration that focuses targeted interventions on individuals most likely to become offenders and victims in firearm violence.”
Operation Ceasefire aimed to identify those most likely to commit crimes and divert them before they caused harm. In other words, instead of regarding entire neighborhoods with suspicion, the police would select specific residents for the brunt of their enforcement.
Much of the work of Operation Ceasefire was carried out by the Youth Violence Strike Force, established in 1993 as a unit of police officers focused on “the collaborative use of order maintenance tactics to quickly ‘cool’ any area of the city in which gang firearm violence flares.” Essentially, their purpose was to identify kids who might be gang members.
Thomas Nolan, a former Boston police gang detective and now a professor of sociology at Emmanuel College, joined the Youth Violence Strike Force at its inception. The strike force, like BPD in Roxbury, kept an internal list of names of suspected gang members, which they used to monitor those identified as “problems.” According to Nolan, however, there were no criteria for what constituted a gang member: “It could be, ‘I believe this kid is in a gang because I saw him with some other guy.’”
This information was kept within BPD until the aftermath of 9/11, when the Boston Regional Intelligence Center was founded. From there, Nolan explains, the list formerly kept by BPD developed into a gang database and became sprawling.
This move was supposed to help law enforcement be more efficient. Winship believes the database expedites these processes by telling officers, “‘here’s where you should focus your attention.’”
But there are now thousands of names in a gang database accessible by federal law enforcement, and some of the people in it dispute the allegation that they were ever in or associated with a gang at all.
On a colorless day in February 2018, a Black Boston resident named Keith took an Uber to a barber shop appointment. Exiting the car, he noticed two BPD officers in a black car watching him; as he walked up the street, he started filming from his phone. The video, which he later uploaded to YouTube, begins on a car-lined street framed by steel-gray sky. As the police car comes into view, one of the officers rolls down the window. He looks at Keith through narrowed eyes.
“You’re not Kevin by any chance, are you?” He asks.
“Nah,” says Keith.
“You sure?”
“Of course.”
“What is your name?”
“Why do you want to know my name?”
“You look like someone we’re looking to speak to.”
Keith pans to his face, looking exasperated: “Again, here we go.” The officer continues:
“Where do you live?” “You don’t need to know that.” The officer then asks him a series of similar questions — about his address, occupation, and identity. “It’s noon time on a Thursday, what are you doing?” “What are you doing?” “I’m working.”
Eventually, the video ends as Keith walks away and the officer returns to the car.
Keith didn’t seem surprised that the police would stop him; this seems less reflective of a guilty conscience than statistical reality. In 2019, department data shows that despite comprising a quarter of the city’s population, Black Bostonians made up 69 percent of police stops.
In response to public outcry over Keith’s video, in 2018 BPD spokesperson Michael McCarthy told the Associated Press that the stop happened while officers monitoring the area saw a man they believed to have a weapon. McCarthy assigned both parties blame, adding, “we can take away that the officer needs to behave better and those that are interacting with the police need to behave better” — even as it remains unclear why the police stopped Keith or what, exactly, was wrong with his “behavior.”
There are other aspects of this incident that, while telling, are likely routine. There is much made about Keith’s name; the officer also asks him for his address. What exactly the officer intended to do with this is unknown, though recording personal information is a typical part of police stops — they are used for Field Interrogation/Observation/Encounter reports, which are records of observations BPD makes of the people they interact with.
FIOEs are supposed to be filed every time a stop occurs, regardless of whether the person stopped is accused of criminal activity. In fact, they’re often not even suspected of criminal activity. According to a 2014 ACLU report on racial disparities in BPD stops, “In three-quarters of all [FIOE] Reports from 2007-2010, the officer’s stated reason for initiating the encounter was simply ‘investigate person.’ But ‘investigate person’ cannot provide a constitutionally permissible reason for stopping or frisking someone.”
FIOEs can even be filed in cases where there is no contact between an officer and the person being surveilled at all. As Crockford, of the ACLU, noted in a 2018 Medium post, officers can make FIOEs based on observations from police cars or across the street that record what someone is doing, “who they’re with, or what they’re wearing.” (In an emailed statement last week, Sgt. Detective John Boyle, a BPD spokesperson, wrote that information entered into the BRIC gang database is determined to indicate “reasonable suspicion” of criminal activity, the standard in the federal rule governing fusion centers.)
Something else is striking about Keith’s video: the officers knew the name and general appearance of who they were looking for (though not well enough to avoid confusing him with someone else). “Law enforcement are very aware of their communities that they surveil. They know people by name, they know them by face,” says Valeria Do Vale, lead coordinator of the Student Immigrant Movement, an organization that educates and fights for the rights of immigrant students. Who gets targeted for surveillance isn’t random: they have already been identified by police as warranting observation.
How exactly an officer knows enough to look for a specific person without ever having met them remains unclear. Still, there are known ways in which personal information obtained through an FIOE might become accessible to other officers — one of these ways is via the BRIC gang database.
FIOEs and other field reports have always been the bedrock of the gang database. FIOEs that indicate gang membership or association are entered and assigned points. The points system is outlined in Rule 335 of the Boston Police Department Rules and Regulations. Each “Contact with Known Gang Associate” is 2 points. Having a “Known Group Tattoo or Marking” is 8 points. “Information Developed During Investigation and/or Surveillance” is 5 points. The list goes on.
When an FIOE report about someone is sent to the BRIC to be added to the gang database, a file is created about them. From there, the individual can accrue points as more FIOEs or other forms of evidence are filed: At 6 points, they’re a gang associate, and at 10 points, they’re a gang member. If you live in a predominantly Black or Hispanic neighborhood, earning an entry in the database is not difficult. Public records requests from the ACLU have revealed that as of 2019, of the thousands of people entered into the gang database, 90.2 percent are Black and/or Hispanic, and just 2.3 percent are non-Hispanic whites.
To live in proximity to Black and brown residents, then, is to be in contact with people already identified as gang members and associates. As Mary Holper, the Director of the Immigration Clinic at Boston College Law School, notes, “If you go to school in East Boston or Chelsea, which have a high Latinx population, and you don’t know who gang members are, who are suspected of being gang members, you are highly likely to be seen with them. Per being seen by somebody, it doesn’t take long to get to 10. All it takes is five times. So there you go. You’re a gang member.”
Doyle, the BPD spokesperson, wrote that the BRIC gang database is “a critical tool in the City’s strategy not only for responding to violent criminal activity, but also for supporting at-risk young people, preventing community violence and victimization, and offering participants safe and healthy pathways to a better life.” He wrote that data in the gang database helps target youth outreach, inform prosecutorial decisions, and respond to crime through the “efficient deployment of police resources.”
Through the deployment of police resources, Holper says that her clients are frequently “stopped and frisked, questioned about whether they’re a gang member.” In the 2014 ACLU report, Ivan Richiez, an Afro-Dominican Bostonian, recalls getting stopped by BPD for the first time in 2007, when he was 14 years old. BPD approached Ivan and some friends as they sat on a bench near where they lived, frisked them, and asked them what they were doing, where they lived, and if they were in a gang.
Not all of the evidence in these files comes from FIOE reports alone. A given file could have a variety of information about a given suspect. This can include possession of gang publications, or a self-admission of gang membership. It can also include evidence collected from social media. As Orlando’s case indicates, files frequently include photos of their subjects, which are then viewed by officers who access them.
Someone in the gang database usually has no way of knowing that they’ve been entered into it; police are not required to inform them. While individuals now technically have the ability to request whether they’ve been entered into the gang database, several lawyers have said instructions for how to do so remain unclear; the BRIC privacy and civil liberties policy does not outline a specific mechanism to make such requests.
But if someone is in the gang database, the police know a lot about them, although it’s not clear who has access to it. Elizabeth Badger, a senior attorney at the Political Asylum/Immigration Representation project, has expressed concerns that this information is being disseminated throughout the police department. Fatema Ahmad, executive director of the Muslim Justice League, has noticed that the Black and Hispanic young men that she works with are often stopped by BPD officers who, despite never having met them before, already know who they are — she suspects that this could be because they’ve been put into the gang database.
For these young men, being persistently stopped by the police “makes them feel like they must be doing something wrong,” says Emily Leung, supervising immigration attorney at the Justice Center of Southeast Massachusetts. “It makes them become disengaged with school, and they become disengaged with their community.”
In a 2020 Boston City Council Meeting, the BRIC’s director, David N. Carabin, told counselors that the establishment of the BRIC had corresponded with a decrease in crime in Boston (crime rates did fall in Boston, but they also fell almost everywhere else in the country over the same period).
Later, in a 2021 city council meeting, Counselor Julia Mejia asked Carabin if he could quantify the BRIC’s impact on preventing or solving crimes. “A lot of our work goes toward proactive police measures […] We have a lot of success stories, but a lot of proactive police measures are difficult to evaluate,” Carabin responded.
In an article about the meeting published in the Bay State Banner, Crockford said that “I’ve never seen a shred of evidence that the BRIC is making Boston safer. Government agencies are always required to show their work. In this case, people just kind of shrug and say, ‘The police say they need it, so we’re going to provide it.’”
In 2016, 18-year-olds around Boston began disappearing.
Leung got a call early that year from an immigration attorney friend. The friend couldn’t find her client. He had completely vanished. Eventually, she figured out what had happened: Unknown to his friends or family, he had been taken to immigration detention by ICE.
For a decade-and-a-half, Boston had been a receiving ground for refugees from Central America. Conflict and civil war led thousands of undocumented immigrants to travel from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to Boston in the 1990s. From 2014-2015 there was another surge of migrants, mostly trying to escape gang violence. 30 percent of migrants from Central America to the United States are children; half of them are unaccompanied by an adult.
Two years later, immigration attorneys from around Boston noticed that more of their younger clients were being detained. Badger, from the PAIR project, suspects the uptick was in response to two murders in East Boston by MS-13. These clients were of a specific type: they were all Central American migrants, had all recently reached adulthood, were enrolled in public schools in East Boston or Chelsea, and were listed in the BRIC’s gang database.
Badger, Nolan, and others have said that the gang database seems to contain a lot of information that comes directly from Boston School Police. The streets, then, are one site of contact between suspected threats and law enforcement; schools are another.
Boston School Police have filed two kinds of reports that have made it into the BRIC: school incident reports and intelligence reports. While school incident reports document notable incidents at schools, intelligence reports have a much more nebulous purpose. Like FIOEs, they don’t necessarily document alleged criminal actions, but rather the more mundane: what a student was wearing, who the student was with, things that a student may have said.
Leung says some intelligence reports seem unwarranted. “They’re like, ‘So and so student was seen with so and so student in the cafeteria.’ Okay, well, they’re both students in school.”
Not all school police intelligence reports have even been filed inside of schools. In 2017, Boston School Police officers filed an intelligence report after receiving a tip that several students had congregated at an off-campus dog park. It’s unclear how they received this tip, or from whom — the report mentions an unnamed “resident.” School police officers then traveled to the dog park, where, according to the report, they observed children who they suspected were associated with MS-13. This report was forwarded to an officer who in 2020 was listed as a “Gang Intelligence Lieutenant” for the Boston Public Schools, and it later wound up in the BRIC’s gang database.
It’s not clear why either of these kinds of reports were sent to the gang database. Nolan, the sociologist and former officer in the Youth Violence Strike Force, questions why any school police reports would be relevant to the gang database. “They have no training in how to identify gang members,” he says. “So there’s no kind of expertise that resides within the Boston School Police Department as it pertains to gang membership.”
Regardless, attorneys who have seen the information entered in the gang database say that schools had a direct role in implicating their clients. Badger says that of her clients in the gang database, all were initially entered when they were younger than 18 — many from reports made by school police.
Badger says that there were officers from East Boston High School “who wanted to label young [Central Americans] as gang-affiliated.” Of her clients, school police had noted fights, leaving school early, or even “someone else looking at someone the wrong way.”
Badger and other attorneys interviewed believe that Boston School Police turned perhaps questionable, though not criminal, behavior of teenagers into signs of gang membership. Sarah R. Sherman-Stokes, who represented Orlando, says that even clothing choice was documented by school police. “A lot of teenagers dress the same, because that’s part of being a teenager,” she says. “You want to fit in. Boston Latinx youth have style, and they posture, and they wear Nike Cortez sneakers and it does not mean that they’re members of gangs.”
School police reports appear in the BRIC gang database alongside FIOEs filed by BPD. Leung, the immigration attorney, points out that FIOEs and school intelligence reports document similarly banal activities. The information they record, she wrote in an email, would be insufficient for criminal court — but is still “routinely utilized to support the re-arrest and detention of immigrants.”
Boston Public Schools did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the utility of school police reports in identifying gang membership or about alleged racially motivated policing by safety service employees.
Sherman-Stokes says that Orlando had been detained purely because of evidence against him in the gang database — evidence, she suggests, that was circumstantial at best. “He had never been arrested or charged or convicted of any crime,” she says. In order to make the case that he was a member of MS-13, “They pulled things off of his Facebook page, like where he was wearing a [Chicago] Bulls hat. And then in the hearing, the [DHS] attorney said, ‘You’ll see, your honor, that he’s wearing a Bulls hat. And everyone knows that Michael Jordan played for the Bulls and he was number 13.’ But he wasn’t. He was number 23. Like, what are you talking about?”
What might not meet the bar for criminal prosecution can still be used in immigration proceedings. Violating immigration law is not a criminal offense — therefore, in immigration court, the rules governing what can and cannot be entered into evidence, and the rights of the accused, are much thinner. Undocumented immigrants’ rights to an attorney, to cross-examine witnesses, or even to be physically present at their own trial are routinely not enforced.
Immigration attorneys say that law enforcement sometimes assumes their clients are gang members, even when there isn’t any evidence against them. Sherman-Stokes recalls a 2015 incident in which she went to the asylum office with a young client from El Salvador, who was wearing what she describes as “an innocuous blue windbreaker that his mother had bought for him.” They were met by a DHS officer, who started “interrogating” him about the jacket: “Why was it that he was wearing blue? He noticed that there was white piping along the jacket, didn’t this child know that blue and white are the colors of MS-13? It was really startling.”
​​The full extent of information sharing between Boston schools and the BRIC remains unknown. As of 2019, 1.7 percent of entries (80 people) in the BRIC’s gang database were of children under 18. Still, this low percentage may be deceiving: Anecdotally, Badger and Leung say legal reforms and leadership changes, along with Orlando’s highly publicized case, led to a decrease in school police reports being sent to the BRIC beginning in 2018. And many who had been previously entered during high school have likely just aged: 19.4 percent of the database is between 18 and 24. Moreover, public records requests from Lawyers for Civil Rights have revealed that at least 135 school incident reports were entered into the BRIC between 2014 and 2017 alone.
In a 2020 interview with WBUR about the incident reports uncovered by Lawyers for Civil Rights, Boston Superintendent Brenda Cassellius emphasized how the shared reports were from before 2018 and said that Boston Public Schools currently “do not share information with the federal authorities at all.”
Prior to 2020, school incident reports should have been sent to the Boston Public School Department of Safety Services, where a judgment would be made about whether it warranted sharing with BPD. From there, BPD could, at its discretion, send that information to the BRIC.
But records show that individual Boston School Police officers took matters into their own hands. As indicated by the note in Orlando’s file — “this incident will be sent to the BRIC” — at least one officer directly forwarded student information to officials at the BRIC.
That officer didn’t act alone. Badger, in conjunction with lawyers representing four groups — the Center for Law and Education Inc., Kids in Need of Defense, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, and Multicultural Education, Training, and Advocacy Inc. — filed public records requests in 2018 that recently revealed that Boston School Police officers often directly communicated with officials from the BRIC and from ICE. Via email, school police sent federal officials information about students. Federal officials would also ask school police to monitor specific students of interest.
Lena G. Papagiannis, a Boston teacher and member of Unafraid Educators, a committee of the Boston Teachers Union that advocates for immigrant students, read excerpts from some of these emails at a city council meeting.
An email chain, initially from a BRIC official to a school police officer, reads: “Do you have a [redacted] that attends [your school]?” The officer responds, “Okay bro I am checking now and I will let you know.” The official sends the officer a picture, and the officer sends back a profile of a student. The BRIC official forwarded this all to an officer at ICE with a note: “This your guy?”
Another, from an ICE official to a school police officer and a BRIC official, begins: “Do you guys know this [student]?” The Boston School Police officer responds, “Yes sir, he’s a student at [redacted]. We don’t have anything on him yet. Still watching him. This kid has the same address as [redacted].”
A final email, from a BRIC official to multiple ICE agents with the subject “School Police Incident” report, contains a school incident report. It reads: “Note the school police report lists both [students] as self-admitting gang membership. This is gang verification gold.”
There are hundreds of pages of emails from this request. There are also emails that suggest that school police officers were communicating with federal officials via cell phone; the extent of these conversations, which were not public record, are unknown.
This testimony received no news coverage, and the lawyers involved have not yet issued any press releases about it. To protect student privacy, they did not share these documents with me. Badger also says she believes school administrators did not know of these extensive communications between school police officers, BPD, and federal bodies like ICE.
The Boston Public Schools did not respond to multiple requests for comment about these emails. Doyle did not comment on these specific emails but wrote that under the updated Boston Trust Act, the BRIC is prohibited from sharing information about individuals to assist ICE with enforcing civil immigration law (but not for investigations into criminal activity). An ICE spokesperson declined to respond to specific criticisms but wrote that ICE officers in Boston “have previously and do currently fully observe and comply with all local law enforcement protocols.”
Nora B. Paul-Schultz of Unafraid Educators saw the documents and was disturbed by the “casualness of the correspondence” between school police and law enforcement, saying, “Who matters so little that their name can be shared with law enforcement without even a second thought about what the consequences of that might be?”
This treatment of children is indicative of an attitude unique to the United States. Many other nations have a minimum age of criminal responsibility, before which they cannot be prosecuted for a crime. For most of the developed world, this is set at 18. In the U.S. there is no federally mandated minimum age — some states have no minimum age at all. In Massachusetts, it’s 12, the oldest of any state.
“We believe that students have a right to privacy and have a right to adolescence,” Paul-Schultz adds. When their misbehaviors are documented in a report, “the student has already been condemned.”
By the logic of law enforcement, these reports are necessary for public safety. But this may also mean that for certain students, schools have lost their essential function; in a blog post on the ACLU’s website, Holper noted that, “One way to protect [my clients] from being profiled, mislabeled by school police as gang members, and deported would be to advise them to stop attending school.”
As Papagiannis asks: “Safety for who, and safety from who?”
As of the 2021-2022 school year, the Boston School Police no longer exists. In 2020, in the wake of protests for racial justice, Massachusetts passed a police reform act eliminating “special police officers,” which includes Boston School Police. They are now exclusively referred to as Safety Service employees. Though the staff remains the same (the former “gang intelligence lieutenant” is now listed as a “Day Shift Supervisor/Lead Specialist”), they will no longer have police powers.
As previously stated, Safety Service employees can no longer file intelligence reports, and are limited in what they can file incident reports about. Parents must be notified when a BPD report or school safety report is made, and only the Chief and Deputy Chief of Safety Services can choose to share reports with the liaison from the BPD school unit. The new regulations, however, do not prohibit the preparation of an Incident Report based on a Safety Services employee’s personal knowledge or observations, so long as the knowledge is “related to” the incident in question.
Theoretically, the gang database itself has also changed. In response to public outcry, Rule 335, which governs the gang database’s usage, has been amended. FIOEs can no longer be used as the sole basis for an allegation of gang membership. Individuals who have no recorded recent activity will be “purged” from the database. BPD and the BRIC have promised to connect juveniles in the gang database with social services so that they can eventually “purge all juveniles from the gang database and stop the cycle of violence in the city of Boston” (though they will not stop entering juveniles into the gang database in the first place). A person can now also request to be removed from the database, however, Doyle wrote that while several such requests have been submitted to the BPD, “there has only been one occasion where corrections were required as a result of a redress request.”
Some advocates have expressed cautious optimism about these developments, though not everybody is as hopeful. “I can see things going back to the bad old days,” says Tom Nolan. “It’s the same agencies, the same people. They dress them up differently, but it’s old wine in new bottles.”

With its soaring windows, art-adorned stairs, and cozy study nooks, the Cambridge Public Library  gives every appearance of a welcoming space. Yet over the past few months, the library’s management team and the city of Cambridge have been working to make it not only aesthetically inviting, but more financially accessible. As of Oct. 19, the library has begun piloting a program to abolish fees on most late return items, excluding those borrowed through an interlibrary loan.
CPL hasn’t charged its patrons late fees since March 2020, when Covid-19 shutdowns forced the library to shutter its doors and close its book collection sites. “It’s kind of a normal practice in any library that if there’s an unexpected closure for a snow day or construction or facility work, that it’s not a patron’s fault that they can’t return an item,” Joy Kim, CPL’s Deputy Director of Libraries, explains.
In October, the library took the additional step of waiving past charges from patron accounts. “That really offers people a fresh start,” Kim says.
The pandemic accelerated a transition that had been in the works since Feb. 24, 2020, when the City Council unanimously passed a policy order to explore the feasibility of completely eliminating fines. According to the policy order, late fees and damage and replacement costs constituted $77,870  in the fiscal year of 2019. The amount comprised a small fraction of the library’s total budget of $12.5 million, and extracting late fees from patrons came with its own costs: sticky conversations and strained relationships.
“When [patrons] go to check out, our system used to block them because they had too many fines, and then we would have a conversation: ‘To check out at the library, you need to have an account in good standing. Are you able to pay the charges?’” Kim recalls. “Some people maybe didn’t come back because they were just embarrassed or ashamed, or knew they couldn’t pay.”
Kim says that the City’s generous budget for the library is what made the switch possible. Library patron Elizabeth H. Sheild believes this is the way it should be. “Library expenses should be covered by taxpayers, not the fines of those who are trying to learn,” she says.
CPL’s pilot program comes as part of a larger movement among public libraries to increase financial accessibility. Large cities like Baltimore, San Diego, and Salt Lake City are already fine-free, and across the nation the Urban Libraries Council has identified (and mapped) at least 400 libraries that have made the switch.
Late fees “have the greatest impact overall on people from disadvantaged backgrounds, low income populations, and children especially,” explains Paul J. Negron, interim communications director at the Urban Libraries Council. “They are at odds with the libraries’ mission of promoting open and free access to information.”
While not all institutions are equally equipped to get rid of fines, Negron maintains that they typically make up a “negligible” percent of a library’s overall funding, and collecting them can be logistically cumbersome. “We’ve found that late fine collection can actually be really costly and can be hard to enforce,” he says. “It’s just not a sustainable source of library income.”
Furthermore, research suggests that fines do not serve as great incentives for library patrons to return their books in a timely manner. Instead, library debt forgiveness tends to lead to the return of overdue books and resources: The Atlantic reports that, “An amnesty program in Chicago brought in 20,000 overdue items; Los Angeles nearly 65,000; San Francisco just shy of 700,000.” To Negron and Kim, the value of returned items and goodwill with patrons far exceeds that of the money collected each year in fees.
“We saw that it really welcomes people into the library, and we also found that the books still came back,” Kim says.
The push for increased accessibility may be more important now than ever, as libraries have expanded their spate of services beyond providing books — they now offer computer assistance, children and teen programs, ESL classes, and more. “These kinds of things weren’t happening 15, 20, 30 years ago,” Negron says. “As we’ve expanded in the community and [continue to] play a greater role, we need to be connecting with those folks who need assistance.”
Libraries played a central role in CPL patron Gabriel J. Barrett-Jackson’s childhood, and he hopes that their resources can reach more people with the fine-free program. “I love libraries,” he says. “I grew up in Seattle and I attribute my public library there to a lot of my education. I think that library fees are regressive — they can be a barrier to folks — and getting rid of them is a good thing.”

Steven Phelps — evolutionary neurobiologist, professor of integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin, and 2021-22 Radcliffe fellow — discussed his research on intimate attachments between animals during a presentation Wednesday afternoon.
Phelps’ online presentation, “The Biology of Intimacy: A Synthesis,” included descriptions of his findings about intimacy and attachment between prairie voles, a species of rodent.
The talk was hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. The Institute annually selects a variety of professionals to participate in the Radcliffe Fellowship and take advantage of Harvard’s resources to explore an individual project.
Studying prairie voles can lead to a better neurological understanding of how relationship bonds are formed and can further illuminate human intimacy, according to Phelps.
“I am interested in the diversity of animal behavior and its neural and hormonal mechanisms,” Phelps said. “I’ve also become interested in what animal studies have to tell us about the human experience.”
According to Phelps, strong intimate bonds often form for the purpose of raising offspring.
“I’ve come to think of a bond as a kind of pact between two minds. It’s a bet that as the parents counter the challenges and opportunities the world has to offer, that they’ll do better if they stick together,” he said.
Phelps explained that neuropeptide receptors in the brain bind with oxytocin, commonly known as the “love hormone.”
“When you compare the distribution of these hormone receptors in the brain to other closely related species [of rodents] that don’t form bonds, we see that these receptors are concentrated in parts of the brain that are important for reward for things that make us feel good,” Phelps said, referring to earlier studies conducted in the field.
Phelps mentioned a study conducted by Helen E. Fisher, Xiaomeng Xu, Arthur Aron, and Lucy L. Brown in 2016 that showed intimate attachments activated the “reward area” in the brain when undergraduate students viewed photos of their romantic partners or opposite sex individuals.
“What we have now is a sense of a kind of circuit for reward,” Phelps said. “This seems to be part of why being together feels good.”
Phelps plans to expand his study of attachments by examining “all of the brain circuits that are involved in bonding.” He is looking forward to following up on a preliminary finding that shows the stress-suppressing region of the brain is extremely active during bond formation.
“[This] would give us some really new insights into how it is that bonds can buffer us against the travails of the world,” Phelps said.
Phelps said in an interview after the event that his research strives to help people recognize that there is more to the world than just the human race.
“I want people to recognize that there’s a world that’s larger than humanity in which animals have complex and interesting social lives,” Phelps said.
“I think if other animals had our intellectual capacity, they would experience love in the same way,” Phelps added.

UPDATED: November 11, 2021 at 3:35 p.m.
The Cambridge City Council debated the latest proposed changes to campaign finance in city politics on Monday night.
The proposed amendments include a municipal ordinance that would reduce or limit campaign donations, specifically from donors who are seeking to enter a contract or acquire real estate from the city, in a bid to prevent conflicts of interest in council members’ decisions.
Per the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance, the maximum yearly contribution from an individual to a candidate cannot exceed $1,000. The proposed amendment would limit donations from developers and those who favor development to a maximum of $200.
The council agreed to defer to the city solicitor and wait until a future meeting to reevaluate the reform.
Several residents argued that the measure is not necessary.
Paul F. Toner — a challenger who won a seat in this November’s election — said he did not believe this is an issue the council needs to address.
“I’m not aware of anybody who has made any decision about a political decision or a policy decision based on donations from any individual or organization,” he said.
Craig A. Kelley, a former city councilor, noted that developers are not the only group of people in the city that donate to campaigns to advance a political agenda.
“If we’re worried about people using money to influence campaign results and influence campaign people, which is the candidates themselves, why one picks solely on developers is a really good question.” he said. “I don’t think it’s about money.”
David E. Sullivan, another resident, also argued the proposed campaign finance reform has more to do with than just money. He argued the amendments are a political ploy to reduce affordable housing development, a point of contention in this year’s election.
“I think the proposed ordinance is not being proposed in good faith,” Sullivan said. “It’s being proposed by people who are trying to make it harder for pro-housing people to participate in Cambridge government.”
If passed, the proposed ordinance would “limit and monitor campaign donations” in municipal elections by those “seeking financial reward from the city.” Sullivan, along with councilors like Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, argued that the current definition is too vague to be useful.
“Would folks who signed onto these [citizens’ zoning] petitions now be implicated as part of this campaign finance reform, that they would not be able to contribute over $200 to any city council candidate or school committee candidate?” she asked in the Monday meeting.
Sullivan, a long-time lawyer, argued the proposed law is also unconstitutional. The ambiguity in the amendments’ language could be “impermissibly vague,” according to Sullivan.
Additionally, Sullivan argued the ordinance would contradict the First Amendment if passed. Under the Citizens United ruling in 2010, the Supreme Court declared campaign donations as a form of free speech protected under law, so limiting or preventing certain groups of people from donating to candidates because of their views could be ruled unconstitutional.
The council must also receive approval from the Massachusetts State Legislature, as the council itself is not authorized to pass laws relating to campaign finance reform. In order to achieve such local reform, the council must request the legislature to pass a special bill on its behalf that would apply to Cambridge.
This technicality has caused the council to experience delays in campaign finance reform in the past.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said during Monday’s meeting that he expects further delays from the state.
“Home Rule petitions are routinely ignored by the legislature, and so we don’t expect that they would actually pass it or even consider it,” Zondervan said. “If we make our ordinance dependent on the Home Rule petition, then nothing will happen.”
Zondervan also called for support from Cambridge residents to help pass the ordinance.
“It’s much harder to do any kind of reform when there isn’t a focus and effort by residents,” he said. “If there isn’t really strong and visible support from the voters and the residents to say, ‘No, we want to see the change,’ then it just doesn’t evolve and that’s what we’ve seen for years.”
CORRECTION: November 11, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated the type of petition to the state legislature that allows Cambridge to take action normally within the state's purview. It is a Home Rule petition, not a homeowner petition.

Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter was tapped to serve as chair of the Harvard Institute of Politics’s Senior Advisory Committee Wednesday, filling a role that was left vacant for nearly two years.
Nutter, who was elected twice as mayor of Philadelphia, will become chair of the 17-member committee after serving as a general member of the group for just eight months. His appointment comes after several high-profile members of the body have resigned over the last two years.
The IOP Senior Advisory Committee has helped oversee and direct the Institute since it was founded in 1966 as a memorial to former President John F. Kennedy ’40. The committee’s role in overseeing the Institute has increasingly become a source of controversy since the 2009 death of former U.S. Senator Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54-’56, who helped steer the organization for decades as the main Kennedy family representative on the committee.
Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 — JFK’s last living child, who took over as the family’s main representative on the committee after Ted Kennedy died — resigned from her post in February 2020 amid concerns over the governance, performance, and leadership of the IOP.
In a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow after her resignation, Caroline Kennedy wrote that changes to the committee’s role in overseeing the Institute proposed by Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf “did not reflect the mission or history of the IOP as a non-academic center founded as a memorial to my father, in which three generations of our family has invested time, effort and devotion.”
Nutter will replace former White House Chief of Staff Kenneth M. Duberstein, who resigned from the committee around the same time as Kennedy more than 20 months ago after serving as chair for the previous seven years.
“The IOP is one of the world’s premiere arenas for political debate and policy making, and I’m thrilled to provide guidance and leadership of the Advisory Committee as the IOP meets the evolving challenges of our 21st century democracy,” Nutter said in a press release Wednesday.
Elmendorf, who has played a more active role in overseeing operations at the IOP than some of his predecessors, said in a press release Wednesday that Harvard “will benefit greatly from Mayor Michael Nutter’s leadership on the Senior Advisory Committee.”
​​“His valuable experience in governance and elected office will help the IOP continue to expand and innovate in its mission to inspire students to lives of public service,” Elmendorf said.

Legal and bioethics experts convened to discuss the future of abortion amid efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade at a virtual panel held by the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School on Wednesday.
The event was moderated by Katherine Kraschel, the Executive Director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School, and featured panelists Mary Ziegler ’04, a professor at the Florida State University College of Law; Louise Perkins King, an associate professor and a member of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School; and I. Glenn Cohen, the faculty director of the Petrie-Flom Center.
The panelists began with a discussion of current legislaitive initiatives to roll back abortion access. The speakers first touched on Texas’s SB-8 bill, often referred to as a “heartbeat bill,” which prohibits abortions after doctors can find a fetal heartbeat on an ultrasound, generally around the sixth week of a pregnancy.
The law, which went into effect in September, prevents state officials from actually enforcing the policy, an attempt to make it difficult to challenge in court under the constitutional precedent of Roe v. Wade. Instead, the law empowers private citizens to sue abortion providers or anyone who assists in an abortion.
King said that such restrictions on abortion access have stymied providers hoping to provide care.
“Providers are frightened, and, again, deeply frustrated by their inability to provide what we consider to be essential care within obstetrics and gynecology,” King said. “Currently, everyone within the American College of OBGYN would consider it an essential care to provide abortions.”
Ziegler said that the Texas bill diverged from past compromises made by the anti-abortion movement and reflects a greater push towards individual rollbacks on abortion access, as opposed to a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortions.
“The six-week bans of the kind that SB-8 represents are actually seen as compromises now within the right to life for [the] anti-abortion movement, because they don’t go all the way to fertilization,” Ziegler said.
Ziegler said the current national dialogue on abortion is reflective of a shift in the focus of the anti-abortion movement towards a discussion of fetal rights, as opposed to women’s rights.
“[The argument] that abortion hurts women, as women, and that there is no tension between eliminating the right to choose abortion and equality for women, because abortion itself ultimately damages women’s psyches and bodies, that argument is falling away,” Ziegler said.
Panelists also discussed the pending Supreme Court case of Dobbs v. Jackson. The court is set to decide on the constitutionality of a Mississippi state law banning abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy, a ruling that advocates believe will have implications for whether Roe v. Wade is upheld.
Cohen cautioned that the SCOTUS outcome could enable further restrictions on abortion in states across the country, resulting in a “checkerboard state of play” for abortion legislation.
“We'll have places like Massachusetts that will basically permit abortions till quite late. And states like Texas and Louisiana that will prohibit just about any abortion they’re constitutionally allowed to do so,” Cohen said.

World Bank Group Chief Economist Carmen M. Reinhart discussed the effects of post-pandemic debt and inflation on emerging markets during the Institute of Politics’s Gordon Lecture at the JFK Jr. Forum on Wednesday.
Reinhart, who is currently on leave from her professorship at the Kennedy School, started the conversation by expressing her delight at returning to Harvard.
“It’s good to be home,” she said.
Reinhart explained the genesis of “classic” financial bubbles, which are “fueled by excesses.”
“You have a lot of credit, you have very solid economic performance, housing prices rise, asset prices rise, people extrapolate,” she said. “The belief is that you’re wealthier and if you’re wealthier, you’re willing to leverage. You’re willing to take on more debt.”
She also discussed the differences between the global financial crisis in 2008 — which, prior to Covid-19, was the most significant worldwide economic event since the Great Depression — and the post-pandemic financial reality.
“I think the risks of the 2008 to 2009 type classic model is different,” Reinhart said. “I think inflation was not in the picture back then.”
Reinhart also addressed the issue of government debt, and whether it is sustainable.​​ Effective methods of lowering the ratio of debt to GDP include fiscal tightening and devaluing currency, she said.
“The options are fiscal tightening, otherwise known as austerity — that can come through lower expenditures, higher taxes, or a combination of the two,” she said.
“Another one, which is less orthodox, is if the debt is in domestic currency — which is not the case for many emerging markets and is not the case right now, by the way, for Italy and Greece — you can inflate and erode the value of the debt,” Reinhart added.
An underlying theme of the discussion was the effects of economic phenomena on emerging markets and low-income countries. For instance, developing countries have a lower debt tolerance than advanced economies and inflation acts as a particularly regressive tax in these countries, she explained.
“Inflation is a tax. It’s a very regressive tax,” Reinhart said. “Working with low-income countries ... highlights just how regressive it is, because it is in the lower income strata where the largest share of the budget goes to food, energy, and basic necessities.”
Prior to her post at the World Bank, Reinhart served as the Senior Policy Advisor and Deputy Director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund, and as Chief Economist and Vice President at Bear Stearns, an investment bank.
The conversation — moderated by Jeffrey Frankel, a professor at HKS — concluded with questions from the audience.
In response to a question on debt restructuring, Reinhart acknowledged that, although there is a need for restructuring, there are many roadblocks to significant economic reform.
“Creditors want to be repaid in full, debtors want a haircut, and where I’m going with this is, to get to the point where a cohesive international move to do something about debt restructuring comes about, usually takes a very long time, because you’re starting from these polar opposites,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services has witnessed an influx of students seeking mental health resources since they returned to campus this fall, administrators said in an Oct. 28 interview.
CAMHS Cares, a 24/7 support line that CAMHS rolled out in July, is currently receiving roughly 300 calls per month, CAMHS Chief Barbara Lewis said. The hotline received 190 calls in its first month, close to 200 in August, and just more than 300 for the month of September, per Lewis.
CAMHS launched the hotline — which can be reached at (617) 495-2042 — to help meet students’ urgent mental health needs and reduce wait times for students seeking therapy.
For years, students have experienced long wait times to schedule a therapy appointment through CAMHS. Last March, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton estimated the wait time for CAMHS therapy appointments was roughly 10 to 12 days; at the time, students estimated it was “months long.”
“If we didn’t have the CAMHS Cares line, it would really be hard to meet the demand,” Lewis said.
Some students call the line for “one-off” needs, while others use it as an “entry-point” to regular therapy appointments, Lewis said. The calls, which last from 10 minutes to about an hour in length, range from “a quick interaction” to make someone “feel better” to initiating hospitalizations in extreme cases, she added.
University Health Services Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen also said in the October interview that he believes the coronavirus pandemic contributed to the high rate of students seeking support from CAMHS this semester.
“We’re really seeing the true impact of the pandemic as students have returned,” Nguyen said. “So we are responding to that, and we’re thrilled that students are accessing the services.”
In addition to therapy, Lewis said students are turning to CAMHS to manage their prescriptions after many students who lived away from Massachusetts during the pandemic had to register with other health care providers to receive prescriptions.
“A consequence of having been remote for 18 months and having students be all over the country — all over the world — [is] we’ve had a huge influx of students who’ve needed to see a prescriber, so they need someone to manage their medication,” she said. “In years past, students see us through the spring. They may be away for the summer, but they come back and get connected again.”
Lewis said CAMHS has seen an increase in students of color seeking its services, which she found encouraging.
“About 50 percent of our student appointments have been from students from non-white backgrounds,” she said. “I’ve always hoped to kind of break down some of the barriers for students who really would benefit from services that have been afraid or anxious about coming in.”
Hiring new staff this semester has also allowed CAMHS to open up more appointments and help meet student demand, according to Lewis. CAMHS currently employs 32 staff, including four in leadership positions, according to its website. Still, CAMHS currently has fewer staff than it did in 2018, when it employed 41 people, per CAMHS website archives.
During the interview, Nguyen urged students to take the National College Health Assessment, a survey designed by the American College Health Association to assess students’ health behaviors and perceptions of campus well-being. The survey was sent to students via email on Monday and is open until Nov. 19.
“I think that it’s going to be a real benefit for us to be able to guide our policies, for us to make decisions about where to put our energy and our resources in the future, and just give us a greater sense of what the real needs are among our students,” Nguyen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the stands in Lavietes Pavilion were filling up, concessions were being sold prior to tip-off, and the sound of basketballs bouncing during warmups controlled the audio in the pavilion, a sense of normalcy was restored. Tuesday's regular season home opener marked the return of Harvard men’s basketball for the first time in 612 days. The Crimson, having been separated across states and countries due to the pandemic, comes in with great expectations as it does every year. This season might feel a little more important, however, as Harvard looks to avenge the 2019-20 squad whose postseason run and hopes of making the NCAA tournament were cut unexpectedly.
However, the contest signifies more than just Harvard’s return to the collegiate basketball scene. Facing off against Morehouse College for the first time in program history serves as a continuation of head coach Tommy Amaker’s initiative to schedule games with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in hopes of highlighting connections between Harvard and such renowned institutions. Over Amaker’s tenure, Harvard has faced off against Howard University five times, with a sixth meeting awaiting next month. Amaker intends on starting this tradition with Morehouse as well, discussing his intentions to head to Atlanta for a future contest.
“Morehouse has an incredible tradition and history and so many amazing people have gone to that institution,” Amaker said. “I’m very pleased that Harvard and Morehouse were able to bring about two communities and have an opportunity to continually build incredible bonds.”
Like most things returning during the Covid-19 era, however, Harvard basketball is not necessarily back as we remembered it (for the time being, at least). This year’s team is a stark contrast to the 2019-20 squad, which featured seven seniors leading the experienced squad into the Ivy League Tournament. With seven of the team’s 16 members having no college basketball experience until tonight, coach Amaker’s “next man up” philosophy will have to be embodied more than ever, as opportunities to step in and contribute will present themselves more often than before.
The first of these opportunities was available tonight, with the current injury status of Harvard’s frontcourt requiring a shift in the lineup. Previous years’ Harvard squads had integral frontcourt presences in Chris Lewis, Robert Baker, and Henry Welsh, among others. This year’s co-captain, 6’9” senior forward Mason Forbes is projected to miss considerable time along with the team’s younger, more inexperienced big men, including junior Ciaran Brayboy, sophomores Justice Ajogbor and Josh Hemmings, and freshman Bennett Pitcher.
Feeding off of the Lavietes crowd itching to see its team back in action, the Crimson started the game on a 10-2 run led by good ball movement and aggressive play. Resorting to a smaller lineup, although raising questions about rebounding and defensive ability, allowed Harvard to stretch the floor offensively. Senior co-captain Kale Catchings quickly forced Morehouse’s bigs out to the perimeter defensively after hitting a three pointer to start the game.
Without the frontcourt presence offered by Forbes and the team’s other bigs, the defensive and rebounding efforts had to be distributed across the lineup even more so than they normally would. However, the team responded emphatically on the defensive front, forcing 13 turnovers in the opening frame through timely steals and drawn charges. On the glass, Harvard closed an early rebounding gap to finish the half with the advantage over Morehouse. Junior forward Chris Ledlum muscled his way to 11 boards in the first half, cleaning up the glass on both the offensive and defensive end to add to his 11 first-half points on 55 percent shooting.
On the offensive end, the Crimson capitalized on Morehouse’s turnovers and found itself at the line often as the Maroon Tigers fell into foul trouble early — committing 16 fouls in the first half alone. Scoring in the first half was led by senior guard Noah Kirkwood and Ledlum, contributing 13 and 11 points, respectively.
With a comfortable first half lead developing in Lavietes, coach Amaker looked to his bench earlier than he typically would. As a result, freshmen Denham Wojcik and Louis Lesmond saw some early action, giving Amaker his first impression of the rookies against in-game competition.
Wojcik, the Charleston, S.C., native, ended the half with two points on a pair of free throws and a steal on the defensive end. Lesmond, the Paris, France, native named Blue Ribbon’s preseason Ivy League rookie of the year, looked comfortable shooting the ball and rocked Lavietes with a pair of highlight dunks. Coach Amaker acknowledged Lesmond’s potential to be a key contributor to the young squad going forward in the season.
“[Lesmond] brings a lot to the table with size, length, shooting ability, and athleticism,” Amaker said of the freshman. “We’ve certainly liked his potential and what he’s been able to do so far, as he’s worked really hard and earned the respect of his teammates.”
By way of the 25 foul calls between both sides in the first 20 minutes of action, it was difficult to establish a continuous flow to the game which the crowd could feed into. However, going into the break, a glimpse of the Lavietes magic that was missing since March 2020 was revealed. Kirkwood knocked down triples in back-to-back possessions before senior guard Spencer Freeman connected from downtown in the final five seconds of the half, ballooning the Harvard lead to 24 and erupting the crowd into an uproar.
The Crimson’s second half suffered in comparison to the first, as it struggled to score at the same efficient clip that it did to open the game. Although the lead grew to 30 in the early minutes of the second, Harvard shot 28 percent from the field and 16 percent from downtown in the first eight minutes of the half, ultimately ending the period 2-15 from deep and 10-30 overall.
Morehouse, on the other hand, found the rhythm it had been missing in the first, as the Maroon Tigers shot 60 percent from three and 57 percent from the field in the second half. Sophomore guard Tavares Oliver Jr. was consistently finding his shot throughout the game, shooting 50 percent from the field and ending with a team-high 19 points. Oliver was often the centerpiece behind Morehouse’s runs late in the game, including a 5-0 and 7-0 run following the 10-minute mark to cut the Crimson lead to 16 points.
Ultimately, however, Amaker’s squad was able to tame the late Maroon Tiger runs, closing out the game with an 86-70 victory and extending the home opener win streak to 10. Junior guard Idan Tretout, Ledlum, Kirkwood, and Lesmond all scored in double digits in the season opener.
As with any season, adjustments will have to be made, and Amaker’s squads have been known for their ability to fill roles and do whatever it takes to win. This season is proving to be no exception very early on, as perimeter players in Catchings, Kirkwood, and Ledlum found themselves inside the paint more often against Morehouse, battling for rebounds and forcing turnovers on the defensive end.
Catchings, standing at 6’6”, found himself going up against Morehouse’s defensive giants, yet managed to secure eight rebounds and find ways to score across the floor. Ledlum filled the physical, bruising role down low as well, being tenacious on both the offensive and defensive ends and reaping the rewards of putback dunks and layups to add towards his 20-point career-high total on the night. Kirkwood has been working on changing his style of play and tendency to operate on the wing with his role shifting to start the season.
“A great example of this is, for me, learning how to run to the rim instead of running to the wing, and that’s something that coach has been harping on,” Kirkwood said about the learning process. “I think we’re going to be prepared no matter what.”
Losing a season and a solid group of veterans in the previous years’ graduating classes naturally presents a challenge in the transition of leadership. With the current juniors and seniors missing out on a year of play, the natural progression of assuming responsibility on the team was disrupted — leaving the “veterans” to adjust as much as the rookies currently are.
“I’d say it’s definitely strange. I remember looking up to the older guys running the practices,” recalled Ledlum, whose last in-game action prior to tonight was as a freshman. “It’s definitely a different situation for us, but we’ve been trying our best to handle it and catch it in stride.”
Looking to build on its first win, Harvard travels to New Rochelle, N.Y., next to face off against Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino’s Iona Gaels on Saturday, Nov. 13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball returned to the hardwood Tuesday night for the first time in 612 days, and Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith did so for the final season-opener in her illustrious 40-year career. The announcement of Coach Delaney-Smith’s retirement at the end of this 2021-2022 campaign provides an opportunity for the Crimson’s newest influx of talent to write a successful final chapter in her storied run. Although Tuesday night’s 86-60 loss to Boston College did not begin this historic season the way Harvard had hoped it would, optimism remains strong in the program for the season ahead.
The Crimson (0-1) began its road matchup trading baskets with the Eagles (1-0). Harvard’s starting lineup featured four guards with first-year Harmoni Turner, senior captain Tess Sussman, junior Maggie McCarthy, and sophomore Lola Mullaney, with senior Maddie Stuhlreyer anchoring the paint from the forward position. Early triples from Mullaney and junior guard Annie Stritzel, one of Coach Delaney-Smith’s first substitutes off the bench, kept the Harvard deficit to only three points as Boston College jumped out to a 10-7 lead. A Stritzel driving layup through an Eagle defender gave the Crimson a 14-13 advantage before both teams produced stop after stop on the defensive end of the court.
Breaking the scoring drought was Boston College’s senior forward Taylor Soule, whose back-to-back baskets included her 1,000th point in an Eagle uniform. Soule would finish the night with 19 points on 80 percent shooting from the field, and her veteran leadership of an experienced squad was a steadying force for Boston College through the rest of the game. After the contest, Delaney-Smith pointed to the wide gap in collegiate experience between her team of nine newcomers and a Boston College team that returned 99 percent of its scoring from 2020-2021.
“[My team] played young, which is not surprising,” Delaney-Smith said.  “I think BC were all seniors and veterans who played last year and played together all summer. I mean, we're just behind because we did not play last season. At times I had three first-years all on the floor. So it's just your classic veterans versus young kids, and I think, as I said,  we did some good things. But our inside presence wasn't strong enough to handle their inside presence. [So] not physical enough and not experienced enough.”
Of the Crimson’s new additions to the roster, which includes the sophomores who were unable to compete last year due to the Ivy League’s cancellation of the 2020-2021 season, Turner provided a glimpse of how key she will be for Coach Delaney-Smith’s final team. Although the former five-star recruit struggled from the field, she displayed an ability to blow by her defender and connected on a pair of smooth pull-up jumpers in the mid-range. She finished with 13 points, second on the team to Mullaney’s 16.
After a competitive first quarter in which the Crimson trailed 19-15, the Eagles’ depth and ability to run in transition opened the game wide open in the second quarter. Tess Sussman and Mullaney provided an offensive spark with two triples to hold the BC lead to four, but fast-break scores and key contributions from players off the bench allowed the Eagles to end the quarter with a 44-29 lead. BC outperformed the Crimson in fast break points 21 to five and bench points 32 to 15. Harvard was unable to match the Eagles’ strong play on the inside through the third and fourth quarters, and BC remained in control to the final buzzer, winning the contest by 26 points.
When asked after the game about any shift in her perspective given it was her final regular-season opener, Coach Delaney-Smith focused instead on the set of takeaways from Tuesday night that have her optimistic for the year ahead.
“You know what, that decision has been made and it's behind me,” Delaney-Smith said. “I really love this group of student-athletes. I think there's enormous potential. Again, we're going to have growing pains, but this game did not discourage me. We could have played much better, but I saw a lot of light. And I saw how deep we can be and how good we can be. I saw that we just have to get through the growing pains of youth.”
Hope for the Crimson’s 2021-2022 campaign can be further found in the return of junior guard McKenzie Forbes from a minor injury. Before joining the Harvard squad in 2020, the 2018 McDonald’s All-American averaged 5.3 points per game and connected on 34 three-pointers in her freshman season at California, Berkeley.
“She's a veteran and she's got good size and good power,” Delaney-Smith said. “So I mean, she was a very valuable missing piece to what we can do. [...] Her IQ is phenomenal. Her skill set is phenomenal. You know, she's already a very valuable part of our program, so we can't wait to get her out on the floor.”
Although Tuesday’s performance was not the strongest start to year number 40 for Delaney-Smith, the importance of this season is certainly not lost on the Crimson players. When Harvard travels to Amherst to take on UMass this Friday at 5:00 p.m., look for Forbes, captain Tess Sussman, and company to give full effort for Coach Delaney-Smith’s last regular season bout against the in-state rival.
“Once you take a step into the gym that Kathy Delaney-Smith is in, you're there for life,” said Sussman at the 2021 Ivy League media day. “I think what sets her apart are the priorities and the values that she instills in you, and those last a lifetime […] We have a million different personalities all throughout our community, but we all connect because we have that connection — which is Kathy.”

13 inches. Yep, you heard that correctly! The last few weeks have been a series of unfortunate events for my roommates and I, all revolving around one 13-inch long menace of a rat. Let me start from the beginning.
I woke up at 2 a.m. to one of my roommates screaming in the common room. “AHHHHHHH guys I think there’s a rat in our room!!” You get the image. During this first spotting, the rat was inside of a chip bag, munching away. When it heard my roommate, it got scared and ran across the top of the desk (it can climb!!) to some abyss in our common room.
Now, the fact that this rat was eating the chips is quite humorous because, for the past few days, the owner of the chips had been vehemently accusing all of us of stealing her chips. Although I am known to be a stealer of snacks, it genuinely was not me that was eating her chips — it was our resident rat, who, according to building ops, had been living with us and sharing our food supply for around a week at this point. Upon closer inspection of our food, most of the apples that we had left on our windowsill had little rat bites on them, and one fallen soldier apple had been fully devoured behind the fridge.
The fact that we had been actively sharing food with a RAT was already disturbing enough. Naturally, we started wondering if the mysterious illness that we had all come down with and were unable to get rid of was somehow related to our evil little pet and the unnaturally large feces that it had been leaving for us. The hantavirus, perhaps? The next bubonic plague, even?
Upon our first urgent call to building ops, our dweller was able to slyly evade capture and was nowhere to be found. Apparently, the larger the rat, the larger its brain, meaning that the largest rats are frequently smart enough to identify and avoid traps. Isn’t that nice? Over the period of a few days when he was nowhere to be found, we grew fond of the idea of him and began calling him our little Remy.
However, Remy was not too fond of us, and reappeared under the sink in our bathroom. Not only did he make his presence known, but he proceeded to run towards my roommate and try to climb the sink when she jumped on top of it. An unpleasant interaction, to say the least. Upon THIS urgent call to building ops, Remy was trapped in the bathroom with seemingly nowhere to run.
Remy always has a trick up his sleeve, though. This time, it was pure girth. The building ops guy told us that he tried to pick him up, but he was simply “too heavy.” We now learned that Remy is 13 inches long and around the size of a cat. Furthermore, the building ops person took a video of Remy, but refused to send it to us, because “it would go viral.”
HMMMMMM. Very interesting.
So Remy escapes again. He somehow managed to work his way into the radiator, leaving everybody puzzled about what to do next. Finally, a zookeeper is sent our way. Yes, a zookeeper. Naturally, we had some questions for this zookeeper about how dangerous our new tenant was.
“Should we be worried about getting bit by the rat?” someone asked.
“No no no don’t worry guys,” the zookeeper responds. “A rat bite is really no worse than a pig bite.”
This one was a real head scratcher. A pig bite?? I literally have zero sense of what a pig bite would be like, and have absolutely no desire to further understand the concept. I feel like a pig bite would be extremely unpleasant, so I’m not sure if this response was really on the scale that I would have liked.
Anyways, Remy managed to evade the zookeeper as well and died an honorable death in our ceiling. The absolute vile smell that he left made it seem like he really did have the last laugh. He was pulled out of the ceiling and hoisted out in a body bag of disturbing size.
Goodbye Remy. Gone, but certainly not ever forgotten.
