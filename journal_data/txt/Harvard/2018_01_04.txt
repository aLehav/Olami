After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said Harvard’s next president should have a background in science and listed several life scientists he “expects” to see on the search committee’s candidate shortlist in an interview last month.
Since University President Drew G. Faust announced her plans to step down in June, a presidential search committee—comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—has worked with two advisory committees to gather input from Harvard affiliates in Cambridge and beyond. In recent weeks, the search committee narrowed its list of candidates to fewer than 20 names, according to individuals with knowledge of the search.
Daley said he expects many life scientists made this under-20 list. Specifically, he said he thinks geneticist and Broad Institute President Eric S. Lander, physician and University of Michigan President Mark S. Schlissel, World Bank President and former Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim, and Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 are on the list.
“Eric Lander, one of the great leaders of the Broad Institute, is almost certainly on that shortlist,” Daley said.
He added that Garber, who several alumni and professors have already pointed to as a likely candidate, would make a “spectacular future president.”
Daley said he does not have direct knowledge of the search, though he has been formally and informally consulted by the search committee. He said he has made his “strong opinions” well known.
“I feel very passionately that we would be very well served in the future to have a scientist as president. I would love to see it be a life scientist,” said Daley, a prominent stem cell researcher.
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation who chairs the search committee, did not respond to a request for comment. He has repeatedly declined to comment on the number or identity of candidates the committee is considering.

Lander, 59, spearheaded the Human Genome Project and served as a scientific adviser to former President Barack Obama. He helped found the Broad Institute, a joint venture between Harvard and MIT for genetic research applied to medicine.
This is not the first time Lander has been mentioned as a potential Harvard president. The geneticist made the 2007 search committee’s shortlist in the University’s previous search for its 28th president, The Crimson reported in Jan. 2007.
Schlissel has served as president of the University of Michigan for roughly three years. Prior to that, he served as the provost of Brown University and before that as the dean of biological sciences at the University of California Berkeley. Schlissel, 60, holds various professorships in fields including microbiology in addition to the presidency.
Kim, 58, is a physician and anthropologist; he has served as the president of the World Bank since 2012. He has strong Harvard ties—in addition to earning an M.D./Ph.D. from the Medical School, he previously held the chairship of the department of global health and social medicine at the school.
When he assumed the presidency of Dartmouth in 2009, Kim became the first Asian American to serve as president of an Ivy League institution.
Multiple Harvard donors have called Garber a strong contender for the presidency. Garber taught medicine and economics for two-and-a-half decades at Stanford before returning to Harvard; he took on the provostship in 2011.
Garber, 62, currently serves as a professor of health care policy at the Medical School, studying methods for improving health care productivity and financing.
Lander, Schlissel, Kim, and Garber did not respond to requests for comment.
More than half a century has elapsed since Harvard has seen a scientist president: Chemist James Bryant Conant, who served as the University’s 23rd president from 1933 to 1953, was the most recent scientist to occupy the corner office of Massachusetts Hall.
As Harvard establishes an engineering campus in Allston, which Daley called a “hub of biotechnology innovation in the future,” Daley said that he “would love to see a greater emphasis on life science” moving forward.
“The importance of life sciences can’t be overstated for the future of not only Harvard University, but the greater Boston region and the future of the United States,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With seven to 14 inches of snow and wind gusts over 50 m.p.h. expected to descend on Boston, Harvard has closed its central administrative offices, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and University Health Services for the duration of the day Thursday.
The winter storm will hit in the middle of the College’s winter break, a time when no College classes meet and many undergraduates are off campus.
In an email to FAS affiliates, Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie Kirwan announced that all FAS class activities will be cancelled due to the "severe" storm, including those at the Extension School. She also announced that FAS library facilities will be closed.
Kirwan directed College students currently on campus to Pforzheimer dining hall for lunch and dinner, adding that Harvard shuttle buses will operate as normal “as long as the roads are passable and being plowed.”
Kirwan wrote that for “essential” employees, “every effort should be made to come to work” unless there is a “previously approved absence or illness.” She encouraged employees to contact their supervisors in case of usafe travel conditions.
Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates Wednesday that Health Services will be closed “for all services, including urgent care,” from 7:30 a.m. Thursday until 7:30 a.m. Friday. She wrote that HUHS will direct patients in need of care to Mt. Auburn Hospital or to emergency 911 services.
Lapp added, “As always, the safety of our students, faculty, staff, and other members of the Harvard community is paramount.”
Both Kirwan and Lapp wrote that updates will be communicated through the Harvard Emergency page and the FAS home page. Updates will also be available through MessageMe and at 617-496-NEWS.
Harvard has cancelled classes due to snow a total of five times since 1978. Last year, the University and Faculty of Arts and Sciences closed in the face of a "substantial" snow storm in March.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing a severe snowstorm expected to hit the Boston area Thursday, the National Labor Relations Board has delayed the unsealing and counting of the 195 contested ballots left over from Harvard’s Nov. 2016 graduate student unionization election.
The count was originally scheduled to take place Jan. 4. But Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven said Wednesday that the impending snowstorm—which is forecasted to bring seven to 14 inches of snow and wind gusts over 50 m.p.h.—caused the NLRB to postpone until Jan. 11.
The NLRB’s final count would pave the way for the University to hold a second election after more than a year of deadlock. At stake is whether or not eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants at Harvard will earn the right to collectively bargain with the University.
The provisional results of the Nov. 2016 election showed 1,457 votes against unionization compared to 1,272 in favor. The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers challenged that result and Harvard fought back, leading to months of conflict—but the NLRB ultimately ruled the University must hold another election.
Per NLRB procedure, Harvard cannot hold a second election until the remaining votes from the Nov. 2016 election are unsealed and counted, provided the final tally does not already certify the union. At least 185 of the remaining challenged ballots would have to break in favor of unionization to change the result. Otherwise, the NLRB, the University, and the HGSU-UAW will set a date for a new election.
NLRB regulations state that both Harvard and the HGSU-UAW each have seven days to contest the final tally after the challenged ballots are counted, potentially further delaying a second election.
