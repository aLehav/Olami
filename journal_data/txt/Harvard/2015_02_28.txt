After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, the concept of a homeland is becoming more vague. Is home where you came from or where you live? How do you understand your homeland after you leave? Novelist Mohsin Hamid explores these difficult questions and examines the relationship between his various homes across the world in his perceptive and inspiring new collection of essays, “Discontent and Its Civilizations: Dispatches from Lahore, New York, and London.”
Hamid maintains a special balance between a novel and political science report, sharing stories and commentary on the three cities that he has called his home. He introduces the book saying, “I recognize that I have always felt myself a half-outsider.” Hamid has been to many cities and connected to them, yet has never been fully comfortable with any one city. Instead, he compares himself to a water lily—constantly floating, but with roots. Over a span of 15 years Hamid floats from Lahore in Pakistan, to the United States, then back to Pakistan, then to New York and London, and finally back to Pakistan. Consistent with this, he divides the book into three sections—life, art, and politics—that organize the book thematically rather than chronologically. These three parts, mostly well-written, translate into Hamid discussing himself as a man, as an author, and as a political commentator, respectively.
Hamid’s multiple selves are accompanied with multiple musings on different topics in his moving, snapshot-like essays. From (almost) making Toni Morrison dinner to Hamid’s favorite novel, Antonio Tabucchi’s “Sostiene Pereira,” the subjects of the selections are well-varied. While the latter portion is a bit of a departure from the rest of the book, the essays are amusing and inspirational. In his description of “Sostiene Pereira” Hamid writes, “Here was novel with the courage to be a book about art, a book about politics, and a book about the politics of art.” Like Tabucchi, Hamid manages in his own work to progress from art to politics and to determine his role as an artist within a political context. He compares and contrasts his experiences of different cultures, relating them to his mother country Pakistan.
Finally the book transitions to an interesting exploration of the good and the bad of the Pakistani government. Hamid, having frequently written on this subject for “The New York Times,” “Washington Post,” and other well-known publications, feels like a credible narrator. He conveys both how important the issues facing Pakistan are and also how everyday life continues amidst the violence and political strife. He speaks with candor about problems within Pakistan, claiming that “Pakistanis must realize that we have been our own worst enemies.” However much Hamid criticizes his homeland, though, he also remains optimistic for the future of the country, and in his book he achieves a balanced account that is filled with constant love and support for Pakistan as well as incisive criticism.
Another one of the book’s refreshing aspects is the way that Hamid manages to handle serious issues while maintaining a readable and relatable tone. He presents an enlightening perspective on how the United States’ treatment of Pakistan has affected his daily life and the lives of so many of his fellow citizens. For example, he makes the strong claim that “America’s 9/11 has given way to Pakistan’s 24/7/365,” and he reminds readers that, while the death of Osama bin Laden was a victory in the United States, it complicated Pakistan’s relationships with its neighbors. This kind of engaging political conversation touches on points that are often absent from the mainstream news. While Hamid criticizes the United States, he goes beyond citing statistics and uses personal anecdotes to show today’s Pakistan, encouraging Americans to sympathize with his story and perhaps even alter their thoughts on the politics of the region. At one point he tells a story about a man comparing the movie “Avatar” to the relationship between the United States and Pakistan. The pop culture reference makes the Pakistani victim a recognizable individual.
The few weaknesses in the book arise largely from Hamid’s confusing use of pieces he wrote separately over time. Despite the way he edits the essays, there are portions of the same stories in different places. The topic of the 60th anniversary of Pakistan occurs both towards the beginning and the end of the collection, and Hamid’s commentary about the event in both places is, disappointingly, very similar. Additionally, while the three thematic sections are a great way of categorizing the essays, at times the collection seems more like a set of unrelated descriptions rather than a cohesive and evolving book.
Another threat to the unity of the book comes from the discussion of politics at the end, which feels less integrated with its overall feeling. While Hamid’s personal relationship to Pakistan is appealing, the final essays deal solely with the relationship between America and Pakistan and rely extensively on discussions of military strategy and political compromises or solutions. The stories here still read like engaging articles. However, they are an ineffective departure from the concept of homeland that is so prevalent throughout the rest of the book. The ending would have been stronger if it returned to this concept of the various civilizations where Hamid lived.
Hamid discusses “homeland” throughout the book, and finally determines that he can find pieces of true “‘homes,’” along with beauties and faults, in all the places he has lived. In this sense, “Discontent and Its Civilizations” tells a story, or perhaps a series of mini-stories, that may feel relatable, especially to those who have had the experience of feeling like an outsider and wondering where they belonged. Perhaps there is no perfect home for such individuals, and the feeling of being an outsider will never leave. One may join Hamid, though, in concluding that there is a way to call many places home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it seems like superhero movies or intense dramas are the only movies that Hollywood has invested in of late, “Black Sea,” starring Jude Law, is a refreshing thriller that goes beyond the traditional submarine drama. “Black Sea” is both a gripping treasure hunt and a claustrophobic’s worst nightmare.
The film maintains a Cold War atmosphere, although it is set in the present. A sunken WWII Nazi U-boat full of gold lies at the bottom of the Black Sea. And a motley crew of six Russians and six Britons is led into fearsome depths in an aged, Soviet-era submarine in an attempt to retrieve the gold. They are incentivized by the promise of an equal share in the bullion hoard. Such movies generally feature a fraternity-like pack of thieves. However, the suspense in “Black Sea” arises from the fact that no such camaraderie exists amongst this crew. The fewer sailors survive, the greater the share for the others. Thus, the drama turns from momentary revelry to a terrifying deep-sea thriller.
Director Kevin McDonald does an admirable job employing his experience in documentaries (“Marley”) and drama (“The Last King of Scotland”) to raise “Black Sea” out of  the doldrums of an otherwise dead January for Hollywood. McDonald’s close shots within a real Russian submarine give the film a realistic feeling of mind-bending claustrophobia and crushing terror. Even though the film takes place almost exclusively in four rooms, the shots never feel repetitive. In fact, like all great danger-filled action movies, “Black Sea” puts the viewer in the same situations as the characters he is watching, forcing him into the cramped and stuffy space of the submarine along with the perfidious crew. McDonald, with his emphasis on the pitch black rolling ocean and the outside shots of the relatively tiny bobbing submarine, constantly underlines the terrifying fact that as greed takes hold and the crew turns on one another, there is no easy escape.
However, it is the acting that truly elevates “Black Sea” above the traditional submarine drama. An aging Jude Law plays surly and desperate Captain Robinson, a down-and-out man whose last hope is to retrieve the Nazi gold after being fired from his corporate employer. While his character’s storyline may be overused, Law still comes off as genuine. While his desperation to find meaning after being estranged from his wife and son, Law takes on a father role for Tobin (Bobby Scholfield), the young newcomer on the ship, as he tries to bring back his sense of purpose. The rest of crew, each bringing their  own unique talents, rounds out a great ensemble. From the sketchy financier (Scoot McNairy), the swarthy Irishman Reynolds (Michael Smiley), seasoned mariner (David Threlfall), and the psychopathic master diver Fraser (Ben Mendelsohn), it is easy to imagine that these men belong in a submarine and could not live normal lives on land.
In all, although the tropes of “Black Sea” may seem tired or overused, it is refreshing to see a film that does not depend on superhero-fueled pyrotechnics to deliver on its promise of action and suspense. “Black Sea”, although not a perfect movie, does rise above the typical submarine drama and is a great reprieve from the January movie season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just like in last year’s postseason, the No. 4/4 Harvard women’s ice hockey team opened the ECAC quarterfinals with a home fixture against Yale.
Unlike last year, however, the Crimson (23-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) swiftly took down the Bulldogs (15-15-1, 12-10-0) in a crisp set of victories—2-1 on Friday and 3-0 on Saturday—that couldn’t be further from the two double-overtime battles and Sunday showdown of the dramatic 2014 series that went the full three games.
With the wins, Harvard locked a spot in the ECAC semifinals next Saturday at home against Quinnipiac.
HARVARD 3, YALE 0
While 2014’s starting goaltenders made repeat appearances in the net (junior Emerance Maschmeyer for Harvard and senior Jaimie Leonoff for Yale), it was a totally different story, as Maschmeyer earned the 12th shutout of her collegiate career in far less time than the six hours she spent between the pipes last year.
“I wanted to have a good start,” Maschmeyer said. “As a goalie you want to make sure you play solid from the beginning. You don’t want to let anything in right off the start so focusing one puck at a time was the key.”
Harvard’s blue line proved crucial in stopping the puck before it could even enter striking distance for Yale, as the Crimson gained an overall edge in shots on goal, 37-24, with the greatest leads coming during the second period and towards the end of the third.
Meanwhile, at the other end of the ice, a trio of Harvard skaters—sophomore forward Sydney Daniels, co-captain and forward Samantha Reber, and senior defender Josephine Pucci—struck gold against Leonoff, with a pair of scores in the first period and one in the second to seal the win.
Harvard coach Katey Stone attributed the win as telling of the specific adjustments and increase in energy that the Crimson made between Friday and Saturday’s game.
“We took time and space away everywhere,” Stone said. “We made it really tough for them. We were on their hands all day. We had good looks at the net. We brought the puck to the middle of the ice a bit more which was a big thing for us and made the goaltender really have to move in her crease.”
Still, despite the high stakes or perhaps poetic nature of the matchup, the focus was on playing what Stone and players call “Harvard hockey” for a reliable, and hopefully victorious, effort.
“Last year was a different year,” Maschmeyer said. “I went into it saying, ‘This is a hockey game, play my game, don’t change anything, and anything can happen.’”
HARVARD 2, YALE 1
An early score from the Bulldogs was no impediment to a Crimson win on Friday afternoon as Harvard beat Yale, 2-1, to open the quarterfinals.
Bulldogs’ junior forward Jamie Haddad, who holds top marks in both points (25) and goals (11) for her team this season, tallied Yale’s sole goal, which came 3:43 into the second frame. Meanwhile, Harvard junior forward Miye D’Oench and teammate Daniels, who pace the Crimson’s offense with 17 and 18 goals each, respectively, chipped in Harvard’s two scores within five minutes of one another later in the second.
“I thought it was an awesome win,” D’Oench said. “They battled, especially at the end, but we battled right back, so it was a lot of fun to play in. A little more suspenseful than maybe we would like, but those are the ones that are fun.”
The first and third periods were both scoreless, while the Crimson’s speedy team gained an advantage in shots on goal through the entire game, winning the final tally, 41-23.
“It was a hard fought hockey game,” Stone said. “We took an inordinate amount of shots, and [Leonoff] stood on her head, and our goalie was up for the task as well. It was tough to score goals on either end of the ice, so [there] was a small margin of error.”

ITHACA, N.Y—The Harvard men’s basketball players spoke to each other before Friday night’s game at Cornell. They couldn’t have another slow start after pulling out close wins three straight weekends. Eventually an early deficit or a close finish would come back to haunt the team, they said. They were right.
The Crimson scored just 21 points in the first half Friday and never led in the second half of a 57-49 defeat to the Big Red (13-14, 5-6 Ivy). The loss drops Harvard (19-6, 9-2 Ivy) back into a tie with Yale for first in the Ivy League.
Senior wing Wesley Saunders nailed a couple shots to cut that gap to three points in the game's final minutes, but the Crimson comeback petered out as the Big Red went on an 6-0 run to grab a 50-41 lead. With 1:47 left in the game, Harvard’s comeback chances got another boost when sophomore Corbin Miller stepped to the line for three free throws. Miller, an 88 percent free-throw shooter coming in, missed the first free throw. Then he missed the second. Then the third clanged off the rim as well.
“That will probably never happen again in his career at Harvard,” Saunders said afterwards. “He can knock down free throws with his eye closed.”
“It was somewhat indicative of the night for us—how tough it was for us to score,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Cornell, meanwhile, made its free throws (20-for-21 overall) late to ice the game, ending Harvard’s high-wire act of an eight-game winning streak with a thud.
Senior Shonn Miller led the Big Red with 24 points and 15 rebounds. The forward bullied his way to points down low and then stepped outside for a series of jumpers. Each seemed to come at a critical time, and each seemed to fall. His reactions grew increasingly animated, as did the 3,208 in attendance at Newman Arena.
“All year, we’ve been getting good shots because we are so good at getting in the lane,” Cornell coach Bill Courtney said. “A lot of times we miss. We had a couple times in the second half when those shots went into the basket and that changes the whole dynamic.”
Courtney jokingly added that he expects at least a thank-you note from Yale coach James Jones, whose team now controls its own destiny in the Ivy title race thanks to Cornell’s upset.
Cornell had not beaten Harvard since 2010—Courtney had never topped Amaker—but the Big Red proved tough from the jump, opening the game on a 6-1 run. It ended the first-half with a final-minute alley-oop that gave the hosts the halftime lead, 22-21. The score was nearly identical to what it was when these two teams faced off in Cambridge two weeks ago.
But whereas the Crimson stormed back to win that game handily with a 40-16 second half, Cornell never let the Harvard offense get going in the second half Friday.
Courtney said he stressed to his team the importance of getting back and setting up on defense rather than allowing Harvard junior co-captain Siyani Chambers to generate easy points in transition. The result was a 25 percent shooting performance from the Crimson and its lowest scoring output in Ivy play this year.
“We didn’t earn this tonight,” Amaker said. “We didn’t deserve to win tonight, and that’s the part that’s as tough to stomach for me as any.”
Harvard stayed within striking range thanks to 21 offensive rebounds and by limiting Cornell to 36 percent shooting on the other end of the floor. Still, the Crimson could never muster enough offensive firepower to make any of that matter.
For three weeks, Harvard found offense when it needed to. It eked out a 52-50 win in New Haven, hit a bucket with 2.9 seconds left to dispatch Columbia after blowing a 17-point lead, and made up for an eight-point halftime deficit against Princeton in its last outing.
Friday, the Crimson finally got burnt by a slow start. And the Ivy League title race is radically different as a result.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the No. 10/9 Quinnipiac men’s ice hockey team lost in conference play was on Dec. 6 at the hands of now-No. 16/15 Harvard. Since that day in late autumn, the Bobcats have not blinked in their quest to go into the conference tournament with the number one overall seed, going into Friday night’s game undefeated in its last 12 ECAC matchups.
Quinnipiac showed no signs of slowing down in Cambridge.
Three first period goals—including two in the first nine minutes—paved the way to a 5-2 victory for the Bobcats at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, cementing their spot atop the ECAC standings heading into the playoffs.
“I thought we came out in the first five or six minutes pretty strong,” co-captain Max Everson said. “They got that power play and made a nice play, and then we kind of stopped skating.”
After surrendering an early goal, the Crimson (14-11-3, 10-8-3 ECAC) looked to stop the momentum of Quinnipiac’s first goal of the night, but such an attempt was unsuccessful. Sophomore Devon Toews sent a shot in from the point which hit pipe and bounced fortuitously right back to fellow sophomore Sam Anas. Last year’s ECAC Co-Rookie of the Year corralled the loose puck, deked junior goaltender Steve Michalek by going to his backhand, and flicked the puck into the back of the net to extend the lead to two goals for the Bobcats (21-8-4, 16-2-3).
Quinnipiac added its third goal of the first period with less than three minutes remaining. Toews sent a wrister past a screened Michalek to further silence the already quiet Crimson crowd and jump out to an early three-goal lead.
Anas added another one 13:34 into the second period. The second-year star has become familiar with the back of the net during his stint in college hockey, increasing his goal total to 19 on the year, trailing only two other forwards in the conference.
Anas’ second goal of the night quelled any momentum Harvard gained from its power play goal at the end of the first period after the score gave the Crimson a jolt of energy going into intermission. Junior forward Jimmy Vesey redirected a shot from junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo for his 21st goal of the year—good for second in the ECAC.  Sophomore Sean Malone added another one less than eight minutes into the third period on a wraparound to beat junior goaltender Michael Garteig, but it was too little, too late.
The Bobcats opened with a power play goal of their own early on in the contest. Senior Matthew Peca found junior Travis St. Denis open at the left faceoff circle, who sent a cross-ice pass to freshman Landon Smith just to the left of the crease. The rookie had plenty of open net and plenty of time as he knocked it home.
Quinnipiac capped off its scoring by adding a third period goal for good measure. Peca and freshman Tanner MacMaster broke out on a two-on-one, with the senior feeding the rookie, who beat Michalek over the left pad.
Junior Colin Blackwell skated for the first time since his one appearance this season on Nov. 21 against Bentley. The third-year forward averaged 16.5 points in his freshman and sophomore years before being sidelined for all but one game this season. He was held scoreless in this contest.
“We’re taking our cue from him and how he feels,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s been a couple of years minus a game, but I think he played excellently for someone who hasn’t played.”
With the loss, Harvard is no longer projected for a first-round bye in the ECAC tournament. Dartmouth beat Princeton on Friday night, while Colgate skated to a tie against Yale, bumping the Crimson in the conference standings to the sixth-seed. Since Valentine’s Day, Harvard has only won one of its last five games as the team has slowly slid down the conference rankings and national standings.
“I don’t think it changes anything for us,” Everson said. “It doesn’t change our goal. Our goal is still to play in Lake Placid and win the ECAC tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning eight straight games to grab sole control of the Ivy League, the Harvard men’s basketball team (19-6, 9-2 Ivy) laid an egg Friday Night in Ithaca. The Crimson shot just 25 percent from the floor and 61 percent from the free throw line, with its top three players combining to make just 13 of 43 shots from the floor. Harvard will look to earn a split on the Gentleman’s C’s road trip when it visits Columbia (13-12, 5-6). Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard visits Levein Gymnasium.
Playing For the Trophy: Arguably the two leading Ivy League Player of the Year candidates will square off Saturday night. Harvard senior wing Wesley Saunders, the reigning ILPOY, missed 15 of his 21 shots last night. He finished with nice round totals of 19 points and 11 rebounds—including a personal 6-2 run to bring Harvard within four—but was outshined by Cornell senior forward Shonn Miller (24 points, 15 rebounds, three blocks). Columbia junior guard Maodo Lo averaged 26.5 points a week ago in sweeping Brown and Yale, but similarly came down to earth in a surprising 84-71 loss to Dartmouth, making just four of 13 shots with four turnovers and zero assists.
Lo got the better of Saunders in the last meeting, notching a game-high 22 points and adding four assists and six rebounds against just one turnover. However, Harvard got the last laugh with the win, which Lo (and Columbia) will surely remember.
Muted Guns: Early in conference play, junior wing Agunwa Okolie was the X-factor for the Crimson, scoring in double digits in three consecutive games after not doing so all season. One of Harvard’s best perimeter defenders, Okolie made his mark offensively with smart off-the-ball cuts and tough rebounding inside. Over the last three games, however, the junior has all but disappeared, scoring just one combined point and missing all seven of his shots. If Okolie cannot provide offense, Harvard’s starting five struggles to find enough spacing and defenses clog up the lane, making the game significantly harder for Saunders and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi.
Sophomore Slumping: Okolie is not the only Harvard starter struggling to score. In the case of sophomore forward Zena Edosomwan, however, it is largely a battle to stay on the court. Since scoring 13 points against Bryant on Jan. 20, Edosomwan has not had more than seven. Not coincidentally, he has played more than 20 minutes just four times in the stretch, committing three or more fouls six times. He had three more fouls, to go along with two turnovers, in his nine minutes of playing time Friday night. The Crimson need more out of its sophomore big man Saturday against the versatile Columbia front line, headed up by burly 6’11” Cory Osetkowski.

Valentine’s Day has come and gone a long time ago, and now we’re at the point where, hell, you may have just missed out on that free Zinneken's waffle. Or of course, you know, the chance to hit it off with the love of your life. Our ticket out of an interminable crawl to death alone littered away last Friday, when the date special ended, as well as the semi-socially acceptable excuse to ask someone out via email. Well, beans.
But then there are the shameless, like yours truly.
February 18, 2015
I sent an email with the subject line “Date for a Story?,” five days after V-Day, the release of our compatibility.
February 20, 2015
He responded to my email with a “let’s do it! whatever you wanna do (within reason) is cool w me.” Swooning from his daring omission of capital letters, I knew he was a keeper. But once he was kept, the painful realization that the critical window of our waffle-reliant romance was closing, and closing quickly, hit me over the head like Cupid with a bazooka.
February 21, 2015
Ran into him in the dining halls at 9 a.m., rockin’ the “Midterm Gremlin Who isn’t Gonna Leave the D-hall All Day” look. Cool.


February 22, 2015
A date. Wut. Frazzled, I took a poll in Leverett dining hall. My friends and colleagues were equally perplexed about this “date” concept. I received the following suggestions for activities that could be constituted as a “date:”
Get a pedicure together!
Give each other haircuts!
ZUMBA!
Go hand fishing for catfish!!
Kill him.
Confused, and slightly concerned about my friendship choices, I decided it was back to the drawing board.
February 23, 2015
I took the plunge, and friended him on Facebook, and asked him to Thursday dinner, somewhere special. ;)
February 24-26, 2015
And we wait.
February 27 2015
Our low budgets and our ambitious sense of adventure lead us to one of Cambridge’s finest eating establishments. White and red light danced across the cool tile floor as we walked in through the glass doors, hit with a wave a savory flavors.  We spotted a cozy aluminum table that would be ours for the next hour, but Tasty Burger is a strange place at 6 p.m. on a Thursday, indeed.
The point is, as we worked through our burger combos, there were no recorded deaths of either of the parties involved, no invasions, and no major pandemics. Ten days ago, my Datamatch was the scariest thing in the entire world, a name on a computer screen and the daunting premise of 90.4% compatibility, and today, he was a really cool guy. AND I got Tasty Burger.
You can let Datamatch pass you by, but ten days of randomly stalking your Datamatch on Facebook and thinking “eh, maybe next year” is by far the less interesting than what reaching out will get you. If it’s horrible, you get a great story. If it’s awesome, it’s awesome.
Here’s to Datamatch 2015!

In a desperate plea to finish as much of my homework as possible before my weekend trip going home (aka how to make my bag as light as possible by not bringing my SLS 19 textbook so I can stuff it with free food courtesy of the 'rents), I braved the cold to walk to make the trek (jk, I live in the Inn at Harvard so I can't really complain) to Cabot Library. But while going down Quincy Street, I decided to take a chance (translation: I got lazy) and check out the Graduate School of Design's Loeb Library instead. I ended up finishing all my weekend readings for one of my class and having a nice change of scenery, so here's why you should make this awesome place your new study spot!
No Bag Checks (yes, this is real!)We all know that it's the little things in life that make us happy, and for me, that is not having to open every compartment of my bookbag after a long and stressful night at Lamont. Yes, the Loeb Library has a turnstile like Widener and Lamont, but no, it does not have someone from Securitas checking your bags! You could imagine how I awkwardly slow-walked my way out of the library because I wasn't sure what was going on as I was leaving, but when I realized that no one was going to ask me to open up my bag, I found out the true meaning of #blessed.
Sidenote: did anyone other than me think that Securitas was a Harvard-centric security company, with a clever play on the word Veritas? Did anyone else not know that Securitas actually isn't Harvard-affiliated and serves countries all over the world?!
ChauhausIt's like LamCaf, but cooler sounding! You can take a nice break from studying here with a snack courtesy of BoardPlus, and the back wall is entirely made of windows so you can bask in sunlight, that is if we all remember what that even is anymore. If you come during lunch, they even have real food and a salad bar! Take that, eclairs and that enormous carrot cake in the Lamont Cafe display!
Being surrounded by people who are really well-dressed and probably don't know youOkay, the GSD students are all so incredibly well-dressed from head-to-toe. I literally stuck out like such a sore thumb wearing my raggedy free shirt from high school and pajamas masked as "fashion leggings," that everyone around me most definitely thought, "Does she even go here?" And to top it all off, you probably won't recognize anyone around you because they're all grad students! Don't you hate it when everyone in your Gov20 class has invaded Lamont the night before a paper is due and you slowly see people finishing and leaving while you're still on sentence #2 and desperately re-refreshing Facebook?
Cool art to look at while you study The first floor doesn't really have anything to brag about, but the bottom floor has a spiral staircase leading to it and miniature models of architecture! When I was getting sick of doing my reading, I looked to my right and stared for awhile at a mini-model of a building, which then made me wonder how long it took the artist to make this since I took several days at the beginning of the year to realize that my drying rack is not in fact supposed to collapse everytime I put my towel on it and that I had just made it incorrectly.

The third season of your favorite political drama is finally here, and what better timing than right before the week you have three midterms, a paper, and six psets! If you’re a disgustingly obsessed House of Cards fan like us, chances are you're spending the weekend huddled in a bed/futon/comfy furnishing of choice soaking up the juicy goodness that is the Underwoods, with possible breaks for a Veritaffle or two. To save you all the mental anguish of trying to actually be productive this weekend, we’ve compiled a timeline of how your weekend of “studying” has been panning out. Warning: minor spoilers ahead.
Friday, 5:30 p.m.: Interior, bedroom. You started watching the first episode of the season, and you felt like you’re in heaven. You missed the bleak theme song, the ominous lighting, and Claire’s wardrobe of only white, black, and grey. You’ve waited too long to be reunited with this treasure, and it’s finally here.
6:30 p.m.: You finished the first episode. Your excitement was still unwavered, but you decided to get dinner before immersing yourself into the rest of the season. Also, you were getting a little bored of watching Doug Stamper go through physical therapy.
7:15 p.m.: Screw dinner. Catch of the day and mashed potatoes are not worth it. The only way you wanted to spend your time is at the side of your main man President Underwood. You start to wish you were the adopted child of Frank and Claire.
8:15 p.m.: What is this show? Why are there so many metaphors to eggs? You started questioning why you’re even watching this piece of fiction in the first place, but it doesn’t matter. HOC is controlling you now. You enjoy the casual beer pong scene between Claire and the Secretary of State. “For the Crimson,” Claire cheers. “Hell yeah,” you agree.
Sunday, 3:47 a.m.: You are a disgrace. You have 109 more unread messages in your college email than usual, and eight hours of review sessions to attend later in the day. You spent the entire weekend in the same clothes, under the same blanket, watching the same characters hash out the same argument over the same legislation and the same moral conflicts. You start to compensate for your lack of movement for the past 48 hours. You tell yourself you’ve been working so hard lately. After all, you went to the MAC once this week!
Monday, 10:32 a.m.: You’re exhausted, but you have no good excuse as to why your math pset is half done with question marks written under most of the questions. But at least you got to spend some quality time with your fictional friends down in D.C. The hottie sitting next to you in section asks, “How was your weekend?” You will try not to sound like the pathetic binge-watcher you are. “Oh, the usual. Studying and stuff.”
