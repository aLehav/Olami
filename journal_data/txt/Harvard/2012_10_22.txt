After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I came to this school with every intention of becoming a radical. My political education had so far been limited to debates over the capital gains tax, voucher programs, and other wonky minutiae. And while such topics were certainly worthy of discussion, they were all confined to a narrow ideological niche.
If there were ever a place where I could break free from the confines of modern liberalism, it was here, where the currents of Marx still trickle through the professoriate.
Many of my intellectual heroes, from Christopher Hitchens to Walter Lippmann, had, after all, ventured outside the boundaries of republicanism during their college days. Compared to our modern activism, their experiences seemed so heady, impassioned, exciting. So it was with an open and receptive mind that I attended this year’s first meeting of the Harvard Socialists, in which an “Alternative to Capitalism” was to be spelled out for us liberals.
Somewhat to my disappointment, I left that meeting not with collectivist ambitions, but with a begrudging respect for those confines I once despised.
The moment I walked into the club’s room that evening, it became clear that my conceptions of modern socialism had been grossly mistaken. Surrounded by a hodgepodge of union members and Harvard Kennedy School students, a head honcho of the club sat fiddling with her iPhone, a hot cup of Starbucks coffee clenched in the other hand. Although the corporate irony was lost on none us newcomers, I was still eager to hear about the virtues of this alternative route.
But instead of constructing an alternative, the club presenter launched a masturbatory, 20-minute diatribe against both capitalism and the statism of Soviet Russia. It was well delivered, chalked full of trenchant points, and as a leftist, I enjoyed this speech thoroughly. But it nevertheless failed to address the questions about the absence of profit motives or individual dreams that I had wanted answered.
A Q&A session followed the diatribe, in which we are all allotted 90 seconds for questioning—speaking slots to be timed, of course, on the iPhone.
I told them I was convinced of capitalism’s shortcomings, but I needed to understand how an alternative could function. In response, the socialists bombarded me with less-than-helpful answers: “We can’t really conceptualize a post-capitalist world,” they said. “There are many different theories. Mainly we’ll have to adopt and innovate as the revolution progresses.
At the end of the meeting, frustrated by this lack of clarity, I ventured over to a table stacked high with back issues of International Socialist Review. I asked if they were free for the taking, and one of the club’s leaders responded that they were not, but for “two or three” United States dollars they could make an exception.
I was astounded. Never in my Harvard career had I experienced such an impromptu, capitalistic exchange, much less from a socialist.
I accepted the offer, and with the hidden transfer of two dollars bills the magazine was mine. But it had come at the cost of my respect for socialism as a legitimate school of modern political thought. This wasn’t at all like the Cuban Trotskyist-Luxembourgist commune I had read about in Christopher Hitchens’ memoirs. This was simply a group of leftists who, like me, were looking for an answer to the conundrums of capitalism. But without a positive alternative or a cohesive, unified ideology, one could not help but feel that these new age “socialists” were simply liberals who had taken the leftist argument to an illogical and undefined extreme.
As much as I was disappointed as I left the meeting, the nail in the coffin of my radical career having been hammered in, that evening’s episode had been instrumental in my development as a political thinker.
Perhaps there was a good reason that socialism, even at the “Kremlin-on-the-Charles,” had been reduced to the intellectually disparate fringe. I had been listening to that presentation and engaging in that Q&A with a level of historical context unavailable even in the sixties. Not only had the positive alternatives to capitalism failed to materialize in Russia, China, and, yes, Cuba, but the capitalist world has also not devolved in the way those college radicals before us had feared. Overt imperialism has begun to transmogrify into a liberal Wilsonianism, and while the pie slices are no more equal than they were a half-century ago, all classes are still markedly better off. Workers’ foment has calmed, and with it, academia’s affiliation with communism has waned.
It’s true that the wealthy still exert undue influence over our politics, and the ideal of meritocratic society has been reduced to a joke. But recent history, unavailable to our radical predecessors, has showed liberal democracy to be tolerable, and the positive alternatives non-existent.
In a way I’m glad that political radicalism has weakened at Harvard, even though the extremists of old held a romance that us social democrats can never emulate. As history has shown with increasing clarity, their cause was the silly one. And as I trudge back to the Dems meeting the following week, I am disappointed, but I am also relieved, for I had not spent four years of my life fighting for the incorrect cause.
Those ideological confines I could never broach had, it turns out, been the appropriate boundaries all along.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Life expectancy in the United States is 78.2 years. Newsweek’s print magazine, narrowly edging out the average American, will reach its end at age 79. In the latter’s case, however, death may not be worth much mourning anymore.
The publication’s last physical pages will grace stands on December 31, 2012. But for Newsweek, the tragedy doesn’t lie in last week’s announcement of the magazine’s mercy killing. The ultimate, and likely inevitable, decision to put down Newsweek’s print edition came on the heels of a more truly tragic stretch, in which gaudy stories and cover images pasted over a decades-long journalistic tradition.
In the wake of the 2010 Newsweek-Daily Beast merger, the magazine, freshly helmed by Daily Beast co-founder Tina Brown, relied on increasingly pithless and provocative covers. Controversial choices ranged from a “what-if” extrapolation of Princess Diana’s face to a pair of risqué asparagus stalks to glossy accusations of rage—rage both of Muslims and of an unfavorably photographed Michele Bachmann. All of these and more signaled a preference for the eye-grabbing over the substantive. And they did grab eyes. Single-copy newsstand sales rose two percent for Newsweek from 2010 to 2011, even as the industry average dipped by nine percent. Unfortunately, Newsweek missed its own business model. Single-copy issues comprise a mere three percent of its circulation (with a net revenue premium of barely one dollar per issue). A two percent of three percent uptick proved far from enough. While occasional passersby splurged on the colorful covers, Newsweek’s subscribers left in droves for better reporting and analysis. Nearly 100,000, or 3.5 percent, departed last year.
Of course, blame for Newsweek’s woes cannot fall solely at Ms. Brown’s feet. Newsweek’s circulation had fallen from roughly 3.1 million in 2007 to1.8 million in 2010, the year of the “NewsBeast” merger. The plight of Newsweek in part reflects a wider struggle to monetize journalism in the internet age. For instance, online advertizing sales form barely five percent of total advertizing revenue for magazines, despite consistent double-digit shares of “digital only” readers across the industry. But even in the face of this trend, unique woes remain: Newsweek’s online viewership has dropped precipitously, too—from 6.3 million unique visitors in mid-2009 to 2.6 million Newsweek/Daily Beast visitors last month. That is a magazine hemorrhaging online viewers should now gear its operations solely toward online content is a serious cause for concern.
Ultimately, however, Newsweek’s example points to an area more deserving of attention than the specific numbers and the economics. Readers should care about the writing.
Flashy covers are a poor distraction from the journalism itself. If Newsweek’s sales are any indication, readers agree. But beyond that, pages and ink matter only to a degree as well. We value and believe in the endurance of high-quality journalism regardless of its medium. Hopefully, publications will find more ways to adapt and survive in the modern marketplace. Untethered by the newsstand’s lure, Newsweek will perhaps reemphasize its magazine’s core, its writing. If that is the case, we wish Newsweek success, just as we wish success to any publication—pixelated, on paper, or both—that esteems the words it writes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tuesday’s presidential debate yielded one of the more caricatured moments in the presidential race thus far. Katherine Fenton, a 24-year-old pre-kindergarten teacher from Floral Park, N.Y., asked, “In what new ways do you intend to rectify inequalities in the workplace? Specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn.” In his response, Mitt Romney said that “binders full of women” were integral to his hiring practices when he took office as governor of Massachusetts in 2002.
Romney’s focus on the composition of his staff eschewed Fenton’s question. Indeed, while President Obama responded by noting his support for the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and expanded Pell Grants, Fenton has lamented that neither candidate answered her question. Yet the former governor’s claim that he went to his staff and said, “well, gosh, can’t we—can’t we find some—some women that are also qualified?” is a gross simplification of the challenges facing women in the workforce.
That the “binders full of women” comment has gained cultural salience is undoubtedly a consequence of Romney’s response. Yet he reinforced his statement with a critique of the Obama administration: “In the—in the last four years, women have lost 580 thousand jobs. That’s the net of what’s happened in the last four years. We’re still down 580 thousand jobs. I mentioned three and a half million women more now in poverty than four years ago.” Despite his emphasis on job loss, Romney severely misapprehended the facts. Romney’s figure is a full six times the actual number of women that have lost work since Obama took office. Romney also points his finger at the wrong administration. While a disproportionate number of the job losses since the President’s term began have affected women, the recession took its deepest toll under George Bush. Between January 2008 and January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, 3.26 million men and 1.6 million women lost their jobs.
In fact, economic downturns have a far more nuanced effect on women. The male-dominated industries of construction, finance, and manufacturing are particularly vulnerable in volatile markets, and when these jobs are lost, women often unexpectedly assume the role of household breadwinner. Yet just as Fenton noted, these women often work for wages significantly less than those of their male counterparts. Furthermore, the cuts in government spending that define post-recession policies impact jobs in education, government, and healthcare, fields overwhelmingly populated by women. Of the 2.6 million jobs created since the end of the recession in 2009, 80 percent have gone to men, signaling that women struggle to re-enter the workforce.
Women are not simply struggling to be selected out of a group—or binder full—of qualified applicants for a job. Women outnumber men in the American workforce, but women still receive fewer promotions than men, are less likely to serve in executive positions, and face potentially compromising choices over maternity leave. To tackle these issues is not the preserve of cut-and-dry economic policy. Both Obama and Romney’s answers failed to confront the paradigm shift necessary to fully tackle the issues of work and gender that our nation faces.
Although Romney’s response advocated for more flexible work schedules, changes that promote enlightened notions of family balance and pay equality are beyond the purview of hiring practices. As the children of working mothers, we understand the importance of balancing family and career obligations. Yet a woman’s choice to or not to work has little bearing on her abilities as a mother. Rather, it is ensuring equality of opportunity, and access to contraception, education, family leave, healthcare, and wage equality for both women and men that will lead to a reinvention of our ideas on work and family.

One has to wonder if the members of Norwegian Nobel Committee purposely try to select the most unlikely recipients for the Nobel Peace Prize. I doubt a single person predicted that the European Union would win the award on October 12, and the reaction following the announcement was near-universal puzzlement. On Twitter—the forum that passes for public opinion these days—jokes about the award quickly circulated. One user suggested that the EU should win the Prize in Chemistry for its austerity experiments in Greece.
Maybe we should come to expect odd choices from Oslo. The reaction to this year’s award feels eerily similar to that of three years ago, when the prize went to a newly elected and barely-tried President Obama. The Nobel Peace Prize increasingly seems like less of a clearly defined concept and more of a random lottery, and that’s truly a shame. By continuously selecting unconventional winners for the Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee both tarnishes the prestige of this unique award and fails to inspire change in places where it is needed.
In all fairness, it would be hard to claim that this year’s prize went to an undeserving recipient. Alfred Nobel intended that the award go to the person or organization “who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” Europe certainly fits that description. Since the end of World War II, cooperation among European nations has transformed the continent from a landscape of recurring war to a place synonymous with peace and prosperity.
European merits aside, however, this year’s choice is still disquieting. By recognizing the long-term accomplishments of an entire continent, does the Nobel Committee make any difference in the world? With the EU in the grip of a crippling economic crisis that has pushed it to the brink of collapse, the award can be seen as a vote of confidence. However, it’s doubtful that a vote of confidence from a profoundly Eurosceptic country will affect the outcome of a situation dependent on economic forces of staggering magnitude.
Some might say that the point of the award is not to make a difference in the present world, but to recognize past achievements. Yet that misses the point entirely. The Nobel Prizes are often criticized for being too politicized, but peace, unlike literature or chemistry, is a fundamentally political concept. Whether the members of the deciding panel intend to make a political statement with the Peace Prize or not is irrelevant—the award will always be interpreted as such.
I, for one, find it absurd to think that one should recognize peace without actively promoting it. The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee should realize that they are quite possibly the most influential activists in the world. With their votes, they can bring attention to issues that desperately need a spotlight. It’s disappointing to see the ability to do good squandered, but it’s even more frustrating to watch it happen time and time again.
In 2006, the prize went to Muhammed Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, for his revolutionary innovations in microfinance that have helped millions escape poverty. A praiseworthy figure indeed, but how exactly did he help resolve any sort of conflict? The following year, the prize went to Al Gore ’69 and the International Panel on Climate Change for promoting awareness of, well, climate change. For two years in a row, the award had only the slightest conceptual link to peace. Then came Obama’s 2009 award, and now Europe gets the prize. Clearly, strange is now the norm in Norway.
Who, then, should win the prize? There are countless dissidents and activists around the world who put themselves in harm’s way for the sake of their convictions—people, for instance, like 2010’s recipient Liu Xiaobo, currently languishing in a Chinese jail cell for promoting human rights, or 1991’s honoree, Burmese dissident Aung San Suu Kyi. There are also many political actors that have genuinely made lasting contributions to world peace, like 2008’s recipient, Finnish diplomat Martti Ahtisaari, or 1987’s recipient, former Costa Rican President Óscar Arias Sánchez, who helped end a decade of war in Central America.
Clearly, the Nobel Peace Prize has never been intended for a specific category of individuals, nor should it be. Yet the spirit of the prize is threatened by choices that—as in the case of Al Gore—only marginally have to do with peace or that—as in the case of the EU—fail to encourage peace and merely celebrate it in a feeble manner. By announcing winners such as these, the Nobel committee casts itself in a doubtful light. And if next year we see a genuine winner, that person’s achievement will resonate a little less because we’ve become accustomed to greeting the committee’s announcement with skepticism, if not derision.

Harvard professors drew on lessons from the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, comparing that controversy with the current Iranian nuclear armament program in a panel discussion at the Institute of Politics Friday.
Panelists argued that the Cuban Missile Crisis could serve to guide policymakers’ thinking in handling relations with Iran today, pointing to the decision-making of President John F. Kennedy ’40 as an example of strong leadership.
During the 13-day confrontation with the Soviet Union over its placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, Kennedy, who was also a Crimson editor, refrained from attacking the island; panelists argued that this decision was a watershed moment that current world leaders should study with respect to Iran’s nuclear enrichment programs.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Graham T. Allison ’62, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, read aloud from a transcript of a private meeting at the White House that indicate that various advisers urged Kennedy to order a military strike on Cuba. “Had that choice been made 50 years ago,” Allison said, “we would not likely be here today.”
In the panel, Allison noted because the media was unaware of the crisis until Kennedy announced the situation to the country, Kennedy was able to make his decision without the distraction of other interests.
“The main lesson from Kennedy’s point of view [was that] nuclear powers must avert confrontations that bring an adversary to a binary choice between humiliating retreat and war,” Allison said.
Panelist R. Nicholas Burns, a professor at the Kennedy School, focused on the comparison between the Cuban Missile Crisis and the current controversy surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.
“I think that President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu need to answer the same question that President Kennedy had to answer,” Burns said. “What are we trying to achieve? Are we trying to achieve a total victory over our adversaries or are we trying to achieve a situation where we stop short of war and both sides can walk away with their pride intact and believing that some kind of compromise has been made that allows them to have a peaceful resolution?”
In an interview with The Crimson Burns said, “We’ve got to have an individual occupying the presidency who’s not just smart and successful and a good politician but who has good judgment and a keen understanding of history and an ability to have intellectual courage.”
Absent from the panel was the highly-anticipated Sergei N. Khrushchev, a professor at Brown University and the son of Nikita Khrushchev, Kennedy’s Soviet Union counterpart during the crisis. Khruschev was slated to speak at the panel but was unable to attend due to airport delays.

Voters cite global affairs, defense, Iran, and terrorism, as crucial factors that will influence their decision on election day, according to a nonpartisan poll conducted by Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs released on Friday.
Although the study confirmed that the economy tops the list of issues concerning voters, it indicated that national security is also a strong factor, ranking above taxes and only slightly below the federal deficit. The survey was conducted immediately following the first presidential debate over the span of five days from Oct. 3 to Oct. 7th, drawing on data collected from approximately 600 voters from each Ohio and Florida.
Half of the voters surveyed said they wanted the United States to pursue more active policy overseas, while the other half advocated that the United States engage in more isolationism. More than 40 percent of voters in both states said that they viewed the Arab Spring as “not good” for American interests. In particular, voters said they were concerned that ongoing conflicts could deteriorate into wars. Only a small fraction of voters expressed human rights or environmental concerns.
Although the survey determined that some American voters have a patchy knowledge of major international figures—more voters knew more about soccer player David R. J. Beckham than they did about British Prime Minister David W. D. Cameron—they showed an avid interest in foreign policy issues.
The voters surveyed said they follow foreign affairs almost as closely as they follow domestic news. They supported an increased focus on geography and foreign language in schools and wanted to see more international coverage in news sources. In future debates, voters said they hope to hear the candidates’ positions on various global security issues, including defense, Iran, and terrorism, among others.
In Ohio, the polls showed Obama with 46 percent, beating Romney, who trailed with only 38 percent. In Florida, the poll showed Romney with a slight edge of 47 percent to Obama’s 43 percent.

Friends and family mourned the passing of former professor Frank Moore Cross—a loving father, a wild mushroom and rhododendron enthusiast, and a great scholar of the Hebrew Bible.
The former Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages at the Harvard Divinity School passed away on Wednesday in Rochester, New York, at age 91.
“It really is the end of an era,” said Professor Peter Machinist ’66, a colleague and former student of Cross.
Cross is renowned for his contributions to the interpretation of the Dead Sea Scrolls­ and for serving as a dedicated and inspring mentor to many students over the years. Cross advised over 100 dissertations during his 35 years as a profesor at Harvard.
Cross began as an Assistant Professor at the Divinity School, and later received the Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages professorship at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a post he held until he retired in 1992. He also received an honorary degree from Harvard.
Machinist first encountered Cross 50 years ago during Machinist’s freshman fall at Harvard. After Machinist was “blown away” by one of Cross’s lectures at Harvard Hillel about the ancient bible, Machinist sought advice from Cross about the best way to pursue a teaching career in ancient history.
Machinist said that he tried to impress Cross, but mispronounced historical names and made a fool of himself.
“He corrected me gently,” Machinist said of Cross.
“People would always come to him to get his judgment because it was very exciting to be in his midst,” Machinist said. “He was a very rigorous man, and he communicated that sense of excitement.”
Like Machinist, many of the Divinity School faculty members are former students of Cross. Professor of Jewish Studies Jon D. Levenson ’71, who studied under Cross as a doctoral student, said he remembers him as a “scholar and gentleman, gifted interpreter of the Bible, but also a kind and compassionate gentleman.”
Although Cross was known for holding his students to high standards, students said he also instilled in them a sense of confidence.
“I always felt good about my own work around him,” Levenson said.
In addition to his studies, Cross cultivated interests in a diverse range of hobbies. Ellen C. Gindele, one of Cross’s three daughters, recalled how her father would go “mushroom hunting,” identifying and collecting mushrooms in the woods.
“Sometimes he would even do taste testing,” she said.
An avid outdoorsman, Cross often enjoyed hiking and backpacking in the Sierra Mountains and visiting national parks in the United States. In addition, he tended his own garden of orchids and rhododendrons.
“His everyday presence just had a wonderful warmth that just drew you in,” Gindele said. “I can’t imagine a better father.”

The banks of the Charles bustled with activity this weekend as Harvard hosted the 48th annual Head of the Charles Regatta, the world’s largest two-day rowing event.
As in the past, the regatta attracted students, families, tourists, and locals to enjoy the festivities and watch the races.
Worcester resident Caitlin Duggan said she attended to take advantage of the pleasant weather, while Boston local Lauren Ferrante dropped by to reminisce about her own rowing days. Cambridge citizen Amy Belford came out to cheer on members of her book club.
Eager spectators gathered in a variety of places to observe the races. Some paid a small admission fee to watch from Reunion Village, a series of tents situated on the Boston side of the river that included food and refreshments and play-by-play color commentary of the races. Others opted to watch from higher vantage points on the bridges, or from leisurely perches along the riverbank.
Visitors also spent their afternoons strolling down Memorial Drive, where vendors sold passers-by gyros, french fries, caramel apples, chowder in bread bowls, and soda pop in old-fashioned silver mugs. Several companies set up tents to distribute free samples, attracting long lines of tasters. Sabra offered free tastes of their hummus, Lightlife handed out free veggie burgers, and 5-Hour Energy distributed free bottles of its new Breast Cancer Awareness-themed drink—Pink Lemonade.
In anticipation of the hectic weekend and the influx of visitors, additional security measures were taken to ensure the safety of Harvard students. Many gates to Harvard Yard were locked Friday and Saturday nights, and entry to the Yard was restricted to individuals with a Harvard ID who were permitted a maximum of one guest.
“It was only a minor inconvenience,” said Matthew E. Lee ’16 of the heightened security measures. “The guards were courteous and didn’t take too long to check IDs.”
The regatta, which took nearly 3 months and over 1,400 volunteers to organize, has become a mainstay of the Harvard experience.
“The Head of the Charles Regatta quickly became one of my favorite parts of every fall semester after my freshman year,” said Shaira Bhanji ’14. “The scene of boats racing along the expansive Charles surrounded by beautiful autumn colors on both sides is picturesque, and the excitement is contagious.”
Nicole A. Golden ’16, member of the Women’s Novice Crew Team, also appreciated the excitement in the air this weekend.
“The electrifying atmosphere down by the river really [made] me look forward to the opportunity to race next year and to continue attending Regattas like this,” she said.

Ties flapping and heels clicking, students flocked to the Sheraton Commander Hotel and the Student Organization Center at Hilles to accumulate company brochures and chit-chat with career representatives at the Harvard Job & Internship Fair Friday.
Bringing together 85 companies, the annual fair spanned a variety of industries including biotech, engineering, finance, consulting, government, and education. According to Deborah A. Carroll, associate director for employer relations at the Office of Career Services, roughly 600 to 800 students attended the event.
This year’s fair also hosted several newcomers, including more start-ups than in the past. Bain Capital Ventures Startup Academy, another first-timer, offered games to attract students.
Fangzhou Yu ’14, who attended the fair to scope out potential internships for this summer, said he found the fair very helpful. “It’s nice to hold [these kinds] of events on campus,” he said.
While the fair was targeted toward seniors and juniors, some freshmen and sophomores also attended to learn more about post-graduation options. “I just wanted to see what the job and internship fair really is, but I’m not really looking for an internship,” Mark D. Grozen-Smith ’15 said.
Julian R. Keuerleber, a visiting student who is looking for a full-time job, said he would have preferred to meet employees of the companies that work in the specific divisions in which he has an interest, rather than general representatives.
Companies attend to the event after receiving an invitation from OCS or expressing interest in connecting with Harvard students. Students are also asked to create wish lists of firms they would like to see at the fair.

Health Leads CEO and Harvard alum Rebecca D. Onie ’98 was named 2012 recipient of the Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award for helping low-income patients establish healthy lifestyles.
Onie, who received $125,000 as part of the award, joins a group of activists such as Wendy Kopp, Gloria Steinem, and Billy Shor who have been awarded the Gleitsman Award in honor of their leadership in social activism. The award—which Onie received on October 18—is given by the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School
Health Leads is a volunteer-based program that enables doctors and healthcare providers to “prescribe” basic resources like food and heat just as they would medication, explained Dana Jessup, rirector of communications for Health Leads.
Health Leads recruits college students through a selective application process and trains them to “fill” these prescriptions by working alongside patients in 6 major cities to connect them with the basic resources they need.
Health Leads got its start in Boston when Onie was only a sophomore. Inspired by an internship in the housing unit of Greater Boston Legal Services, Onie became, “fixated on this connection between health and poverty.”
John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, House Master of Adams House and one of the first doctors to focus on the connection between basic needs and health, remembered how his patients had insufficient food, housing, jobs, education, and language, challenges that made it difficult for him to provide appropriate health support.
“What Rebecca said, which was so unique, was, ‘look we have an army of undergrad students who are very smart and very committed and who want to get hands on experience with people...How can we merge what the patients need, doctors need, hospitals need, with what the students wanted to do and could be trained to do,’” said Palfrey.
Onie said she hopes to refocus the health care community on promoting general wellness, rather than simply treating illness through the “sick-care system.”
“We need [a health care system] that will keep us healthy, not just one that will manage our disease when we have gotten sick” Onie said. Health Leads is helping to address this particular area in medicine, she added.
According to Onie, receiving the Gleitsman Award was a humbling experience.
“The award isn’t really for me per se, it’s for the thousands of college students around our campuses who have given a significant amount of time, and energy, and tenacity and passion to this organization,” said Onie. “The Gleitsman Award at its heart is about what it means when people get together and work on a cause they care about deeply. Having an award that recognizes that is really profound.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard scientists proposed a new model to explain the formation of the Moon in a study published this Wednesday in Science Magazine.
The professors presented analysis that could rationalize the “giant impact model,” which hypothesizes that the Moon formed from the coalescing of a disk of debris following the collision of a small Mars-sized celestial body and the early proto-Earth.
While earlier models contend that the Moon mainly consists of material from the other non-Earth object, recent geochemical studies suggest that the isotopic fingerprint of the Moon and the Earth are far too similar for the Moon to have formed from another body.
The new model, developed by Earth and Planetary Science professor Sarah T. Stewart-Mukhopadhyay and EPS post-doctoral fellow Matija Cuk, indicates that the Earth may have been rotating faster than previously thought—possibly fast enough for the impact to eject enough Earth material to create the Moon.
“We were looking through all these papers and identifying things that we thought would be the constraints we could remove,” said Stewart-Mukhopadhyay, who started working on the question two years ago.
They settled on one constraint, changing the speed of the rotation of the Earth, tweaking the model from a five-hour day to a two to three-hour day.
“The main thing was to throw out conventional thinking and go with the fast-spinning earth and see where it took us,” Stewart-Mukhopadhyay said. “No one else had ever considered [this] case, and they weren’t allowed to because angular momentum would not be conserved to today.”
In their paper, the two said that the gravitational interactions of the Earth’s and the Moon’s orbits can slow the planet’s rotation faster than previously believed. “It was very embarrassing that we didn’t have a single working theory of how the Moon formed, and now we do,” Stewart-Mukhopadhyay pointed out.
Stewart-Mukhopadhyay and Cuk’s work could have significant implications for the field. “If we knew what forces had to work for this to work out, we can maybe reverse engineer,” Cuk said.
Understanding these forces can help scientists understand the processes that shaped early Earth, Stewart-Mukhopadhyay said. This research will also establish a foundation for understanding planet formation in general.
Other scientists are already building on Stewart-Mukhopadhyay and Cuk’s model, which Cuk said will require much more research to refine.
“The other thing that we didn’t do that people should be doing is forming the Moon from the disk,” Cuk said. “My simulation starts thousands of years later and assumes the Moon has already formed—we’re missing the middle.”

Stopping or reversing climate change can be achieved with significantly reduced side effects if solar radiation management efforts are optimized for the different seasons and latitudes, according to a new study by a team of researchers at Harvard University, the California Institute of Technology, and the Carnegie Institution for Science.
The study, which will be published in the November issue of Nature Climate Change, examines how tailoring radiative forcing, the change of the radiation balance of the Earth, can improve the efficiency of geoengineering—the use of large-scale interventions to moderate climate change. These interventions can range from carbon dioxide removal to iron fertilization of the oceans.
According to study co-author and Applied Physics Professor David Keith, solar engineering—putting aerosols in the stratosphere to reflect incoming sunlight back into space—is “the most credible idea in the near future.”
“In principle there is an infinite number of dimensions you could twist. You could control which season the radiative forcing is applied in,” said Keith. “You could have a layer of aerosol that is denser in the summer.”
The study showed that the melting of sea ice could be stopped with two to three times less radiative forcing if it is tuned specifically.
“People have done this crudely before, non-optimally, but this is first paper that tried to explicitly tune this effect. What we’ve shown is that we can tune it a lot,” Keith said.
The technology for solar geoengineering already exists, but countries must decide whether to implement it.
“[Solar geoengineering] is technically possible—whether that is a good thing to do or politically realistic is another thing,” said Keith. The biggest concern regarding the technology, he continued, is that people will cease trying to cut carbon dioxide emissions.
“The biggest risks are the unknown unknowns,” he continued. “There are lots of examples in history when interventions like this didn’t work out.”
According to Keith, it is physically impossible to stop or reverse warming in the article without geoengineering. Cutting emissions can only reduce the future contributions to global warming.
Countries hesitate to take action, however, because the effects of climate change are not uniform across the globe, and wealthy nations tend to be less vulnerable to the most deletrious results of global warming.
“We spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on agriculture so even if you double the cost [due to global warming] you’re hardly going to notice it,” he said.
Keith said he hopes that there will be serious efforts by all countries to cut emissions and to invest in geoengineering in an effort to help protect the natural world and the poorest nations.

This December, Harvard student-run service publication Seva will release its first e-issue.
Seva, which is derived from the Hindi word for service, is a six-year-old student magazine typically featuring articles written by Harvard students about their experiences volunteering abroad.
Although Seva has produced a physical magazine for the last six years, their December 2012 issue will be the first time the magazine is released exclusively online. According to Editors-in-Chief Chelsea F. Carlson ’13 and Lynn Shi ’13, the deciding factor was efficiency.
“It’s easier for people to access, it’s greener, and it’s cheaper,” said Carlson.
Carlson adds that “the website will allow future boards room to grow” and that the organization may develop a volunteering blog in the future.
The December edition of Seva will feature profiles of students’ experiences abroad, explaining how they discovered those opportunities, and offering advice for how readers can do the same.
According to Carlson, the online format has generated much interest, and many students have expressed a desire to share their experiences through the new medium.
Seva distinguishes itself from the Study Abroad catalogues distributed by the college yearly because, according to Carlson and Shi, part of the organization’s objective is to facilitate deeper discussions about what it means to live abroad and engage in meaningful service.
According to Carlson and Shi, the magazine seeks to “expand Harvard students’ horizons and help them to think in complex ways about what it means to do service abroad and how they can use their experiences to impact what they do here at Harvard.”
“For me, I’m white, 21 years old, coming from Harvard with an elite education,” Carlson said. “I want students to think about how service affects their studies, career and doing service in the future.”

“I wrote this poem immediately post-sex,” said Yazmin Monet Watkins, spinning playfully in a circle at the front of the room. “I don’t feel the need to dance around the issue. We’re talking about sex here.”
Watkins, a queer spoken word poet, launched Harvard’s second annual Sex Week by sharing several poems with an audience of 60 students Sunday evening. Touching on a range of topics from discovering sexuality to religion to sexual violence, Watkins made the crowd laugh, clap, and snap their fingers in approval.
“I really enjoy being able to share my erotic poems,” Watkins said. “Most of the events I speak at aren’t sex-centered, so I really love this chance.”
Members of Sexual Health Education and Advocacy throughout Harvard College, the group that organizes Sex Week, said that this opening event was a great way to set the stage for the days ahead.
“I thought that Yazmin was awesome,” Julia B. Hyman ’15 said. “I think that if the week had to start with something, this event was it.”
SHEATH co-president Martha R. Farlow ’13 said that Director of BGLTQ Student Life Van Bailey recommended Watkins highly and worked with SHEATH to arrange Watkins’ presentation.
“We thought that Yazmin could reach a lot of people in different ways,” Farlow said. “She’s young and she can really connect with an audience emotionally.”
At the event, audience members were treated to SHEATH’s infamous vagina cupcakes. In addition, seventeen students also won prizes of Sex Week t-shirts or vibrators.
SHEATH members said that Sex Week, which was first introduced to Harvard seven months ago, is meant to promote dialogue on campus about sex and related topics. Though the first Sex Week occurred last March, co-president Hazel A. Lever ’13 said that moving Sex Week to the fall was both a convenient and strategic move.
“We wanted to get a headstart and get people while they’re fresh,” she said.
Weeks of preparation went into planning events taking place over the next few days, including acquiring thousands of condoms to give away.
“I think we have more condoms than Harvard students can use in a year,” Farlow said.
Events will include a sex education workshop specifically targeted at freshmen, a conversation on faith, sex, and love, a talk by Dr. Elizabeth Reis about genital cosmetic surgery, and a sexual assault policy panel, among others. The events are meant to appeal to a variety of populations, providing information for both the uninitiated and experienced students.
Students at the opening event said they are particularly excited about the session called “The Female Orgasm and All Things Penis,” which will be hosted by sexologist Jill McDevitt.

CORRECTION: Oct. 22
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the annual Female Orgasm Seminar had been renamed “The Female Orgasm and All Things Penis.” In fact, the session on orgasms and penises which will take place this week is a separate event from the Female Orgasm Seminar, which will be held in the spring.

The Harvard men’s soccer fought back on Saturday to force overtime for the seventh time this season but was not able to hold on in the extra period as the Crimson fell in double-overtime at Princeton.
The Crimson (2-8-3, 0-3-1 Ivy) was able to counter a late goal by the Tigers (6-5-2, 2-0-2) to extend the contest, but Princeton sophomore midfielder Alex Wettermann converted a loose ball in the box to seal the Tiger victory early in the second overtime period.
“We were under a ton of pressure from them getting balls in the box, but we had dealt with them very well throughout the game,” sophomore midfielder Tim Schmoll said. “That goal was the first time the ball hit the ground on a set piece, and it was kind of a scramble.”
Harvard’s defense held strong in the first period of overtime—the Tigers went without a shot—but failed to prevent Wettermann from taking advantage of a loose ball off a throw-in. Wetterman beat freshman goalkeeper Evan Mendez, dealing the Crimson its third straight loss in Ivy League play.
Mendez finished with six saves and two goals allowed in the contest.
The team was frustrated with the result, believing that the final score did not reflect the level of play throughout the game.
“It was their homecoming weekend, and they had a big crowd behind them,” sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi said. “But I think we had more goal-scoring opportunities and played better.”
The Crimson showcased its offensive and defensive abilities and was able to hold off strong set pieces by Princeton for most of the game. Despite being outmatched in possession, Harvard was effective in creating chances when it got the ball.
“We had times when we were putting a lot of pressure on them,” Schmoll said. “They also definitely had times, admittedly, where they were getting the ball repeatedly into our box and forcing us to defend, which we did very successfully. They had a lot of possession, but they weren’t creating clear-cut chances like we were.”
The Crimson’s ability to execute offensively became critical late in the second half after Princeton defender Mark Linnville scored on a long arcing shot that evaded Mendez and put Princeton up, 1-0.
But the Tigers’ lead was short lived.
Just two minutes after Princeton’s goal, senior forward Zack Wolfenzon tied the game, rebounding a shot from sophomore midfielder Matt Sheeleigh and beating Tigers’ goalie Seth MacMillan.
“That [goal] showed our mentality—that we really wanted to win,” Kobayashi said.
“We are very confident in our fitness and our ability to play the ball in behind other teams’ defenses,” Schmoll added. “We are very confident in our attacking plays and formation. We were really successful at times.”
But Wolfenzon was the only player to beat MacMillan, who finished with five saves.
Offensively, Harvard was outmatched in both shots and corner kicks, but the team managed to create scoring chances and ended the night with six shots on goal from six different players.
After failing to score in four of its first eight contests, the Crimson has had more success offensively, finding the back of the net in five straight games.
“The performance in itself was good,” Schmoll said. “We are getting better and better each game, but we let games slip away in the last minute.”
Harvard has reached overtime in five of its last six games, and seven times on the year, going, 1-3-3. The Crimson is looking to put games away early and avoid the high-pressure situation it often faces—a tied game with minutes or seconds left on the clock. The team will continue to focus on creating and capitalizing on offensive opportunities.
“[Overtime] comes from us scoring a goal and not scoring the second goal,” Kobayahi said. “We need someone to step up and score the second goal for us because that is what decides the game.”
With the loss, Harvard remains in seventh place in the Ivy League. Despite the standings, the team is looking forward to the rest of the season.
“Nothing changes in terms of the way we are going to treat the games,” Schmoll said. “There is no point in letting our heads down.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its trip to the Big Apple on Saturday, the Harvard men’s water polo team came up fruitless.
The Crimson (12-14, 4-3 CWPA) traveled to New York to take on St. Francis (9-8, 3-2) and Mercyhurst (16-5, 10-0) for its final two games of the regular season, falling just short in both matches.
Harvard started its day against St. Francis, which capitalized on the Crimson’s slow start to claim the victory, 14-9. In its second game against Mercyhurst, Harvard surrendered a late lead and fell to the Lakers, 11-10, in a dramatic finish.
With four players out due to injury, the Crimson starters were unable to receive their typical rest.
“Playing with four guys down makes it a lot tougher to keep up,” freshman attacker Noah Harrison said. “Our energy was down during the second game, and I felt like this influenced the outcome of our game.”
Despite the disappointing weekend, Harvard coach Ted Minnis was pleased with the games, considering the circumstances.
“The whole team rallied around each other and battled for eight bursts [Saturday],” Minnis said. “Our guys played really well—we just didn’t catch some breaks down the stretch.”
Although the Crimson has now dropped its last nine games, Minnis is not overly concerned with the team’s performance heading into the postseason.
“I think if you look at it… we lost to probably five top-20 teams, three of which were [in the] top 10,” Minnis said. “We’ve played a very tough schedule, and I think we’re doing some good things and getting better. We’re just going to keep playing Harvard water polo.”
MERCYHURST 11, HARVARD 10
Harvard finished its regular season with a nailbiter—the Crimson went into the final three minutes leading the Lakers, 10-8, but a late run by Mercyhurst proved costly for Harvard.
With two minutes left, the Lakers pulled within one off of a score from Mercyhurst junior utility Garret Schoeman.
Just a minute later, Schoeman struck again, converting a penalty shot from Laker junior utility Isaac Ogloblin into a Mercyhurst score to tie up the contest at 10 apiece. The duo teamed up once more to score the game-winner with 12 seconds left to play.
Fatigue, according to Harrsion, was a central problem late in the second game of the day for the Crimson.
“We came out with intensity during the St. Francis game, and we were lacking some of that intensity during the Mercyhurst game,” Harrison said. “We probably had about an hour of rest to actually lay low and relax before the [Mercyhurst] game. We don’t have the [greatest] amount of [substitutes] in the world, so our guys got tired.”
The teams matched each other goal-for-goal throughout the beginning of the game, but even strong performances by freshman attacker Blake Lee and sophomore utility Max Murphy and a solid defensive effort by freshman goalie Colin Woolway could not yield a victory. Lee and Murphy scored four goals apiece, while Woolway recorded 19 saves, a career high.
ST. FRANCIS 14, HARVARD 9
Although freshman 2-meter Ben Zepfel and sophomore 2-meter John Holland-McCowan combined for the first two goals of the third quarter to bring Harvard within striking distance, St. Francis’s early lead and consistent play proved insurmountable.
After the Crimson’s two scores to open the third, the Terriers connected before the end of the period and scored five of the game’s eight  fourth-quarter goals to seal their victory.
“They jumped on us early, and we battled back,” Minnis said. “We got it back to two in the middle of the third, but we had some defensive breakdowns, and they scored some goals, so...they capitalized on [our mistakes].”
St. Francis senior attacker Marko Gencic opened the Terriers’ Senior Day with a goal two minutes into the game, burying the ball cross-cage past junior goalie Jimmy Field.
Harvard was unable to get anything started offensively early in the game, and St. Francis, led by junior center Bosko Stankovic, took advantage by jumping out to an early 3-0 lead, which it never relinquished.
“I think that it was kind of a learning experience for us,” Field said. “We’ll definitely focus on defense and keeping the intensity up overall.”
Zepfel, Holland-McCowan, Lee, and junior attacker Will Roller led the Crimson’s offense, each scoring two goals.
With its win against Harvard, the Terriers grabbed the second-place spot in the CWPA North Division.

After 75 holes and four matches, Harvard and Brown remained deadlocked, and a late match rally had provided junior captain Theo Lederhausen a chance to advance his team into the tournament’s semifinals.
But a strong tee shot by Lederhausen’s opponent on the 18th propelled the Bears to a 3-2 victory in the weekend’s opening round of Ivy League match play at the TPC Jasna Polana in Princeton, N.J.
This final hole was one of several missed opportunities for the Crimson, which ended up 1-2 on the weekend.
In the team’s final tournament of the fall, Harvard followed the defeat with an equally close 3-2 loss against Cornell in a consolation round before defeating a composite team of players from several Ivy League squads.
Host Princeton defeated Dartmouth, 3-1-1, in the tournament’s final.
Despite setbacks and losses, Lederhausen is pleased with what he has seen from the team this fall.
“The results weren’t what we would have liked for the weekend, but we played well today,” Lederhausen said after Sunday’s rounds. “Overall, we’ve learned that we definitely have a very deep team. We have seven guys who can all compete, which has been great to see. Everyone’s stepped up at different times.”
With its fourth and final tournament of the fall season completed, Harvard will resume play in March. By then, Harvard hopes to be at full strength. A wrist injury prevented key junior Seiji Liu from competing at Princeton, and freshman Rohan Ramnath made his debut for the Crimson this weekend, playing through stubborn back problems.
Still searching for its first Ivy League championship since 1975, the Crimson’s fall has provided the team with opportunities to feel the pressure of competition in close matches.
With three out of its four tournaments coming down to the wire in either the final day of stroke play or on the final holes of match play, the Crimson’s relatively young squad will look to use this experience in the upcoming championship season.
HARVARD 4, COMPOSITE TEAM 1
The Crimson concluded the weekend on Sunday afternoon with a 4-1 win over a composite team comprised of players from Brown, Penn, Princeton, Harvard, and Yale.
The Crimson’s round three consolation game included a hard-fought intra-squad match between No. 3 Ramnath and junior Kevin McCarthy, who went 0-2-1 overall as a member of the composite team throughout the weekend. Ramnath clinched the match after the 17th hole for a 2&1 win.
Lederhausen, Harvard’s No. 1 for the tournament, defeated Yale’s Thomas Greenhalgh, 6&5, while sophomore No. 2 Akash Mirchandani lost, one up, to Matt Gerber of Princeton.
Freshman No. 4 Un Cho and junior No. 5 Michael Lai defeated Penn’s Patrick O’Leary (6&5) and Brown’s Jack Mylott (5&4), respectively.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 2
After losing to Brown, the Crimson faced off against the Big Red in the consolation semifinal. Two matches went to extra holes, as Cornell edged out Harvard, 3-2, to advance to the consolation final.
Lederhausen defeated Cornell’s Carl Schimenti in 20 holes, but a 24-hole victory by the Big Red’s Zack Bosse over Cho proved decisive.
Lai and Mirchandani also lost matches, 3&2 and 2&1, respectively, while Ramnath defeated Cornell’s Max Koehler, 2&1.
Round two began Saturday afternoon, but darkness forced officials to suspend play until Sunday morning.
BROWN 3, HARVARD 2
Round one came down to the final hole as the Crimson fell to Brown in a nailbiter Saturday.
Lederhausen overcame a two-hole deficit with three holes to go, drawing square with the Bears’ Nelson Hargrove after the 17th. But Hargrove topped Lederhausen on the 18th to seal a narrow 3-2 victory for Brown.
“[Lederhausen] put up a really good fight,” Cho said.
In the first match-play style tournament of the year, Lederhausen appreciated the opportunities to perform under pressure.
“It was great to get a lot of matches come down to the wire,” Lederhausen said. “I learned a lot from the matches I had which went to the end.”
Also in the first round, Brown’s Justin Miller and Peter Callas scored victories against Lai (6&5) and Mirchandani (5&4), respectively. Cho won his match over J.D. Ardell, 3&2, while Ramnath defeated Jack Wilson, 4&3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the Harvard men’s lightweight and heavyweight crews turned in strong performances over the weekend in their first home races of the season at the Head of the Charles Regatta.
An overturned violation left Harvard in second place in the men’s championship eights, while the men’s lightweight eights registered a big victory over the crew that edged them out a year ago, USRowing.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
A buoy violation in the men’s championship eight race on Sunday originally added 10 seconds to Washington’s time, resulting in the Harvard heavyweights being temporarily declared the winners of the race.
But hours after the competition, the penalty was reversed, putting Harvard in second place.
Despite a crash with USRowing eight before the Eliot Bridge, the Huskies finished the three-mile course in 14:37, outpacing Harvard’s time of 14:42. Cal Berkeley finished third, nearly five seconds behind the Crimson.
“Washington rowed a great race and were the victim of an unfortunate crash, but that’s the nature of the race,” said senior six-seat Josh Hicks.
The Huskies, the third boat to start, began to gain on USRowing, the second to start, but the national squad did not yield to the Huskies, and the two boats collided.
“I was sitting in stroke seat, so I could see it all unfold,” senior James O’Connor said. “[There was] angry yelling coming from the Washington crew.... It was quite funny to watch.”
USRowing, another predicted contender for victory, was docked a full three minutes for yielding infractions, causing them to finish last in a field of 28 boats.
The Tideway Scullers, composed entirely of Olympic sculling competitors, and Princeton rounded out the top five.
“The Tideway guys are off their peak from the Olympics and [they’ve had] a little bit of time off,” O’Connor said. “It was really cool today that we beat those crews. I think we all understand that those guys are incredible athletes.”
The first freshman boat also competed in the championship eight race, taking 19th place.
The third Harvard entry came in 25th with a time of 16:06. On Saturday, the two Harvard boats that competed in the club eight race took sixth and tenth places, respectively.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
By the time the Harvard 1V lightweights reached the Riverside Boat Club, the crew already held over a half-second  lead on the USRowing eight, the team that Harvard fell to at last year’s Head of the Charles Regatta.
From that point on, the Crimson only extended its lead, ultimately finishing 12 seconds ahead with a time of 14:35.
“[It was] a huge win for the team,” said junior seven-seat Michael Wales. “We packed it in around the big turn, and burned down the last 500.”
By the time the crews had reached the Cambridge Boat Club, Harvard held nearly nine seconds on the USRowing eight. While the national team maintained a fast and strong stroke rate, the Crimson’s steady pace allowed it to keep increasing the size of its lead.
Princeton came in third place behind Harvard and USRowing with a time of 14:58, over three boat lengths behind the Crimson.
“It was a great piece—really aggressive and a big win for our program,” said senior three-seat Erich Schultze. “We know how tough the league we’re in is, though. If we’re still this same speed come March, they’ll make us pay. We’ve got to build off this and keep getting faster.”
Harvard’s second varsity lightweight boat also competed in the race, finishing in 13th place with a time of 15:29.
During Saturday’s club eight race, the first freshman lightweight eight finished in 12th place, two spots behind the second freshman heavyweight eight. The lightweight club four finished in the middle of the pack of 55 competitors in 26th place.
“We expect nothing but our best every day, and we showed that this afternoon,” said senior Austin Meyer, four seat of the first varsity eight. “It’s a great beginning to our year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Racing against stiff competition at the world’s largest two-day regatta, Radcliffe crew not only held its own, but took home its first varsity lightweight eights victory at the event in program history.
Following a solid performance two weeks ago at the Head of the Housatonic, the Black and White rowed against boats from around the world on its home course at the Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend.
The heavyweights entered two crews in the championship eights on Sunday, placing seventh and 20th.
On the first day of the regatta, the Black and White entered a boat in the club eights, which took 10th.
Finishing behind Radcliffe’s victorious 1V boat, another lightweight boat placed seventh, while the lightweight fours finished in 13th place.
“Especially since it’s our home course, it brings a whole new level of comfort because you know where you are, you know how much you have left to go,” heavyweight captain Mary Maginnis said. “It’s a huge advantage. It makes the regatta that much more fun.”
For the Radcliffe seniors rowing in the Head of the Charles for their final time with the Black and White, the event was a special one.
“I always say it’s Christmas for rowers,” Maginnis said. “I’ve been rowing here since my sophomore year of high school, so this is my seventh Head of the Charles. It was always a really special regatta for us; it’s always been sort of like, ‘find out where you stand; find out what you need to do, where you need to be’… so it’s probably my favorite regatta.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
In a field of 40 boats that included crews from the London Olympics, the Black and White 1V boat rowed into seventh place overall for Radcliffe’s best finish. The Black and White placed third out of all the collegiate crews, trailing Virginia and Princeton.
The top Radcliffe crew finished with a time of 17:06.15, one second ahead of a Canadian silver-medal winning crew from London. The Black and White 2V boat finished in 17:40.10, placing 20th overall.
About halfway through the race, the USRowing entry that contained past Olympians, including two Radcliffe alumnae, caught up with the 1V boat as the crews maneuvered the Eliot turn.
“Today’s race was definitely a highlight of my entire rowing career,” Maginnis said. “That was just so incredible, being able to row next to [the USRowing crew]; even though they were passing us, we were able to hold them off at points. It was just an amazing experience to row with some legendary women…so that was really exciting.”
Although the USRowing crew finished well ahead of the Black and White, Radcliffe put up a strong fight to the finish.
“The US eight just went right through Yale and Michigan, and then caught up by us, which we anticipated would happen, but we hung in there with them,” O’Leary said. “Clearly, they were significantly faster than we were…and they certainly went by us, [but] we fought hard to make it as hard as we could for them to get by us.”
The USRowing crew cruised to victory, finishing the three-mile course in 16:13.49, while UVA was the top collegiate crew with a time of 17:00.12.
In the club eights race, Yale, finishing the race in 16:49.64, took home the victory, while the Black and White entry rowed the Charles in 17:54.58 to take 10th.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Under a strong headwind on Sunday, the 1V Radcliffe lightweight crew surged to victory with a time of 16:58:83 ahead of Wisconsin in the lightweight eights race.
“I remember my freshman year [at Head of the Charles], I think Wisconsin had the entire field beat by about a minute, so it’s really exciting to see how things have changed since my freshman year.” lightweights captain Veronique Irwin said. “I think our team’s just come a long way and it’s fantastic.”
The 2V finished in 18:09.22, placing seventh in a field of seven boats.
“We were the only 2V [entered in the lightweight eights],” Irwin said. “We did finish last, but I think we had a really solid performance against all the other 1V boats in the field. I think that was a really great race for us despite the finished order.”
The Black and Weight also had an entry in the lightweight fours, which placed 13th with a time of 21:17.73, while Western University claimed the victory, rowing the course in 19:01.39.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The result did not matter, but it’s hard to imagine a better outcome for the Harvard men’s hockey team’s game against McGill on Friday night at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson, coming off an appearance in the ECAC championship game last season, won its first exhibition game of the year, 5-1, over its Canadian opponents.
Harvard scored three goals in the first period to jump out to a commanding 3-0 lead. Senior Luke Greiner, who scored nine times last season, put the first one in the back of the net with a one-timer less than six minutes into the contest. Greiner added a second goal with the Crimson a man down in the second period.
But the story of the night for the Crimson was the performance of its highly touted freshman class. Less than two minutes after Greiner’s goal, rookies Desmond Bergin and Brayden Jaw put away the first goals of their respective Harvard careers. Bergin scored off assists from Conor Morrison and Max Everson with a thunderous shot from the blue line, and just 25 seconds later, Jaw scored off a tip from sophomore Petr Placek. Crimson Goaltender Raphael Girard allowed a score nine minutes into the first period, but the junior didn’t allow another, stopping 17 shots as the Crimson outshot its opponents 34-18.
Harvard was playing its first game without All-American forward Alex Killorn ’12, who led the Crimson in goals a year ago and is currently playing in the American Hockey League with the Syracuse Crunch, an affiliate of the NHL’s Tampa Bay Lightning.
But the performance of the Crimson’s rookies on Friday eased fears of replacing Killorn and his 53 career goals.
Harvard returns to the ice on Oct. 27 to take on Bentley at home in the season opener.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—Just over 15 minutes into its game at Princeton Saturday, the Harvard football team was doing exactly what it had done in each of its Ancient Eight matchups over the past 700 days—simply dominating.
Senior quarterback Colton Chapple had just thrown his third touchdown of the contest to put Harvard up, 20-0. The Crimson offensive machine looked flawless, just as it had through its first five contests, when it scored more points than any Harvard team through that point since 1892. The Crimson was well on its way to its Division I-leading 15th straight win, and a game that was supposed to be well-contested simply wasn’t.
But senior kicker David Mothander’s ensuing extra point attempt was blocked, setting in motion a series of Crimson (5-1, 2-1 Ivy) miscues that would help result in Princeton (4-2, 3-0) pulling off a stunning 39-34 comeback victory that gives it control of the Ivy title race with four weeks to go.
“We just made too many mistakes,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “You can see them on offense, you can see them on defense, and you can see them on special teams.”
One such blunder came on Harvard’s next possession when following a 19-yard rush to the Princeton 25, senior running back Treavor Scales was stripped by the Tigers' Phillip Bhaya and fumbled for the first time all season as the Tigers recovered along the sideline.
But after a Princeton punt, Chapple led a 77-yard drive and had the Crimson set up once more to go ahead, 27-0, with a first-and-goal from the two. The senior ran it in himself on the ensuing play to do just that, but classmate John Collins was called for a holding penalty, pushing Harvard back 10 yards. On third down, Chapple threw up a lob towards a double-covered Cameron Brate that was intercepted by Princeton's Mande Sheaffer, and what had been six points had turned into zero.
Following a Tigers three-and-out, Chapple went right back to work with 1:18 to go in the half. But a 27-yard strike down to the Princeton three to junior Andrew Berg down was wiped out on an offensive pass interference call that pushed Harvard out of field goal range and cost the team another great chance to score before the break. For the third consecutive possession, the Crimson had failed to score on a drive in which it had the ball inside the Tigers 30.
None of that seemed like it would matter as the two teams headed to the locker rooms. In the first half, the Crimson had outgained Princeton—which entered the game with the second-ranked defense in the FCS—415 yards to 51, had 21 first downs to the Tigers’ four, and most importantly, still held a 20-point lead.
But ever so slowly, the momentum started to swing towards the home team as the Crimson continued to make mistake after mistake.
After the Tigers opened the second half with an 86-yard touchdown drive, freshman Paul Stanton dropped the ball on the ensuing kickoff. Instead of diving on it to secure possession, Stanton tried to pick it up and run, but the rookie was unable to get a good grasp on the pigskin. Jakobi Johnson recovered at the Tigers four, leading to a Princeton field goal.
Chapple responded by leading back-to-back scoring drives, as touchdown passes to Juszczyk and Brate put Harvard up, 34-10. Things had stabilized once more, and with 13 minutes to go in the game, the Crimson looked well on its way to an impressive win.
Princeton’s Connor Michelsen led the Tigers down to the Harvard seven on their ensuing drive but threw a poor pass on first-and-goal that went right through the hands of senior linebacker Alexander Norman, who likely would have been able to return an interception to the house.
Instead, the Tigers took advantage of Norman’s drop by scoring on the next play and adding a two-point conversion to cut the Crimson lead to 34-18.
On the next Harvard series, senior Jacob Dombrowski’s punt was blocked, and within five plays, the Tigers had scored eight more to cut the deficit to a single possession.
Chapple brought Harvard back down to the Princeton five, putting his team on the doorstep of a game-clinching score. But three successive running plays went nowhere, and after blocking an extra point and a punt, the Tigers this time got their hands on a 22-yard Mothander field goal attempt to keep the Crimson off the board.
Up two with time winding down on its next drive, Harvard came up one yard short of what would have been its 34th first down on Juszczyk's 15th reception—second-best in team history—and was forced to give the ball back to the Tigers.
It was on Princeton's final drive on which the most costly Harvard miscues came.
The Tigers had a first down at their own 37 when backup quarterback Quinn Epperly—who had replaced an injured Michelsen—was sacked, ticking precious seconds off the clock. But senior John Lyon was called for an excessive celebration penalty, turning a 2nd-and-17 at the Princeton 30 into a 1st-and-10 at the Tigers 45.
Two plays later, Epperly made a poor read, throwing the ball directly at junior safety Chris Splinter. But the safety could not hold on to what would have been a game-ending interception for the second time in the contest, and after failing to put the game away again, the Crimson soon learned that Splinter’s drop would be the straw that finally broke the camel’s back.
Within seconds, Epperly had found Roman Wilson on a 39-yard fade to the back corner of the end zone, giving Princeton its fourth touchdown in 11 minutes and its 29th unanswered point to clinch the upset and leave the Crimson stunned.
The Tigers had won a match in which it had given up 634 yards of offense, thanks in large part to three Crimson turnovers and 12 Harvard penalties, compared to just five for Princeton.
Harvard, meanwhile, had lost a contest in which its quarterback broke the all-time Crimson passing record with 448 yards and tied the all-time record with five touchdowns, in which Scales eclipsed 100 yards on the ground, and in which Jusczcyk, Brate, and Berg all registered over 100 through the air.
The contest followed a similar script to last year’s game between the two teams, when Harvard went up 26 before a dramatic Tigers second-half rally cut the Crimson lead to 42-39. But last season, Harvard answered back with two touchdowns to put the game away and keep its undefeated league season rolling. This year, a much-improved Princeton squad was able to finish the comeback and take first place for itself.
“[Harvard is] probably the better team,” Princeton coach Bob Surace said. “But we got some breaks, and we’re very fortunate.... I’m glad we didn’t play them in a seven-game series, but it’s every given Sunday—or Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past year and a half or so, no school has tormented Harvard sports quite like the Princeton Tigers.
Doug Davis hitting that are-you-kidding-me shot with 2.8 seconds left in the one-game playoff to end the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 2011 Tournament chances. That 70-62 victory to finish the team’s stretch in the top 25 last season.
And now, this.
Down 20-0 at halftime, the Princeton football team completed a stunning, jaw-dropping, mouth-wide-open-and-hands-on-your-head comeback to pull off a giant 39-34 upset over the Crimson.
In doing so, the longest winning streak in Division I football came to an abrupt and climactic end.
That magical run that began over a year ago on a rainy Friday night at Harvard Stadium with a 24-7 victory over Brown, brought the Crimson to the pinnacle of Ivy League play, saw Harvard break its program modern-era points record, unraveled in a matter of minutes. A streak over a year in the making disintegrated in a single fourth quarter.
The whole ordeal on Saturday seemed strangely out of place. It was the villain finally getting the best of Bond, the Jordan buzzer-beater clanking out. Things that just aren’t supposed to happen.
But of course, all streaks have to end eventually. And with the end of this one, all thoughts of a perfect season, all comparisons to that undefeated 2004 team led by Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and Co., went the way of the Hindenburg.
But for Crimson fans, it’s an even tougher fate to swallow for one simple reason: Harvard, unquestionably, should have won this game.
When your quarterback—senior Colton Chapple—throws for 448 yards and five touchdowns, breaking one program record and tying another, you shouldn’t lose.
When one receiver alone—senior Kyle Juszczyk—has three touchdowns and nearly 200 yards on 15 receptions, you shouldn’t lose.
When at halftime, you have a 20-point lead and have held the opposition to 51 total yards while tallying 415 of your own, you shouldn’t lose.
And when you have a 16-point edge with 11 minutes left and the other team’s fans are leaving, abandoning the game as a lost cause, you definitely shouldn’t lose.
Worse yet, the Crimson was the better team, plain and simple. Even Princeton coach Bob Surace acknowledged that.
“They’re the best team in the league by far, and we had a few good breaks go our way....There’s a reason they won 14 in a row,” Surace said.
But in the end, costly mistake after mistake after mistake ultimately cost the team a chance at elusive number 15. If any one of those, it seemed, had been corrected, had gone in the Crimson’s favor, then that winning streak might still be alive and well. One fewer dropped pick, one fewer excessive celebration penalty, one fewer this or that, and who knows.
Yes, this was a game that left Harvard fans with more “what ifs” than a Michael Sandel lecture.
And it all came to a head in that fateful fourth quarter, when the Tigers reeled off those 29 unanswered points—more points than Harvard has ever allowed in program in the final frame in program history—and everything unwound in a stunning and epic collapse.
It wasn’t only those mistakes, though, that allowed for such a remarkable comeback. After allowing only 51 passing yards in the first half, the Crimson secondary struggled mightily in the second two quarters. This wasn’t the unit that shut down Cornell’s mighty attack; it wasn’t the group that gave up 23 points in its previous three contests.
After a strong first half, the secondary gave up a whopping 241 passing yards in the second. By comparison, entering the contest, the Tigers averaged just 163 yards through the air each game.
Even worse: In the fourth quarter, Princeton threw four touchdowns. Coming into Saturday’s game, the Tigers had thrown for just three all season long, and Harvard had allowed just five.
But for some reason, once more, Princeton had Harvard’s number. For the two years prior, the otherwise-anemic Tigers offense had put up more points against the Crimson than any other league competitor. And that trend continued on Saturday—a weak Princeton offense shined against Harvard—but this time, unlike the past two years, it was the Tigers who came away with the ‘W’.
And now, after its first loss since early in the 2011 season, the Crimson must deal with another reality: that Ivy League title that seemed so firmly in its grasp for a second straight year is now, all of a sudden, anything but a done deal.
With the Tigers undefeated, the fate of the Crimson—considered even by Princeton’s coach as the top team in the conference—is no longer in its own hands.

With midterm season underway and constant reminders of imminent finals, stumbling across an empty reading room is often a welcome discovery.
Questioning the students and faculty behind the circulation desks yielded the consensus that hidden gems of underused library facilities are a rarity on campus, but there are still places to study where an open seat and quiet atmosphere are guaranteed.
It seems that undergrads have the best chance at an empty room if they are willing to venture to the grad schools. The first floor of the Bauer Laboratory (pictured above) provides a light-filled, modern space, close to the Science Center and with few disturbing fellow studiers. The Loeb Library at the Design School and the main room of the Fung Library in the CGIS building similarly see comparatively low student traffic. The Gutman Library at the Graduate School of Education usually has a fair amount of free chairs, so don't let the walk to Brattle Street deter you.
Devout Lamonsters can try the Larsen Room, Farnsworth Room, or Woodberry Poetry Room (all on the third floor) for lesser-known sections of the always-popular library.

Each Harvard undergraduate now has a personal cable box.
Well, sort of.
Tivli, a startup founded in 2009 by Harvard graduates Nicholas B. Krasney '09 and Ho A. Tuan '09, earlier this month launched Tivli Beta, a real time television service that streams 36 channels over the Harvard network through its website, Harvard.Tivli.com. Tivli's lineup includes all the major networks and many popular cable channels, such as CNN, Fox News, History, and NFL Network.
For now, Tivli Beta is in an evaluation period (hence the Beta tag), and is available for free without a subscription. (Tivli and its advertising partners are covering the costs.)
"We believe that Tivli has a duty to give back to Harvard because we were born here, and a lot of us went to school here. So Tivli is subsidizing our product at Harvard at the moment because, well, we love Harvard," Tivli President Christopher A. Thorpe, A.B. '97 M.S.'08 said.
According to Thorpe, the length of the free Beta period has not yet been determined. "It all depends on engagement," he said. "If Harvard students watch a lot of programming, and our advertisers are happy and we can make the dollars and cents work out, then Tivli may be able to keep giving back to the Harvard community by sponsoring the rest of the cost."
Tivli is not entirely new to the IP television market. Last year, it partnered with Harvard Student Agencies to build HSA.TV, a similar service which served as a model for Tivli’s current product.
Despite its ties to Harvard (it's based in the I-Lab), Tivli is eager to expand its reach. It has already launched a limited version of its product at Wesleyan University in Connecticut and, according to Krasney and Thorpe, the company plans it to launch the full Tivli service at four major universities in the coming weeks.
Students can check Tivli Beta out for themselves at Harvard.Tivli.Com.

According to a recent article in Business Insider, Chanequa N. Campbell was clashing with Harvard administrators long before they knew her as one of two former undergrads with possible links to the Kirkland shooting of 2009.
Campbell told Business Insider that back in 2005, she listed Jay-Z  as her role model in a recruiting survey at the Office of Career  Services and was told by a counselor there that the rapper was an  inappropriate pick who might not be taken seriously by potential  employers. She eventually wrote "Shawn Carter" instead and called it a  day.
As of 2012, Jay-Z is worth a few hundred million, and Forbes says that's no accident. Also, he's married to Beyoncé. As another wise poet  once said, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Whatever you  want to call Hova, he's definitely a legitimate role model.
Let's forget about the shooting for a minute and disregard all that  would transpire between Campbell and Harvard in the years to come.  Campbell was absolutely right and whoever it was at OCS who made this  call was just plain wrong. May we kindly suggest some (required) reading?
Put your diamonds up, OCS. Can you hear him? Good.

Domestic violence is an issue that affects people across the country. As part of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, Harvard is doing its part to raise awareness.
Purple Door Campaign participants spent last night journeying through rooms and dining halls to distribute purple ribbons. The Purple Door Campaign seeks to raise awareness for relationship violence and promote healthy relationships through the spread and display of purple ribbons.
Eliot House members released a video featuring members of their community sharing words they associate with healthy relationships. In an email sent to the Eliot House list, Eliot's Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) advisers called the video "a part of our House, Campus, and National efforts…to eradicate domestic and relationship violence."
Along with the ribbons and video, project organizers are distributing information pamphlets. These flyers, appropriately printed on light purple paper, come with their own "relationship bill of rights." This list of eight declarations is headed with, "I have the right to an equal relationship with my partner," and the bill emphasizes proper treatment in both emotional and physical mediums. The pamphlet also includes a brief description of relationship violence, defining it as "a pattern of controlling behaviors exerted by one partner over the other."

Students, holed up in Widener Library in preparation  for midterms, were forced from their study carrels just past 6:00 p.m. Monday night following what one firefighter described as a system  malfunction.
"We're going to want to talk with Harvard Fire  Protection Services about what can be done to rectify this mechanical  problem," said the Cambridge fireman.
Monday's evacuation came just days after a sprinkler malfunction damaged approximately 400 books in the library.
