After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There’s mountains and lakes in the far background. And there’s desert land. And there’s like monstrous, glaring hotels. It’s kind of such a strange… it’s like all the madness below, standing up here and stuff,” Garrett Borns says at the beginning of his interview. He is standing on a balcony, overlooking and describing—as he calls the place—Sin City. Borns, better known by the stage name BØRNS, has seen a meteoric rise in popularity in recent years. After the release of his 2014 debut single, “10,000 Emerald Pools,” the psychedelic pop singer appeared on Conan, received a shout-out from Taylor Swift, and even performed at Coachella in 2016. In anticipation of his upcoming performance at Boston Calling on May 28, The Harvard Crimson sat down with BØRNS to talk about his plans for his upcoming tour and the ways his past performances have affected him.
The Harvard Crimson: What are you doing in Vegas?
Garrett Borns: I’m playing a show tonight at this hotel. It’s kind of like a pool party… so it should be a good time.
THC: Compared to concerts, what’s it like doing those types of shows?
GB: Actually, these past couple of months have been a lot of one-off sort of shows, so… I don’t even know what exactly a normal concert is anymore…. We just played a few nights at a theater in Denver, now we’re playing at a pool party, and we played at a museum in LA last week. So it’s like every show is different lately. I’m going on tour soon, and then I think the shows will be a little more alike because we’re playing in theaters. But still, yeah, it’s been kind of like an all around randomness.
THC: What should concertgoers expect from your tour?
GB: What to expect? Well, I like to keep most of it a secret, but you know, I think people can expect a good show… and it should be an all-around very melodic sort of experience.
THC: What are you looking forward to with Boston Calling?
GB: I don’t really know what to expect, to be honest, but I will definitely be putting on the best show that I’m capable of putting on.
THC: You've been called "Coachella's coolest rockstar" by Teen Vogue. You've been recommended by Taylor Swift. How do you feel about all of this attention and praise?
GB: It's all extremely generous to say. I'm really glad listeners are connecting to the music.
THC: Can you describe your creative process?
GB: My first album was a collaboration between me and Tommy English, except “10,000 Emerald Pools,” [which was] produced by Kennedy. The creative process is a mix between arranging drum samples; old analogue keyboards; and iPhone sound clips of birds, talking and coyotes.
THC: You have a long history of performance, such as your time doing magic or working with TEDx. How do you think those experiences have shaped your own shows now as a performer?
GB: I think that I’ve gone through a lot of different... artistic outlets just growing up. I don’t know. I feel like I just kind of dabble in a lot of things, just because I’m always trying to figure them out. I mean, magic is like a pretty good metaphor for, really, a lot of the arts. Because you always look at the behind-the-scene, sort of secret thing that you don’t see when you’re experiencing art, whether it’s a painting—you don’t see someone paint it—and you don’t see someone write songs. You don’t experience the kind of, like, secrecy of art; you only see the final product. I’m always interested in the creative process of art and figuring [that] out—everyone has a different way of approaching writing music or the melody or playing an instrument.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Palehound’s record label, Exploding in Sound, calls the group “one of the best up-and-coming bands… throughout Brooklyn’s DIY community,” and looking at their track record, the statement doesn’t seem an exaggeration. Palehound—composed of Ellen Kempner, Thom Lombardi, Ben Scherer, and Max Kupperberg—came together in 2013, and in the span of three years the alternative indie rock unit have seen an incredible rise in fame. Featured in the CMJ Music Marathon 2015, an annual autumn convention and festival in New York, and on NPR through the Tiny Desk Concert series, they will be performing at Boston Calling on May 28. Vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist Kempner sat down with The Crimson to discuss her musical beginnings, her inspirations, and her experiences leading a band that is currently evolving and exploding with attention and acclaim.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you first become involved in music?
Ellen Kempner: My dad played when I was growing up, so that kind of got me started…. I’ve always just been a fan of listening to music my whole life—[it was] kind of a big part of growing up—and I just started writing songs to contribute to that culture, that scene.
THC: Do you remember the first songs that you wrote?
EK: Yeah, I wrote a song called “Real World,” and the chorus was like, “Get back to the real world / Get out of your cloud.” And that was my first song—one of them.
THC: How did Palehound form?
EK: [Palehound] still is in its own way a solo project because I write and record everything…. But I decided I wanted to start touring and definitely didn’t want to do it by myself. [I] definitely wanted to be able to play louder shows and not just be like the girl with a solo guitar.... I wanted to make more noise, so I put together a band when I moved here to Boston.
THC: How do you think your music has evolved since you first started out?
EK: Having a band now has made me rethink how I write songs. Now I know what to expect when I play shit live and what kind of instruments I’m working with, so I definitely keep that in mind when I start writing. I’ve also been practicing a lot more, so that broadens my abilities to just experiment more with guitar and stuff. And of course, I listen to different stuff that comes out, and everything has its own little influence.
THC: Who are some of your musical inspirations?
EK:  I definitely grew up listening to a lot of Joni Mitchell. Loved her growing up. And in high school, I loved Elliott Smith. And recently, I’ve really loved Angela Wilson and Courtney Barnett. New stuff comes out every day that I like—well, not every day, [but] every year—that I like and kind of stick with.
THC: In what ways do you channel those inspirations in your music?
EK: I don’t know. I honestly will just hear a song that I really love and will be inspired by it. It just makes me want to make music when I hear something I really like. It makes me want to sit down and try to make something like it.
THC: What was like it recording your debut album, “Dry Food”?
EK: It was really awesome. I recorded it with my friend at his studio—or a studio that he assistant engineers at, but he was the main engineer for my session…. It was basically the nicest studio I’ve ever worked in. It was just really nice and felt comfortable and wasn’t flashy…. It was really great to camp out there for a few days.
THC: What’s your favorite part about recording?
EK: Finally hearing things that I’ve only heard myself play in a bedroom coming alive in a studio is a really rewarding experience. It almost feels like magical, you know, to see something I work hard on… [and to] flesh it out and turn it into something I’m really proud of.
THC: Alternative rock is pretty male-dominated. How is it being a woman in that scene?
EK: A lot of dudes in the scene are really great, so I haven’t faced a ton of sexism from fellow musicians. But you know, there will be times when people will come to a show and will make side comments like they weren’t expecting me to play guitar like I do. Most of the offensive stuff that people say comes from a place of them trying to be complimentary. No one really goes out of their way to be an asshole to me, which is really nice, but it’s all just kind of tokenizing shit. It’s getting better, and I’m kind of fortunate to be in a place now where I have a lot of friends in the scene. And what I really like about the Boston music scene is that there are a lot of female musicians and non-binary identifying musicians.
THC: You’ve appeared on NPR Music, and you’ll be playing at Boston Calling. Can you describe those experiences?
EK: It’s been really amazing but also really nerve-wracking. If I didn’t love music so much, this would be like a terrible career choice for me…. It’s totally weird to be in a position now where I’m seeing myself on websites that I’ve always read or on NPR, and it’s crazy seeing myself doing these things that I’ve always dreamed of doing but never felt that I would get to do. But at the same time, it’s also insanely anxiety-provoking for me. So it’s kind of bittersweet. It’s mainly sweet. I love it, I’m incredibly fortunate, and I’m insanely grateful.
THC: What has it been like going on tour?
EK: It’s exhausting but also really incredible. I’ve gotten to travel to places I never thought I’d be able to go to. I toured Europe for the first time a couple of months ago, and it was insanely amazing and like a total dream come true…. I actually really love touring the States a lot because if I [had gone] to [the] cities just to visit, I would have just done touristy bullshit and not known how to do the cool shit. But when you tour as a musician, you end up in a lot of the cool scenes of the city.
THC: What part of Boston Calling are you looking forward to most?
EK:  I really want to see Courtney Barnett, really bad. I love her, and I haven’t seen her yet.
THC: What do you usually try to bring to your live shows on-stage?
EK: I just want people to feel like they can come up and talk to me afterwards. My main goal is just to be myself as much as possible, even though I’m under a lot of pressure [to] try to retain myself and not be someone who I’m not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The banner that serves as a header to every page of the Harvard University Athletics website is emblazoned with the words “Academic Integration, Competitive Excellence.” Here, and more explicitly on the Athletic Department’s recruiting page, the University proudly touts the academic and athletic opportunities offered to its undergraduate student-athletes. The unfortunate truth, however, is that many student-athletes are finding academic integration to be incompatible with their efforts towards competitive excellence; in fact, the opposite is too often true, as practice schedules for athletics can sometimes inhibit academic exploration. Rather than finding themselves able to pursue their desired course of study while also competing as an athlete for the University, many student-athletes find that their academic and athletic interests conflict logistically.
We firmly believe that Harvard students should never have to compromise their academic goals to pursue their extracurricular ones—or their extracurricular goals for their academic ones, for that matter. At this time, when the College finds itself at a crossroads of campus expansion and administrative overhaul, Harvard is well-positioned to rectify these issues.
The ProblemThe commitment that student-athletes make to their sport is unique in a few key ways. Before arriving on campus, student-athletes commit not only to being students at the College, but also to competing for the University’s varsity athletic teams—a commitment that includes daily team practices and conditioning sessions as well as games that often require travel across state borders. A significant portion of a student-athlete’s day is consistently devoted to his or her sport, without any of the schedule flexibility or distribution that characterizes other extracurricular activities. In sum, student-athletes lack the luxury of tailoring their extracurricular schedule to fit their academic interests; instead, that commitment to the team means that student-athletes’ academic schedules must be organized around practice schedule rather than vice versa.
This problem is neither new nor unique: Issues with scheduling conflicts have plagued the College in the past, and student-athletes at Yale have also complained of similar obstacles. In the past year, the issue came to prominence during the UC campaign of Nick E. Gajdzik ’16-’17 and Jeffrey M.  Ott ’16-’17, two members of the varsity wrestling team. Ott was disappointed to find that his wrestling practice schedule “played a huge factor in which concentration [he] was able to do.” Ott arrived at Harvard hoping to pursue both his interest in ornithology and his commitment to the wrestling program; yet, he soon discovered that certain classes required for Organismic and Evolutionary Biology conflicted with his afternoon wrestling practices. Though he was, and still is, wildly passionate about the study of birds, pursuing OEB would have meant missing two wrestling practices a week—a sacrifice that he was unwilling to make.
In theory, such a sacrifice is required by neither the College nor the Department of Athletics; student-athletes are allowed to miss practice time if a conflict exists between their athletic and academic commitments. This solution, though, is impractical and unreasonable given the expectations accompanying the commitment that student-athletes make to their sports and their teammates. Moreover, forcing Harvard’s student-athletes to choose between class time and practice time appears counterintuitive in light of the stated mission to combine “academic integration” with “competitive excellence.”
Moving Forward
At this point in time—in the midst of overhauls of both the Program in General Education and and the course schedule—the University is particularly well positioned to consider how it can better serve its students and stay true to its mission of “creating and sustaining the conditions that enable all Harvard College students to experience an unparalleled educational journey that is intellectually, socially, and personally transformative.” Now is the perfect time to tweak the undergraduate academic schedule so that it empowers, rather than hinders, students in their efforts to pursue the studies and activities they love.
One possible solution is to designate a period of time, between two to three hours, each afternoon expressly for extracurricular and athletic activities, ensuring that there would be no conflict between academics and other activities. Schools such as MIT, Princeton, and Cornell have already implemented similar blocks of time. Though this solution may not be feasible on our campus, we believe that the principle nevertheless stands: In charting a new course schedule, the administration must take into careful consideration the conflicts that the current schedule—and any future schedule—creates for student-athletes.
The benefits of a new schedule are not confined to those who are varsity athletes. After all, student-athletes are not the only members of the College community that must face the problem of balancing academics and extracurriculars. On the contrary, the commitments that students make to writing for a publication, doing community service through PBHA, or participating in theater are no less important or worthwhile than a commitment to athletics, and often equally time-consuming. As Ott eloquently argued, “The dichotomy that we’re assuming is that we have ‘student-athletes’ and then we have ‘students,’ but in reality… we have student-athletes and then we have student-editorial writers, we have student-cello players.”
In short, the potential for conflicts to arise in declaring a concentration does not fall solely on student-athletes, but also potentially on any student who has a serious commitment to an extracurricular activity. A new course schedule that frees student-athletes of conflicts between their academic and athletic commitments could provide widespread benefits for the entire student body, by also preventing conflicts between academic and extracurricular commitments.
Conclusion
Both of the course schedules proposed a month ago to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences represent substantial steps in the right direction, by providing for more flexibility in the scheduling of courses, especially seminars, tutorials, and labs. We hope that, in considering these proposals, as well as other potential schedules, the Faculty keeps in mind the sacrifices that student-athletes at the College are forced to make every semester, between the classes they want to take and the sport that they have committed to, between their pursuit of competitive excellence and their desire for academic integration with the rest of the College. For the University to truly fulfill its academic mission, every concentration must be a logistical possibility for every undergraduate student. The choice that exists today—between athletics and academics, and sometimes, between extracurriculars and academics—should not remain in the fall of 2018. As Ott stated, we hope that all student-athletes will be given a full opportunity to “pursue their academics. Because that’s something that Harvard… really pushes; they support your interests. If you want to do something, there should be no barriers.”

To the Editor:
While we acknowledge and have personally seen the positive formative value that Harvard’s clubs and other single sex social organizations can and have had for our players and family members, we are committed, alongside Harvard to make strides in strengthening inclusion on our campus, and we are hopeful that the recently announced framework for student membership in unrecognized single-gender social organizations released by President Faust and Dean Khurana will further that end.
We are reminded that when Condoleezza Rice and Darla Moore were admitted to Augusta National Golf Club, the decision to do so was far from unanimous, but it was the right thing to do. As we move forward, it is our collective responsibility as community members and leaders to set a tone which is worthy of this special place.
Sincerely,

At the outbreak of the Vietnam War, Harvard students were safe from the draft. College undergraduate and graduate students were automatically awarded draft status 2-S–deferment for  postsecondary education–and could not be forced to serve. For those opposed to the war, it was a get-out-of-jail-free card.
In 1965, that changed.
The war in Vietnam was escalating, and the U.S. army found itself in need of more recruits. In fact, by the fall of 1965, the U.S. Defense Department would order the highest enlistment quotas since the pinnacle of the Korean War: 27,400 men in September, and 33,600 in October.
To meet these demands, the U.S. military began to draw from a new pool: college men. The policy, Director of Selective Service System Lewis B. Hershey announced, would affect only a small percentage of the  1.8 million college students in the country—“only a thousand or two a month.”
These thousands weren’t selected at random. Instead, the Selective Service System (SSS) instituted a system of academic evaluation under which local draft boards would defer students based on intellectual ability. This ability was determined by two factors: class rank, and score on a national aptitude test known as the Selective Service Qualification Test. Undergraduates with a high class rank, or a test score above a certain cutoff, were draft-exempt. Everyone else could be sent to the front.
“At that point, things changed,” recalls Timothy K. Wright, who was a Harvard graduate student at the time. “Everybody had a number and if you had a low number–even if you were in college–you had to show up.”

Harvard responded warily to the SSS decision to use class rank to determine draft status. Harvard had not previously ranked its students, and many students and faculty worried that rankings would foster “grade-grubbing” and prevent academic risk-taking.
"Are [professors] willing (and able) to function professionally in a situation wherein they hold life-and-death probability powers over their students?"  Sociology Department chair John R. Seeley asked in a 1966 memo. “We might refuse to be professors under such an invasion or misuse of our role. We might cease to grade at all (except privately for information for each student) or we might grade every one equally high."
An October 1966 referendum showed that 72 percent of the Harvard undergraduate respondents felt that Selective Service should not use class rank to determine 2-S deferment.
Harvard administrators, too, were concerned. In an effort to standardize grading and make draft designation “fairer,” then-President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 and then-Dean of the College John U. Munro ’34 suggested a solution: adopt the aptitude test already in use at schools across the country.
The test, officially called the Selective Service Qualification Test, and colloquially known as the “Vietnam exam,” was scored out of 150 points. Undergraduates needed to score at least 70 points to secure draft exemption, and graduates needed to score 80. The first sessions were administered on Harvard’s campus in the spring of 1966.
As much as Harvard students disapproved of class rankings as a determinant of draft exemption, they liked the Vietnam exam even less. According to the 1966 referendum, a vast majority of students surveyed–90 percent, in fact–felt that the exam should not be the sole means of draft selection.
Some feared that the exam advantaged those with wealth and access to education, further exacerbating class imbalance in the military. “The whole thing was designed to create class unrest. If you qualify as sufficiently elite, then you get out of [the draft],” Eric Lessinger ’68 said. “It sets people up against each other.”
By the 1965-1966 academic year, growing anti-war sentiment had resulted in the emergence of several large movements on or near campus, including the Boston Draft Resistance Group, “The Resistance,” and the Harvard-Radcliffe branch of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).
Initially, SDS had lacked a strong anti-draft program. Its primary membership was students, after all, a population which had been draft-exempt until 1965. This changed after the erosion of the 2-S deferment. Galvanized by this new vulnerability and seeking to consolidate its place as the leading anti-war organization in the country, SDS staged a national protest against the exam.
The protest was based on a “counter-exam”–a four-page leaflet printed 500,000 times and distributed by SDS members stationed outside 850 examination centers across the country. The protest took place on May 14, 1966, the date of the very first Vietnam exam.
“If the US divided the money being spent on the war among everyone in South Vietnam what would that amount be?” the counter-exam asked. “Answer: $866 per person, making [South Vietnam] the country with the highest per capita income in Asia.”
“Some of it was straight education. Some of it was a little funny. Some of it was clearly pointed and polemical. We were just trying to make a point,” Michael S. Ansara ’68, regional coordinator of SDS during the administration of the counter-exam, said.
Organizers perceived the effort as a success. “This exam put SDS on the map around the country,”John F. Maher Jr. ’60, New England coordinator of SDS, said.
Other Harvard students were reluctant to protest the Vietnam exam. Under a system of draft deferments based on class rank within schools, Harvard students were competing with one another. Under a system based on a national test, they were competing with students from universities and colleges across the nation. Students at top-ranked schools often found themselves better prepared for the exam than their peers at less well-resourced schools. For many Harvard students, the Vietnam exam offered a distinct advantage in the competition for draft deferrals.
Perhaps for this reason, neither popular discontent nor the catalyst of the counter-exam led to immediate change. “It didn’t stop any college from participating. It didn’t stop any dean from doing the rankings,” Ansara said. Harvard would continue to submit class rank and test score information to the SSS, and students would–apart from occasional protests–for the most part acquiesce.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If he’s not scribbling an Rx on his prescription pad, Stephen J. Bergman ’66 might be writing an epic novel. The psychiatrist, better known under his pen name, Samuel Shem, has published a series of critically acclaimed novels. Many of them, like the popular 1978 novel “House of God,” which follows a group of interns through their residency at a fictionalized version of Beth Israel Hospital, satirize the medical industry.
Born in 1944, Bergman grew up in Hudson, New York. His father, Sig, was a dentist, and his mother, Rose Fuchs helped found the Hudson Area Library in 1959. Bergman attended Hudson High School, and when it came time to apply to college, he had his mind set on nearby West Point. His father, however, encouraged him to apply to Yale and Harvard, and he was accepted to both schools. 
At Harvard, Bergman lived in Leverett House and concentrated in social relations while also working to complete pre-med requirements. Bergman excelled academically, earning membership to Phi Beta Kappa—the nation’s oldest arts and sciences honor society—and graduating magna cum laude. Bergman also joined Harvard’s Glee Club, and played junior varsity basketball and varsity golf.
Bergman eventually quit basketball in order to devote more time to his academics. He did, though, find a way to balance golf with his academic responsibilities, and remembers his trips with the varsity golf team fondly. Bergman continued to play golf recreationally after his graduation from Harvard, and met the writer John H. Updike ’54 through the sport. They remained close friends until Updike’s death in 2009.
But while Bergman excelled in the lab and on the putting greens, he found less success as a writer. “I thought Harvard had taken me for my athletic ability since I thought I was the stupidest kid in my class,” said Bergman.
“That whole first semester of my freshman writing class the teacher, Ms. Heller, did not put a letter grade but wrote on the bottom ‘See Me’. When I went to see her, she looked at me and said this paper is too terrible to mark, ‘Below F’,” Bergman said. “She destroyed any idea in my mind that I could fulfill my dream to become a writer.”
In hindsight, Bergman thinks that turning away from writing while at Harvard provided him a “blank slate” to develop his own style later.
During his senior year, Bergman wrote his thesis on the biological basis of learning and memory. He also applied to Harvard Medical School, and interviewed with assistant psychology professor Daniel H. Funkenstein, notorious for his his unorthodox questions
During his interview Funkenstein asked Bergman, “Who do you admire most, Einstein or Churchill?”
When Bergman chose the latter,  Funkenstein advised him to not to apply to a school “known for its science.”
Bergman was accepted to Harvard Medical School, but he turned down the offer to study at Oxford through a Rhodes fellowship. Bergman graduated from Oxford with a PhD in physiology at the height of the Vietnam War, and decided to reapply to medical school to avoid the draft.
“It was either go to war or go to med school,” he said.
This time, for his application, Bergman had to write a “brief and candid description” of his personality. “S.J. Bergman is helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent,” he wrote, quoting the Boy Scout Law.
Even though Bergman had escaped the war, he did not escape the social turmoil erupting on campuses across the nation.
“After Kent State, the first year class commandeered the auditorium to vote whether to go on strike or learn the kidney,” Bergman said. The class never learned about the anatomy of the kidney.
Bergman graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1973, and completed his residency at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Bergman later became a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, a position he maintained for 35 years. During that time, though, he also found time to pursue writing.
Bergman, who has also written several plays, chose the pseudonym “Samuel Shem” to protect his patients. Much of his writing questions the assumption that doctors should maintain emotional distance from their patients, advocating instead for the development of honest, trusting relationships between medical professionals and those they treat. Bergman warns against the “danger of and risk of isolation,” while promoting “the healing power of good connections.”
Bergman’s most recent novel “At the Heart of the Universe,” departs from medical themes  to explore the consequences of the one-child policy in rural China. Shem has also co-authored two books with his wife, Janet Surrey, a clinical psychologist.
In 2014, Bergman became the clinical professor of medicine in the Division of Medical Humanities at the New York University School of Medicine, a position that combines Bergman’s dual careers in medicine and literature.

Sitting cross-legged in her two-room Cambridge apartment, which also served as the local Psychedelic Information Center, Lisa Bieberman ’63 told the Harvard Crimson, in a 1966 article, “I’d always wanted to have a mystical experience.”
In the article, titled “Local LSD PR-Girl Tells How to Make (And Take) Those Little Sugar Cubes,” Bieberman explains how she had lost interest in finding that experience until one day, while perusing the Crimson, she stumbled across the work of two Harvard figures: psychology professor Richard Alpert and instructor Timothy F. Leary.
In a series of trials between 1960 and 1962, through the Harvard Psilocybin Project, Leary and Alpert—now known as Ram Dass—administered psychedelics, among them LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, to students with the intent of understanding their effects on people.
“I began to hang around Leary’s office after classes,” Bieberman said, “licking envelopes, tying letters, and running errands. And I faithfully read all the papers [Leary and Alpert] put out.” The next year, the article explains, she became the circulation manager for Leary’s “Psychedelic Review.”
Bieberman, an honors graduate from Radcliffe with a degree in mathematics and philosophy, became, what one article described as, a “disciple of Timothy Leary.” Describing her experience with the psychedelic drugs, Bieberman spoke  in spiritual terms.
“It’s hard to explain to people who have not taken the drugs just what these good effects are,” Bieberman said. “But they can give you a new perspective on the way you are living, and an increased sensitivity. You look at life in a completely different way when you’re up and the important thing is to be able to apply this new perspective to your life when you come back down.”
 By 1963, Leary and Alpert no longer had ties to the University; Leary’s contract expired after he abdicated his teaching responsibilities, while Alpert was dismissed for breaking an agreement not to give drugs to undergraduates.
Even though the trials ended when the duo left Cambridge, Leary and Alpert continued to  influence  Harvard for years to come, sparking debates on the role of psychedelics on campus and helping to bring 1960s drug culture to the forefront of national consciousness.
For Bieberman, who could not be reached for an interview, Leary’s and Alpert’s  impact was clear. In a letter to the editor following the 1966 article, Bieberman wrote of her conviction that LSD  “can be an aid to spiritual and moral growth to those so motivated.”

One night, Allan Y. Cohen ’61 found himself in the backseat of a car driving back to campus from Boston. At the wheel of the Volvo sat a professor from the Harvard Business School. Suddenly, the professor, in the midst of a psychedelic flashback, took one hand off the steering wheel and began shaking his arm like a whip.
“He said ‘damn horses’ and he had a flashback and he was driving a 12 horse sleigh through the snow covered streets of Cambridge,” Cohen remembered, adding “somehow, we got home.”
For Cohen, who participated in the trials and worked with Leary and Alpert as a graduate student, scenes of this kind were not uncommon. The experiments were informal and, by modern standards, unscientific in nature. There was often no control group and those administering the experiment would sometimes take the drugs along with the subjects in order to better empathize.
“I don't think you can make a case that he was doing really important science, in part because [Leary] decided that these drugs were bigger than Harvard, bigger than science and that everyone should try them,”  Michael Pollan, a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute studying the history of psychedelics, said.
One of the most famous trials was dubbed the “Good Friday Experiment.” Ten Divinity School students were given psilocybin and another 10 students were given a placebo before Good Friday services in order to see if the drugs could facilitate a mystical or spiritual experience.
“Eight of the 10 students receiving psilocybin reported a mystical experience, while only one in the control group experienced a feeling of ‘sacredness’ and a ‘sense of peace’,” Pollan wrote in an essay in the New Yorker, adding that it was not difficult to tell the two groups apart. “Those on the placebo sat sedately in their pews while the others lay down or wandered around the chapel, muttering things like ‘God is everywhere’ and ‘Oh, the glory!’”
Controversy arose within the department, where two camps emerged: those who took psychedelics or supported the trials, and those who did neither. Psychology professor Herbert C. Kelman circulated a letter and called for a meeting to emphasize that the trials were voluntary.
“My recollection was that you could choose between taking the final or participating in the psilocybin trials,” Cohen said. “Not many of us chose to take the final.”
Leary left the school in 1962, after he failed to fulfill his teaching obligations one semester, electing to travel instead. Harvard did not renew his contract. Alpert was fired in 1963, after he gave drugs to undergraduates, breaking his and Leary’s agreement with Harvard to refrain from doing so.
Following Alpert’s firing, a group of students, including Bieberman, organized a public protest against the dismissal. In letter to the University, the group wrote that Harvard’s “timidity [was] unworthy of a university which claims to encourage free inquiry and exploration,” adding that administrators “reacted with undue alarm to the widespread public controversy” over the drugs.
The duo leaving Harvard, along with the national coverage of the trials, helped to make Leary and Alpert—and psychedelics, by extension—known in households around the country.
Andrew T. Weil ’64 first covered the trial for the Crimson, but his story soon “got picked up by the Boston papers and the New York Times,”Don Lattin, author of the “Harvard Psychedelic Club,” said. “It was really them getting kicked out of Harvard and then all that happened after that which was that Leary and Alpert were the most famous proponents of enlightenment through psychedelic drugs.”
Within the group taking psychedelics “there was a big argument going at the time whether to keep it private and esoteric like in a cult, or go public and try to turn on as many people as possible because it was a revolutionary thing,” Paul A. Lee, who participated in the “Good Friday Experiment,” said.“And it got out to the public.”

In October of 1966, years after leaving Harvard, Leary was arrested in New York for violating a narcotics regulation. According to an article at the time, Leary told reporters that a “majority of Harvard students use LSD.” While the claim is unsubstantiated, anecdotes indicate that some students did indeed take LSD regularly.
In a 1966 article, titled “Drug-Users at Harvard Explain their Views About Pot and LSD,” a Crimson reporter surveyed 45 anonymous students, all sophomores and juniors between 18 and 20 years old, on their experiences with marijuana and LSD.
One student described what he experienced when he read a newspaper while on LSD. “He not only saw the object which lay on his doorstep every morning, but also single letters put together to form words, words combined to make phrases,” the reporter writes. “He saw people working hard to write the articles and printers sweating over their type; he saw thousands reading it, ignoring it, or folding it into paper planes.”
Just a year later, another Crimson article posited that when it came to LSD use at Harvard, “five per cent is a figure that nearly everyone agree[d] on.” The article speculated that drugs were more accessible  in the Yard than they had been in the past.
The expansion of drug use on Harvard’s campus did not come without backlash. F. Skiddy von Stade Jr. ’38, the Dean of Freshmen at the time, said that to combat this “new kind of rebellion” the “University must play a role in educating students of the danger of drugs.”
In response to this increase in drug culture, Harvard University Health Services released a statement warning students against using LSD and other drugs.
“Our professional medical opinion is that playing with L.S.D. is a desperately dangerous form of ‘drug roulette’,” the statement reads. “The medical evidence is clear. Any person taking L.S.D. runs the clear risk of psychotic breakdown and long-run physiological damage.”
Still, psychedelics, introduced to Harvard by Leary and Alpert,  remained present on campus through the 1960s.
Bieberman had a response to the stream of warnings from the Director of HUHS.
“He only mentions the cases that turn out badly, and does not mention cases in which psychedelics can be used constructively,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing in Tercentenary Theatre, William F. Weld ’66 began his Latin Oration for the Commencement of the graduating Class of 1966. A long-standing Harvard tradition in which one graduating senior is selected to give a speech entirely in Latin, the oration is considered among the highest honors a graduating senior can receive.
For Weld, the occasion provided the opportunity for satire. In his speech, titled “De Puellis Radcliffiensibus,” or as it is translated in English, “Radcliffe Women,” Weld sardonically explained how Lamont Library was  “the last bastion of Harvard men” to escape the “Radcliffe onslaught.” At the time, women were not allowed in Lamont, and debate raged about whether or not to lift this restriction.
According to friends, this speech, the capstone of Weld’s collegiate career, encapsulated his wit and intelligence. 
Before Weld became a two-term governor of Massachusetts, and the 2016 Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee,  he was better known to his friends as “Bill,” the  clever undergraduate with a biting sense of humor.
“His intellectual and personal confidence raised my eyebrows,” Nicholas B. Deane ’66, a classmate and fellow member of the Signet Society for arts, said.  “He expressed it through being pretty sharp tongued about things and people.”
In the classroom, Weld, who studied Latin and Greek as a Classics concentrator, excelled. He was one of only 45 students to graduate summa cum laude,  the highest  level of academic distinction. Even more, Weld, who could not be reached for an interview, was one of only eight students in his year to be elected as a junior to Phi Beta Kappa for his outstanding academic achievements.
“He was a brilliant fellow but very discrete about it,” Weld’s classmate and fellow Adams resident Francisco R.R. de Sola ’66 said. “He wasn’t someone who would go around trumpeting his incredible intelligence.”

Outside of the classroom, Weld was highly active in campus social life as a member of the final club the Fly, the Signet society, and the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, an all-male drag troupe famous for its burlesque productions.
While Weld was a dedicated scholar, he, like most college students, wasn’t always perfectly studious. As Mitchell L. Adams ’66, who was the president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, remembers, two weeks before senior theses were due, Weld still hadn’t started his.
Still, Weld did not let his role as a “leading lady,” playing the character “Vera Similitude” in the 1966 Pudding Production, “Right Up Your Alley,” get in the way of his academic pursuits. Adams said Weld balanced his responsibilities by writing his thesis underneath the stage during the show in between his scenes.
“I’ll never forget the sight of Bill in between scenes in the Pudding show that spring,” said  Adams. “There he was by himself in dress and wig with a legal pad on his lap writing his thesis, which turned out to be a Summa.”
Aris M. Sophocles ’66, also a Pudding cast member, added that Weld was extroverted. Sophocles recalled a particularly vivid memory of Weld, who at that time had bright red hair, enthusiastically participating in the kick line during several Pudding shows.
“He had lots of humor and enjoyed our silliness,” Sophocles said. “He had a lot of fun with the rest of us."
Fellow members of the Fly Club also warmly remember their time with Weld.
“We were all really fond of Bill, he really added alot to the cohesiveness of the [Fly],” Adams said.

Though Weld was involved in a series of extracurricular organizations, he did not participate in any politically-orientated clubs. Several of Weld’s friends were surprised by his postgraduate career choice.
“In college, I can’t recall him being particularly politically active,” Adams said. “It never occurred to me at the time that Bill would go into politics.”
Sophocles echoed this surprise. “I really didn’t think he would go into politics,” Sophocles said. “But, since he did, I’m not at all surprised he became governor.”
De Sola, however, remarked that he always suspected that Weld would pursue a career in politics, a field that would draw on Weld’s theatrical abilities.
“He had that ability to deal with people, a great ability with words, and an aim to make the world better,” de Sola said.
After graduating from Harvard, Weld attended the University of Oxford on a year-long fellowship program, before returning to complete a degree at Harvard Law School. After graduating in 1970,Weld began his legal career as minority counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate impeachment inquiries.
In 1981, Weld was appointed United States Attorney for Massachusetts by President Ronald Reagan. He later worked in the Justice Department before being elected governor of Massachusetts in November 1990.
Weld served two terms as governor, before vacating his seat to pursue an appointment by President Clinton as Ambassador of China. After the Senate failed to confirm his appointment, Weld served  in various positions within government and, most recently, running as the Vice Presidential nominee for the 2016 Libertarian Party ticket

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donald E. Graham ’66 never imagined he would one day be standing at the wrong end of a burglar’s loaded gun.
Graham, the son of famed Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, knew from a young age that he would take the reins and lead the Post one day. The newspaper had been in his family since his grandfather bought it in a bankruptcy sale in 1933.
But before joining the Post, Graham wanted to better  understand the city where he had grown up. So when he returned from serving in Vietnam, where he was drafted to the 1st Cavalry Division during the war, Graham decided to join the D.C. police department. He would find himself confronted by a burglar, said Peter Cummings ‘66, who wrote for the Harvard Crimson with Graham and learned of the episode decades ago. 
“Don realized this guy could kill him. And Don was very calm and said, ‘You don’t want to do this. You don’t want to kill a cop. If you do, it’ll just be horrible for you,’” Cummings said. “And the guy didn’t shoot him.”
Cummings, who acknowledged some of the story’s details have faded from his memory, called Graham’s decision to join the police department in the first place “pretty astonishing.”
“He didn’t have to do something like that, you know. He was going to be [publisher] no matter what—I mean, the family owned the business,” Cummings said. “But he did that kind of thing because he thought that was the kind of experience he needed to be a good [publisher] of a Washington, D.C. newspaper.”
From patrolling the streets of D.C. to serving in Vietnam, Graham learned the stories of other people, all the while strengthening his skills as a journalist. But his first training ground was The Crimson.
Graham spent many of his nights at Harvard in the basement of The Crimson. Sitting in front of two linotype machines —19th century instruments that set the daily paper in lead type—he and his colleagues proofread the stories, lined up the text, and made sure headlines were properly configured.
“If I were honest with myself, I spent more time at 14 Plympton Street than in any library or classroom,” Graham said, referencing the Crimson’s address. “So many of my memories revolve around The Crimson, the stories I covered, and the friends I made.”
Graham, a History and Literature concentrator and Winthrop House resident, quickly rose through the ranks of The Crimson to become its president.
“My memories of The Crimson revolve around two things: one was my friends, and one was the production process—how much time we poured into it,” Graham said. “I was also pretty lonely the fall of freshman year, as people sometimes are, and once I joined The Crimson that was not true anymore.”
Graham covered everything from sports and news to one of his main passions: the arts. He grew up loving jazz and blues music, an interest sparked by a high school classmate who convinced him to see a performance at the Howard Theater in Washington, where legendary singers Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding were known to frequent.
“I was hooked,” Graham said. “I was hooked on jazz and hooked on the Howard.”
Later, as an editor for The Crimson, he would sit in a different theater: the Loeb Mainstage. Graham wrote reviews of different productions and essays about the state of theater at Harvard.
Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr. ’68, who would later follow Graham as both president of The Crimson and publisher of the Post, said he remembers Graham’s “huge interest” in the theatre, as well as his passion for sports. In high school, Graham said he played sports “relentlessly”—everything from tennis and baseball to wrestling and football. At The Crimson, he became a sports editor.
Those around him emphasize that Graham’s hard work, not his family name, enabled him to rise to the top of the newspaper’s staff.
“People might have looked at him as somebody who was destined for something, but Don really earned everything he had on the way there,” Jones said. “He never took anything for granted, never expected anything to be handed to him.”
Many of Graham’s peers at The Crimson pursued careers in journalism, and several remain his lifelong friends.
“As Crimson president, he had a quiet charisma,” Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and former Crimson editor Linda Greenhouse ’68 wrote in an email. “He didn't try to call attention to himself. But he was obviously such a good and talented guy that people automatically paid attention anyway.”
Ellen Lake ’66, a former Crimson editor who dated Graham freshman year, said he held an “egalitarian” attitude despite his esteemed journalistic background.
“Here we were, student journalists, and here was Don with the Washington Post in his family and it was clear that he was going to go back and be very much a part of running this terrifically important newspaper,” Lake said. “But it wasn’t as though he ever, in any way, lorded that over anybody, or made anybody feel less important or special.”
Graham recognized the importance of every member of The Crimson’s staff, Jones said.
“A newspaper is such an amazing entity because it comes out every day, and it takes all these people acting in concert to make that happen,” Jones said. “And he really truly appreciated that. He appreciated the linotypists, he appreciated the people on the editorial, the photographers.”
Graham said his father’s death in August 1963, around the time he would head back to Harvard for his sophomore year, was the saddest point in his life. But he also called it a “turning point in a way.”
After he witnessed the courage of his mother, who made the unheard of decision as a woman in the 60’s to run the Post herself, Graham said he was pulled more in the direction of one day working for the paper.

Long before he would assume leadership of the Washington Post, Graham was drafted to serve in Vietnam. By some trick of fate, a computer randomly selected him to serve as an information specialist—army jargon for a journalist.
A year after graduating from Harvard in 1966, Graham was assigned to take pictures and write stories for the 1st Air Cavalry Division.
“I got to know a very wide range of people in the United States Army,” Graham said. “While I’m still quite confused about the war in Vietnam, I do feel that the soldiers I served with in the Army were really remarkable people.”
After a year in Vietnam, Graham returned to a city reeling from the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Washington was overrun by riots that left much of the city burnt down and several people dead. Desiring a firsthand look at the city he called home, Graham postponed his career in journalism and joined the police force.
Once again, Graham was thrust into an unfamiliar situation, spending 18 months policing the streets of D.C. and exposing himself to parts of the  the city he had never known.
“I thought I did not know much about life in the city where I lived and where the Post is published,” Graham said. “I was called into the houses of a lot of very poor families in very difficult times.”
After his stints reporting in Vietnam and patrolling the streets of D.C., Graham felt he was ready. He went to work for the Post as a reporter in 1971 and succeeded his mother as publisher in 1979.
“People just admired him a lot, and that was true at the Post,” Jones said. “It’d be very hard to overestimate the influence that Don had on the newsroom at the Post.”
In 2000, Graham became the chairman of the paper, a position he held until 2008. In 2013, the Graham family sold the Post to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
Aside from his career at the Post, Graham has devoted much of his time to philanthropic efforts, co-founding both a scholarship fund for the children of undocumented immigrants, who are ineligible for federal loans, and the D.C. College Access Program, which aims to increase the college attendance of students in the city.
Graham’s experience as a police officer helped spark this interest in educational access. He said that when he would enter the home of poor, struggling residents, he would ask himself how he could help the families.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 1965, Frank M. Snowden III ’68, then a sophomore, partook in a centuries-old Harvard tradition known as punch: He attended a series of dinners and date events with the hope of becoming a member of the Spee, one of Harvard’s final clubs. Snowden’s punch experience, however, differed from those of the men who came before him. He was inducted to the club in December, making him the first black student to join the Spee—or any final club—at Harvard.
Now a professor of history and history of medicine at Yale, Snowden remembers his undergraduate years positively, despite  “a little bit of turbulence” during the punch process. In an era when racial tensions were palpable on Harvard’s campus, Snowden saw the Spee as a “particularly liberal club,” a reputation that some today say resurfaced when the group admitted its first female members last fall.
Snowden’s punch was a first for final clubs, but the Spee was just one of several historically white institutions where he broke barriers.
Although final club membership had long been restricted to white males, Snowden was not surprised when he received an invitation to punch the Spee. A few of his close friends at Harvard had family connections to the club, and had reached out to him about diversifying its membership before punch season began.
“They thought that it was an important cause to integrate the Spee Club racially, and so they said they could nominate me and asked if I would like to be part of that process,” Snowden said. “I knew that it was segregated until that point and I was hoping to end the segregation.” 
Snowden, then a government concentrator living in Eliot House, went through the punch process with a close group of friends who had also been his classmates at St. Alban’s School in Washington, D.C.
“I told them I wouldn’t join unless Frank could join,” Tom B. Reston ’68, one of Snowden’s high school friends, said. “I think there were other people in the punching class who told them the same thing.”
The sophomore punch class attended a number of events through the fall semester, including touch football games, date functions with Radcliffe women, and dinners in the homes of club alumni. Snowden went through the process without incident, but a few nights before initiations, he received an unexpected visit from Giles M. Whitcomb ’66, then the president of the Spee.
“He said that he thought the club was not quite ready and there was some resistance; the alumni had serious reservations,”  Snowden said. “[Whitcomb] was clearly very embarrassed at his having to do this.”
Whitcomb—who is now deceased—asked Snowden if he would want to punch the club again the next year, when “everything might calm down,” but Snowden refused the offer. “They could punch me and admit me in the normal way, as a sophomore, or not at all,” Snowden said.
Despite resistance from some alumni, Snowden became a member of the Spee at the end of the semester. A 1965 Crimson article titled “Negro Student Accepts Final Club Membership” announced his induction and included responses from leaders of other final clubs, some of whom were still hesitant to integrate their groups. 
“I don't want to say that this is a precedent that all the clubs at Harvard should follow, or that the Delphic Club is definitely going to take in a Negro, or a Chinese, or whatever,” William C. Coleman III ’66, then a senior and president of the Delphic Club, said at the time. “I think as far as the clubs are concerned within the context of Harvard University, this is a good thing. It is an indication that clubs are not as exclusive—in any sense, not just racially—as people have tended to think they are.”
As a member of the Spee, Snowden regularly enjoyed dinner and poker games with his peers at the Mt. Auburn St. clubhouse. He said that any racial tensions “ceased to be an issue” once he was inducted to the group. “I didn’t feel like a second-class member in any way at all,” Snowden said.
Snowden kept a social circle outside of the Spee and enjoyed academic and athletic success as a Harvard undergraduate, but the campus was not an idyllic one for black students in the 1960s. Snowden, who was one of a handful of students who identified as African American in a class of about 1,200, once received death threats over the phone.
“There were these pockets of resistance in the 1960s,” he said. “There were people who didn’t like going to classes with African-Americans, but I don’t want to say that’s my Harvard experience.”

Before Harvard and the Spee, Snowden was the the first black student at St. Alban’s School. The process of integration at the D.C. preparatory school, Snowden says, was  “fraught.” Shortly after Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court decision that desegregated American public schools, Washington’s private schools began to integrate as well. When Snowden enrolled in St. Alban’s as a sixth grader, he felt like a “social experiment,” under enormous pressure to represent African-American students well.
“I was told... that they were going to watch me carefully, and how I did would determine if any other African-Americans would be admitted,” Snowden said. “I had this sense that what I did was hugely important for our race as a whole, which is entirely unrealistic.”
Snowden excelled as a student and athlete, but still felt “let down” by the school, as discrimination continued after his acceptance. Although he was at the top of his class, Snowden could never join the school’s spelling team, as the spelling bees were hosted at segregated schools. According to Boisfeuillet Jones Jr. ’68, Snowden’s high school and college classmate, Snowden set record times as a middle-distance runner at St. Alban’s. Still, he was often excluded from sporting events that took place at segregated schools.
Snowden considered leaving the school during his first four years, but his experience improved as time went on. He took pride in his accomplishments and was supported by friends like Jones and Reston, and by his parents. Snowden’s father, Frank M. Snowden Jr. ’32, received his undergraduate and doctorate degrees from Harvard. A professor and dean at Howard University, the elder Snowden pioneered the study of black people in classical antiquity.
“My father is a classicist, and he told me that one of the messages from Greek literature was that knowledge comes with suffering,” Snowden said. “I think I probably felt that, and I knew that it wouldn’t always be fun.”
Snowden ended his career at St. Alban’s with a group of close friends and a slate of achievements, but he did not return to the school until 40 years after his graduation.
‘Thank Heavens’
As a senior at Harvard, Snowden was inducted to Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest arts and sciences society in the United States, and graduated magna cum laude. The 1968 yearbook lists him as a member of the Phillips Brooks House Association and Harvard’s varsity track team. Snowden earned his doctorate at Oxford University and was a lecturer at the University of London before taking a professorship at Yale. He has published several books about 20th century Italy and the history of disease, including the award-winning “Conquest of Malaria: Italy, 1900-1962.”
Although Snowden is not an active member of the Spee alumni network, he attends reunions at the clubhouse during Harvard-Yale weekend and is enthusiastic about the club’s recent decision to admit women. Last fall, the Spee became the first of the final clubs to go co-ed, a move that was more than a decade in the making, according to former club president Randall J. Winston ’04-’05. Winston’s presidency, like Snowden’s induction to the Spee, made campus news in 2004, as Winston was the first black member to take the position.
“What struck me as inducing pressure was the weight of history,” Winston said. “In staying true to [the Spee’s] legacy and building upon it as a young black man, there was pressure but there was also pride.”
Since graduating, Snowden has been invited back to both St. Alban’s School and the Spee Club to discuss his experiences with those institutions. Snowden said that at both St. Alban’s and the Spee, students—especially African-American students—seemed shocked to hear what he had gone through.

When Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr. left Duke in 1991, he came to Harvard because administrators offered him the chance to build the African and African American Studies Department from the ground up.
At the time, the department had only one tenured professor, Werner M. Sollors. But, the University President and the acting Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the time—Derek C. Bok and Henry Rosovsky—persuaded Gates to pursue his career at Harvard. They told him, Gates said, that Harvard would support him in constructing “the greatest center of African and African American studies in history.”
And Gates knew that commitment was genuine.
“When they were recruiting me, they had all the black faculty at Harvard plus Professor Sollors for a dinner,” Gates said. “Each one went around the table to speak, to say why it was important for me to join. I was in tears, I had never experienced anything like that.”
In the years that followed, Gates attracted a group of superstars in the field—Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Cornel R. West ’74, William J. Wilson—to his department, hosting similar dinners.
Gates said people often ask how he convinces academics to join him at Harvard, how he “bought” them, so to speak. But he argues that individuals worthy of Harvard tenure—“scholars of the first order of eminence,” as faculty guidelines state—cannot be bought.
“No one in this job should be thinking, ‘This is my path to getting rich,’” Economics professor Sendhil Mullainathan said. “We’re very well paid, and comfortable, and life is good, but in some sense you’re in this job because you’re like, ‘I want to do something very big.’”
At the same time, there are other factors—sometimes financial—that bring faculty to and from Harvard. These are highly specific to individual circumstances, and what attracts one professor to Harvard might be the very factor that prompts another to leave.
Administrators focus on recruiting and retaining top-notch faculty, sometimes incentivizing them to stay with waived down-payments on mortgages, prime spots on the years-long child care waitlist, or honors such as the prestigious Radcliffe professorships. Other times, though, Harvard cannot offer some professors what they need to stay: a job for a spouse, proximity to an aging relative, or significant laboratory space and equipment.
Indeed, star departures in recent years indicate that Harvard may not always have what every professor wants. In the fall of 2015, for example, Raj Chetty, a MacArthur-winning economist projected to receive the Nobel Prize, traded Harvard’s ivy tower for Stanford’s sunny, buzzing campus.
And Harvard’s administrators have noticed.
“When we hear about somebody that’s being recruited by another institution, we talk to them,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said. “What’s going on in your life? How can we make your life here even better? What are the issues that are coming up? And why is that you even want to think about leaving our wonderful environment?”
Julio Frenk, former dean of the School of Public Health, turned down several job offers from Harvard’s peer universities. That is, until the University of Miami offered him its presidency.
“I was more than happy at Harvard, and anyone can tell you… I was really enjoying my role as dean,” Frenk said, adding, “I was not planning to leave Harvard at all.”
For Frenk, the decision to leave depended on “a unique combination of factors”: good timing, a job offer geared toward his research interests, and the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of one of his mentors, University President Drew G. Faust.
“I don’t think I would have accepted an offer in any other place,” Frenk said. “There were zero push factors. It was the pull of Miami.”
Frenk can count himself among the faculty members who have recently left Harvard to pursue their careers elsewhere.
Smith said he sees the ebb and flow of the faculty as varied, highly specific, and constant. Over the past couple of years, Harvard’s peer institutions have “poached” top professors in fields ranging from history to the study of religion.
“A lot of our peer institutions right now are deciding to spend some money and try to recruit away many of our extremely talented and exciting and successful faculty,” Smith said. “It’s a big part of my time.”
Last semester, History professor Niall C.D. Ferguson announced that he would leave Harvard for Stanford’s Hoover Institution, an American public policy think tank that will not require Ferguson to teach.
“As I said when my appointment at Stanford was announced, this was not a sideways move from one History department to another,” Ferguson wrote in an email, adding, “My move really wasn't about that kind of thing, which is not to deny that Stanford made me a very attractive offer!”
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said professors’ departures are inevitable, but they do indicate the depth of talent at Harvard. 
"Let me just say that I would be much more concerned if other universities weren’t trying to recruit our faculty,” he said.
Available lab and office space and opportunities for expansion can factor into a professor’s decision to remain at Harvard, or to leave. Economics Department Chair David I. Laibson ’88 said a lack of space for the department  “is certainly one of the challenges we faced in the past in these retention events.”
And for Physics Department Chair Masahiro Morii, concerns arise around Harvard’s lack of clarity about future opportunities for physical expansion. He said the department has faced difficulties in hiring new research-based professors because of limited office and laboratory space.
“You don’t hire somebody senior and say, ‘Okay, come in with a couple students and postdocs and then [sit] there for the next 35 years,’” Morii said. “They all want some potential for expanding and making their research program bigger.”
Harvard’s tenure policy—which offers academic job security only at the full, rather than at the associate, professor level—also may influence tenure-track professors to accept offers elsewhere.
“It’s a very stressful number of years as you’re trying to get tenure, and people can get discouraged,” Faust said. “It’s often possible to get a very nice tenure job at a different institution earlier in career or slimmer in publication record. And so I think that’s an attraction, too.”
Though Smith said administrators aim to provide competitive benefits for faculty, there are lines he will not cross.
“I’m not a fan of teaching relief, I’m not looking to hire faculty who don’t actually want to teach undergraduate students,” Smith said. “You can get those deals at other institutions—those are not deals you’ll get here.”
In order to defend against outside recruiters and retain its faculty members, Harvard capitalizes on work-life factors that could give it a competitive edge.
 Many professors say Harvard’s location is a strong asset that the University can leverage in the hiring process. For faculty with spouses, the large metropolitan job market—not only in academia but also in technology, medicine, and law—entices couples to come, Morii said. When Morii arrived at Harvard as an assistant professor in 2000, for instance, his wife was still a postdoctoral fellow. Choosing Boston, with its many universities and colleges, he said, was better than going to an isolated state university.
“Imagine what it’s like at [Cornell]—that’s an excellent university… but it’s in the middle of—it’s in Ithaca, upstate New York,” Government and Sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol said. “Harvard is in a metropolitan area, so it really should have fewer problems in arranging opportunities for dual-career couples than a lot of major American universities.”
Some also appreciate the Boston area as a place to start a family, given its highly-ranked public school districts.
“We could anticipate how living here as parents of teenagers would be great,” said Michèle Lamont, a Sociology professor who came to Harvard from Princeton in 2003. “Recently, our daughter took the subway to go to the beach by herself with her friends. She would never have been able to do that in Princeton.”
The Cambridge area is also expensive. The average single-family home costs nearly $1.5 million, and it’s a seller’s market, with the average house going for 107 percent of its list price as of last March, according to real estate agent Charles P. Cherney ’89 of Hammond Residential Real Estate. So Harvard, like most peer institutions in metropolitan areas, offers faculty housing assistance.
Lamont said Harvard offered two faculty members—recently promoted in the Sociology Department—loans without interest for housing. In other cases, Harvard will help with the initial down payment for a mortgage, Morii said.
“Housing plays a large part in all [recruits’] consideration to come to Harvard,” Susan Keller, director for faculty real estate and special projects, wrote in an emailed statement provided by Harvard Spokesperson Brigid O'Rourke. According to Keller’s statement, Faculty Real Estate Services offers two condominium options, developed on University land, priced more than 20 percent below fair market value for eligible faculty.
In addition to housing, childcare costs can also be sky-high in the Boston area. There are six Harvard-affiliated child care centers on campus, but fees can balloon up to $34,944 for a single child per year. And even obtaining that expensive childcare can be difficult; according to Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer, the six daycares have just 380 combined slots. Individual centers can receive as many as half a thousand prospective applicants.
Harvard has in recent years established programs to subsidize childcare, such as Ladder ACCESS, which provides up to $20,000 to eligible faculty with children under the age of 6.
And for top talent, the University maintains a “Provost’s waiting list,” created specifically for recruitment and retention, according to Singer. Highly sought-after individuals placed on the list will be given priority for spots in Harvard’s daycare center.
“We work with the deans, and if they deem individuals a high enough priority, we will work with our friends in the Work/Life office to work with the centers,” Singer said. “Relative to the size of the number of slots in the centers, this is a very small piece of it.”

But childcare and housing are not why most faculty come to Harvard.
Indeed, the network of colleagues across fields continues to draw academics. Chemistry professor Daniel G. Nocera, who left MIT for Harvard three years ago, said that Harvard’s emphasis on the liberal arts and a strong faculty and alumni base compelled him to make the move.
“I wanted to get more engaged with the non-science research piece, and that’s the reason I moved to Harvard,” Nocera said. “And I will say, it’s worked out unbelievably well.” 
Smith, the FAS Dean, said another draw are Harvard’s many graduate and professional schools, which offer faculty more opportunities  to interact with students and practitioners in their field.
One academic “secret weapon” Harvard also employs in recruiting faculty are the Radcliffe professorships, Singer said.
Created by Faust when she was dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the professorships offer new hires the chance to pursue independent research for four semesters of their first five years at Harvard without teaching. This setup gives faculty time to focus on their research, a very attractive proposition for many.
According to Radcliffe spokesperson Alison Franklin, when a school’s dean identifies a “good fit” for a Radcliffe professorship, the dean can contact Radcliffe about a potential joint appointment. If Radcliffe administrators agree with the dean, the candidate receives an offer for a professorship at the institute.
In the end, though, the reasons for coming to, staying at, or leaving Harvard vary from case to case.
“There are personal issues, like Princeton is different than Cambridge, Palo Alto is different than Cambridge, and people have two-body problems and things like that,” Mullainathan, the Economics professor, said. “But I’ve got to imagine that Harvard is so committed to being a first-class research institution...that I would be shocked that if they didn’t make it that the research output could be as good here as there. Because who else are we going to bet on, if we’re not going to bet on the best people in the field?”

Leading up to Commencement, many Harvard seniors worry about finding the perfect dinner venue, or balancing their final days at the College between family and friends.
But some, like Edgar J. Orozco ’16, worry if their families can make it to Commencement at all.
Orozco’s parents, who are Mexican immigrants, saved money for nearly two years to buy plane tickets from California to Boston. His father is a construction worker and his mother is unemployed. Neither one has ever visited the east coast.
Orozco said other students have taken care to be welcoming and include him in events when families visit campus—such as move-in day or parents weekends.
“But that doesn’t mean that you don’t kind of feel this isolation,” he said. “It kind of gets shoved in your face almost that you are different from the people around you and that your circumstances are different.”
Though the Financial Aid Office offers various programs for low-income students to offset Commencement costs, some students say the total price tag leading up to graduation detracts from the typically joyous occasion.

For Orozco, the financial burden brought on by Commencement would have been more difficult to shoulder had his father’s boss not offered to pay for his parents’ plane tickets.
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16 lives within driving distance, but she still felt the financial strain of the weeks leading up to graduation. Before students sit in Tercentenary Theatre decked out in their caps and gowns, they participate in senior week events—one last hurrah for the graduating class.
But those events come with a price. This year, the senior soiree cocktail party cost $40. The moonlight cruise around Boston Harbor cost $30. And the Last Chance Dance, where seniors experience the nostalgia of a similar dance from the beginning freshman year, cost an additional $30.
Students eligible for the Students Events Fund, a program that provides free event tickets to low-income students, do not have to worry about paying for senior week events. There is normally a cap of five free events per semester for SEF-eligible students, but Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue said there is no limit during senior week.
Suslovic, who gets near-full financial aid and has worked up to three jobs at a time in the past, was SEF-eligible for the past several years. But this year she was not, and therefore missed out on certain memorable senior week events.
Had she been SEF-eligible this year, Suslovic said, “I would have definitely just felt, I think, more comfortable about the week overall.”
“There are plenty of free events that happen but I think that there’s still a large social emphasis on the events that are ticketed,” Suslovic added.
Students are often enticed to shell out money beyond the mandatory $40 cap and gown rental. Suslovic said she has felt a social pressure to purchase extra mementos, including $130 yearbooks, $35 class photos, and class rings, which can cost several hundred dollars.
“I didn’t even let myself consider getting a class ring or yearbook,” Suslovic said, adding that she is budgeting her money because she intends to go straight to graduate school and find an apartment.
Besides the extra keepsakes, accommodations are an unavoidable expense. Hotels in particular are pricey during Commencement week; “stupid expensive,” Orozco said.
Hotels near Harvard Square cost more during Commencement because of high demand. One night at the Charles Hotel starts at $1,000 compared to an average rate of $350 during other times of the year, and each reservation requires a three-night minimum stay, according to brand marketing manager Greg S. Bodenlos.
The Charles Hotel is already taking reservations for next year’s Commencement, Bodenlos added. Hotel Veritas, where rates are sometimes as low as $200 a night, have basic rooms priced at $775 during Commencement. Concierge Megan B. Grosovsky recommends booking more than six months in advance, although the hotel does not allow cancellations or provide refunds. Normally, Hotel Veritas allows cancellations two days prior to arrival. 
“If we took reservations three or four years in advance, we might see demand as soon as somebody gets into Harvard,” Bodenlos said.
While Bodenlos may have just been hypothesizing, some freshmen—especially those who come from low-income backgrounds—are already thinking about Commencement expenses.
“It’s definitely a worry of mine. Looking towards the future, I don’t really know how I’m going to fund all these expenditures,” Diana C. Barreto ’19, a first-generation college student, said.

To shoulder the burden of pricey accommodations, the Financial Aid Office and the Office of Student Life offer a parent guest program to students who receive significant financial aid, according to Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.
Administrators contact students about the program, which provides 60 beds in upperclassman Houses to parents for $10 per night, according Friederich. Administrators for the program, which Friedrich said has existed for 10 years, lottery the rooms because the number of beds are limited. Currier is one of the houses where families can stay, according to House Administrator Patricia G. Pepper.
However, Suslovic and Orozco said they had never heard of the program. They said they thought the Financial Aid Office lacks proper communication with students, and that many people only hear of assistance for Commencement through word of mouth.
Last year, Sara H. Hankins ’15, submitted an itemized list of her family’s anticipated expenses to the Financial Aid Office to apply for up to $2,000 in funding, which she received. Hankins, who is SEF-eligible, was even offered a loan to purchase a class ring. Though she was impressed with administrators’ generosity, she had heard about the opportunity not through the office, but through a friend.
“I remember thinking ‘people don’t know about this’ when I was applying for it,” Hankins said. “To students who aren’t really tuned into financial aid opportunities, they probably wouldn’t ever know.”
But for the first time this year, low-income students were contacted about this informal program that assists with expected Commencement-related expenses, according to Donahue. In previous years, students had to reach out to the Financial Aid office directly if they needed help.
“It’s becoming a little bit more formalized as we realized that it’s actually best to reach out to the students directly whom we know are going to be eligible for that benefit,” Donahue said.
Although students were contacted early in the spring semester, some still were not fully knowledgeable of the programs available.
“Maybe they reached out to me. Maybe I’m not eligible. Maybe they reached out and I didn’t see it,” Orozco said. “I definitely didn’t hear about it.”
Donahue and Friedrich encourage all students to reach out to their financial aid officers to discuss any concerns, and emphasize that they can always find some way to help. But for some, having that sit-down conversation is difficult.
“It really takes a while for us to kind of realize that we should be asking for help,” Orozco said. “It’s not something that’s necessarily been in the culture that I and many of my low-income, traditionally disadvantaged friends kind of grew up with.”
Some non-SEF eligible students who are still struggling financially did not feel that they could ask for help.
“I think that if I were still SEF-eligible, I would be more comfortable reaching out to them,” Suslovic said. “I think I would just feel uncomfortable asking for something when it wasn’t necessarily for me.”
Students said the Financial Aid Office could be more transparent at the start of senior year about how costly Commencement can be. Suslovic said she could have gone to more senior week events if she had known about the expenses ahead of time.
“A lot of the costs are not made clear to you until the week before all of these events, so there’s not time to budget for any of them,” Suslovic said. “If I had known about these costs at the beginning of senior year, I would have been able to save more money or at least spend my money differently.”
Suslovic said she wishes the Financial Aid Office contacted all seniors about holding office hours, where they could discuss any concerns. Orozco said he would have found a physical Commencement package detailing all of the costs immensely helpful.
The Financial Aid Office has incorporated student feedback into new initiatives, such as the creation of  the First Generation Program, according to Ted J. White ’17, former president of the First Generation Student Union. For the first time, the program is offering free professional portraits to this year’s graduating seniors.
With these efforts, White is confident the Financial Aid Office is making improvements.
“Since our program was created, they’re becoming pretty aware of the different financial barriers,” White said. “I’m pretty optimistic about where it’s going to go.”

While Harvard freshmen spend part of their spring semester finalizing blocking groups, performing rituals to game the randomized upperclassman Housing assignments, and anxiously awaiting their fate on Housing day, their Yale counterparts trade excited speculation for certainty from day one.
On Housing Day, celebrated the Thursday before spring break, Harvard freshmen wait eagerly for a knock on their door to signal their Housing assignment for the next three years. For Yale freshmen, their fate comes much earlier and with less fanfare—the college notifies them of their four-year housing assignment weeks before move-in day.
At first glance, these two housing systems look familiar. Both sort students randomly into one of 12 dorms—called “Houses” at Harvard and “Residential Colleges” at Yale—and both feature a centrally-located cluster of freshman buildings: the Yard for Harvard and Old Campus for Yale.
Despite these broad similarities, though, the two housing models differ in significant ways. In addition to the earlier assignment to residential colleges, Yale freshmen are limited to students in their residential college when choosing sophomore year roommates. Harvard freshmen, on the other hand, choose their sophomore living companions from among the entire class, a process that offers a broader choice and, some say, adds stress to the first-year experience.
Harvard administrators have considered adopting the central idiosyncrasy of Yale’s model—the assignment of freshmen to their residential college before they arrive on campus—many times over the course of the House system’s more than 80-year history. And while Harvard administrators report no definitive plans to make a switch anytime soon, the Yale pre-assignment system has again surfaced as a topic of discussion in recent years.
In a 2001 report, then-dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote that administrators “are asked, from time to time, to consider Yale's system of random preassignment of students to the Yale Colleges.”
Although the report predicted that a change would limit student choice and have a negligible effect on freshmen integration with House dining halls, administrators have not taken the idea off the table. Over the past decade, the College has alternated between directly advocating the switch, opposing any change, and remaining undecided on the matter.
The College deliberated on switching to the Yale pre-assignment model in a spring 2009 “Report on Harvard House Renewal,” which wrote that a subcommittee “discussed moving to Yale’s model, in which freshmen are assigned to a House before they arrive, but did not come to a consensus about the efficacy of this model at Harvard.”
While the report on House renewal ultimately came to no definitive conclusion, previous reports have more strongly advocated the Yale model. A spring 2004 “Curricular Review” of the College suggested that “freshmen be assigned to their upperclass House upon arrival” to improve the “sense of community” at Harvard.
In a reversal of the 2004 report’s recommendation, a December 2005 “Report of the Standing Committee on Advising and Counseling” evaluated the pros and cons of pre-assignment to Houses, ultimately discouraging any change.
A separate 2007 “Report of the First-Year Experience Planning Committee Prepared for the Dean of Harvard College” came to a similar conclusion, reporting that freshmen didn’t prefer housing alternatives such as pre-assignment to the current system.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who sat on the committee that prepared the 2007 report, said that the upperclassman peer advising system could sufficiently link freshmen to the Houses.
According to Stephen Davis, head of Pierson College at Yale, the college often receives inquiries about the workings of their residential model, though he said he had not heard of specific conversations about adopting the model at Harvard.
Faculty Dean of Adams House, John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said discussions of a possible switch to Yale’s housing model have “ebb[ed] and flow[ed]” during his time at the College. Palfrey cited the absence of a “clear right answer” as the reason the College has never taken the step to adopt Yale’s pre-assignment practice.
Like the reports, Palfrey’s own views on Yale’s pre-assignment system have changed over time. While he told The Crimson in 2004 that he saw no reason to change Harvard’s model, he said his views have “shifted slightly” since then—a result of concerns over what he considers inadequate freshman year social life.
“The Yard doesn’t have a good way of making good parties itself. It’s probably even less well structured than the Houses are,” said Palfrey, who emphasized that freshmen he spoke to valued the broad pool of potential sophomore roommates, a choice not afforded in Yale’s model. “If there were a way to get the students into the Houses and some of the bigger parties that the Houses have and some of the bigger events that the Houses have earlier that would be good.”
Dingman reiterated Palfrey’s concern about inadequate social accommodations for freshmen in the Yard. “We don’t have any one large gathering place to see and be seen,” Dingman said.
References to a switch in the reports of the 2000s emphasized potential benefits to advising and the academic life of the undergraduate population. In recent years, as discussions on social life have taken center stage, conversations about a pre-assignment switch have focused on possible social benefits. Those concerns have made their way into closed-door meetings between administrators and Harvard’s unrecognized final clubs.
A set of confidential meeting notes from two spring 2015 meetings, distributed by Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, expressed concern about the “social isolation” of the first year and recommended that College administrators “find ways to connect students to the Houses earlier.”
Months later, in the fall of 2015, Lowell House tutor Eli B. Schachar met informally with undergraduate leaders of male and female clubs. In an email to top College administrators, Schachar summarized his conversations with club leaders, recommending that the College move closer to Yale’s residential model.
William A. Greenlaw ’17, the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee chair who has made student social life a focus of his tenure, said he thought Yale’s housing model might address perceived problems with the freshmen experience.
“In my mind, it would immediately solve a lot of vexing problems of social spaces," Greenlaw said.
While not all Harvard undergraduates have expressed Greenlaw’s level of support, many are receptive to proposed changes.
William N. Corbett ’16 said he was struck by the show of enthusiasm from upperclassmen in his then-girlfriend’s residential college that greeted her on move-in day at Yale.
“I remember being like ‘oh my god, this is so welcoming,’” he said. “[At Harvard,] you have these little clusters that are the blocking groups and nodes that are the people and it’s much sparser, whereas at Yale it’s like the house is much more integrated,” Corbett said.
He also said blocking at Harvard can be a stressful experience. The College’s 2007 report on the first-year student experience found that 38 percent of the Classes of 2008 and 2009 reported a “stressful” or “very stressful” blocking experience.
Yale graduate Joanna Cornell, now a proctor in Thayer, said she observed the trials of the blocking experience in her Harvard entryway.
“There’s always going to be drama with rooming, and there’s certainly drama with rooming every year at Yale as well, but I think it’s so much more escalated here,” she said.
Proponents of the Harvard housing model, however, argue that blocking allows for both more flexibility in choosing roommates and the festive fun of Housing Day.
Mather Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten said the College-wide celebration is the most popular event in the Houses, and he would be reluctant to give it up.
Still, Rosengarten acknowledged several problems with Harvard’s current system, including the isolation that students without blocking groups may face, and the difficulty of the sophomore transition to the Houses. Last fall, Mather House piloted a sophomore advising system, in which sophomores were paired with upperclassmen advisers in the House.
“I think it has been brought up at times,” Rosengarten said, referring to a pre-assignment housing system. “It is a model that people have been thinking about, because of the issues of the sophomore transition.”
Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard, said there are advantages to having resources and staff dedicated only to freshmen.
“There [are] a lot of needs that are particular to the first year experience, both academic, socially, extracurricularly,” he said. “So… we have proctors and resident deans and a whole staff at the FDO who solely focus on the freshman experience.”
One of the more significant differences in the Yale housing model is the undergraduate advising system, a model that administrators have largely avoided. Instead of living alongside graduate students, Yale freshmen reside with freshman counselors, or “FroCos,” who are seniors at the college. Like proctors, FroCos are compensated through reduced room and board costs. Cornell was a freshman counselor during her time at Yale.
“I think when you’re really close in age with people you’re advising, I think you are seen less as an adult that people respect whereas now I feel like I am making friends with the kids but I’m also kind of like their mother and I’m also their adviser,” she said.
Cornell added that, as a proctor, breaking up parties and making attendees throw away alcohol is standard procedure, a far cry from her experience as a FroCo where she would only “make someone dump out their booze” in extreme situations.
“I would say our role as freshman counselors is not usually as disciplinarian,” Justin Young, a FroCo in Branford College, said. “ We have a very sensible [alcohol] policy in that we really focus more on safety than discipline.”
Dingman said Harvard’s stricter alcohol policy—alcohol is forbidden in freshman dorms—may contribute to problems with freshman drinking. For example, he said students may consume hard alcohol before College-monitored events.
“I think we are asking ourselves how could we go about this differently,” Dingman said. “ It’s very much on our mind because we can’t turn our back on the law, but maybe we can learn from other institutions.”
While Palfrey is open to comparing other residential systems, he said students and administrators have not expressed a strong desire in favor of a switch.
Speculation of a switch, Palfrey said, “comes and... goes, but I have not seen it become such a strong push from anybody’s perspective that the College wants to change dramatically.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 23, 2016, at 12:05 p.m.
Harvard Management Company CEO Stephen Blyth will take a temporary medical leave of absence starting May 23, the University announced Monday.
Robert A. Ettl, HMC’s Chief Operating Officer who joined the company in 2008, will serve as the interim CEO of Harvard’s investment arm. 
Blyth’s absence comes in the middle of his second year at the helm of HMC, which manages Harvard’s $37.6 billion endowment. Under Blyth’s tenure, HMC has taken a number of steps to change its investment strategies and match returns that peer institutions earn on their endowments. In the last few years, Harvard’s endowment has grown at a slower rate than the investment pools of several peer institutions, including Princeton, MIT, and Yale.
“We have a highly-experienced executive team at HMC and, together with Bob, they will provide strong leadership in Stephen's absence” Paul J. Finnegan, Chair of HMC’s Board of Directors and the treasurer of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, wrote in a statement.  “We look forward to Stephen's return to the company, and wish him well as he returns to full health."
The University has not specified a reason for the medical leave of absence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s an old joke that Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for alumni affairs and development, likes to tell about Harvard fundraising.
Two people, she says, are stuck on a desert island. One of them starts panicking, but the other one is completely calm. So the panicked one turns to the calm one and asks: “Why are you so relaxed?”
The calm one, as Rogers tells it, says, “I went to Harvard. The development office will find me wherever I am.”
Rogers’s joke, meant to lampoon Harvard’s famed fundraising apparatus, belies a certain truth: When it comes to raising money, the University doggedly pursues its donors.
Harvard’s most recent fundraising drive is no exception.
The University publicly launched its “One Harvard” capital campaign in 2013, the first fundraising drive to encompass each of Harvard’s 12 schools.  The worst of 2008’s financial crisis largely behind it, the University set its sights high. It would aim to bring in $6.5 billion, more than any other higher education institution had ever raised in one fundraising drive before. 
To match the historic figure were historic goals: replenished financial aid offerings, renewed undergraduate housing, and a new engineering campus in Allston.
Now, less than halfway through the public portion of that fundraising effort, Harvard has already surpassed its overall goal.  With about two years left in its drive, Harvard’s fundraising officials are now focusing their energies on raising money for still-unfilled “buckets” of need, instead of raising the overall goal.
But that’s easier said than done. Putting billions in the right place and towards the right priorities can be another matter altogether. Many of the most generous alumni come to the University with interests of their own—interests that don’t always align with Harvard’s fundraising priorities.
Rogers’s joke about finding donors on desert islands seems more relevant than ever. With two years left in the campaign, the perpetual dance between the donor and the University has become all the more complex, as Harvard must increasingly tailor the money it receives to its institutional priorities.

To hear University President Drew G. Faust explain it, fundraising is somewhat like matchmaking. Donors have their interests, Harvard its own, and Faust works to design gifts that will that satisfy both parties.
“We don’t pick money out of people’s pockets,” Faust said. “Whatever gets funded, it’s because someone has decided they want to do this, so we want to find something that makes them feel great about their philanthropy but also advances the purposes of the institution.”
A capital campaign is a time for a university to articulate those institutional purposes, defining a vision for its future. Once the campaign starts, the school must energize donors about those priorities.
But as the initial excitement of the campaign fades and the most glamorous priorities receive funding, Harvard faces the uphill battle of filling in what some may consider less-enticing gaps.
“Some things are easier to raise for than others. Once you’ve raised what you’re going to spend on something and you try to steer people in another direction, they may or may not be open to being steered,” said Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
Many of the campaign’s largest priorities, including House renewal and the new science and engineering complex in Allston, are among those that still need the money. But at the same time, many of Harvard’s most enthusiastic alumni have already come forward and the campaign’s largest donations are likely behind it, according to several donors involved in fundraising efforts, including Paul J. Zofnass ’69 and Gerald R. Jordan ’61.
Some fundraising priorities are generally more appealing to donors than others. For example, because Harvard likely won’t rename undergraduate Houses anytime soon, Jordan said it can be hard to attract large gifts for House renewal.
“Everybody loves to donate an endowed professorship, but I suspect we’re running out of professors to be endowed,” Jordan said.
When the University has to raise money for the targeted priorities, fundraising—an already complicated task—becomes even more intricate.
“While many supporters of Harvard will rally to the goals that have been established, there are others that have strong preferences of their own and unless those preferences are inappropriate in themselves, then Harvard should be happy to have those funds,”  Peter L. Malkin ’55, a major donor, said. “It means Harvard has its work cut out for it to encourage people to give where it thinks the needs are.”

Coaxing donors to fund a University priority is a complicated dance; Harvard must respect the wishes of donors while also pushing its institutional priorities.
Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60, a member of the Boston Campaign Committee, has his own saying about Harvard fundraising.
“The one phrase that a lot of us like to use is, ‘We don’t give to Harvard. We give through Harvard,’” Buttenweiser, who was a Crimson editor, said.
With 12 schools, thousands of professors, and countless research projects happening at the University, it’s fairly easy for donors to find a program that they want to support.
“Harvard is so big and so vast that if you’re interested in a certain area, there’s always something that needs money,” Mitchell L. Dong ’75 said.
In philanthropy, those giving the money ultimately hold the cards, Zofnass, who is a major Harvard benefactor, said. While Harvard consistently tries to funnel small-time donors towards unrestricted gift funds, for the bigger benefactors, the University is more willing to compromise.
While not every donation is earmarked perfectly to Harvard’s priorities, Zofnass said, “the alternative is not to give anything, and that’s not efficient either.”
“You need to get someone to write the check,” Zofnass said.
When Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow initially asked Michael R. Klein to donate to a specific program for the Law School’s $305 million capital campaign, for example, he declined. Instead, Klein elected to give $15 million to the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, which will be renamed the Berkman-Klein Center.
“Frankly, this is something I had decided to do rather than things they suggested,” Klein said.
As in Klein’s case, the autonomy large donors enjoy means that some gifts go towards programs outside Harvard’s typical fundraising dossier. In April, the Lee Kum Kee family—whose ancestor invented oyster sauce in 1888—gave $21 million to the Harvard School of Public Health to establish the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness. The center’s initial efforts will include constructing a “happiness index” and studying the effects of social media on mood.
“That was an interesting example, because the donors had a clear notion of happiness as a focus,” Faust said of the gift. “It kind of congealed around a shared set of goals that emerged as plausible ones for a gift.”
A potential donor with a narrow pet project in mind might be encouraged to broaden the scope of their gift, or a benefactor interested in an already-filled “bucket” might be redirected to an area of greater need, Faust said.
“Someone may say to you, ‘I want to give a professorship in 19th-century German poetry,’ and I would likely say to that person, ‘Can we broaden that a bit?” Faust said.
But a request like Faust’s—to broaden the nature of a gift—does not always appease both sides. Harvard may be able to redirect small-time donors towards unrestricted or general gifts, but with the larger donors, Zofnass said, Harvard’s hands can sometimes be tied.
“On my gift for the trees, I think the trees are very important. I think the education it provides is very important, but that’s me,” said Zofnass, an environmentalist who funded a tree walking path in New York City’s Central Park.  “I have to believe that there’s somebody who says, ‘You know that’s a really nice idea, but that’s not what we need right now, can you convince him or her to do something else with it?’”
“But the answer for big gifts will probably be no,” Zofnass added. “If the gift is large enough, the University will do anything it can to make it happen.”
Still, aside from Harvard’s banner priorities, donors have found plenty of niche buckets to fill.
At the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, hedge fund manager Louis M. Bacon donated $3.5 million in 2014 to found the eponymous Louis Bacon Environmental Leadership Program, funding fellowships for students interested in conservation.
And at the Law School, a gift of an undisclosed amount from hedge fund manager Mitchell R. Julis created a program in Jewish and Israeli law last November. Julis, in a press release, said his family’s Jewish heritage partially motivated his donation.
Ultimately, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said, a donation is a donation—and every dollar counts.
“I don’t believe I’ve come across a situation where a donor wanted to give money and we didn’t need it,” Garber said. “The more common issue is we may have something that's a very high priority, something where there’s an urgent need, and the donors are less interested in that area than in another area where we already have pretty good funding.”

To be sure, Harvard will try to direct donors away from gifts that would significantly depart from the University’s goals. And sometimes, with concerted effort, fundraisers are able to get a donor more in step with campaign priorities.
Dong said he decided to endow a professorship of Epidemiology at the School of Public Health after a conversation with the dean there, and Buttenweiser recalls how he endowed a University professorship after then-University President Neil L. Rudenstine approached him and asked about it. Donors may also decide to give the University unrestricted gifts, allowing Harvard to use a donation as it sees fit.
According to Faust, the University thinks carefully before creating or significantly augmenting research programs because of gifts. If a subject is too arcane or narrow, it can be difficult to convince faculty to work on the project; instead, Harvard tries to guide donors to fund already-popular or promising programs.
“Faculty, especially tenured faculty, do what they want,” Faust said when asked about the University's involvement in research. “Sometimes they might be lured towards a subject because there are resources there, but more often they decide what it is they’re interested in and try to generate the resources to support that.”
And in some cases, Rogers said, the cost of perpetually funding a newly-established program may outweigh the benefit of the donation.
“Sometimes I have to say, ‘I just don't believe that we can make you happy with your philanthropy,’” Rogers said. “And the most important thing is for you to really be happy with your philanthropy, so you might want to think of someplace else or see if we have something else. It’s a rare conversation, but it’s definitely one that I’ve had more than once.”
Harvard must be careful when accepting gifts, Rogers said, because endowed funds cannot be legally redirected to areas of greater utility.
“There are some donors who have their own ideas and things they want to accomplish, and as you can imagine, sometimes we can accept those gifts and sometimes we cannot,” she said.
In any case, Rogers said, Harvard plans to continue its capital campaign until 2018, scoping out first-time donors on “desert islands” and drawing more money out of repeat ones.
“The big number is great. It’s wonderful. Don't get me wrong, we feel very proud that we're going along so well,” Rogers said about the overall campaign goal. “But we do have a range of things where we’re not done, and we really, really want to look at that.”

When Alison J. Simmons arrived in Harvard’s Philosophy Department in 1994, there were two senior women on the faculty who had been hired with tenure from other universities. But Simmons—who would become the first woman to receive tenure from within the department—remembers feeling grateful that she could even call those two colleagues.
“It’s weird to say that, because I was walking in thinking, ‘why do I feel fortunate?’ There were two women out of 18 and I felt fortunate,” she said. It was a time when the vast majority of tenured faculty were white men. Simmons found it intimidating to break into that environment.
The proportion of female faculty in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has grown over the course of the past two decades. But many of the cultural barriers Simmons and other women faced in those days persist. And, as Harvard tries to diversify its senior faculty, a challenge remains: women junior faculty—associate and assistant professors—leave FAS’s tenure track at higher rates than do men.
At an FAS faculty meeting in October, administrators presented what they considered “troubling” statistics. Sixty-six percent of women who began their associate professorships between fall 2003 and spring 2012 remained at Harvard for the final stage of the tenure process, compared to 78 percent of men. A third of women in the process, then, were leaving Harvard, and the gap between the percentage of men and women who stayed was widening.
According to the most recent University-wide report on faculty, the disproportionate attrition of tenure-track women in FAS is a long-term trend. Administrators, department chairs, and female faculty who went through Harvard’s infamously rigorous tenure track themselves have offered various hypotheses for these women’s departures.
Several women who have left Harvard’s tenure track declined to comment on their reasons for leaving.
But many current faculty and administrators agree that a combination of formal processes and informal forces disadvantage women on the FAS tenure track, pushing some to leave before they come up for final review. And while the University is taking steps to tackle gender inequality in its senior ranks, faculty question the extent to which it can shape departmental cultures and counteract prevailing social norms.
A NUMBERS PROBLEM 
Solving the attrition problem is a puzzle. Women in FAS are already a significant minority, which many say discourages women who feel excluded and overburdened from continuing their careers at Harvard.
Indeed, for Sociology professor Mary C. Brinton—the chair of a committee charged with monitoring the environment for women and brainstorming improvements—the problem is one of “critical mass.”
“It’s not that you necessarily have to have a lot of other women around, but if the numbers are so small then it kind of perpetuates itself,” Brinton said. “You’ve got to get beyond that sort of token phenomenon—you’ve got to get up to 30 or 40 percent.”
Currently, 28 percent of ladder faculty in FAS—tenured or tenure-track professors—are women.
While the percentage of women ladder faculty has increased since 2006, the year after Harvard’s tenure track was established, there still exist stark differences in the gender composition of FAS’s three academic divisions and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Whereas 34 percent of tenured professors and 63 percent of tenure-track professors in the Arts and Humanities are women, only 15 percent of tenured professors and 17 percent of those on the tenure-track are women in SEAS. 
Some departments, like Economics, are notorious for having fewer women. Economics Department Chair David I. Laibson ’88 is concerned that the department has just two senior women. Two, he said, is “woefully too few.”
And at least one department—mathematics, which still does not have tenure-track faculty—has no women in its senior ranks.
Part of the disparity in some fields—particularly those in math and science—stems from earlier pipeline issues, said Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Elena M. Kramer, a former chair of the FAS committee on women. Fewer women in these fields receive Ph.D.s to begin with, resulting in applicant pools for junior positions that similarly lack gender diversity. Kramer said the committee conducts demographic studies to put pressure on these departments to ensure their faculties reflect the gender composition of their broader fields.
The committee’s analyses indicated that divisions with low representation of women also experienced the highest attrition rates of female junior faculty in recent years.
High attrition rates among women often mean that men continue to dominate certain departments. To counter this trend, FAS has tried to increase the proportion of women serving on administrative committees such as search committees. But departmental service is the least important component of the tenure review process, and the increased representation can often have “perverse” effects, Kramer said.
“Every committee wants to have women on the committee, every conference wants to have women in the conference, every journal wants to have women reviewing articles for them—you’ve got fewer women, so they’re going to be stretched more thin because of that,” assistant Philosophy professor Susanna Rinard said. “I think one thing that’s really important to learn is what to say no to and how to say no to those things.”
‘GOOD OLD BOY NETWORKS’
Low numbers of women in certain departments reinforce what Government and Sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol calls “macho cultures” that favor men over women and can lead junior-level women to feel uncomfortable.
Physics Chair Masahiro Morii said he has personally witnessed this reality in the sciences division.
“When people say the male professors don’t take female scientists as seriously as they take male scientists, I think it is true,” Morii said. “Just because we grew up within a culture where the image of scientists we learned and absorbed as a child, they are always guys with glasses and white coats—and it’s never going to go away completely.”
Mentors are critical in changing these perceptions, but with few women in the first place, female role models can be scarce. And historically, Harvard has not generally had a strong culture of mentorship.
“Ten years ago, the thought that you would really mentor faculty here was crazy,” said Judith D. Singer, the senior vice provost for faculty development and diversity. “I mean, mentor a Harvard faculty member? They come knowing what they should do.”
But male junior faculty have long benefited from informal relationships with their male senior colleagues, Singer said, whether it was going out for beers, playing card games, or traveling to conferences together—social interactions that would bring the younger men into a broader professional network of scholars across academia.
“There was an era in which the female faculty at Harvard didn’t get any of that,” Singer added. “It created this very interesting dynamic where mentoring was something that the guys always got, but it wasn’t called mentoring.”
When women are left out of these “good old boy networks of transmission,” as Romance Languages and Literatures Chair Virginie Greene called them, they miss key information and guidance on how to navigate Harvard.
Simmons, the Philosophy professor, recalled showing up to teach her first class at 10 a.m., only to be greeted by an empty room. No one had told her about “Harvard time.”
“Those little things get to you, because you feel like ‘how am I supposed to know this stuff that everybody else knows?’ and that wears you down,” Simmons said.
The scarcity of senior women in many departments also makes it difficult for junior women to develop relationships with mentors who understand the gender dynamics at play.
For many female faculty who had gone through Harvard’s tenure track, having senior women in the department was empowering: it provided role models and hope for their own careers in academia.
The absence of such figures and the presence of a “macho culture” creates a departmental climate that leaves some junior women feeling isolated. An FAS-specific annual report from 2015 identified adverse departmental cultures as “the most striking reason” why some women choose to leave.
“In many cases, these faculty members found that the culture of the department was not conducive to their productivity and was a significant factor in their decision to leave,” the report reads.
As a result, FAS published a guide to faculty mentoring earlier this semester. The guide—synthesized from “sucessful practices” collected in a review of departmental mentoring plans—emphasizes the importance of mentoring and outlines expectations for department chairs, mentors, and mentees.
While Kramer praised the recommendations, she said strong leadership at the departmental level will be necessary to ensure departments actually adopt them. Chairs play a critical role in setting the tone in departments, Brinton said, and need training to be cognizant of gender dynamics and foster an environment that values mentorship.
“We’re not trained to do this kind of work—we’re trained to be scholars and teachers, and then when you go into this role, I found—I’ve been department chair for five years—I had to kind of teach myself, ‘what should I be sort of keeping my finger on, the pulse of this and that, and what can I be doing,’” Brinton said.
A ‘TERRIFYING’ PROCESS
Harvard’s tenure process, notoriously rigorous, can itself disadvantage women and push them away. Unlike most universities, the seven-year promotion trajectory grants tenure at the full—rather than associate—level. In lieu of explicit requirements, Harvard instead requires that tenured faculty are “scholars of the first order of eminence.”
This demanding—but ambiguous—standard calls for a subjective interpretation of a candidate’s promise that can leave room for implicit bias.
“When you think about our search image of what a successful Harvard tenure case looks like—usually this is unconscious—we often tend to think of some white guy who is spending a huge amount of time at work and publishing with very high consistent rates,” Kramer said.
For Skocpol, a process that requires speculative judgment favors men.
“That’s got to do with a very well-known gender stereotype, which is that it’s easier for everyone to see promise in men than it is to see promise in women,” Skocpol said.
The subjectivity of the review process is “terrifying,” Simmons said. “I think the scariest thing for everybody is just the unknown.”
For women, the process falls at a time when they are starting families—when predictability and stability are desirable. The timing of promotion competes with women’s biological clocks, and Rinard said many prefer to have the job security that comes with tenure before having children.
“Many female scholars at Harvard are at the top of their fields, and they might get tenure offers from other institutions before the time at which they would come up for tenure at Harvard—so it could be quite tempting with that imminent fertility decline to move to a position elsewhere,” said Rinard, who has thus far delayed having children.
Other institutions that tenure at the associate professor level, then, can entice junior female faculty members with attractive offers.
A FAMILY AFFAIR
Personal family considerations can also prevent women from reaching the final stage of review.
In Rinard’s observations, men are more likely than women to have stay-at-home spouses. “I know many of my male colleagues have wives who stay at home, and that makes things easier if you’re on the tenure track and you have a partner who’s taking care of all the domestic arrangements and childcare,” she said.
Meanwhile, women who are part of dual-career couples face domestic burdens on top of the long hours the tenure track demands. According to a 2013 survey on the environment for Harvard faculty, junior female faculty who are either single, or have children and a working partner, spend a median of 20 more hours each week on household duties than their male counterparts.
“They’re working just as hard at work as guys, but they go home and work an extra three hours a day if they’ve got small kids,” Singer said.
Being one half of a dual-career couple also generates challenges as women base their career decisions partly on those of their partners, which are sometimes given higher priority.
Morii said his observations confirm this trend. “I can’t think of any male junior faculty situation where the wife’s profession was the major obstacle for hiring, but whenever we try to hire a woman we always think about who is the partner and does he have a job,” he said.
And when both partners are academics, the University’s ability to find a position for a junior woman’s spouse can determine whether she stays.
Brinton said that while Harvard makes efforts to find positions for spouses, it cannot require a department to hire someone, so it is not always able to provide a solution.
Kramer said the Harvard name may not be enough anymore to compel women whose partners are unable to find jobs to stay.
“Some of our peer institutions like Duke and even Princeton have become more aggressive about making attractive spousal appointments,” Kramer said.
Prevailing social norms and very personal life decisions often fall outside of the realm of the University’s influence.
“There’s an issue about the extent to which Harvard as an institution can insert itself into the private lives of the faculty,” Rinard said. “There are broader cultural trends that really complicate things.”
FAS is trying to address the aspects of gender inequality among its faculty that it can control. In order to increase the visibility of junior women and their research, for example, the committee on women has sponsored mini-symposia that give female tenure-track faculty the opportunity to present their work. The audience at these events includes FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, division and department heads, and colleagues in their department—many of whom will later review their tenure case.
Still, Smith said, achieving gender parity across FAS will take time.
“This is something we can’t declare victory [on] tomorrow and be done,” Smith said. “This is something we have to constantly do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a cold Saturday morning in February, more than 50 Harvard College Democrats bussed up to New Hampshire to rally support for their preferred candidate ahead of the state’s first-in-the-nation primary. Trudging through the snow, they knocked on doors and canvassed voters alongside other Boston-area college students.
But while the Harvard undergraduates who traveled that day were split among supporters of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, a survey of Harvard seniors conducted by The Crimson revealed they prefer Clinton over Sanders.
Clinton continues to lead the race for delegates in the campaign for the Democratic nomination. Along the way, she has benefited from high levels of support among Harvard students, the overwhelming majority of Harvard faculty’s political contributions, and the expertise of a significant number of alumni working for her campaign as senior staffers.
The ties between Harvard and Hillary run remarkably deep.
A recent article in the Guardian characterized Harvard’s campus political climate as silencing for supporters of Clinton, but a number of students advocating for America’s former top diplomat to become the first female president said that is simply not the case.
Harvard has an active organization, Harvard Students for Hillary, which has held phone banks and run canvassing trips to support Clinton throughout the election cycle. Matthew Moore ’19, a coordinator for the group, said the national campaign welcomed their efforts.
“The campaign did look kindly upon us because we tended to reach the goals that we set out,” Moore said.
Many of the group’s student leaders over the past year are working for the campaign this summer, but declined to comment for this article, citing a campaign policy against speaking to the press. Student supporters not directly involved with the campaign this summer said they remain excited about the likelihood of her securing the Democratic nomination.
Jacob R. Carrel ’16, former president of the College Democrats, said members of the student group were split evenly among supporters of Clinton and Sanders. However, he said he actively supports her candidacy and that “a lot of members of the Harvard community respect her leadership ability and domestic and foreign policy experience.”
Data from The Crimson’s annual Senior Survey shows that within the ranks of the Class of 2016, Clinton enjoys strong and remarkably broad support among students, surpassing that of Sanders.  Over 800 seniors participated in the survey.
According to the survey, 66 percent of senior respondents who voted in this year’s Democratic primaries cast their ballots for Clinton, compared to 33 percent who voted for Bernie Sanders.
As Donald J. Trump has emerged as the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, the survey revealed that Harvard students who voted for Republicans in the primary have swung to the left and thrown their support behind Clinton.
Among the three remaining presidential candidates of Sanders, Clinton, and Trump, 67 percent of respondents said they preferred Clinton. This increase, however, does not appear to come from Bernie Sanders’ primary supporters, as he was the preferred candidate of 28 percent of respondents, about the same number who reported they preferred him in the primary matchup among all candidates.
Fifty-seven percent of respondents who supported former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney as the GOP presidential nominee in the 2012, the first election in which most members of the class had the opportunity to vote, plan on voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Clinton’s support on Harvard’s campus is high, but it is comparable to support among millennials across the country, according to a national poll conducted by the Harvard Institute of Politics this spring. Likely voters between the ages of 18-29 favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in a general election 61 to 25 percent, with 14 percent still undecided, the poll found.

While many Harvard students have expressed their support for Clinton, the ties between Harvard and Hillary are even stronger among the University’s graduates and faculty.
Clinton enjoys the almost unchallenged financial backing of faculty who donate to presidential campaigns, and she has drawn on the University’s alumni to fill top spots in her campaign. At the same time as Clinton enjoys faculty and alumni support, Harvard has also benefited by hiring former top staffers who served with Hillary or in Bill Clinton’s presidential administration. 
An analysis conducted by The Crimson found that 91 percent of contributions to current presidential candidates made by Harvard faculty, instructors, and researchers in 2015 went to Clinton.
Former top staffers who served with Hillary or in Bill Clinton’s presidential administration have also served in leading roles at Harvard. The Director of the Institute of Politics is Margaret A. “Maggie” Williams, a former top Clinton adviser and manager of her 2008 presidential campaign. Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, led Harvard as President and is currently a professor. Former Dean of the Kennedy School David T. Ellwood ’75 was a senior official in the Clinton administration’s antipoverty effort, and Economics professor David M. Cutler '87 served on Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers and in the National Economic Council.
The road between the Clintons and Harvard goes both ways. When Hillary Clinton began assembling her core campaign staff in 2014, she tapped a number of Harvard alumni to lead the charge to the White House. Madeleine “Mandy” Grunwald ’79, a longtime Clinton ally and Democratic media strategist, was chosen as Clinton’s senior adviser for communications. Working beside Grunwald on the campaign’s communications staff is Brian E. Fallon Jr. ’03, Clinton’s national press secretary.
Some of Clinton’s top political and digital strategists also have Harvard degrees. Amanda A. Renteria, a Business School graduate, serves as the campaign’s political director. As Clinton built out her digital strategy, she called on another Business School graduate, Stephanie K. Hannon, to serve as the campaign’s chief technology officer. Also on the technology side, Nellwyn A. “Nell” Thomas ’05 serves as director of digital analytics.
Among the lower ranks of the campaign’s large apparatus, recent Harvard College graduates have filled spots with the potential hope of working their way up the ladder and into a Hillary Clinton administration. Daniel R. Ki ’15, Ross C. Svenson ’15, and Valentina I. Perez ’15, all former leaders within the Democratic community during their time as undergraduates, joined the Clinton campaign after graduating. They later moved on to roles in the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and Hillary for America Brooklyn headquarters, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beijing. Boston. London. Los Angeles. New York. Mexico City.
Over the past two years, University President Drew G. Faust visited those cities and others as she traveled the globe, raising funds for Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign, describing research at the University, and meeting with alumni and potential donors.
On those trips, Faust does not travel without experts. Faculty members from across Harvard accompany her to discuss their research, pitch their  projects to donors, and help Faust navigate the foreign countries they study.
Faust personally selects the faculty members who accompany her around the world. Many trips fall under the Alumni Association’s “Your Harvard” series, which convenes alumni and potential donors to hear Faust speak about the University and to attend presentations from these carefully chosen faculty members.
“It’s always interesting to do these ‘Your Harvard’ events because one of the things they do is bring together faculty from across the University,” said Harvard Business School professor Michael I. Norton, who traveled with Faust to London in January 2014, just months after Harvard kicked off its public fundraising drive. “When we’re reaching out to alumni we really want to represent all facets of the school.”

Many faculty members say they play an integral role in Faust’s trips, even before she leaves Cambridge.
Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez—who was Harvard’s Vice Provost for International Affairs at the time of Faust’s Mexico trip in October 2014—helped with the preparation stages of that trip because his own scholarship focuses on Mexico.
Domínguez added that, beyond advocating for a trip to Mexico, he emphasized to Faust how trips abroad should factor into her presidency.
“It was some years ago decided that a presidential trip, a presidential trip outside the United States in particular, was a big hassle,” he said. “That, you know, there’s jetlag, it interrupts all the other things she’s doing. It’s not like a trip to New York. New York, she can go in the morning and be home in the evening. And so, she agreed that she would do, I’d say on average, one per semester… trip abroad during her presidency.”
Several faculty members said that, ahead of trips, Faust meets with professors who work on the particular country. She also meets with students from that country, Domínguez said.
When Faust traveled to Beijing in March 2015, she reached out to Chinese history professor Mark C. Elliott, then-director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies who recently took over for Domínguez as vice provost for international affairs.
An expert on China, Elliott said he wanted to ensure Faust could speak to current events in the country during her visit. Just two weeks prior to the “Your Harvard” alumni event in Beijing, for example, Chinese independent journalist Chai Jing released “Under the Dome,” a documentary that criticized the Chinese government about the failures of pollution regulations in the country. Hundreds of millions of viewers saw the film before government censors took it down.

“There was never any question of self-censorship, and I advised that she should mention it in her speech,” Elliott said. “In an address by the President of Harvard about the environment and climate change in Beijing, not to have referenced that documentary at that time would have been read as sending a certain type of signal, and that was not the signal we wanted to send.”
“This was a chance for her to express in a forceful way—but, at the same time, in a diplomatic way—the important role that universities have to play in finding solutions in addressing all the sorts of issues we see in protecting the environment,” Elliott added.
Faculty are also briefed ahead of each trip. Some professors said that representatives from Faust’s office meet with them to discuss the theme of specific “Your Harvard” events and the people slated to attend panels and receptions.
Music professor Thomas F. Kelly, who spoke at the February 2015 “Your Harvard” event in Seattle, emphasized the role that event organizers, especially “Your Harvard” panel designer Susan Olsen, played in preparing the professors before the event.
“There was an awful amount of concern that everything goes very, very smoothly, which means that there was a whole lot of choreography and meetings with me and then insisting that we all get together and talk through how this is all going to be the evening before the event,” Kelly said. “It may be that not everybody seems as comfortable in public situations as I do, but I would imagine that most Harvard faculty are used to talking before crowds, “ he said.
Kelly added: “It seemed to be a bit overkill.”

Government professor Danielle S. Allen, who is also the director of the Safra Center for Ethics, described her rationale for sitting on the “Your Harvard” Boston panel about bioethics in simple terms: “If you can do something when the President personally asks you, you try to.”
Still, professors say they often can use national and global trips to advance personal projects. While some travel with Faust in order to raise money for their ongoing research, others said they focus on developing academic or working relationships with Harvard alumni.
Chemistry professor Daniel G. Nocera, who said Harvard recruited him three years ago to address the global energy crisis, uses the trips to fundraise for his research.
“I’ve been going on those trips because I’m trying to generate enthusiasm among the graduates of Harvard—that it should be their moral imperative to address the energy problem,” Nocera said. “I’ve had so-so success with that. It’s been hard for me to convince the alumni that’s something that they should be doing.”
Paul L. Choi ’86, president of the Harvard Alumni Association, emphasized how crucial faculty engagement is in creating events for Harvard alumni.
“When we ask alumni, ‘What do you want to learn about Harvard, what do you want to learn from the Alumni Association?’ One of the strongest responses that we get in our surveys and in talking to alumni is a strong desire on the part of the alumni to remain connected to the intellectual wealth of the University,” Choi said.
Sometimes, though, professors downplay the role that fundraising plays in their trips. Instead, they emphasize the networking climate that such events foster.
For economics professor Sendhil Mullainathan, who traveled with Faust and several other professors to a “Your Harvard” event in New York, forming alumni connections also took precedence over raising money for the University.
“I don’t know whether there was money involved in this. Like to me, it was just fun, because afterwards, after you give your talk, we just have conversations,” Mullainathan said. “People want to know, want to share their stories, and that was really interesting. To say, ‘I found this interesting… This idea resonates, or this idea feels wrong.’”
Jonathan L. Walton, the Pusey Minister of Memorial Church, similarly said his participation at the November  2015 “Your Harvard” event in Atlanta was not geared toward fundraising for the capital campaign, which recently surpassed its overall goal.
“I was glad to participate in ‘Your Harvard’ Atlanta because it is an example of a space where people from so many walks of life are able to come together, and that’s what I see as the role of the Memorial Church,” Walton, who is a native of Atlanta, said. “To me, I felt like I was at the Memorial Church South.”
“Your Harvard” trips often coincide with larger announcements at the University.
On the heels of the College’s unveiling a concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media in 2014, American Repertory Theater Artistic Director Diane M. Paulus ’88 attended a “Your Harvard” event in Dallas as a panelist.
“Of course, it is connected to the campaign, but I think [it is also] engaging with alumni and bringing them up to speed to what’s happening right now at Harvard in terms of the A.R.T. and arts—not what the alumni think is happening from their experience 10, 20, 30 years ago, but really where we are now,” Paulus said.
 Another year and a half of Harvard’s capital campaign means Faust’s travel is far from over. The Alumni Association already has set the travel agenda for the next leg of her worldwide tour: Berlin in October; Miami in February 2017; Singapore in March 2017; and Minneapolis in June 2017, with more stops pending. And, if the pattern holds, faculty will be along for the ride.

In April 2000, faced with a record 18,691 applicants, Harvard accepted just under 11 percent—a historic low for Harvard College admissions.
“The academic strength of the pool is extraordinary,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said at the time. “The pools have been getting larger and the quality of the pool has been getting better.”
In the 16 years since, although the number of applicants to the College has more than doubled, the size of Harvard’s undergraduate population has remained relatively constant. This year, the College admitted 2,037 students to the Class of 2020; in comparison, 2,035 students were admitted to the Class of 2004.
As a result, the College admitted a record-low 5.2 percent of an unprecedented pool of over 39,000 applicants this year.
While the size of Harvard’s undergraduate student body has remained about the same for decades, several of the College’s peers—namely Stanford, Yale, and Princeton—plan to enlarge their undergraduate populations and construct new residential dorms to accommodate additional students. As Harvard undergoes its own physical expansion with the scheduled opening of a new engineering campus in Allston, some administrators are weighing in on whether Harvard should likewise expand the size of its undergraduate population—a question first raised more than 10 years ago.
Harvard, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in an emailed statement, “is not actively pursuing expansion of the undergraduate student body at this time. Our focus today, in the capital budget of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is on completing the important process of renewing our existing undergraduate Houses in Cambridge and on the development of the new home for the Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences along Western Avenue.”
The University has thought of expanding, though, if not definitively.
“Not just because our peers are doing it, honestly, but because we do have lots of talented students that can come and be part of our Harvard community,” Smith said in an interview earlier this month.

In 2003, then University-President Lawrence H. Summers indicated that plans for the new Allston campus included possibly constructing additional undergraduate housing on the other side of the Charles River.
Summers said in 2003 he would consider eliminating the three Houses in the Radcliffe Quad, to be replaced by new Houses south of the River. The Quad Houses would then be repurposed for graduate students, many of whom were “paying quite a bit on the open market for housing,” according to William C. Kirby, a Chinese history professor who was dean of FAS in the early 2000s. Summers also expressed interest in the construction of an additional, 13th residential House to accommodate an expanded undergraduate population.
A year after Summers’s initial proposal, an undergraduate life task force published a report that strongly endorsed the plan, suggesting that having a “critical mass” of undergraduates living in Allston would be valuable for the campus.
Despite such discussion, Kirby emphasized in an interview earlier this month that expansion was not the University’s top priority at the time.
“It was something we would look at, but only after we increased the size of the faculty, reviewed the state of undergraduate education, [and] reviewed the state of Allston plans,” Kirby said.
“Simply getting bigger, in our view, wasn’t necessarily the first goal—getting better was the first goal,” Kirby added.
However, in response to the financial crisis, the University decided in December 2009 to halt Allston construction—and with it, the plans for further expansion.
Even as the University resumed development of its Allston campus with new construction plans three years later, definitive action has yet to be taken on a growth of the undergraduate population.

In 2003, Summers expressed interest in accepting more international students to the College without decreasing the number of students accepted from the United States, a plan that would expand the undergraduate population.
But for years now, the size of Harvard’s student body has remained relatively constant at about 6,700, even as a growing number of prospective undergraduates apply to the College each year. This year, a record 39,044 students applied to the Class of 2020, more than a threefold increase from the 12,188 that applied to the Class of 1994.
As a result, the College’s acceptance rate has been declining steadily—dropping from 18 percent for the Class of 1994 to just over 5 percent for the Class of 2020.
“We have no shortage of very qualified people applying to the College whom we can’t admit, so there’s enormous pressure on admissions,” Kirby said.
In response to the declining acceptance rate, Smith, the current FAS dean, said Harvard administrators have considered expanding the student body.
Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73 wrote in an email that she believed “there is some hope to enlarge” the undergraduate body, but that other priorities—such as financial aid—may take precedence.
Fitzsimmons said that, should the College choose to expand, it should not do so at the expense of “the quality of the undergraduate experience.”
“I think in the future, if we were to expand, the first thing we’re going to have make sure of is providing that personal experience that we are providing now,” Fitzsimmons said.
Anna Ivey, founder of the admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting, also said an increase in the number of applicants is not itself a reason to accept more students.
“When you see the number of applicants go up, it’s not necessarily the case that all those extra applicants are qualified, or even remotely qualified,” she said. “Some of them are, some of them aren’t.”

Still, Smith said the impending opening of the Allston campus, expected in 2020, means that space could be available for the construction of new residence halls to accommodate more students in the future.
“Allston is obviously a potential place to put another House—or two,” Smith said. “Since 98 percent of students live in our residential system, in order to expand the undergraduate College, we would have to have a place for them to stay in the House system.”
Any construction of new residential Houses would not begin until after the end of Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project, Smith said in an interview, later emphasizing in a statement that “Harvard is not actively pursuing expansion of the undergraduate student body at this time.”
Recommendations from FAS presented in a 2007 report for then-Dean of the College David Pilbeam and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 suggested that the College “[r]esist any attempts to increase the size of the class until” a study of House occupancies was completed.
In addition to having the space to build new Houses, some faculty members argued that the growth of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—which will see two-thirds of its faculty moved to Allston in 2020—is another reason why expanding the undergraduate population could be valuable, given that many undergraduates would likely be taking courses there.
“I think for those who argued for the possible expansion of the student body, it would be because we were beginning to engage in areas where Harvard had not been so publicly visible,” Kirby said, discussing how faculty viewed a possible expansion in the past. “For example, this was at the same time that we were establishing the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.”
If Harvard were to expand, it would need to spend more on financial aid, although it would receive more revenue from tuition, according to Ivey. However, Ivey added that she did not believe the cost would be a significant burden for Harvard.
“I think a school that didn’t have as much money as Harvard would have to think about how to fund additional students who don’t have the means to pay,” Ivey said of Harvard’s financial aid program, which finances more than 60 percent of undergraduates. “Harvard doesn’t typically have those problems, so fortunately it doesn’t have to worry so much about how it’s going to finance students with demonstrated need.”

Harvard’s discussions about a possible undergraduate expansion follow decisions by several peer institutions—including Stanford, Yale, and Princeton—to increase the number of enrolled undergraduates and build additional housing.
Stanford is currently constructing additional undergraduate and graduate residence halls as part of an expansion effort first announced in 2013. Though the original plan called for the undergraduate population to begin expanding starting in fall 2016, Stanford spokesperson Lisa A. Lapin explained that the construction needs to be completed before more undergraduates can be accepted.
“While it is the intention of Stanford to slowly grow the undergraduate classes, it has not yet happened. We first need to have the housing to accommodate the additional students,” Lapin wrote in an emailed statement.
Yale spokesperson Tom Conroy wrote in an email that Yale’s two new residential colleges, set to open in fall 2017, will allow Yale to accept a freshman class of 1,550, compared to the current class size of 1,350—smaller than Harvard’s typical class size.
Princeton, meanwhile, is considering the construction of a seventh residential college, which would allow the university to expand its undergraduate population by 125 students per class. For the 2014-2015 academic year, Princeton enrolled 5,275 undergraduates.
This is the second time in the past two decades that Princeton has worked on an expansion effort. In response to recommendations in 2000 from a committee tasked with reviewing the size of the undergraduate body, Princeton also increased its undergraduate population by 125 students per class.
“If we’re serious about maximizing our impact on the world and maximizing diversity, the diversity of exposures that our students can have here, the single most important thing we can do is grow the size of our student body,” Summers said in an interview.
Until plans formulate, however, Harvard is expected to continue to accept a similar number of applicants each year—and Harvard’s acceptance rate will continue to drop, according to multiple experts.
“There’s no natural law that says…    Harvard has to be ‘size Y.’ Those are just judgement calls,” Ivey said. “And they should be reevaluated on a regular basis.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 28, 2016, at 10:46 a.m.
Howard J. Shaffer studies addiction at Harvard Medical School—thanks, in part, to eight alcohol distilleries.
In 2015, the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility—a nonprofit funded by a number of alcohol manufacturers including Bacardi—sponsored Shaffer’s professorship at the Medical School for $3.3 million.
As Harvard seeks to raise money for its ongoing fundraising drive, it regularly seeks out a bevy of alumni and individuals to support the school. In some cases, though, Harvard will turn to another source of funds: corporations.
The partnership between the University and a corporate entity can be complicated. While alumni often give to Harvard because of their fond memories of their alma mater and their philanthropic goals, corporate donations, to some, bring concerns that for-profit institutions could attempt to use the University and its professors to attempt to advance their own corporate agenda.
Joel Westheimer, an education professor at the University of Ottawa who has written about the influence of corporations on academic research, said that potential conflicts of interest often arise when a corporation donates to universities.
“There’s a whole bunch of cases where medical research comes up with findings of interests to corporations that donated the money,” Westheimer said. “There’s been lots of pressures on professors— sometimes unbelievable explicitly—not to publish these adverse findings.”
In the case of his Medical School professorship, Shaffer said, the fact that the funds come from alcohol distilleries has heightened caution around possible conflicts of interest in his research.
“We’re always on the watch for potential conflicts of interest with everything we do, so it really didn’t add something new,” Shaffer said. “It just added something more.”
Ralph S. Blackman, the CEO of the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility, said his organization has no clear stake or bias in the Harvard research it sponsors.
“There’s nothing that benefits us,” Blackman said. “If anything, with all due respect, we probably wouldn’t have chosen Dr. Shaffer or Harvard if we were trying to find someone who we could turn into our public relations arm.”
Vice Provost of Research Richard McCullough, who oversees and approves corporate giving, said Harvard has often been reticent to accept corporate gifts compared to peer institutions. It’s a trend he has been working to reverse.
“I would say I’m quite progressive and have been leading the charge to try to get Harvard to accept more corporate gifts,” McCullough said. “I feel like this is what many of our peers have been doing for some time, and it’s sort of accepted practice in higher education to do this.”
Harvard, however, does not have an established corporate gift policy—it is in the process of formalizing one, according to McCullough—and continues to accept corporate donations with certain caution. A “BP professor of environmental sciences” or “Coca-Cola program for nutrition,” for example, are unlikely, McCullough said.
“Harvard doesn’t have any problem necessarily with taking a corporate gift but naming the corporate gift is where people get a little bit nervous,” McCullough said. “But you have to remember that it’s a gift, right, so a gift is a gift is a gift.”
Most of Harvard’s money comes from its graduates. Tamara E. Rogers ’74, the vice president for alumni affairs and development, said that “individual donors are by far the highest proportion of donors in the campaign.”
Still, a few corporations have made inroads.
The Kraft Group, a Massachusetts-based conglomerate that owns the New England Patriots, gave the Business School $20 million through its foundation to support precision medicine.
Corporate giving can sometimes backfire, though, as student organizations at the Law School found out earlier this year. Milbank, an international corporate law firm, pledged $1 million over five years to support student groups, but stopped doing so after the group Justice for Palestine held an event titled “The Palestine Exception to Free Speech: A Movement Under Attack.” Milbank funds had paid for $500 worth of pizza for the group, and the event’s Facebook page thanked “the good folks at Milbank LLP.”
“Our motivation was solely to avoid the risk of future misimpressions that the firm endorses specific viewpoints expressed by any particular student organization or journal,” Milbank wrote in a statement explaining the firm’s decision to redirect the funds to other Law School.
But the incident left some increasingly wary of corporate influence at Harvard. Law School student Brian Klosterboer said his student group, HLS Advocates for Human Rights, was denied money after Milbank redirected its funds.
“I think as an organization we’re very concerned about free speech on campus, and on the role of corporate law firms in directing student speech and what kind of events we can have,” Klosterboer said at the time. “I think it’s kind of shocking how much influence Milbank had in the first place… It just shows we have this huge influence of corporate power at the Law School.”
According to McCullough, however, the influence of large corporations on the University does not go unchecked. Harvard could draw in “lots of gifts named after corporations” if it loosened its conflict of interest standards, McCullough said, but the University rejects proposed gifts that could seem like advertising for a corporation.
“You see a lot of sort of preliminary talks about gifts that don’t necessarily come to fruition, because it often feels like there's going to be an endorsement,” McCullough said.
Another variety of corporate giving—sponsored research—does not count toward the capital campaign, although, McCullough said, the ethics of mixing research and corporate gifts can be murky. Corporations that sponsor research enter into contracts with individual professors and license their intellectual property, subject to similar conflict of interest policies as corporate gifts.
The conflict of interest policy, according to McCullough, doesn’t prevent a professor from having a research conflict—only from not disclosing it. Once a corporation decides to fund a faculty member’s research, Harvard designs a conflict of interest management plan and schedules periodic check-ins.
“If there's some funny business, sometimes I’ll have to get on the phone and say, ‘you know, you can’t really do this. You're going to ruin your reputation by doing something stupid,’” McCullough asid.
In one prominent case uncovered last year, Cambridge-based Smithsonian researcher Wei-Hock Soon—a climate change skeptic—accepted more than $1.2 million from fossil fuel companies over the past decade. Soon was not an employee of Harvard and has not been granted any funds from the University, according to University spokesperson Jeff Neal, although Soon has a Harvard email address and has used the University’s name on his publications.
Harvard also trails its peers in the percentage of its research funded by corporations: About five percent of the University’s research budget is corporate-sponsored, according to McCullough, compared to 19 percent at MIT. As with corporate gifts, McCullough said, it’s a ratio he’s actively working to increase.
And as federal research funding continues to fall, McCullough said, the University will continue to pursue gifts and sponsorships in these less-charted corporate waters. While Harvard’s $37.6 billion endowment is a consistent source of funds, it requires a steady stream of incoming capital to fuel the furnace.
“Endowments are great if you can make the gift big enough, so you get a five percent return that ends up being enough money to make a difference,” McCullough said. “The problem is the obvious one: we have to take in hundred million dollars to get five million dollars a year. That’s a huge amount of money.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years into his deanship, Rakesh Khurana’s debut to the College has been marked by turbulence. Responding to protests about race relations, sexual assault, and social life on campus, Khurana has been confronted with many controversies outside of the classroom.
Just months into office, Khurana sat on the bare shoulders of a student at a primal scream protest, looking to mediate a conflict between protesters and nude runners. Come that spring, he again waded into undergraduate controversy over a lewd party invitation from a final club. This year, as the federal government continued to investigate the College’s Title IX compliance, he responded with shock and a promise to fight the prevalence of sexual assault on campus.
Continually framing his goal at the helm of the College around a singular mission, Khurana says he divides his priorities into three categories: personal, intellectual, and social “transformation.”
During his deanship, however, many of his most public, and controversial, comments have focused on undergraduate social life in particular. Earlier this month, after several semesters of closed-door meetings with the College’s unrecognized final clubs, Khurana issued what some have called his most controversial policy to date. Breaking a decades-long practice of restrained administrative oversight of the clubs, University President Drew G. Faust accepted recommendations from Khurana that will bar members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from leadership positions in recognized student groups and endorsements for top fellowships.
An academic by trade, Khurana has repeatedly denied that his top priority is undergraduate social life. By his own estimate, he spends about 80 percent of his time on academics.
But even as he oversees the rollout of the College’s honor code and overhaul of the General Education program—two initiatives planned before his deanship—Khurana faces the challenge of defending it as one geared towards undergraduate education.
Khurana has argued that national media outlets, which have sped to cover his pressure on single gender organizations, mischaracterize and blur his true priorities. But within the College, Khurana faces his own share of critics.
Many student leaders have praised the dean for his involvement in undergraduate social life, but have largely rebuked his unprecedented policy on final clubs. Some—including a previous Dean of the College—have called on Khurana to temper his focus on social life and re-balance the deanship around academics.

Through his campus presence and initiatives to revitalize student social life, Khurana is known among students as an administrator who puts student life at the top of his agenda.
“We are choosing the harder path of inventing something new and reimaging new types of organizations, new types of associational life, new types of environments,” he said this month.
As a sociologist at Harvard Business School, Khurana studies organizational behavior and management theory, two fields he has tried to incorporate in his approach to his deanship.
Since starting his first semester as dean in fall 2014, Khurana has been outspoken about gender discrimination, social exclusion, and racism on campus, demonstrating a desire to reshape undergraduate social life. In addition to establishing sanctions against social groups outside of Harvard’s gates, Khurana has looked to bolster House life and College-sanctioned events. Over the past two years, his office  has increased funding to the Office of Student Life—the administrative department charged with organizing and funding a significant portion of social activities—by 73 percent. According to Khurana, the College has already budgeted another 15 percent increase in resources for the upcoming academic year.
“I see my role as more of trying to be WD-40, to help move things along where things can sometimes get stuck,” Khurana said.
Also high on Khurana’s agenda is tackling sexual assault on Harvard’s campus. In September, the University released the results of a sexual assault climate survey revealing that 31 percent of senior undergraduate females at Harvard experienced unwelcome sexual contact while at the College.
In response, a University-wide task force issued a set of recommendations aimed at tackling sexual assault. The recommendations, released in March, disproportionately emphasized the College and suggested the administration reconsider its alcohol policy, mandate annual trainings for alcohol consumption and “health sexuality,” and decrease the number of access points into the Houses. The report also sharply criticized the historically male final clubs for possessing “deeply misogynistic attitudes.” About two months later, Khurana and Faust announced their sweeping sanctions of the groups.
In announcing the new sanctions, Khurana compared his policy to the integration of all-women’s Radcliffe College, arguing both were steps in preventing discrimination. “Today, we have reached another crossroads, and it is time to move Harvard College forward by fostering a campus culture that respects the dignity and rights of all our students,” he wrote.
Given Khurana’s extensive social policies, many students have interpreted his leadership as one more publicly focused on students’ social lives rather than academics.
“I see him much more involved in social life,” Leah U. Rosen ’19, a former board member of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, said. “I’ve heard him speak much more about student life than academics.”
Drisana M. Mosaphir ’17, an organizer for anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, agreed.
“I see him much more in touch with students on social issues,” she said.
Khurana’s colleagues said the dean aims to “build a strong social fabric” of undergraduate life. “He’s setting the culture,”  Jasmine M. Waddell, the freshman resident dean for Elm Yard, said. “I think that the transformations that he set out when he first started have evolved and developed and been given legs and things to hold onto.”
Although Khurana’s focus on providing safe social venues for undergraduates is not unique, some former administrators and students say his stance towards regulating the College’s unrecognized final clubs is unprecedented.
Like former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III, Khurana has sought to introduce new social spaces at Harvard and emphasized safe party practices. Whereas Epps advocated building a barn-like structure for students to host parties, Khurana, as a Faculty Dean and administrator, has repurposed Cabot’s junior common room into a similarly functioning space. Also similar to Epps, who wrote public letters criticizing the College’s final clubs, Khurana has decried the historically single-gender groups as antithetical to the College’s core values.
But unlike Epps and former College administrators, Khurana has sought to regulate the final clubs through sanctions, a strategy that some say is an overextension of the dean’s office into students’ private lives. In the wake of that policy announcement, hundreds of students—primarily undergraduates in female social organizations— rallied against the sanctions in front of Massachusetts Hall and took to social media, calling on the College to reconsider its oversight of student groups.
Harry R. Lewis ’68, Dean of the College from 1995 until 2003, recently criticized Khurana’s sanctions of single-gender social groups and the dean’s involvement in student social life. In a private letter, Lewis applauded Khurana’s broad efforts to reign in the groups, but castigated what he characterized as an unprecedented and damaging policy.
“Students’ membership in organizations is their own business, not the College’s,” Lewis wrote, adding that the policy enforced a new requirement for students to adhere to a purported mission of non-discrimination and co-education.
“It seems to me that you are breaking dangerous new ground in articulating this standard and in interpreting it to disqualify students from captaincies and leadership positions,” Lewis wrote to Khurana. Lewis declined to comment for this story.
Khurana, responding to the letter, wrote in a statement that he was “appreciative” of Lewis’s comments and would share his message with a committee tasked with overseeing the final club policy implementation.
Lewis’s letter closely echoes his long-attributed motto that administrators avoid serving as the “cruise directors” of undergraduate social life.
Similarly, attorney Harvey A. Silverglate, a vocal critic of the administrative board—the College’s disciplinary body—said Khurana’s efforts reflect a broader trend in higher education of administrators exercising “increasing bureaucratic control” over the private lives of undergraduates. Still, Khurana, Silverglate argued, stands out among other administrators who “micromanage” student life.
“Intruding into private activity on private property in the course of private social legal arrangements that previously would have been unthinkable of Harvard social life control—that’s what’s new,” Silverglate said. “It’s truly radical and disturbing to anyone that believes in liberty.”
For former University President Lawrence H. Summers, the University’s recent initiatives on social life and cultural sensitivity could detract from a focus on academics.
“I think as a University we should be concentrating on academic excellence rather than making broad statements of values—whether it is through placemats in our dining halls or kindness pledges or sanctions on student association,” Summers said.

Despite the pressure he has placed on the College’s final clubs, Khurana fervently resists the perception that social life is at the top of his agenda.
“The biggest focus this year is on the academics of the College, to make sure that academics should be the foreground of the Harvard College experience,” Khurana said.
According to Khurana, 80 percent of his time is dedicated to work related to academics, spending the rest of his time on other areas including social life.
Pointing to the increase in number of freshman seminars, introduction of a paid meal program for students and faculty, and overhaul of the College’s beleaguered general education program, Khurana said administrators have already implemented a host of academic-focused reforms.
One such endeavor includes the creation of the Honor Council, the governing body composed of College administrators and undergraduates that enforces the honor code and adjudicates cheating cases. Khurana, who serves as the chair of the Honor Council, has been “instrumental” in the honor code’s roll out, said Freshman Resident Dean for Ivy Yard Michael C. Ranen.
In administrators’ minds, although Khurana is often seen in the context of social life, he has focused just as much on academic matters.
“I don’t think that the social is any more important to him than the other two,” interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said, referencing the College’s three-part mission to provide an intellectual, social, and personal “transformation.” “It may just be the circumstances that led him to the social piece, but I don’t think that’s a greater importance than the other two.”
“Dean Khurana, like previous deans of Harvard College, have all worked tirelessly to ensure that students are receiving an intellectually transformative education,” Associate Dean of the College Joan Rouse wrote in an emailed statement.
Outside of his office, however, Khurana’s sanctions against final clubs have drawn the attention of the national media, outlets the Dean argued contribute to a mischaracterization of his priorities.
“I think that’s partly due to where people pay public attention to, by news accounts, partly fermented by what people have different interests in,” he said in a recent interview.
When asked if he considered his two-year tenure as a departure from previous deans, Khurana framed no conclusions.
“I don’t know enough about the predecessor deans to make any judgement that would be informed,” he said. “I see myself as part of a long thread of notions of making Harvard College a standard in a liberal arts and sciences education.”

Sophomore Matt Rothenberg entered Harvard in the fall of 2014 as a standout third baseman out of Pine Crest School in Boca Raton, Fla. But as a freshman, Rothenberg saw action at second base and in the outfield but struggled to carve out a niche in the Crimson lineup. In 51 at-bats as a first-year, he batted .275 with eight runs scored and six batted in, appearing mostly in midweek, non-Ivy League contests.
Entering this spring, Rothenberg figured to have a more prominent offensive role but still lacked a position as Harvard coach Bill Decker shifted sophomore John Fallon to third base and Drew Reid and Mitch Klug returned to anchor Harvard’s middle infield. Despite the logjam, Rothenberg’s bat forced Decker to make him a regular in the Crimson’s starting lineup. The Economics concentrator appeared in 38 of the team’s 41 games, seeing action at designated hitter and both corner outfield and corner infield positions.
“He settled in, he did his job, he did what he was asked, and he performed at a very high level,” co-captain DJ Link said. “He comes to practice everyday ready to play and I think everyone on the team sees that. His bat was something we really needed and we asked him to be an offensive catalyst for us and that’s 100 percent what he did.”
Harvard entered the 2016 campaign needing to replace much of the offensive firepower that helped it to lead the Ivy League in batting average and finish second in runs scored the year before. Rothenberg was not in the starting lineup when the Crimson opened its season on Mar. 4 in Winston-Salem, N.C.
As Harvard’s offense struggled to establish itself early on in the season, Rothenberg found himself playing first base for the first time in his collegiate career and batting fifth against A.J. Puk, a projected top pick in next month’s MLB Draft, and the No. 1 Florida Gators. Rothenberg was the only Crimson player to register a hit against Puk and a nine-hit performance in a four-game stretch against UMass and Army the following week fortified his spot in the heart of the Harvard order for the remainder of the season.
“One thing I’ve learned being here for four years is that if you can hit and you’re hitting well, they’ll find a place for you,” co-captain Matt Sanders said. “It’s great to have a guy who also provides the flexibility with what to do with the rest of the lineup because he can play so many different positions.”
Less than six weeks later, Rothenberg was hitting in the middle of the Harvard order, leading the Crimson offense into its four-game series with Dartmouth for a chance to claim its first Red Rolfe Division title since 2006. While Harvard would lose three of four against the Big Green and Yale would take the division crown, Rothenberg finished the season hitting .363 with 45 hits, 13 doubles, 18 walks, a .444 on-base percentage, and a .500 slugging percentage, all of which led Harvard regulars. His average was also good for third in the Ivy League and was the highest mark for a Crimson regular during Decker’s time in Cambridge.
Despite not having a defined position and rotating between the third, fourth, and fifth spots in the Harvard order, Rothenberg had a breakout season in large part because of his offensive consistency. In addition to having 13 multi-hit games, the Boca Raton native reached base in 32 of the 38 games in which he appeared.
“The fact that he was able to get on base so consistently just put guys in situations to get RBIs and put the team in situations to score runs,” Link said. “The bottom line is it all starts with getting on base and since he was able to do that, it really contributed to us winning games and us scoring runs.”
He also saved some of his best performances for his team’s biggest games. In the team’s two weekend series against Yale and Brown, of which the Crimson won six of eight contests to regain its footing in the Ivy League standings, Rothenberg hit .375 and scored eight runs.
His emergence was one of the keys to Harvard’s best record in Ivy League play since 2010. With Klug set to graduate, Rothenberg may have the opportunity to transition back to the infield in 2017 as the Crimson looks for its first Ivy League crown since 2005.
“Every year when you come back, the team needs to reinvent itself,” Sanders said. “I think it’s going to be great having some kids who have shown how well they can hit in Rothenberg and Fallon who you know can come back and get right back into the [heart of the order].”

In the fall of 2012, Devin Dwyer began his collegiate career as one of the highest-rated recruits ever to put on a Harvard jersey. If the expectations that came with his National High School Player of the Year award were not enough, Dwyer also had the unenviable task of filling the shoes of prolific attacker Jeff Cohen ’12, the program’s all-time leading goalscorer who had graduated the previous spring.
Four years later, however, Dwyer leaves as he arrived, having completed his transformation from one of the Crimson’s most highly touted recruits to one of its most successful and high-achieving players.
His name has gone from being written in the Top-5 of recruiting lists to springing up in the Top-5 of numerous school records, and in the process, he has left his own shoes to fill.
Of all of Dwyer’s impressive statistical accomplishments, one sticks out to Harvard men’s lacrosse coach Chris Wojcik ’96. It is 49—the number of consecutive games in which the attacker has tallied at least one point.
“More than anything, he [Dwyer] is a model of consistency,” Wojcik said. “The way in which he shows up to play in every game, the way in which he’s up for any situation, is something that has boosted our team countless times.”
Dwyer took his streak to another level this year, starting each of the Crimson’s 16 games and collecting at least two points in all of them.
At the beginning of the year, he helped set the tone for his team’s hot start. In the first four games, he reached the seven-point mark two times and added another six-point performance as he led Harvard to a 14-9 neutral site upset over then-No. 4/4 Duke.
Dwyer’s early outbursts placed him in the top-10 nationally in points per game, a distinction he held on to throughout the season.
Perhaps more importantly, two of these early points came in sudden death, overtime situations. Dwyer showed a flair for the dramatic by assisting the winner in double overtime against Holy Cross, and scoring the go-ahead goal himself in overtime against UMass just a few days later.
By the midpoint of the regular season, Dwyer had already set his career high for goals in a season. After tallying 20 in his junior campaign, he scored his 21st as a senior in the seventh game against Brown. He also recorded his 15th assist in that contest, putting him on pace for the second 30-assist season of his collegiate career.
Dwyer then put together a second half just as impressive as his first, finishing with 40 goals and 32 assists in total. His 2.50 goals per game and 2.00 assists per game put him in rare company nationwide, as only Ivy League counterparts Dylan Molloy, from Brown, and Ben Reeves, from Yale, have reached both marks this season as well.
“Devin’s the general out there,” said Crimson co-captain and defender Stephen Jahelka. “When he’s on the field calling the shots on attack, we feel we have a chance to score on any given possession no matter what the situation and no matter who we’re playing.”
For Jahelka, seeing Dwyer’s growth has been extra special because of the bond the two players have shared since childhood. The pair grew up in Garden City, N.Y, where they started playing lacrosse in the third grade. They even suited up for the same local high school team.
While Jahelka has taken full advantage of his frame to dominate as the physical defender he is today, he admires how Dwyer has developed into a different type of player.
“He [Devin] won’t necessarily be the fastest or strongest guy on the field,” Jahleka said, “but his lacrosse smarts are out of this world. He has an understanding for the game that few other guys do, and it’s a beautiful thing to watch.”
The improvements that Dwyer has made to his game over the course of his college career speak volumes to his understanding of the game and his work ethic as well.
By learning from his experiences more so than increasing his physicality, he has steadily built on his point haul every year since joining the program in the fall of 2012.
After tallying 43, 47, and 49 points in his freshman, sophomore, and junior years, respectively, Dwyer exploded for 72 as a senior this season. The 72 points place him in a tie for third all-time in most points collected in a single season by a Harvard player, while the four-year total of 211 puts him in the third spot all-time in career points as well.
“You can tell in the fall when we get the team back together that Devin is one of those guys who always puts in a lot of work over the summer,” Wojcik said. “A big thing is that he loves practicing alone just as much as he loves practicing with other guys or playing games, so he’ll work at his game a lot even when he’s at home.”
Viewers have noticed Dwyer’s development as well, benchmarking his growth with a succession of awards. Dwyer was named to the All-Ivy Honorable Mention list as a freshman, earned Second Team honors last year, and was a First Team selection in 2016.
He was also nominated in the preseason this year for the Teewaaraton Award, and remained on the watch list for the honor throughout the season as he lived up to expectations.
The biggest honor that Dwyer has received this year, however, might be the fact that he was selected in the Major League Lacrosse draft. He was the sixth round pick, at spot No. 46, of the Florida Launch, and has the option to play in the league after college. The Launch, who have started the current MLL season with a 0-4 record, will hope that Dwyer can help make a difference.
Until then, however, Dwyer can reflect on a 2016 season, and collegiate career, as successful as any that a Crimson player has had.
