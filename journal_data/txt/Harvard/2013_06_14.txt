After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Megan M. Savage ’10 did not expect to stand before a television audience of millions when she signed on as a producer of a quirky comedic play about quarrelsome siblings. But on Sunday night, she and her colleagues who brought playwright Christopher F. Durang ’71’s “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike” to Broadway took the stage at the 67th Annual Tony Awards to accept the award for Best Play.
“I think it was extreme beginner’s luck that put me there,” Savage said in an interview this week. “It was my first Broadway credit.”
New to Broadway but no stranger to producing, Savage was involved in the Gilbert and Sullivan Players and the Hyperion Shakespeare Company, and produced Harvard’s Summer Theater during her time as an undergraduate.
She was one of a handful of Harvard alumni—many of whom still have ties to the University—who took home hardware at the annual awards show honoring achievements in Broadway theater.
Diane M. Paulus ’87-’88, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater, was named best director of a musical for “Pippin,” which played at the A.R.T. just down the road from campus. The restaging of the ‘70s classic won three additional Tony Awards, taking home two Best Actress awards and the honor of Best Revival of a Musical.
Paulus, who also directed last year’s Best Revival-winner “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess,” offered a shout out to University President Drew G. Faust in her acceptance speech Sunday night, quoting her as saying that “creativity is a form of knowledge.”
Courtney B. Vance ’82 also received the award for best featured actor in a play for his depiction of a New York tabloid editor in “Lucky Guy.”
Sunday night’s regional success extended beyond Harvard’s campus, as the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston won a Tony for Best Regional Theater. The award is given out each year to a nonprofit professional theater company that stages impressive plays while serving its community.
“It’s thrilling…for the Huntington to be on the national stage,” said Rebecca Curtiss, communications manager for the Company. “And of course to be sharing the night with our friends across the river, at the A.R.T. It was a really great night for Boston and Boston theater.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many in the scientific community lauded the Supreme Court’s ruling that naturally occurring human genes may not be patented, several geneticists at Harvard Medical School on Friday said they believe the decision warrants a more lukewarm response.
In a unanimous decision Thursday, the court ruled that Myriad Genetics, Inc., a Salt Lake City-based company that patented genes associated with increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, does not have exclusive rights to offer genetic testing services for the sequences it had located.
The court affirmed patenting of laboratory-engineered complementary DNA, or cDNA, but ruled that identifying a gene is not an act of invention. The ruling said that “groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery” of DNA, as in the Myriad case, is not enough for a patent, prompting many scientists to predict that the strike down of some gene patents would open the door to a flowering of research efforts and more affordable genetic testing.
But in the wake of the ruling, “Life won’t change,” said David A. Sinclair, a genetics professor at the Medical School. “There will be minimal impact.”
George M. Church, a genetics professor at the Medical School, agreed, saying that the decision only rules out an old style of patenting in biotechnology.
“Despite the celebrations, this ruling only impacts a rare and obsolete practice of patenting unimproved genes,” said Church. “Most groups patent ways of using genetic discoveries as part of non-obvious diagnostic and therapeutic protocols and slightly or greatly altered genes.”
Still, Raju S. Kucherlapati, a genetics professor at the Medical School, said he expects the ruling to shift routine practice within the biotechnology industry.
“It will have a significant impact on molecular diagnostics,” Kucherlapati said, noting that several companies have already announced plans to offer genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2, the two genes previously patented by Myriad.
“This should increase competition and reduce the price of DNA-based diagnostics,” he added.
Though Myriad saw its stocks rise and then plummet following the Supreme Court’s decision, Church predicted that the ruling itself would not hurt the company.
“[The company’s] other patents, trade secrets, and know-how still give Myriad a competitive advantage,” said Church. “If Myriad is in danger, it is not this court case, but the emergence of whole genome sequencing, which is already less expensive than sequencing the two genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.”
Thursday’s ruling marks the second time the gene BRCA1 has been highlighted in the media in the past month. After testing positive for a mutated BRCA1, actress Angelina Jolie made headlines when she revealed in a New York Times op-ed that she had undergone a preventative double mastectomy to reduce her risk of breast cancer.
