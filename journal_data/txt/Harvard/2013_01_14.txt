Following ancient Vietnamese culture, I spent my New Years at the zoo in Ho Chi Min City listening to top 40 songs.
 
The zoo was full of people; it was impossible to get around without bumping into someone and immediately checking to see if your passport was still intact. 
 
There weren’t too many animals—only a dozen if you counted the giraffe statue and the sign for the monkeys, 20 if you counted the American tourists, which the locals do. At one point, a women turned away from the elephants just to stare at me. Try as I might to blend in, I must have looked out of place with my red number 25 tour sticker and tendency to speak loudly in English. She gave me a big toothy grin and a thumbs up and then snapped a photo. A part of me was waiting for her to toss me a peanut from the way she was watching me. I guess there was a sign that said not to feed the animals. 
 
Most people weren’t paying attention to the animals anyways. Something bigger had attracted their attention. And to my surprise, it was not my mother's fannie-pack. 
 
Thousands of young couples and their kids surrounded a huge stage in the center of the park. At first I thought they were looking at the adjacent sign pointing to the monkeys, but then Santa appeared. He was a tiny Santa, and the thinnest I have ever seen. He had the beard and red jacket, but the jolly belly full of Christmas cookies was non-existent. I guess there was another sign that said not to feed the Santa. 
 
A group of young girls stood next to Santa on the stage. They also looked in need of a cookie or roast beast or a health care plan or something. They appeared about 15 or 16, which seemed a bit young to be working in the North Pole if you ask me. I wanted to talk to them about unionizing but suddenly the music started. 
 
It was a familiar tune—a bit shocking given that I didn’t know the Vietnamese national anthem, which I assumed they would play on New Years. But then Santa started waving his fist in the air and the little girls began trotting like horseback riders and my dad started singing along: “Heyyy Sexy Lady.” 
 
It was a tune as sweet as the “Star Spangled Banner,” or “Thrift Shop.” It was nothing other than “Gangnam Style.” I suddenly felt at home in this Vietnamese zoo filled with Korean music, malnourished Santas, and one elephant.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Applied physics professor Federico Capasso remembers the emergence of fiber optics vividly—he was working at Bell Laboratories when the research institution performed the first industrial tests of the technology forty years ago. Fiber optics quickly gained prominence in the subsequent years as a more robust way of sending information with light instead of electrical signals.
Today, Capasso and his colleagues are researching what could be the latest breakthrough in fiber optics technology: the vortex beam, a special type of light that twists as it travels. Capasso said he believes that the twists in a beam could potentially increase the information capacity of a single fiber many times over.
In a paper published in Nature Communications in December, Capasso and his team describe a new device that can detect the “twistiness” of vortex beams. Although other devices capable of sensing the twist of a vortex beam exist, they are bulky and expensive, Capasso said.
“We took a commercial device that cost around 20 dollars and simply modified it,” Capasso said. “It shows you can do things not only in a simpler way but also in a cheaper way.”
Research into the use of vortex beams in fiber optics first began in 2004, when scientists began sending multiple vortex beams, each at the same wavelength, along a single optical fiber–a technique known as spatial division multiplexing.
“With vortex beams you can presumably increase the information capacity by another large factor and exceed the wall that many system engineers think is there around one hundred terabits per second [on a single fiber],” Capasso said.
To fully realize the potential of spatial division multiplexing, a detector like Capasso’s must separate and read off the different types of vortex beams sent along the fiber. Each different type of beam has a special number called orbital angular momentum that characterizes its “twistiness” and can take on any integer value.
Capasso’s device was able to distinguish between beams of three different orbital angular momentums, meaning that such a solution could, in principle, triple the capacity of current fiber optics systems. But Capasso estimated that a factor of ten improvement might be possible with spatial division multiplexing—and other scientists think it could be even higher.
Capasso, however, emphasized that his group’s results are only preliminary, and must be complemented by research on the manufacture and transport of vortex beams.
“There are a number of companies that are taking this approach seriously as a research topic,” Capasso said. “Nothing is going to be inside of a practical system in my opinion before probably ten years—although sometimes one makes mistakes in predicting technology.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 15, 2013, at 12:55 a.m.
Stephen Lassonde, deputy dean of the college at Brown University, has been named Harvard College’s new dean of student life. He will assume the position in late March.
Katherine Bergeron, dean of the college at Brown, announced Lassonde’s departure in an email to Brown students on Monday. Bergeron praised Lassonde for his work to improve academic advising and reform the deliberative procedures of Brown’s Committee on Academic Standing.
“His departure represents a huge loss for our community,” Bergeron wrote.
Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds also praised Lassonde in an email to Harvard students later on Monday.
“Dean Lassonde brings a wealth of experience on all the issues the OSL oversees, including student services, academic standing, undergraduate advising, support for underrepresented student populations,” Hammonds wrote. “These will all be critical areas for the College in the coming years.”
As the new dean of student life, Lassonde will head the College’s Office of Student Life, which has seen the turnover of several administrators in the past year.
The permanent dean of student life position has been vacant since Suzy M. Nelson departed in June to become vice president and dean of the college at Colgate University. When Nelson’s departure was announced in March, Joshua G. McIntosh was named interim dean of student life, but in June he too announced that he would leave for another position at Johns Hopkins University.
Lassonde, who is also an adjunct assistant history professor, spent nearly six years at Brown. He received his Ph.D. in American Studies from Yale University, and also has served as an assistant dean at Yale College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was only fitting that the showdown between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the country should come down to the wire. In the final points of the last match of the day, the top-ranked Harvard women’s squash team fell to Princeton, 5-4, in New Jersey.
The result came down to the final grouping, as the two teams, which both entered the day undefeated, split the first six matches. Crimson sophomore Amanda Sobhy quickly defeated her opponent in the No. 1 position to win in straight sets, but the Tigers were by no means ready to lay down quietly.
In the No. 4 spot, Rachel Leizman of Princeton outlasted Harvard freshman Michelle Gemmell. Although Gemmell found herself one point away from a Crimson victory, Leizman continued to battle and ended up winning the set and the match, 12-10, in the fifth.
With each team having won four matches, the contest would be decided by the pairing in the No. 7 spot between co-captain Sarah Mumanachit of Harvard and Alex Sawin. The two players battled deep into a fourth set tiebreaker until Sawin finally converted on a match ball, allowing her to win the set, 16-14, while at the same time sealing the match and the Tigers’ victory.
“The Princeton crowd was going nuts,” fellow co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “The energy in the gymnasium was unbelievable. This is what college squash is all about…. [Mumanachit] really never gave up. In the end it didn’t quite work out for us, but we were just so proud of her.”
The Tigers won two of the first three matches in the opening shift. At the No. 6 position, Kingshott made short work of her opponent and proceeded to win in three sets.
Although sophomore Haley Mendez took home the first set, she could not keep up with her Princeton rival and went on to lose the next three.
Sophomore Megan Murray, who competed in the No. 9 spot, also fell in a tight, five-set battle to Tara Harrington.
But the Crimson bounced back in the next set of matches, digging itself out of a hole to knot the contest at three matches apiece.
After pulling out a five-setter the day before against Penn, senior Laura Gemmell showed no signs of fatigue en route to a tough, four-game victory in the No. 2 position.
Playing at No. 5 and holding her opponent to seven, two, and eight points in each game, freshman Saumya Karki rolled to a straight-set victory.
But despite finding herself up two sets in the No. 8 spot, freshman Isabelle Dowling could not hang on against Tigers sophomore Hallie Dewey and fell in a five-set battle, losing the final game by just two points.
“We all fought really hard, and I think this was a good learning experience, particularly for the freshmen,” Kingshott said. “For [Dowling]…she’ll hopefully learn from that experience, and in the next match, hopefully she’ll remember the situation she was in.”
The final grouping was full of drama, and Princeton emerged with the victory by taking two of the final three matches.
Sobhy continued her dominance of her competition, holding Julie Cerullo of the Tigers below four points in each game of the sophomore’s straight-set victory. Sobhy has never lost while playing for Harvard.
Michelle Gemmell’s match was the closest and longest on the day. The showdown went back and forth until her opponent made some big shots down the stretch to stave off a match ball and snatch away the win.
All eyes then turned to the battle at the No. 7 position. Although Mumanachit found herself up four points in the fourth game, the set eventually evened out. Each player repeatedly failed to close out the set before Sawin finally finished it off and sent the Crimson home.
“We were confident [Sobhy] was going to win, so we knew we needed one other win,” Mendez said. “I was very confident in [Mumanachit]. She’s a super steady player and has been in this situation many times before. We all definitely had faith that she could pull it out, but unfortunately it didn’t go our way.”
Princeton (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) had not defeated Harvard (5-1, 2-1 Ivy) in a head-to-head meeting since 2009.
As expected entering the showdown, the competition was evenly matched between the two squads. Although the Tigers captured the five matches needed to win, three out of the Crimson’s four victories came as shutouts. Harvard won 20 total sets to Princeton’s 16.
“It didn’t go our way today, but we’re going to learn from the squash aspect,” Kingshott said. “We’ll have another crack at [the Tigers]. It’s all about learning through competition.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time that the Harvard men’s squash team won a match against Princeton, George W. Bush had just been inaugurated into his second term as President. But the year that Bush’s successor was inaugurated into his second term of office would not be the one to break the skid.
It seemed like a repeat of 2011 as the Tigers (6-0, 2-0 Ivy) once again upset the Crimson’s previously unblemished record in heartbreaking fashion.
Mere hours after the Harvard women fell to a similar fate, the reigning Ivy League and CSA National Champions eked out a win over the Crimson (8-1, 2-1 Ivy) at the Jadwin Squash Courts on Sunday, 5-4, the same score by which Princeton topped Harvard the year before.
“They’re a team that shows up on the day consistently,” co-captain Zeke Scherl said. “You think that even when some of their players are people who you would beat on paper, they show up, and some of our guys didn’t have the most solid performances. Today was a really individual incident, where it really came down to the wire, and two points could have gone the other way, and we would have had the match.”
Down 4-3, the Crimson sent its No. 2 player, junior Brandon McLaughlin, onto the court to face his counterpart on the Tigers, Samuel Kang. Kang easily won the first two games, 11-5 and 11-6, and looked to take the third game as well, but McLaughlin’s foe couldn’t convert on five match balls and dropped the third game, 12-14.
McLaughlin and Kang fought two more hotly contested games, with McLaughlin taking the fourth to tie the match before losing the final game, 11-9, to give Princeton its eighth consecutive victory over Harvard.
“[McLaughlin] got down against [Kang], and he gritted his teeth and fought back—it’s how he operates,” Scherl said. “He’s always been a fighter, but unfortunately it got down to the last couple of points when he buckled down and fell to the guy.”
While the drama unfolded on the No. 2 court, the Crimson’s top-ranked player and reigning CSA national champion, junior Ali Farag, took on a former national champion in the Tigers’ Todd Harrity. Harrity took the first game, 11-5, before Farag bounced back to win three consecutive and take the match, 3-1.
“At first I didn’t play well because I was nervous from watching the number two, Brandon McLaughlin,” Farag said. “But after that, I talked to my coach, and he told me to just forget about the other match and get the job done, and I think from there, I played just fine.”
With the win, Farag remains undefeated, both against Harrity, whom he topped, 3-2, in last year’s matchup, and in his collegiate career.
“I thought [Ali] played unbelievable squash with a lot of pressure on him at the end,” Scherl said. “He’s always expected to win, but playing Todd Harrity who’s an incredible player, never easy to beat, I thought even after having gone down the first game, he composed himself well and got himself together and played beautiful squash to win that.”
The Tigers jumped out to an early lead, taking the first two matches of the day. Freshman Matt Roberts went down in straight games at the No. 9 position, while No. 3 Gary Power took the first game before dropping the next three to his opponent.
Harvard responded, as sixth-seeded junior Tommy Mullaney and eighth-seeded co-captain Jason Michas both bested their opponents in straight games to knot the score at two apiece.
“I thought Tommy Mullaney and Jason Michas posted incredible showings today getting on and off court, really executing their game plans and taking it to their opponents,” Scherl said. “I saw Tommy just dominate his opponent. The kid never had a chance.”
Losses at the fourth and fifth spots gave Princeton the lead back before Scherl defeated his opponent at No. 7 to bring it to 4-3. Farag noted that some of the Crimson’s struggles stemmed from the conditions of the court, which made it difficult for the visitors to find their rhythm.
“I think the fact that they were playing at home made a huge difference,” Farag said. “Their courts were really bouncy and really hard, so a lot of our players struggled with that. It’s hard to finish the ball on these courts.”
Despite the track record that the team holds against the Tigers, Scherl remains optimistic about the next meeting between the two.
“Coming off the match, we’ll do what we always do,” Scherl said. “We’ll pick up the little things and keep working, and I think Princeton should be afraid the next time that they see us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Its that time of year again…
Yes, it’s the NFL playoffs. But if you kept watching CBS after the Patriots-Texans game, you probably caught a glimpse of the Golden Globes and realized it’s awards season as well. With Argo and Les Mis winning big last night, the SAG Awards less than two weeks away, and the Oscars in sight shortly after the Super Bowl, it’s only fitting that The Back Page sees who brings home the hardware amongst Harvard’s cast and crew.
Best Actor (Male Athlete): Colton Chapple.
CFPA Quarterback Award, George “Bulger” Lowe Award, Asa S. Bushnell Cup, Division I FCS Gold Helmet. Chapple is raking in the year’s top honors after a stellar senior season. He was a shoe-in to win this one as well.
 
Best Actress (Female Athlete): Jillian Dempsey
The forward gets the nod based on her outstanding performance anchoring the Crimson to its 13-1-1 start this year. In her swan song season, she leads with a team-high 18 goals and 16 assists.
Breakthrough Performance of the Year: Siyani Chambers
The freshman has stolen the show with his play thus far this season. He’s averaging 13.3 points per game and has dished out a team-high 6.0 assists per contest. They say big actors demand big roles, and Chambers has no problem stepping up in the most critical moments. He hit the game-winning shot with four seconds left in the Crimson’s battle with BU, and the rookie put up nine points in the final seven minutes of Harvard’s game against Dartmouth to spur a comeback victory.
Best Director: Kathy Delaney-Smith
Now in her 31st season at the helm of the women’s basketball team, Delany-Smith has orchestrated an effective offense in the absence of graduated senior Brogan Berry. The Crimson is off to a 10-5 start this season and just clinched its first conference win, topping Dartmouth in the Ivy opener.
Best Supporting Cast: Harvard football
Chapple’s performance would not have been so memorable without the added help of senior Trevor Scales, senior Kyle Juszczyk, and company. And as a bonus, football gets the nod for its continued support of the men’s and women’s basketball teams. Here’s to filling out the front bleachers at Lavietes every home game.
Best Performance (Drama): Harvard hockey’s 6-5 OT win against BU
The plot had all the good components of an unfolding drama: a sibling showdown, a crosstown rivalry, a cliffhanger after regulation. It was indeed dramatic, but in the end, the Crimson walked (or skated) away victorious. Down 5-2 going into the third period, Harvard mounted a comeback for the ages, tying it up in regulation and putting it away with less than a minute to go in overtime.
Best Performance (Comedy): The Columbia men’s football team
A 69-0 loss. A grand total of eight first downs. -19 rushing yards. Now that’s live comedy at its finest.
Best Original Screenplay: A Late Night Escape in Taipei
Best Adapted Screenplay: Harvard Baseball’s “Call Me Maybe”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like college finals, snowfall, and shopping frenzies, a Harvard-Dartmouth dogfight in Leede Arena has become an annual winter tradition.
In each of the past few years, a heavily-favored Crimson squad has gone into Hanover and endured a surprisingly gritty effort from the Big Green—who sport an 18-84 record over the last four seasons—before eventually pulling away in the second half and winning by double digits.
In the 2013 edition of the contest, Harvard found itself in such a situation once again. And on this occasion, time was quickly running out.
Just 32 minutes into its conference season, the Crimson’s chances of three-peating as league champion were in jeopardy of taking a major dive, and a stagnant Harvard offense—trailing by three with 7:33 to go—needed to make something happen.
So it turned to the man who has been doing just that all season long, and once again, Siyani Chambers saved the day.
Starting at the top of the key, the freshman crossed over his defender, Dartmouth’s Alex Mitola, and then blew past him. He drew a foul, poured in a layup, and capped the play with a passionate fist pump along the baseline that energized his team.
Chambers’ ensuing free throw tied the game, and Harvard would never trail again, as the point guard sparked the Crimson to a 17-2 run down the stretch that gave it a 75-65 win.
“Typical Ivy League basketball on the road,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “We really found the energy and the courage to step forward and make a lot of plays that we needed, and I think Siyani was in the middle of it, making things happen.”
Chambers was at his best as the game wound down.
In the contest’s final 2:30, the point guard got to the line and hit both free throws, assisted sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi on a dunk with a second remaining on the shot clock, and then hit an open jumper to ice the win.
The freshman finished with six assists and a career-high 22 points, including 16 in the second half, and for his efforts earned his second-consecutive and fourth-overall Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor.
“I was just really anxious to come out here and do what I could [to] help my teammates win in order to get our first victory in the Ivy League,” Chambers said.
By achieving that goal in heroic fashion, the Cousy Award nominee was able to add another impressive item to a rapidly growing resume.
Chambers leads the Ancient Eight with 6.0 assists per game, second-best in the country among rookies. He is also second in the conference in three-point shooting at 50 percent (including a perfect three-for-three on Saturday) and ranks seventh in both points (13.3) and steals (1.5) per game.
But the importance of Chambers’ performance thus far goes far beyond the numbers that have largely surpassed everyone’s expectations.
Predicted before the season to receive sparse minutes off the bench behind former co-captain Brandyn Curry, the reigning Minnesota Mr. Basketball quickly found himself in a starting role following Curry’s decision to take a year off as a result of the Gov. 1310 investigation.
From that moment forward, it has been Chambers’ team, and whether it was holding his own on the road on ESPN in his second career start, scoring 21 points to lead Harvard to its fifth-straight win over B.C., hitting a game-winning jumper against B.U., or rallying his squad to a win over the Big Green, the floor general has displayed the poise and leadership of a senior for nearly every one of the 36.6 minutes per game he has spent on the court (most in the country among freshmen, and sixth-most overall).
It is those types of performances that have helped keep Harvard (9-5, 1-0 Ivy) atop the Ancient Eight following the departures of Curry and classmate Kyle Casey and the graduation of Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12.
Though it would by no means have eliminated the Crimson from championship contention, a loss to Dartmouth (3-11, 0-1) on Saturday would have been devastatingly destructive, for in a league with no postseason play and no head-to-head tiebreakers, every defeat—whether to the league’s best or the league’s worst—counts exactly the same.
A loss to the latter would have left the Crimson with little margin for error the rest of the way, and its quest for a third-straight title would have suddenly become immensely more difficult.
So though he had never before been part of the 14-game playoff, Chambers knew he could not let that occur.
“What an effort,” his coach said afterwards.
That effort came in a contest before which Chambers admitted he was both “nervous and excited.”
“First Ivy League road game—everyone was talking about how tough it was going to be,” the rookie said.
But just as has been the case all season long, once Siyani Chambers stepped on to the court, things did not appear to be very tough at all.
