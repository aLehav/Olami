After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Journalist and author A’Lelia Bundles ’74 has just submitted the second-to-last chapter of her forthcoming book to her editor, and she’s looking forward to celebrating its publication early next year. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Bundles discussed her latest work, her time at Harvard, and her writing process.
Bundles’s next book is a biography of her great-grandmother A’Lelia Walker, a businesswoman and patron of the arts during the Harlem Renaissance. She was known for throwing renowned parties in her townhouse on 136th Street, striving to create a space for Black artists to create and commune together. A’Lelia Walker shared this love of art with her mother, Madam C.J. Walker, the Black hair care pioneer who is widely recognized as the first female self-made millionaire. Bundles’s first book was a biography of her great-great-grandmother entitled “On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker,” published in 2001. Bundles also serves as the brand historian for the hair care line MADAM by Madam C.J. Walker, which is owned by Sundial Brands.
Despite this impressive family history and the two biographies she’s written, Bundles didn’t grow up with her world revolving around the notoriety of Walker. Unsurprisingly, her parents were also in the hair care business, but she didn’t feel particularly attached to it herself.
“My life was very much steeped in Black hair care, but Madam Walker was not in any way the center of my life,” Bundles affirmed. Still, there were little reminders of her everywhere that her family had inherited — monogrammed silverware, china, and a baby grand piano that belonged to Walker’s daughter.
“The last thing I thought I would be doing at this stage in my life is Madam Walker. The hair care thing was my parents’ thing. I wanted to be a journalist. And that’s what I did for 30 years,” Bundles said. She served as a news executive and producer for both NBC and ABC.
Bundles expressed gratitude that her parents never pressured her to join the family business. “It was really important that I developed my own identity, and that I followed my own interests,” she said.
Bundles shared that writing has always been a key part of who she is. She was editor of her junior high school paper and co-editor for her high school paper. She went on to attend Radcliffe/Harvard for her undergraduate years — when the colleges gave out joint degrees to women — but she consciously decided not to join The Harvard Crimson.
“At that point, there had maybe been a couple of Black women who were working for The Crimson. And the stories that I heard from people made it sound like there was more hazing than actual reporting going on,” she said. She opted instead to join what she viewed as a more welcoming space: the jazz department of the college’s radio station WHRB, a different avenue to introduce her to the world of media.
Bundles entered college in the late ’60s — “when people were going from perms to afros,” she noted. After several years of perming her hair, she wanted an afro too, though her father — like many other parents at the time — was disapproving. There was a “generational gap,” and her father worried that an afro might only make her life harder. Still, with more support from her mother, she got the afro anyway, and when she arrived in Cambridge for her freshman year, most other Black women had one too.
At this point in time, there was a common misconception that Madam C.J. Walker had invented the hot comb, and some Black people looked down on her legacy for “wanting to turn Black folks white.” As Bundles began college at a time when young Black women were trading in flat irons and chemicals for afro picks, the idea that Walker had promoted straightening hair was a source of tension for Bundles.
Then one day deep in the stacks of Widener Library, she happened to stumble upon an obituary of Walker written by W.E.B. Du Bois in 1919. It was filled with praise, and it was then that Bundles began to rethink her conflicting feelings about her great-great-grandmother. Years later, while at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, she was talking about potential paper topics with her advisor Phyllis Garland, the only Black woman on the faculty in the fall of 1975.
“Your name is A’Lelia. Do you have any connection to Madam Walker and A’Lelia Walker?” Garland asked.
“Yeah, that’s my family.”
“That’s what you’re going to write about.”
Bundles cited this conversation as a critical moment. In the mid-’70s, books published by or about Black women were rare. Beyond releases from prominent names like Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, Black women were largely underrepresented.
“The world was not saying ‘please write this book,’” Bundles said. Her biography on Walker wouldn’t be released until 2001, but it was at Columbia that she first began to do deep research on her family.
Across all her work promoting the legacy of Madam C.J. Walker, Bundles has been committed to telling Walker’s story authentically. Too often, she lamented, the stories of marginalized people either remain untold or are misrepresented. Bundles has been passionate about putting in the work to tell Walker’s story with the accuracy and fullness it deserves. She feels particularly strongly about this in light of the 2020 Netflix series “Self Made” starring Octavia Spencer, which was inspired by Bundles’s biography of Walker. She wasn’t allowed as much control over the script as she would have liked, and she has publicly expressed her disappointment with the creative liberties taken in the making of the series. This includes the series’ emphasis on a rivalry between Walker and a character based on another Black business woman named Annie Malone; Bundles believes this rivalry was not only overdramatized but portrayed Walker as pitting herself against other Black women when she was actually invested in lifting them up.
In her own work, Bundles had access to a great many resources to help her tell her ancestors’ stories accurately. Her grandfather “saved everything,” and she’s also grateful that she could talk to people that personally knew Walker before they passed away. She had thousands of records to go through — letters to read, connections to draw, and relationships to decipher between Walker and iconic figures like Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. Du Bois, and A. Philip Randolph. She went to courthouses and libraries in her free time. She traveled to 12 different cities. She examined copies of the Chicago Defender on microfilm. She did her research.
Bundles contemplated the process of writing “On Her Own Ground” and what it meant to her. “It’s being able to tell the story not just of a woman who created hair care products, but of a woman who provided employment for thousands of Black women who otherwise would have been sharecroppers and domestic workers,” she said. She also finds comfort in the fact that the children of those women had greater opportunities — to buy homes, to become educated, to become activists.
Bundles reflected on her forthcoming book on A’Lelia Walker as well. “I’m very happy with the story that I’m telling because it will clear up a lot of caricatures and flattening of A’Lelia Walker, and also tell a lot of other dimensions of the Harlem Renaissance.”
Bundles hopes that her books are not only authentic accounts of the lives of the women that came before her, but that they also educate readers on underrepresented time periods and communities.
“I write the books that I wish had been written for me. I wish I had had these stories when I was in junior high and high school about Black women who lived in America between the Civil War and the Depression. To reframe how we understand who we are as a people.” Bundles said.
“And that’s important to me, that I’m filling in the blanks. I’m always really gratified when people tell me ‘Oh, I learned so much history when I read your book.’ [...] What I’m doing, secretly, is giving people history lessons but also trying to tell them about an interesting person. Creating historical context is really important to me.”
As for what she's looking forward to next?
“You know, I’m really excited about finishing this book and having book parties,” she said with a laugh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As global concerns over climate change and environmental sustainability have intensified over the past decade, many have become progressively more aware of the impact of industrial food production on carbon emissions and waste management. From discourse surrounding microplastics intruding into food systems to reports of the massively destructive nature of the meat industry, sustainability within the culinary world is quickly becoming a “trending topic.”
Although renowned chefs have been preaching about the importance of farm fresh cooking for decades in order to improve food quality and support local purveyors, the farm to table movement has grown exponentially in recent years due to increasing ethical and environmental concerns.
Many establishments in the Boston food scene have incorporated these considerations into their approach to food — indeed, the city boasts some of the earliest proponents of this more sustainable philosophy.
For example, take “Clover Food Lab,” a mission-based restaurant chain which focuses on combating climate change by prioritizing convenient vegetarian food for all.
In an interview with The Crimson, “Clover” founder and CEO Ayr Muir demonstrated his knowledge of and passion for food sustainability “We can hit all of our targets on reducing the use of fossil fuels, on changing transportation networks, on moving new construction to green building, and we’re still going to fall short of [environmental] goals if we don’t change the way we eat,” said Muir. “The changes to the way we eat are really massive.”
As restaurants strive towards culinary sustainability as a means of combating climate destruction, a key question arises: What changes need to be made?
To Muir, the first step towards more conscious food practices is simple: “If you look at the numbers, we really should be in a place where people are eating meat maybe a couple of times a month. So that’s a big difference: The average American right now is eating 3.4 servings of meat every day.”
Aside from changing dietary habits — a historically challenging sell to communities heavily entrenched in culinary tradition — many chefs have opted to prioritize local farms with ethical sourcing practices.
“Henrietta’s Table” of the Charles Hotel has been championing farm-to-table sourcing since its inception. Peter Davis — the chef who created the Harvard Square staple in 1995 — has promoted buying locally for decades and was a revolutionary part of the beginnings of the farm-to-table movement in the late ’90s.
Current Executive Chef at “Henrietta’s Table” and Davis’s predecessor Sean Lizotte spoke about maintaining this legacy of sustainability in a recent interview with The Crimson. “We do our best to use local farmers that are within the vicinity of New England and try to limit our impact on the environment that way,” said Lizotte. “We cut out the middleman of produce companies [...] we pay directly to local farms.”
“Henrietta’s Table” evokes the ethos of old-school culinary business practices that predated industrialized farming; while small-batch “family farming” may not be as efficient as the modern-day economy demands, it undoubtedly produces a higher quality product, in addition to being a more environmentally-friendly practice.
Similarly, Concord Restaurant Group and its award winning “Woods Hill Table” and “Woods Hill Pier 4,” created by owner Kristin Canty and Executive Chef Charlie Foster, was founded on the basis of celebrating sustainable cuisine and has been widely recognized for its innovation in the industry.
The restaurant group actually boasts its own farm, The Farm at Woods Hill, which Chef Foster reported was a part of the unique vision from day one in an interview with The Crimson. “There’s locality, there’s your carbon footprint [...] there’s seasonality and there’s obviously just if farmers are doing things right when they’re raising animals and/or crops, [that] the land is benefiting from that action, not suffering.”
“It's more than just food,” said Foster, in regard to restaurant sustainability. “Sustainability needs to follow through in the way you treat your staff … and the way you obviously treat the experience that you bring your guests.”
Sustainability in the restaurant industry is by no means an easy feat — it is not second nature for any business predicated on profit to adopt more expensive industry standards. Chef Foster spoke to the complexities and challenges of the Concord Restaurant Group’s mission: “I think that there’s a lack of communication in the industry, from people that are solving problems that other people want to be solving,” Foster said. “We need education for business owners, and we need to continue to educate clientele to understand the value of what we’re serving.”
While establishing sustainability in the food industry does present some initial challenges, these obstacles are essential to overcome if Americans are going to move towards a more climate-conscious future.
Ultimately, each interviewee stressed the power of the consumer’s dollar in terms of supporting sustainable food practices. Muir hopes that average Americans can find ways to shift their spending habits in support of sustainable purveyors, and Chef Lizotte urges readers to shop locally at farmers’ markets.
“Through education and through advocacy, the value of it will continue to increase in the eyes of the consumer and the market will drive it,” said Foster, in regard to his hope for future prioritization of food sustainability. The rejection of current unethical market offerings by American consumers has immense potential to raise standards of sustainability within our food industry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This review contains spoilers.
Taylor Jenkins Reid has taken the literary world by storm in the past few years. Catalyzed in part by BookTok, her meteoric rise has included the successes of books like “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,” “One True Loves,” “Carrie Soto is Back,” and, of course, “Daisy Jones and The Six” — which was a #1 National Bestseller and sold over one million copies.
It was not entirely surprising, then, to learn that Reid’s work piqued the interest of production companies looking to take “Daisy Jones & The Six” — a story about a fictional 1970s band and their explosive rise to fame — from the page to the screen. This undertaking ultimately became a project under Reese Witherspoon’s production company, Hello Sunshine. And despite the almost unreasonably high expectations surrounding it, “Daisy Jones & The Six” generally delivers.
First and foremost, it is clear that the series benefited simply from being in competent hands — as well as not insignificant financial backing. Production quality is high, with a robust set including an expansive music studio, impressive mansions, and a variety of concert venues. The band even has thousands of real extras portraying arenas of crazed fans.
The styling is also rather effective in conveying the essence of the time period: In an interview with Variety, costume designer Denise Wingate described drawing from a variety of fashion inspirations like classic rock, boho, hippie looks, and psychedelic vibes, and spent about a year sourcing material from flea markets and online. Her efforts resulted in distinct wardrobes tailored to each character, a collection of visual marvels that — combined with all the other aspects of production — provided viewers of “Daisy Jones” with a colorful, enticing, and immersive cultural landscape.
Furthermore, the production team’s commitment to musical integrity is impressive. Although most of the cast had little prior musical experience, they engaged in intensive lessons and training for their roles. The cast went to band camp, where music supervisor Frankie Pine was tasked with teaching the actors how to convincingly perform like members of a hit rock band.
Not only that, but a fully produced original album (available on Spotify) by “Daisy Jones & The Six” was recorded and released, with vocals by Riley Keough as her character Daisy and Sam Claflin as Billy. The record, titled “Aurora,” launched at No. 1 for Billboard’s soundtracks chart, and became the first fictional band to reach No. 1 on Billboard’s emerging artists chart.
Was making a standalone album an absolute necessity for the series? Probably not. The tracks themselves are catchy and evoke a classic ’70s rock sound, but are nothing to write home about. Despite this, it’s certainly a cool addition to the project, and — aside from helping viewers buy into the story — is also significant in that it showcases the creators’ willingness to go above and beyond out of their passion for the project.
Because it’s a book adaptation, the “Daisy Jones” narrative itself cannot be credited to the TV series; however, the show does deserve praise for its ability to capture the key compelling elements of the novel.
The cast does a wonderful job of bringing the characters and their nuanced dynamics to life — from loyal mother and wife Camila Alvarez-Dunne (Camila Morrone) to music producer Teddy Price (Tom Wright). Riley Keough as Daisy Jones and Sam Claflin as Billy Dunne are stellar at conveying the electricity and volatility of the connection between the band’s frontrunners. Particularly in the band’s last-ever performance in Chicago, their chemistry is palpable.
The show probably could have benefited from a bit more development of their romantic tension, however. Most of the relationship is implied as occurring during their months of co-writing the songs for “Aurora” — which to viewers is compressed into just a couple episodes. This means that the emotional devastation of the love triangle between Daisy, Billy, and his wife Camila isn’t as powerful as it could have been. Up until that point, Billy is primarily conveyed as putting up his walls against the temptation that Daisy presents: He frequently expresses frustration and dislike towards her. It would have been helpful to see a few more moments of vulnerability from Billy towards Daisy — a look into his transition from resenting her to falling for her. A similar effect could have been achieved by the inclusion of an emotionally charged singing performance between the two, à la Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham in Fleetwood Mac’s iconic performance of “Silver Springs” live in Burbank in 1997.
The series can also be lauded for its depiction of relationships and friendships between the women of the story. There is significant attention paid to the various dynamics between woman characters, such as between Karen and Camila, Karen and Daisy, Daisy and Simone, and even Daisy and Camila — despite the two being involved in the show’s central love triangle. Furthermore, these relationships are primarily portrayed as healthy and uplifting, rather than catty or discordant. Some of the most impactful moments of the story hinge on the support systems these women have created for themselves: Whether it was Camila being by Karen’s side at the abortion clinic, Simone dropping everything to fly to Daisy in Greece, or Daisy coming over to Karen to comfort her on stage, the series expressly ensures that the Billy and Daisy will-they-won’t-they relationship is not all-consuming for the plot. In terms of romance, too, it is a breath of fresh air to see the series diverge from the novel in terms of Simone’s character. She is developed not only as a loyal friend to Daisy, but viewers learn about her own rise to fame, exploration of her sexuality, and the nuances of her relationship with her partner, Bernie.
One area the series struggles with, however, is its temporal delineation. Especially towards the beginning of the story, it is difficult for the viewer to discern how many months or years have passed between scenes. Unclear time jumps also make it difficult to gauge character’s ages, Billy in particular. It would likely have been helpful to introduce the actors meant to portray adult characters later, as for instance a 36-year-old Sam Claflin being brought in to play Billy in his early 20s is not entirely believable and disrupts the viewer’s sense of timeline continuity. Lastly, and this is perhaps a nitpicky note, but Karen (platinum blonde) and Billy’s (oddly parted, straightened bob) hairstyles in their “present day” interviews are particularly atrocious and cause slight pain each time they appear on screen.
In the end, “Daisy Jones & The Six” succeeds in creating an exhilarating and immersive ride for its viewer: The series is not the most profound piece of media ever to be created, but it is certainly an enjoyable one. Although it contains some undertones of heavier themes like addiction, infidelity, and sexism in the music industry, at its core the series is dominated by an intoxicating air of passion, recklessness, romance, and wild fun associated with the period in which it is set. Society has spent nearly 50 years being enraptured not only with Fleetwood Mac’s musical sound, but also their trajectory as a band and group of people. Taylor Jenkins Reid’s story, then, is effectively a piece of fan fiction sourced from the lore around Fleetwood Mac. The novel and TV series bring to (fictional) life an era that American society collectively holds tremendous nostalgia for: the love, the lust, the drugs, and the rock n’ roll of the 1970s — what’s not to enjoy about “Daisy Jones & the Six?”
“Daisy Jones & The Six” is available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video.

Lynn, Massachusetts-born rapper Estee Nack is the embodiment of authenticity in hip-hop. With a vivid storytelling style, gritty lyricism, and profound spirituality, Nack has become a pillar of the East Coast underground. His work reflects a fusion of his Lynn upbringing, Five Percent Nation teachings, and an unyielding drive to evolve artistically. As a result, Nack has cultivated a dedicated fan base, some of who resell the rapper’s album vinyl for as much as $350, and has earned prominent feature placements with the likes of President Westside Gunn.
Nack's rap career began with Tragic Allies, a group from Lynn started by Purpose and the late Fuge. Eventually adding Nack, Codenine, and Paranom to their ranks, Tragic Allies released multiple full length projects during the late ’00s and early 2010s such as 2011’s “The Tree of Knowledge of Good & Evil.” The crew’s music represented a continuation of the ’90s boom-bap sound pioneered by the likes of Wu-Tang Clan.
In 2014, Nack and the Tragic Allies went on a multi-city tour with their frequent collaborator and Wu-Tang Clan affiliate, Killah Priest.
“[Purpose and Fuge] had already graduated from high school, when I went into high school,” Estee Nack said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “They was already doing their thing, I just came in and got added on after the fact. And then the rest of the guys, throughout the years added on as well and we became more of a collective.”
Growing up in Lynn, a city home to a thriving contemporary underground rap scene, Nack honed his craft and developed the distinct style that would come to define his music. Drawing inspiration from his environment, Nack's verses often delve into the reality of life in Lynn, tackling themes of struggle, perseverance, and triumph such as on his 2020 track “Wedontslip.” Born to Dominican parents in Lynn, Nack credits graffiti with exposing him to American pop culture and the artistic landscape of hip-hop.
“My first [graffiti] throw up was actually on the side of my house,” Nack said. “This is the early ’90s. From there, I kept on writing. I never was out bombing or anything, just hand styles, fat markers, shit like that. That was pretty much when I started walking and talking hip-hop.”
Nack's unwavering commitment to his craft is evident in his extensive discography, featuring numerous solo projects, collaborations, and guest appearances. His recent album with acclaimed producer V Don, titled "BRAP!” showcases Nack's exceptional skills as an emcee and his ability to navigate diverse soundscapes.
Nack's artistic evolution has been shaped in part by his long standing collaboration with al.divino, who is Nack’s junior by ten years. The two first met over a decade ago at MichaelAngelo's studio, and their creative chemistry was instant. In the years since, Nack and al.divino’s partnership has yielded multiple full length projects including 2018’s “Triple Black Diamonds” and its highly-anticipated sequel released last fall. “When I saw him at Michelangelo's, I just felt like I needed to tell him how great he was,” Nack said about al.divino. “God spoke to me and it was just that divine spark. I told him, ‘Yo, don't ever let nobody tell you that you're not great.’ ”
“He was young at the time and had an unstable upbringing,” Nack added. “I felt like I needed to say that to him. I could see that [music] is an outlet for this kid, for his trauma and pain.”
It was around the time that he met al.divino that Nack became a member of the Five Percent Nation, a cultural movement influenced by Islam that was founded in New York City during the 1960s. Nack introduced a young al.divino to the teachings of the Five Percent before the pair started to make music together.
Since their first meeting, Nack and al.divino have become one of the best hip-hop duos to emerge from the Northeast. “We didn't make music right away, we knew each other for about a half a decade before doing anything,” the rapper said. “I just wanted him to have a safe place for him to come and express himself. He used to come to the spot and make like 16 beats in 15 minutes and then dip.”
Al.divino’s solo beat-making sessions eventually developed into recording sessions with Nack. Each of the duo’s releases showcases Nack's prowess as a lyricist, blending gritty realism with Five Percent Nation spirituality [IN ORDER] to create an improvisatory style that the rapper and al.divino have termed “the splash.” According to the rapper, it is inspired, in part, by the anti-formalist approaches of famous jazz composers like John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman.
“The focus is not telling you this story in plain words, but telling you my story through sound and feeling and emotion,” Nack said. “I might have a gruff voice on one track. I might have a metal voice. I might have gotten fucked up last night, but I'm feeling it today, so you can hear it in my voice. Maybe I'm not grabbing the beat the way I did yesterday. That's where ‘the splash’ came from.”
Nack, al.divino and their “splash” style have caught the attention of industry heavyweights, including Griselda's Westside Gunn. Nack was featured as a primary vocalist on Gunn’s July 2022 album “Peace ‘Fly’ God” along with Griselda rapper Stove God Cooks. The Lynn rapper also has an unreleased tape in the works with Gunn called “Nacksaw Jim Duggan.”
“[Westside Gunn] knows I'm busy trying to secure the legacy of my city,” Nack said. “He’s doing the same thing for Buffalo and Atlanta, so you know, we got our hands full. We just come together and work.”

Four years after the release of her last full-length album, Melanie Martinez chants “I’m back from the dead” in her newest track “DEATH.” The lead single on her third album “PORTALS,” which is slated to be released on March 31, “DEATH” powerfully transports Martinez’s career-defining narratives and audio-visual aesthetics into a new era, although its lyrics and vocal tone don’t always match its rich instrumental storytelling.
First teased in an Instagram clip of a mushroom engraved with the phrase “RIP CRYBABY” — a reference to Martinez’s schoolgirl persona of past albums “Crybaby” and “K-12” — “DEATH” creates a perfect harmony between the album’s aesthetics of birth, dark foliage, and a pink alien-like persona. Shedding Martinez’s childhood influences, its lush variety of sounds establish an entirely new world that feels magical, extraterrestrial, and bold.
“DEATH” opens with a high-pitched mantra that could be the fetal voice of the pink creature — “Death is life, is death, is life, is death, is life, is” — and ends with sounds of running, enticing listeners into the rest of the album’s story. Floating strings underline the opening melody before an explosion of synth sound and heavy percussion. With the song’s emphasis on the concept of rebirth and Martinez’s love of narrative videos, it’s easy to visualize the creature growing slowly before bursting into life in the chorus. As synth-cushioned screams cut to ominous whispers, Martinez expertly weaves the ethereal, creepy, and hardcore.
Martinez’s lyrics enhance the reincarnation theme of “PORTALS” with fantastical and emotional juxtapositions. The self-descriptor “immortal by design” suggests a godly designer while empowering the singer with superhuman immortality, adding a Frankenstein-esque paradox to the creature’s existence. Meanwhile, Martinez sings of Death giving her “closure” while still feeling obsessively drawn to a former lover: “I’ll be meetin’ you here every time.” Sometimes, though, the lyrics dissolve into clunky phrases, like “I show my presence, you run away in fear of ghosts,” and “we all die one day.”
The electronic overlays on Martinez’s languid singing are also a weakness, feeling unnecessary and overdone at times. Evoking autotune, they overwhelm the parts of the song without instrumentals while minimizing her smooth, clear voice’s ability to carry its own weight when rough instrumentals enter.
Despite some flatness, the song’s pacing, sound, and narrative prove again that Martinez can craft an entire world out of an album, this time while successfully integrating a heavier rock sound. Every element of “DEATH” declares that Melanie Martinez has not just grown up, but metamorphosed.

This review contains spoilers.
On March 16, the second season of the fantasy show “Shadow and Bone” dropped on Netflix. The first season of the show, which is based on Leigh Bardugo’s bestselling Grishaverse novels, was praised for its impressive acting performances, compelling writing, high-quality production, and adaptation from the source material (which included the first book of the “Grisha” trilogy as well as characters and settings from the “Six of Crows” duology). While the highly-anticipated second season carries some of the previous installment’s strengths, it crams in too many plotlines and the addition of surprising changes from Bardugo’s books work against the show’s coherence and thematic throughline.
“Shadow and Bone” follows orphan and cartographer Alina Starkov (Jessie Mei Li), who discovers she’s a Sun Summoner — a person with the rare ability to control light and destroy the Shadow Fold, created by the Darkling (Ben Barnes) to divide her country, Ravka. A parallel storyline concerns the Crows, a gang led by Kaz Brekker (Freddy Carter), who find themselves entangled in Alina’s story and the politics of Ravka.
While the first season of “Shadow and Bone” only adapted the first of the three “Grisha” books, Season Two attempted to finish out the trilogy’s arc completely, adapting both the second and third novels. Because of the large amount of material to get through in only eight episodes, the season progresses at a breakneck pace that sacrifices the development of meaningful character relationships in favor of barreling towards the story’s conclusion. Because of this, moments that should be emotionally resonant often feel unearned. It almost feels like the viewer is expected to mentally fill in these emotional gaps to understand the character development that wasn’t shown onscreen.
Another reason why this season’s character work feels underdeveloped is the sheer size of its cast. At any point during the season, the 14-member main cast is spread out across three or four locations and storylines. While the show’s expansive worldbuilding is impressive, and the locations are visually beautiful, it can be difficult to keep track of everyone at once, even for viewers familiar with the source material. Some of the new characters also seem a bit extraneous. For instance, this season introduces two separate sets of siblings with Grisha powers, and the Darkling’s right-hand woman Fruzsi doesn’t appear to do much that he couldn’t do himself. With so many characters to follow, it’s no wonder that the season doesn’t have time to linger on the emotional journey of each one.
That’s not to say all the characters’ personal stories lack attention. Kaz, whose harrowing backstory is revealed in a series of brilliantly executed flashbacks — including a jaw-droppingly gorgeous shot in the fifth episode — is a highlight of the season. Alina’s biracial identity — she’s half-Ravkan (coded as Russian) and half-Shu (coded as East Asian) — is explored with much more grace than in the previous season, particularly given the introduction of more Shu characters. And the burgeoning relationship between sharpshooter Jesper Fahey (Kit Young) and demolitions expert Wylan Hendriks (Jack Wolfe) is exactly what a romantic subplot like theirs should be — sometimes endearing, more often earnest, and a delight all around.
The Crows, as usual, are the best part of “Shadow and Bone.” However, their half of the season also struggles with pace. In addition to adapting two books from the “Grisha trilogy,” Season Two of “Shadow and Bone” lifts the central plotline from “Crooked Kingdom,” the second book of the “Six of Crows” duology. It explores the story of the Crows’ confrontation with Pekka Rollins (Dean Lennox Kelly), a notorious crime lord with whom Kaz has a personal score to settle. Standing alone, this subplot is brilliantly written and acted; Carter, in particular, is stunningly good. But because of the season’s breathless pace, and the lack of attention paid to characters’ interiority, this storyline’s adaptation doesn’t carry enough emotional weight behind it to be satisfying. It feels particularly unearned given that in the show, the events of “Six of Crows” — which are meant to set up Kaz’s showdown with Rollins, both plotwise and in terms of character development — haven’t happened yet.
On the day of Season Two’s release, showrunner Eric Heisserer said in an interview with EW that a spin-off based on “Six of Crows” had already been written, but was yet to be greenlit by Netflix. “It’s about how well Season Two numbers do,” he said, suggesting that the spin-off’s future depended on the success of “Shadow and Bone.”
But the inclusion of the “Crooked Kingdom” storyline in Season Two begs the question of what a “Six of Crows” spin-off would even look like. “Crooked Kingdom” is a direct continuation of “Six of Crows”; putting the former chronologically before the latter renders whatever character arcs the Crows would have in the spin-off redundant. It’s a frankly bemusing choice, and one that, given the pace of the season, gets quickly glossed over. After confronting Rollins, the Crows are immediately pulled into an irrelevant and somewhat bizarre side quest involving a legendary sword, which takes up the rest of the season.
The season finale also heavily implies that a “Six of Crows” spin-off will follow, disrupting the ending of Alina’s arc by inserting an important plot element from “Six of Crows” into her storyline mere minutes from the end of the season. This is another baffling decision given that, again, neither the Crows spin-off nor Season Three of “Shadow and Bone” have been greenlit. Unlike the “Grisha” trilogy, the finale leaves almost all of its characters in an unsatisfactory place at the end of the season, in ways that clash with the characters’ personalities. For instance, why would Alina leave Mal, her childhood friend-turned-lover, after the emotional heart of the entire season was the growing strength of their bond? Often these altered endings, such as David’s death, feel needlessly cruel to both the characters and audience.
To be fair, it’s possible that these out-of-character endings will circle back around to a more satisfying conclusion in the future. It’s fine to leave endings open for the possibility of future seasons, but given how Netflix routinely cancels well-performing shows after two seasons, the complete turmoil in which Season Two leaves the characters’ stories feels like a dangerous game at best. And at worst, it turns “Shadow and Bone” into a story disdainful of happy endings — one that would rather alienate its fanbase than let its characters (and the audience) move on from their stories with joy.
Regardless of questionable writing choices, Season Two of “Shadow and Bone” showcased stellar performances from the entire main cast. Carter is a standout, perfectly capturing the tensions and nuances of Kaz Brekker’s character. His relationship with acrobat-turned-thief Inej Ghafa (Amita Suman) — a delicious and perfectly agonizing slow burn — is an emotional highlight and arguably the most compelling romance in the show. Patrick Gibson, who carries himself with swagger as the privateer and bastard prince Nikolai Lantsov, also deserves a mention; as does Daisy Head, whose portrayal of Genya Safin is viscerally heartbreaking.
From its inception, “Shadow and Bone” was a show that seemed to be made primarily for fans of its source material. And yet, several elements of the second season seemed made to alienate Grishaverse fans, raising the question of who this show is even for. It’s a setup for “Six of Crows” but ensures the Crows’ story will lack a satisfying emotional punch. The acting is stellar, but the story is all over the place. All of these contradictions come together in a confusing mixture, evening out into a somewhat lukewarm experience for fans of the books and viewers unfamiliar with the Grishaverse alike.

Trigger warning: mention of sexual assault and violence
In 1974, Marina Abramović’s “Rhythm 0” pushed the bounds of performance art as it had been previously understood. While she had engaged in acts of violence against herself in past projects — including the series of performance pieces that led up to “Rhythm 0” — she recognized that performance art genre was much broader than people realized. The resulting piece was one of Abramović’s most controversial works, with Abramović serving as a canvas for the audience’s desires. The performance came to highlight a more dangerous reality: the potential sadism of the audience when nothing is off limits.
Abramović was born in Serbia and is known for her provocative works that pushed the boundaries of physical and psychological endurance. Born in 1946 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, she grew up during a tumultuous time in the country’s history, marked by the aftermath of the invasion by Hitler’s Germany and World War II. It was against this backdrop that Abramović began her career as an artist.
Her Rhythm Series — beginning with “Rhythm 10” and ending with “Rhythm 0” — tested her ability to endure mental and physical pain. In Rhythm 5, for example, she fell unconscious after lying in the middle of a wooden star that she lit on fire.
“Rhythm 0” was unique though, because it did not feature any self-inflicted violence, but rather violence inflicted upon her by strangers. In this project, she stood still for six hours, allowing audience members to choose from 72 items on display to employ them however they chose. The instructions she laid out were, “I am the object. During this period I take full responsibility.”
The items she chose either fell into the category of pleasure or pain. Some of the items in the pleasure category included perfume, flowers, and lipstick. Some of the potentially dangerous objects included a gun, a bullet, an ax, a scalpel, and scissors. The potentiality here is a pivotal part of the performance because the objects, when laid out in front of the audience, are harmless. Yet, when put to use by the audience members, they have the potential to be instruments of violence.
As the performance progressed, the audience’s reactions to the objects began to evolve. Initially, people were hesitant to use any of the dangerous items presented. However, as time went on, the audience became more emboldened, beginning to use the objects to test if Abramović would either resist or react to the pain they inflicted upon her.
One of the main reactions the audience members aimed to elicit was fear, reflecting the power dynamics at play between the artist and the audience. The audience members were aware that there would be no consequences for their actions against Abramović. This lack of consequence contributed to their increased willingness to use the objects in more extreme ways.
Within three hours, her clothes had been cut off. Those same weapons were used to cut her skin, including her neck, and some people drank her blood. Others took advantage of her, removing her clothing and touching her inappropriately. One of the participants even loaded a pistol with the bullet and held her finger over the trigger, waiting to see if she would respond. By relinquishing all control over her own body, Abramović highlighted how far people would go without the threat of accountability.
In 2009, 35 years after the performance, Abramović said, “The experience I drew from this work was that in your own performances you can go very far, but if you leave decisions to the public, you can be killed.”
Abramović was not the only artist to question the bounds of human nature in this way. Yoko Ono’s “Cut Piece” is another notable example of performance art that invited audience participation in a way that subjected the artist to violence. Ono’s performance predated Abramović’s by ten years, taking place in 1964. It involved Ono kneeling on a stage with a pair of scissors and inviting the audience to cut off pieces of her clothing and keep them.
Like Abramović, Ono did not defend herself. By allowing the audience to participate in the act of cutting and taking pieces of her clothing, Ono forced viewers to grapple with their potential for harm and to question the ethics of participating in acts of violence or exploitation. By intentionally creating a sense of discomfort and unease among non-participating audience members, Ono also reinforced the idea that inaction can be just as harmful as action.
Abramović and Ono grew up in environments marked by war and violence, and this had a profound impact on their artistic practices.
For Ono, who was born in Japan during World War II, her work often reflects her experience of war and the trauma that it caused. “Cut Piece” can be seen as a commentary on the destruction and violence of war, and how people can be objectified and dehumanized in times of conflict. Abramović’s upbringing in Yugoslavia similarly informs her work, informing her exploration of human nature when normal societal expectations are removed.
Both artists’ works speak to the ways in which gender intersects with other forms of oppression and power. By inviting the audience to participate in the performance, both Ono and Abramović are challenging traditional power structures and raising important questions about consent, agency, and the boundaries between performer and audience.
Both “Cut Piece” and “Rhythm 0” are powerful and thought-provoking works of art that continue to challenge our assumptions about power, violence, and the limits of artistic expression. By contextualizing them within their broader social and historical contexts, we can gain a deeper understanding of their significance and relevance today.

Each year, viewers tune into the Oscars to witness Hollywood’s biggest awards night — who will win what, who will side-eye who, and, most importantly, who wears what. In case you missed it, here are the best looks of the night.
10. Jennifer Connelly
Connelly had one of the better looks of the night given that many dresses clashed with the champagne carpet. Bringing classic couture mixed with what the future of fashion has to offer, Connelly stepped out onto the carpet in a stunning Louis Vuitton dress for her Best Picture-nominated film, “Top Gun: Maverick.” The gown’s silhouette, trapezoidal embellished panel of rhinestones, and stretch of fabric down that covered both her arms created a futuristic effect that absolutely exuded elegance.
9. Harvey Guillen
At ninth, Guillen kept it classy with a twist on the classic tux. Guillen brought the drama — twirling down the carpet to show off his Christiano Siriano tuxedo gown and the label’s first plus-size design for the red carpet. They made fashion history while nodding to classic Hollywood style, featuring an original jacquard tuxedo top and cascading flair bottom topped off with Guillen’s finger-wave hairstyle.
8. Malala Yousafzai
Nominated for her production of a short documentary, Malala also produced one of the top looks of the night. The Pakistani activist dazzled fans in a sparkling silver dress by Ralph Lauren. The look featured a floor-length skirt and was elevated by her expert jewelry choices. Malala’s gorgeous, sequined look made her Oscar’s debut all the more glamorous, certainly preserving her moment in a timeless manner.
7. Dwayne Johnson
In seventh place, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson rolled onto the Oscars carpet in a custom-made Dolce and Gbanna tuxedo featuring a satin jacket that he described as “ballet pink.” Johnson graced the champagne carpet perfecting the classic tuxedo look with a pop of color.
6. Halle Bailey
Bailey’s look was a fairytale come true, ranking her sixth on the list. Bailey made waves on the red carpet in a stunning blue tulle Dolce and Gabbana gown. The dress’s aquamarine color, sheer, flowy fabric, and corset top were a possible nod to her role as Ariel in the upcoming live-action remake of “The Little Mermaid.”
5. Sofia Carson
Coming in fifth, Sofia Carson hit the carpet in a gown that screamed “princess bride.” Princess looks seemed to be a trend at this year’s Oscars and Carson definitely played a role in this. Her all-white dress, with an off-the-shoulder neckline, and frothy tulle skirt completed the effect. The gown seemed to call back to her Disney Channel days with its ballgown silhouette and a princess neckline.
4. Michelle Yeoh
Making history as the first Asian-American Best Actress winner, Yeoh effortlessly pulled off a feathered Dior Couture gown. With layers of white tulle covered in fringe, the dress perfectly captures the elegance of the Academy Awards. The gown had an ethereal and angelic quality, with a breathtaking A-line neckline and tulle train that looked just as beautiful on the awards stage as it did on the champagne carpet.
3. Angela Bassett
Angela Bassett did the thing! The actress wore a gorgeously vibrant royal purple gown by Moschino, paying subtle homage to her role as Queen Ramonda in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” for which she was nominated. The dress featured diagonal draping across the bodice, a mermaid silhouette, and a flowing train. The regal look was fitting for the actress. She had a lively fierce presence and one of the only dresses that did not clash with the champagne-colored carpet at this year’s Awards, placing her third on this year’s looks.
2. Cara Delevingne
Coming in as runner-up, Delevingne paid homage to Old Hollywood glamor in a showstopping Elie Saab gown. The shade of red was just perfect, with a dramatic bow detail on the sleeve, a thigh-high slit to show off her heels, and an asymmetrical neckline. The whole look was ravishing and seductive, with Cara using her modeling experience to its fullest.
1. Tems
And our winner for Best Dressed is… Tems! She graced the champagne carpet with a standout white gown by Lever Couture that can best be described as cloud-like. The gown was structurally stunning, resembling a blooming orchid with a leg slit that draws inspiration from her nominated Best Original Song “Lift Me Up.” She absolutely stole the show in this eye-popping gown with an angelic and graceful quality that let audiences know Tems had arrived.

Kara Walker looks bathed in sunlight when she hops on the Zoom call. Dressed in a bright red and pink satin jacket with embroidered flowers, this floral designer and mixed-media artist evokes the essence of her latest project:“Allure.” Featuring tall foam orchids paired with their respective pollinators, “Allure” is on display at the New England Botanic Garden at Tower Hill.
“I'm whimsical,” she said. “I like the imperfections and things that make it feel more yummy.” This is not the first time that her whimsicality has been on show at the New England Botanic Garden — the Garden had previously commissioned Walker to make larger than life, LED mushrooms. Working from her home in California, Walker custom made each piece before shipping it across the country to Massachusetts.
Whether they are glowing mushrooms or scarlet ire-star orchids, Walker’s creations are bright and bold — they are made to be seen.
Yet, growing up, Walker sought just the opposite: She wanted to be hidden. Walker was born with Goldenhar syndrome, which impacted her facial structure and left her hearing impaired in one ear. This severely impacted Walker’s confidence.
“I would hide myself,” Walker said. “I didn’t want to be seen.”
This bright, bubbly artist described herself as a “lone wolf.” Growing up, she didn’t have friends or play any sports, and she wasn’t involved in other activities, she explained. When she discovered painting as a sixteen-year-old, Walker recognized that she was good at something for the first time.
“It gave me a way to feel valued,” she said. “I didn’t know I was good at anything,” she said, so it was a “mind blowing moment” to identify her strong artistic abilities. She enrolled in community college to study graphic design, but ultimately dropped out to become a muralist. By the age of 19, Walker was a self-employed businesswoman.
She has since developed a deep desire to learn and noted that, beginning with her early successes in mural painting, she started learning a new skill each year — from Venetian plasters to cabinet finishes, Walker has built up an impressive resume of home finishing skills.
From the beginning of her business, she has relied on “trial and error.” She had no mentor to help her along.
She worked in this way for 20 years. Then, Covid hit. All of a sudden, the school schedules of her two elementary school-aged boys mandated that she stay home. To adapt to this unexpected change, she added yet another skill to her repertoire: prop-building.
“Now I'm gonna turn my house into Disneyland,” she said on her switch to prop-building. Despite only beginning to build props five years ago, she feels that this is what she really loves to do. Simultaneously, Walker knows that work must also yield to the demands of life. At this time of her life, work must be done from home. Prop-building fits the mold.
She cites Halloween as her favorite holiday — not because of any particular attachment to the celebrations, but because it’s the time of year when it’s acceptable to indulge in displays of magical sculptures on the front lawn. Her website showcases Poppy Hollow, a collection of glowing flame tips, eerie tombstones, and wide-eyed jack-o-lanterns that allows anyone the opportunity to likewise make their lawn look like a vision from Walker’s imagination.
Walker described her neighbors lining up and down her block to see her creations. She sat on her lawn, sipping a glass of wine.
Even as she enjoyed her creations, Walker described her mind continuing to whir: “While I’m on one project, my brain is already five projects down,” she said.
In recent years, Walker has come to value the community she has since built on Instagram. Despite her own lack of “outside help,” Walker expressed an eagerness to share what she has learned with others.

As beloved Apple TV+ show “Ted Lasso” takes to the screen once again, Jason Sudeikis and company remind us why we just can’t stop coming back for more. Retaining its signature wholesome humor and lovable, dynamic characters, “Ted Lasso” stands out as some of the best in television right now, and Season Three seems prepared to hang onto that mantle.
The premiere, “Smells Like Mean Spirit” opens, perhaps unexpectedly, with a somber Ted (Jason Sudeikis) in Heathrow Airport accompanying his son (Gus Turner), who is soon to leave England and return to Kansas to live with his mother, Ted’s now ex-wife. After the first two seasons beautifully portrayed the different stages of Ted’s marital issues, from initial failed attempts at reconciliation to a long battle towards acceptance, maybe it’s no surprise that the premiere immediately sets up the continuance of this personal conflict.
Ted’s marital journey is far from the only returning subplot, however, as some of the show’s most beloved faces crop up again. Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) is adjusting to his role as Richmond head coach knowing that he lacks the “tactical super brain” that he claims Nate Shelley (Nick Mohammed) — now manager at rival West Ham United — possesses. Keeley Jones (Juno Temple) shines as the head of her new PR firm, and the actual football (or soccer, for Americans) team is largely unchanged, with star man Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster) now solidly integrated into its easy-going atmosphere.
“Smells Like Mean Spirit,” however, certainly does not disappoint in giving its fair share of intrigue; with every known, comfortable facet of the show, the premiere tosses a new variable. We find out that Keeley and Roy’s relationship has suddenly ended, naming an excuse of busyness but hinting at deeper troubles that Season Three will be sure to explore, especially given ex-boyfriend Jamie Tartt’s development into a much humbler man. Furthermore, team owner Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham) seems to have gained a previously absent drive to win at all costs, especially with regards to beating her ex-husband and West Ham owner Rupert Mannion (Anthony Head).
Within these new plot lines, there do seem to be some slight disconnects. Rebecca’s sudden urge for the championship seems somewhat out of character; she certainly rooted for Richmond before, but her new, avid concern with winning the title feels a little artificial. Gus Turner’s performance remains somewhat subdued, especially given Elodie Blomfield’s spectacular portrayal of Roy’s elementary school-aged niece, Phoebe. Rupert continues to be nothing but a villain; his character feels more one-sided than ever as he begins to groom Nate to turn against his old club as much as possible.
And then there’s the choice of a rival team: West Ham isn’t the worst Premier League team out there (although in real life they’re currently in 18th place out of 20), but are the “Ted Lasso” pundits really predicting them to go top four? The last and only time West Ham finished in the top four of the first tier of English football was in the 1985-86 season, before the Premier League existed. As such, claims like Coach Beard (Brendan Hunt) calling West Ham “top dogs” are more cringeworthy than anything.
Despite these drawbacks, the show’s biggest strength remains the title character himself, Ted Lasso. In a new season with higher stakes, different motives, and relationship shifts, Ted remains his unique, optimistic, and overall lovable self. Despite constant pressure from Rebecca and undeserved criticism from Nathan, Ted is determined to keep on the road of kindness and care for others above all else. Sudeikis’s beautifully warm character continues to feel like a much-needed hug for the audience in a way that made us fall in love with the show in the first place.
With new crises to navigate, friends to assist, and mental health issues to deal with, Season Three of “Ted Lasso” certainly won’t be easy running for our favorite fake football team. But, with Ted at the helm, his friends at the heart, and the team as strong as ever, Season Three promises to deliver a whole slew of wonderful adventures for the Nelson Road gang.

Hallyu, the “Korean Wave,” has brought South Korean music to listeners all over the world. Yet despite K-pop's well-demonstrated global success, many still think of it solely in terms of overproduced pop tracks and flashy music videos. Diving a bit deeper, listeners will find a treasure trove of stylistically diverse,and lyrically complex songs, underscored by the current rise of soloists and singer-songwriters. Each track is an artistic synthesis of music, choreography, concept and storyline, fashion, and videography, and the diversity of music genres encompassed by K-pop adds another exciting dimension to the mix.
Beyond Title Tracks
BTS - “Sea”
“Sea” tells the story of BTS’s rise to fame, going from an underdog group sleeping in one room and being cut from broadcasts to global superstars in just a few years. In stunningly intricate lyrics, the members are unsure whether this dream of theirs is the ocean or just a “blue desert,” and ultimately affirm both stating: “Where there is hope, there is always trial.”
IU - “Love Alone”
As Korea’s beloved soloist, IU has always been praised for her songwriting. Her poetic ballad, “Love Alone,” is one of the most heart-wrenching songs ever written on the nature of unrequited love. Accompanied solely by a plaintive acoustic guitar, her beautiful vocals range from a breathy, hesitant expression of loneliness to an ardent outcry in the chorus.
EXO-K - “Thunder”
While many EXO members are fulfilling their military service, their older B-side tracks continue to hold on to listeners in their absence. “Thunder” is one of EXO’s finest songs, a smooth and groovy R&B track that gives the group’s vocal powerhouses like D.O. room to shine.
Day6 - “I Need Somebody”
K-rock band Day6 vulnerably contemplates themes of loneliness and disconnection In “I Need Somebody.” Subdued, melancholy verses turn into a cathartic outcry with raspy vocals and screaming guitars as the chorus asks: “Why am I alone?” The song’s brilliance lies partly in this startling change, suggesting that candid acceptance and expression of one’s pain precedes healing.
Genre Blends
Dreamcatcher - “BEcause”
Combining metal and rock instrumentals with crystal clear voices, intricate choreographies, and a horror-concept, Dreamcatcher is one of K-pop’s most unique girl groups. In “BEcause,” they haunt a hotel while singing about a love that turns into occult-like obsession.
Oneus - “LIT”
Fusing traditional instruments with trap and EDM sounds, “LIT” bridges cultural and temporal gaps. With lyrical references to traditional South Korean stories and festivals, a music video featuring folk traditions, and a Taekwondo version performance, the song makes for a stunning display of South Korean culture by one of K-pop’s most underrated groups.
Stray Kids - “God’s Menu”
Rightfully claiming that Stray Kids is “one of a kind,” “God’s Menu” is an energetic hip hop track which proves that no other group can match the group’s intricate raps or powerful dances. In one of K-pop’s most perfectly unhinged and experimental music videos, Stray Kids — known for writing their own music — pose as chefs preparing their music.
Mamamoo - “HIP”
Since their debut, Mamamoo have ventured into many genres but are most known for their Jazz and R&B tracks. Showcasing their signature retro sound and impeccable vocals, “HIP” is an addictive dance-pop song with swing and hip-hop influences.
Soloists
Taemin - “Advice”
A member of the iconic second generation group Shinee, Taemin has been releasing artistic and unique solo tracks since his 2014 solo debut. In his solo performances, Taemin is known for his complex choreographies that push the boundaries of K-pop’s gender norms. “Advice” is a dramatic and moody R&B track that soars vocally and features classical piano, played by Taemin himself.
Eric Nam - “Wildfire”
Best known for his mellow guitar pop, Korean-American singer-songwriter Eric Nam has recently broadened his sound. “Wildfire” is a cinematic pop track about a love “lost [...] to the flames,” and powerfully utilizes drawn-out notes followed by full-stop silence that mirror the emotions of passionate love turning into nothing.
CHUNG HA - “Stay Tonight”
Listeners can always count on Chungha, originally a member of I.O.I, for top-tier music videos, stage outfits, and choreography. In the house and disco-pop track “Stay Tonight,” she elegantly incorporates voguing and waacking while featuring a BGLTQ dance group.
Rising Stars
Enhypen - “Given-Taken”
With cinematic production and complex storylines that often involve the paranormal, Enhypen has proven that they’re much more than BTS’s junior group. Their debut single “Given-Taken” features harp instrumentals and a vampire concept, giving the track’s theme of personal growth and transformation a twisted horror edge.
Purple Kiss - “Sweet Juice”
Since debuting in 2020, Purple Kiss has released hit after hit with their distinct blend of retro and fresh sounds. Combining orchestral instrumentation with sultry vocals, their latest single “Sweet Juice” is an addictively smooth pop track with a rich texture of sound effects.
Kang Daniel - “Paranoia”
Since the disbandment of the group Wanna One in 2018, Kang Daniel has become a successful soloist. His most popular song, “Paranoia,” explores battling one’s inner demons matched with a haunting, sinister sound that includes whistling and distorted background vocals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Isaac Heller ’23 sat in the center of the room, surrounded by a hushed audience. As the final performance of his senior thesis unfolded, he took up his hair clippers and began to shave his head, a bold and symbolic gesture that would come to embody the themes of the evening. Titled “Unbind This Book, Unstitch This Body,” the performance was a four-part journey through archival research, queer history, and the deeply personal process of gender affirmation.
The first part of Heller’s performance was an audio tour of the zine “Timtum”. The second was a live reading by Heller of “Stone Butch Blues” by Leslie Feinberg. The third was a zine-making workshop. The final performance saw Heller sitting center stage in silence. Several minutes later, he began transforming his body by shaving his head as an audio recording played in which he and his longtime roommate and friend discussed their experiences with brain surgery and top surgery, respectively. All four of the performances gathered together to tell a story of an archive, history, and memory.
“What I was hoping to do with my project was to really explore the ways in which different institutions record histories of people's lived experiences, and particularly how systems of power inform those structures and what narratives are recorded and how they're recorded,” Heller said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Heller’s choice to have four separate segments of the performance was influenced by his desire to keep to the theme of the archive.
“With the performances, I think I was really interested in having separate but connected instances that can be experienced by an audience member either individually or as a set, because I thought that that was one way of mirroring that archival structure of having disconnected objects that are still being grouped together by this larger kind of knowledge system,” Heller said.
Heller chose to highlight historical queer figures such as Leslie Feinberg and Susan Stryker to give a voice to the figures who have shaped both him and queer history as a whole.
“I really wanted to take a book that had been really important for my own kind of identity, understanding my own identity, and then give voice to that,” Heller said.
The final performance — consisting of an audio recording discussing surgery, the shaving of Heller’s head, and images displaying Heller’s naked torso overlayed with drawings of how he wished he appeared — served to show a transformation and an opening of the body. Heller wanted to show how the body can be used as a tool of expression and of memory.
“I was really interested in thinking about my body as a source of memory and talking through some of these ideas of visible and invisible transformation and how those are recorded in my body and in my memory, and then how they can be brought to life through performance,” said Heller.
Shaving his head in particular served as a symbolic representation of transformation and gender affirmation for Heller.
“Yeah, so I think that for me, it's very connected to this question of transformation. And a theme throughout my work that I'm really interested in exploring is sort of change through some sort of loss or potentially destructive act, but trying to reframe that in a way that acknowledges that loss, but is also open to the potential that that loss could be somehow generative” Heller shared. “So I think for me, shaving my head, it was a way of referencing surgery. It was a way of referencing gender affirmation in my case, because I think hair is really tied up with gender for me,” said Heller.
Audience members were incredibly moved by Heller’s performance. In particular, Cyrus Gray, one of the attendees, found he was able to connect his own experience as a trans man with Heller’s performance especially through Heller’s choice of shaving his head.
“For me, haircuts are a very gender affirming experience. And so being able to witness that gender affirming experience while listening to another one was really powerful,” Gray said.
Gray also found himself being moved by the pictures and drawings present throughout the performance.
“I really appreciated the drawings on the table where there's photos, and then on top of it, the dreaming of what the artist wished they could be or wish they'd look like,” Gray said. “The future planning, the queer futurity of it, of the becoming. And so, yeah, the trying to create oneself.”
Gray wasn’t the only audience member who felt a connection to the performance. Ariel G. Silverman ’23 was able to connect to the performance through Her own shared queer experiences. She, like several other audience members, was moved by the vulnerability displayed by Heller.
“I'm queer, so I relate to, I guess the aspect of making certain decisions about perhaps appearance and sort of coming out of it and the challenge of making that transition, but nothing to this extent. Yeah, so I think their vulnerability and the vulnerability and honestness and honesty of this thesis was incredible and shined a lot of light on the experience,” Silverman said.
Ryan D. Morillo ’23 also commented on the vulnerability of Heller’s performance.
“I definitely think it came from a place of vulnerability and it was just so raw, and it feels very, not out of the ordinary, but very unique because I think in spaces like these, we don't really get to have such intimacy and vulnerability, and so this was a really important piece,” Morillo said.

Park Jimin is best known as a vocalist and dancer as a member of BTS, but his new single, “Set Me Free Pt.2,” seeks to change this. As he stated in an interview with Consequence of Sound, no longer is he just a “proud member of BTS,” with his new single, Jimin embraces his strengths as a dancer and vocalist while asserting his identity as a solo artist.
“Set Me Free Pt.2” was released on March 17 as a single in advance of Jimin’s first official solo album, “FACE,” on March 24. The “Pt.2” in the title references BTS bandmate SUGA’s solo song “Set Me Free,” a track off of “D-2,” released under his solo moniker, Agust D, in 2020. In the interview, Jimin stated that he intended the songs to stand alone, but the subject matter of the two complement each other.
“My song talks about freedom and moving forward, and SUGA’s song talks about some of the stories that come before,” Jimin said.
Indeed, “Set Me Free Pt.2” presses relentlessly forward, shifting quickly between different styles while finding cohesion through a memorable chorus. The single’s music video opens, ironically, with a climax: The first bars create a sense of grandeur and tragedy with soaring, operatic vocals. Yet, this feeling of divinity is coupled with the frenzied, corporeal movements of the dancers on screen. The tension builds, a wailing siren joining the voices, sustained in a piercing high note, until — silence.
Jimin, wearing a sleek, all-black outfit, breaks through this silence, with a quiet “yeah.” Opening vocal lines cut through the chaos, along with triumphant trumpet blasts. The first verse features a lax but powerful snare beat, evoking images of the slow, easy stalk of a predator towards its prey. Jimin’s movements match this sentiment, calm at the center like the eye of a storm. Though Jimin initially describes being in a “maze,” his tone is decisive and defiant. “I never stop, fuck all your opps,” Jimin spits in the first verse against a backdrop of percussive beats.
The dramatic trumpets and rhythmic backing vocals make for a catchy, confidence-boosting melody, developing the repeated statement of “set me free” into a powerful, personal mantra. Despite the unexpected style, Jimin’s stellar vocals shine through, highlighted by the sparse instrumentation of the refrain.
This vocal prowess is especially apparent within the flow change of the snappier second verse. The tempo quickens; drums become sharper and punchier. Autotune now masks Jimin’s voice, his lines echoing through the grand space established by the track. Through this more intense flow, Jimin engages in even more explicit resistance: “Hey fool, just get out my way / shut up, fuck off / I’m on my way,” he sings.
Despite this change, Jimin’s unmodified voice returns in the refrain. The highly autotuned lines alternate with Jimin’s unmodified vocals, as if two disparate halves of the same artist are in conversation. They ultimately meld, Jimin’s unmodified voice dominating in the pre-chorus and returning to the repetitive affirmation of “set me free.” The chorus shifts between minor and major keys, as if taking the listener through the ups and downs of a journey towards freedom.
The single closes with a quiet victory. Though a new strain of vocals — perhaps the whispers of something sinister — disturbs the peace, Jimin’s voice rings clear through the background noise. In the music video, after the last refrain of “set me free,” Jimin emerges changed, clothed in pristine white, the stage littered with solemn dancers clad in black. The voices quiet, leaving both Jimin and the listener alone in the silence — triumphant, empowered, and “finally free.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Madelyn Ho ’08 took a leap of faith figuratively and literally when she decided to pursue a professional career as a dancer for the internationally acclaimed Paul Taylor Dance Company (PTDC). As a Harvard College and Harvard Medical School graduate, she will return to Boston April 14 to 16 to perform with PTDC at a show presented by Celebrity Series of Boston at the Boch Center Shubert Theater. The shows feature dancers that have personal ties to Boston, Western Massachusetts, Central New Hampshire and Central Connecticut.
“My mom was a piano teacher. So there was always music in our household and my mom also really loved dance. So I think I give her a lot of credit for introducing me to dance,” Ho shared in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Ho grew up in Sugar Land, Texas and fondly remembers watching a dress rehearsal for a dance recital at the age of three and immediately falling in love with the art. From that moment on, her passion for dance — especially ballet — only continued to grow. She danced throughout high school and wanted to keep dancing in college, but deep down a part of her knew that she wouldn’t be able to dance professionally.
When applying to colleges, Harvard stood out to Ho during prefrosh weekend because she was not only enamored by the Harvard Ballet Company’s performance but also felt that she could pursue a rigorous academic career through her arts and sciences education at Harvard.
“Here's a group of people who are super passionate about dance, and dancing at such a high level. This is something I can continue doing in college while still getting a degree,” said Ho.
The programs offered at Harvard gave her hope that she could possibly pursue a career in dance even though at the time she was unsure of what her academic and professional future would look like.
“I think if I hadn’t gone to Harvard, I wouldn’t be dancing professionally now,” said Ho.
Through the Artist Development Fellowship, she was able to attend two dance intensives and immerse herself into modern dance. She not only attended the Paul Taylor Winter Intensive, but also took a course at Harvard that focused on the history and repertoire of Paul Taylor. This opportunity helped solidify her passion for modern dance and her desire to one day join the PTDC.
Right before her Harvard College graduation, Ho saw her dance aspirations come together when she joined Paul Taylor’s smaller company, Taylor 2. Ho smiled as she recalled that there was always a lot of Paul Taylor in her life. After all, as an undergraduate she saw Taylor 2 perform at Harvard and the main company perform in New York.
“There’s so much humanness in the dancing. It just felt very right for me,” said Ho.
When asked about her growth as a performer and the journey it took to become a dancer for PTDC, Ho recognized that she had to find a balance between perfection and allowing herself to be human.
“Something like dance is very ephemeral, right? And there’s always the striving to work on things. But there’s something beautiful about being human on stage,” said Ho.
For Ho, being a dancer is a continuous process of growth that involves juggling between striving for perfection and its counterproductiveness. Ho also emphasized the importance of balance in pursuing her goals.
“I think … motivation is so important to help us get to where we are,” said Ho. “But also finding that balance of recognizing when to allow] oneself to be human and be vulnerable."
Her experience with PTDC has allowed her to delve more into vulnerability as she dances and strays away from perfectionism. Interestingly, there are no mirrors at the studio since Paul Taylor did not want the dancers to stare at themselves while rehearsing, as he wanted the interaction between the dancers to be genuine. For instance, he did not want the dancers worrying about how high their leg went since perfecting a move is not integral in portraying the realness of a piece or corresponding storyline.
She praises the genius of Paul Taylor and is excited for everyone to experience the humanness in the interaction between dancers when they perform “Company B” and “Brandenburgs” — two of Paul Taylor’s most popular works — in April. Although the pieces are quite different from each other, they both contain elements of what makes Taylor unique. From sweeping athletic movements that reflect a relationship between the dancers to a storyline with characters based in the 1940s depicting World War II, Paul Taylor manages to capture light and darkness within a single moment.
Ho shares that in preparing to perform these pieces and Amy Hall Garner’s recently commissioned piece “Somewhere in the Middle” in just a few weeks, she is really looking forward to returning to Boston after not being able to complete the PTDC tour as a result of the pandemic and sharing her passion for dance with her close friends and mentors in Boston. “Being back is just very exciting for us. And the program is great because you get to see the full range of what the PTDC does,” said Ho.
Ho’s passions aren’t just confined to dance either. Beyond graduating Harvard College with a B.A. in Chemistry and Physical Biology, Ho also attended HMS and completed her Doctorate of Medicine in 2018. Throughout her college years, Ho knew she wanted to combine her passion for dance with science.
“I was more interested in the human aspect. And in some ways dance also really inspired me to pursue medicine,” said Ho.
When she discovered the field of dance medicine that focuses on the needs and specific injuries of dancers, she knew that she could apply her experience in dance to better understand the needs of other dancers.
In her desire to blend both of her passions, Ho was faced with a difficult decision of whether to pursue residency or a professional career in dance. When asked what was the deciding factor that allowed her to choose a career in dance, Ho smiled and recalled that it was something that she knew she had to do. She finished her fourth year of medical school in a non-traditional way with a schedule that involved attending classes and dancing professionally for PTDC.
While one may be shocked by Ho’s decision to pursue a professional dance career, people close to Ho understood her decision.
"The people who know me know how important dance is to my life. So in that way, they weren't surprised,” said Ho. “And I think they recognize what a special opportunity this was. You know, as I like to remind my dad, getting into the company is percentage wise, harder than getting into Harvard Medical School."
Ho feels incredibly fortunate to be dancing full time, especially since some of her biggest concerns previously included obtaining a stable career and having relatively few arts opportunities as an Asian American woman. As she has danced with PTDC since the spring of 2015, she encourages everyone who wants to pursue dance to do it and hopes people choose to be brave enough to go after what seems out of reach.
Most importantly, Ho shared, “if there's something that you love, you can find some way to incorporate it into your life. And I think that's — that's important."
Watch the Paul Taylor Dance Company perform at the Boch Center Shubert Theatre from April 14 to 16.

At long last, television’s best theme song is back.
And with it, comes television’s best show, “Succession.” Season Four of HBO’s highly-lauded Emmy-juggernaut premiered on March 26, wasting no time in reminding viewers why it deserves every bit of praise it has received. In a virtually flawless premiere teeming with new and intriguing family dynamics, masterfully written dialogue, and its trademark brand of searing comedy, “Succession” effectively sets the stage for what is bound to be a remarkable final season.
After three seasons spent squabbling and undermining each other in increasingly craven campaigns to win their father’s favor, the thought of a team-up between the “big three” Roy children (Kendall, Siobhan, and Roman) is simultaneously frightening and irresistible. And luckily for viewers, Jesse Armstrong and the other creators of “Succession” chose to use the Season Four premiere to continue developing upon this new spirit of sibling cooperation forged in the iconic final moments of Season Three’s finale.
Much like the viewers themselves, the three Roy children portray a tangible sense of discomfort with their newfound partnership. While they continue to make illicit jokes at each other’s expense, the actors are unsurprisingly adept at infusing their words and mannerisms with a layer of lightheartedness that has previously only existed in fleeting moments of unity. Of the three siblings, Kieran Culkin’s Roman masters this nuanced change most brilliantly, using his trademark squirming and wisecracking to portray the paralyzing effects of his competing desires to be accepted by his siblings and loved by his father; this ongoing interior dilemma and its unexpected consequences (read: Roman’s endlessly complicated love life) remains one of the show’s strongest points, and time seems to have greatly strengthened Culkin’s ability to depict this state of constant affliction.
In addition to previewing some of the novel features that will develop in the new season such as the sibling team-up and Logan’s disturbingly complex relationship with his young assistant, the Season Four premiere also continues “Succession”’s unfaltering tradition of superb writing. For evidence of this claim, look no further than the scene in which Logan Roy (Brian Cox) sits in a diner with his trusted bodyguard and philosophizes about the nature of humanity and the afterlife. While such a scene in any other show may run the risk of being painfully trite or overly esoteric, “Succession” falls into neither trap and instead delivers a poignant reflection on universal questions of mortality from a character that continues to defy the construction of the archetypal villain. Even when all outward signs point towards Logan’s disregard for his children, his doubts about the worth of humans and pessimistic outlook on the afterlife convey a deep sense of shame, guilt, and fear for the way he has misled his family. A show’s ability to write a character whose every line is infused with such deep subtext is a mark of excellence and a promising sign of more genius to come in Season Four.
Even though “Succession” does set aside time for heavy, reflective moments in its final season premiere, the episode also abounds with sharp humor. Everyone’s favorite bromance between Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) and Greg (Nicholas Braun) is alive and well, now branded with its own not-so-ironic moniker: “the disgusting brothers.” The premiere includes a soon-to-be classic interaction between the two men, in which Tom pranks Greg by convincing him that he has been caught having sex on the (imaginary) cameras in Logan’s home. But the episode’s true peak of comedy comes in the form of Tom’s classist rebuke of the gauche designer handbag that Greg’s girlfriend brings to Logan’s birthday party, which he cleverly mocks as being big enough to hold her “lunch pail.”
Even in an exposition-heavy episode tasked with setting up conflicts for the season to come, “Succession” succeeds on all fronts and easily retains its status as the strongest show to grace the small screen in recent years. While any predictions about the show’s conclusion would be premature, viewers should expect Sarah Snook’s performance as Siobhan to perhaps steal the show in Season Four; her strained marriage to Tom results in the premiere’s most wrenching scene, and Snook asserts a quiet fury throughout that conveys just how great television can be. But, after three seasons of many such moments, what else could viewers expect?

“Let us declare this our block.”
So began Harvard College’s Cultural Rhythms Show, organized completely by students and featuring various student cultural groups took place on Saturday, March 25. The bustling, energetic atmosphere was due in part to the full capacity audience: The show — which fused music, dance and culture — was completely sold out. In addition to the student group performances, producer, actress, entrepreneur, and activist Issa Rae was honored by The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations as the 2023 Artist of the Year. Including 11 performances and a conversation with Rae, Cultural Rhythms was a powerful representation of the beauty and strength found on Harvard’s campus.
This Cultural Rhythms was a historic one, as it was the first time it has been led by all Black female directors: Tiffany C. Onyeiwu ’25, Kyla N. Golding ’24, and Hayat A. Hassan ’25. These three created a dynamic celebration that everyone could feel represented in and connected to.
Joelle S. A. Williams ’26, Akua Pokuaa ’26, and Sameerah A. Lawal ’26, who were waiting in line over an hour before doors opened, reflected on their excitement.
“The fact that we have three Black directors is amazing, that's a great step towards equality between not only genders but races, so props to Harvard for that. Obviously there are still a lot of strides to be made,” Lawal said.
“The whole program is a very great way to show the diversity we have at Harvard, and as a Black woman I feel like that’s very inspirational, to see other Black women standing there, sharing their experiences,” Pokuaa added.
In addition to excitement about the directors, there was a great amount of anticipation for the entire program. In particular, Williams was thrilled to see Issa Rae: “[It’s a] crazy experience to have someone like that come to our school,” she said. Furthermore, she also added how much she appreciated The Harvard Foundation’s festivities. “I like how it was a full week of different activities, highlighting different cultures and experiences which accumulates into an event like this.”
Hayat A. Hassan, the Director of Programming and Events of Cultural Rhythms, shared similar sentiments regarding the great amount of intersection of cultural groups on campus. “We have the people, we have the passion, and all we need is to bring that together and truly be visible on campus and reclaim the space — which is what Cultural Rhythms intends to do: To celebrate our culture and come together is our ultimate goal.”
The show started off with an empowering spoken word performance by Remka Nwana ’23, welcoming the audience to “the block party,” and promising a show that personifies “what it means to be real.”
Hosts Nayleth E. Lopez-Lopez ’23 and Santy Mendoza ’23 later explained the theme: “The directors chose the block party theme because they wanted to remind everyone that Cultural Rhythms is so much more than an annual event, it's so much more than a single night where we celebrate how diverse Harvard is. Cultural rhythms is a harmonizing within us,” said Mendoza.
Featured in the first part of the show was Devin Gates & Friends, Harvard College Bhangra, Candela Latin Dance Troupe, UNIQUE: Harvard College Step Team, Harvard Philippine Forum, Harvard Asian American Dance Troupe, and musician Mai Kim Nguyen and Sergio Javier Jara-Reynoso. Every performance left the audience cheering. The show was full of ensembles featuring an impressive collection of instruments, vibrant wardrobes, and emotional dances that told stories of history and love.
Golding, the Director of Production, said she “wanted performers to be seen and their pieces to be felt.”
“I always wanted them to shine in their own right — the lights and stuff are great, but it's about them and what they want the audience to see and know about who they are and where they come from,” said Golding.
After intermission, the Associate Dean for Inclusion and Belonging of Harvard College Alta Mauro and the Senior Director of The Harvard Foundation Sadé Abraham took the stage to introduce and award Issa Rae as Artist of the Year. Every year, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and its partner the Office for the Arts invite and award an artist with this extraordinary honor, followed by a conversation on stage.
With Onyeiwu, Golding, and Hassan, Issa Rae took the stage as the first artist to be given the award in person for Cultural Rhythms since 2019. In her talk, she shared wisdom and anecdotes on “identifying with places” and navigating life in her post-grad career. Rae embodied authenticity, as she was vulnerable when sharing her journey of finding her African and African American identity and even comedic when discussing her struggles of figuring out how to adapt to her environments. Rae was subsequently celebrated with a standing ovation.
The show concluded with performances from Omo Naija X The Wahala Boys, Mariachi Veritas, RAZA Ballet Folklórico, and the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College. Each group shared their talents and spoke proudly about their heritage as well as their hopes for their people.
“Cultural Rhythms isn't just a time for celebration, but a time for cultural solidarity, so this year we’re celebrating our cultures and our communities, and how they taught us to live and love together in life,” said Onyeiwu.
After the show, Emma Oyakhire ’26 said, “Contrary to popular opinion, because [Harvard is] a PWI you wouldn't think to see culture like this represented, but just watching the different cultures that I saw tonight — these are just the ones that performed, not even the ones that are all across campus.”
Once the show ended Golding reflected on the final product: “I watched this thing come together and I learned so much about what it means to create a space where marginalized folks are amplified — it's a form of demanding liberation, dreaming without bounds, creating without limits all while performing in service to the communities and cultures that raised us and that we carry with us each and every day.”
When asked what the most rewarding part of the experience was for Golding, she answered, “Getting to see how proud my peers are of who they are and where they come from. I think something we all share was a love of what has raised us and what has shaped us and wanting the rest of the community to love it and appreciate it as much as we do.”
Cultural Rhythms 2023 was a festival of unification. Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Harvard College, said it perfectly while addressing the student body: “In a space like this, we shape Harvard's future, and we show that our diversity is the source of infinite possibility for our world.”

Laura R. Coe ’23 immediately immersed her audience in a breakdancing gathering straight out of New York City streets in her senior thesis performance “Falling Together.” Coe — inspired by her ballet background and her newfound love for breakdancing — combined several styles of dance into one emotional and amusing production. From the moment audience members entered the black box theater, they found themselves as active audience members bumping along with the music or sometimes volunteering themselves to dance in the circle.
The first section of the performance included familiar breakdancing moves like head-spinning, handstands, and isolated movements. Coe and her dancing partners took turns “calling out” one another to join them in playful dance battles on stage. After a couple of funk and hip-hop songs, the performance transitioned to duets and solos where the movement became more fluid.
Using a style called “contact,” Coe’s dancers moved almost acrobatically across the stage while they intertwined and disentangled their limbs from one another. They supported each other with their bodies despite never grasping the other person’s hand. Coe described the dance technique as “having this relationship with the ground.”
Coe expanded on this technique, sharing that “in contact specifically, that [relationship] becomes transposed onto another body. And so there’s this confusion of ground and body and architecture of the space.”
An important part of Coe’s performance was honoring the space and the ground upon which she and her partners danced. She focused on light and sound rather than on physical scenic elements to call attention to the importance that the ground has for both dance styles performed.
Music was also an important aspect of recognizing the history of these dance techniques that Coe employed. Coe’s DJ for the performance, Elmer Martinez, wanted to stay authentic to the genre of hip-hop from which breakdancing is derived.
“The music is all based on different episodes of hip-hop music,” said Martinez. “I was trying to place things in cities … There are city soundscapes in there, traffic, and a lot of little nuances in the songs that maybe only I noticed. And then part of it was jamming. A lot of this [performance] was improvised and I wanted the music to feel improvised, so I’m playing live.”
Martinez’s spinning was indeed not the only part of the performance that was improvised. Isaiah E. Coleman ’23, one of the featured dancers said that the performance was “probably 98 percent improv[ised].”
For these improvisations, Coe had recruited dancers from Harvard Breakers as well as dancers she had met through Eleganza. In fact, the level of experience with the dance genres varied across the cast of dancers. Coe herself only began breaking when she first came to college, and Coleman was also new to many of the dance techniques.
“It was so cool being in a room where everyone is dancing to the same song but in different ways, and everyone is adding their own flavor. I was like a sponge just soaking it all in,” Coleman said.
During each part of the performance, the dancers took in each other’s presence. Whether they were letting themselves fall onto the back of another dancer or responding to a callout in a battle, the dancers embraced both the art form and themselves. Audience member Isaiah A. Osazuwa ’23 was so impressed he couldn’t begin to describe it.
“It was definitely amazing. Left me with no words,” Osazuwa said.
Coe wanted to borrow and add to the dance style of breaking, and she recognized her privilege in her ability to do this through her written thesis. She certainly highlighted the importance of honoring the history of the breaking and the people who created it. “Falling Together” transports its audience from the origins of breakdancing to its current embodiment in the diverse communities that it has touched. Coe created an environment so mutually positive and uplifting that even the audience joined in, head-bopping and two-stepping.

“Forget what you know about mermaids,” Jade Song writes in the opening page of her debut novel, “Chlorine.” The following 200 pages of this slim book live up to this first-page intrigue. While “Chlorine” centers around a mermaid who narrates its story, the novel is far from a fairytale or Disney movie — it’s a brilliantly unsettling exploration of toxic competition, unhealthy power dynamics, and all of the messy grotesqueries of teenage girlhood.
“Chlorine” follows Ren Yu, a competitive high school swimmer, who pushes her body to the limits every day in pursuit of an athletic scholarship. Ren must simultaneously navigate puberty, adolescent sexuality, and a complex relationship with her Chinese immigrant mother. In a fantastical twist, the mermaid fairytales from Ren’s childhood begin to infuse into her present thought, pulling her toward the freedom of their underwater lives.
It’s no spoiler that Ren turns into a mermaid. In fact, the novel is narrated by Ren’s adult self, who quickly establishes that she now lives underwater as a mermaid. “You are not here of your own free will,” she narrates in the first chapter, addressing the reader directly. “You are here because I desired you first.”
From the beginning, Ren singles out the reader as something other — a citizen of the world, and a subject of blame — while telling her story from the protected distance of time. The effect allows for a sharp nostalgia to permeate the entire novel, balancing Ren’s affection toward her younger self with an adult anger at how the human world treated her.
Ren’s voice takes some time to get used to, but once the reader relaxes into the novel’s cadence, her narration adds an important, subtle layer to the story of Ren’s girlhood and eventual transformation. The plot, too, takes time to settle into. The first half of the book is more or less plotless, as the reader follows Ren throughout the various stages of her teenage life in an almost episodic way, patiently waiting for the mermaid transformation they’ve been promised. Although this promise falters occasionally as a driving force for the narrative, it pays off in the book’s latter half: Ren’s carefully planned school year devolves into athletic failures, psychological spirals, and eventually a horrific act of bodily violence.
This is not a book for the squeamish. Prior to the novel’s beginning, Song uses the author’s note to address several content warnings such as self-harm, eating disorders, sexual violence, and various forms of bigotry. “Chlorine” expertly weaves together ordinary adolescent milestones with uncomfortable, violent imagery. For instance, Ren’s first period is described as “burst water balloons” that leave “skid marks evoking roadkill” on her underwear. “Was womanhood always so violent, raw?” she wonders. Song uses the book’s gory nature to defamiliarize what society has deemed ordinary with the reality of what a teenage girl may find frightening and foreign.
Just as a mermaid is neither fully human nor fully fish, “Chlorine” also skillfully explores the spaces that exist between. Song’s characters exist at the midpoint between childhood and adulthood. Ren bridges cultures between her Chinese heritage — including an absent father living in China — and her life in the United States. Her relationship with her teammate Cathy also walks a fine line between friendship and sapphic romance, a mutual longing that both hesitate to act on. Even the swimming pool exists in a sort of liminal space — Ren describes her mermaid self as “not of salt like the mermaids in the book, but of chlorine.”
The book itself is also a sort of literary mermaid, existing comfortably between genres and age classifications. “Chlorine” is an adult novel with a teenage protagonist, though narrated by an adult. It juxtaposes modern slang in dialogue against vivid, elaborate prose. The book has elements of horror and is ambiguously fantastical — readers are never quite able to trust Ren’s unreliable assertion about being a mermaid.
Despite the novel’s speculative elements, Song is more interested in exploring Ren’s relationships with the people in her human life — Cathy, her mother, her boyfriend, and her coach — than in the concept of mermaids itself. This lack of clear classification works in its favor: In the absence of literary or speculative conventions, “Chlorine” can exist simply as a well-crafted story.
“Chlorine” does suffer from a few minor imperfections. The narrative is occasionally interrupted by Cathy’s letters to Ren, written after the mermaid transformation. These letters feel rather extraneous and seem to exist mostly to convey exposition. The novel’s surrealism is also unevenly applied — long stretches of the book are written in a fully realistic way, while the ending dissolves into complete fantasy. The moments that blur reality in the book’s last 50 pages are the best parts of the novel, and the book could have benefitted from showcasing more of these moments, and earlier.
Overall, “Chlorine” is an exceptionally strong debut. It’s shocking and tender, fantastical and intimate, gorgeous and grotesque. After reading “Chlorine,” readers will not only forget everything they know about mermaids — they may never look at a mermaid the same way again.

My earliest memories of Kashmir lie with my grandparents, in the fine grooves of their fragile palms and the soft hums of their leisured speech. In between verses of Urdu and Kashmiri that glide past my ears, they call me their jaan, their kurbaan: their life, their sacrifice. They call me their jigar, their liver — and though it perhaps makes for a quite unsavory translation, I learn years later that the body cannot survive in the liver’s absence; that my grandparents and I, separated by one generation and even more oceans, breathe and bleed together.
I often struggle to imagine a Kashmir undecorated by my grandparents’ handprints, by the scenes of their childhoods and adolescence that they would spin over their regular evening chai: of a Dal Lake so pristine that even a penny tossed into the water would glisten across its twenty-foot depth or of their electrifying treks onto snow-capped Himalayan mountains from which their eyes could meet the soil of Pakistan.
But when age — when my grandparents’ age — begins to sound less like the triumphant extinguishing of candles and more like the pounding drum of a clock, I wonder what will then tether me to this rich memoryscape that they have so tenderly tilled throughout their lives.
For me, it is this Kashmir — their Kashmir — that is home.
But as I drift across different spaces at Harvard, especially South Asian-centered institutions and initiatives, I am forever haunted by the chilling reminder that here, Kashmir is never a home to be held close, a culture to be celebrated, or a memory to make last. Rather, at Harvard, Kashmir is too comfortably scripted as a caricature of itself, rendered most legible when depicted as a site of violent occupation and extraordinary militarization but utterly unintelligible upon attempts to foreground enduring, everyday ways of life in the region.
Indeed, I am disturbed by the overwhelming sense of spectacle that has become too readily invested in my Kashmiri identity — a sensation that I have been made to feel most acutely in South Asian spaces at Harvard, where I feel I have become a carrier of an exceptional legacy of suffering alone.
I must note, I hardly intend to obscure the very real, embodied consequences of colonial violence and militarization that have shredded the fabric of everyday life in Kashmir. Instead, I hope to interrogate the conditions under which Kashmir is produced in the grammar of progressive and South Asian discourse at Harvard, bringing my homeland and my people into new and daring focus — even if it means lighting a match in my efforts to shed light.
As a Kashmiri student, I inhabit a uniquely liminal position across affinity spaces at Harvard, stretched and suspended aimlessly across diverse South Asian cultural groups, organizing networks, and artistic productions. And it is a kind of tenuous, precarious condition that belongs widely to diasporic Kashmiri students, who — in the absence of geopolitical legitimacy and institutional support for preserving Kashmiri culture and language — first interface with our identities through political encounters: through confrontation, through opposition, through anger. We are a deeply socialized ethnic minority: We learn to speak boldly about and bear witness to histories of injustice before we learn to speak our mother tongue. We learn what it means to resist and protest against occupation before we learn what it means to be Kashmiri itself — what it means to walk for Kashmir, for its liberation.
Thus, we inherit a conception of our Kashmiri identities that is emptied of its cultural, symbolic, and affective textures and become grotesquely politicized, as if there is nothing but barbed wire that binds our people. We learn to rehearse the trite tropes that keep us visible at South Asian cultural showcases — of Kashmir as the most militarized region on the planet, as an occupied and disputed territory — and condemn to our collective amnesia the faces who fundamentally keep our people alive and movement aflame. We learn to forget, and we learn to be forgotten.
It is in these fragmented moments that I remember my grandparents most vividly — how they indelibly continue to make life and break bread amid the impossibilities of everyday life. I recall the Kashmir they showed me to embrace, how they taught me to wear this identity with care, with spirit.
At Harvard, though, this Kashmir is not palatable, not legible. What emerges, instead, is a cruel, diminishing narrative of Kashmir as a merely geopolitical space — as a land with no culture, no people. As a land of graves.
However, in Kashmir, we say that our people live not in graves but in baghs, in gardens, inhabiting homes and everyday forms of life that flower between military encampments and fences. These gardens are pollinated by the histories and stories of their Kashmiri residents, who give new meaning and breathe new life into this profoundly militarized ecology.
This is what liberation means to me: a framework that neither begins nor ends in politics, but with people. It is a liberation imagined in each blossoming bagh of Kashmir, in the hearts and hands of those like my grandparents. And it is a liberation we must be bold enough to dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lights automatically buzz to life along a seemingly infinite hallway. Somewhere at the end of the liminal stretch, a stairwell leads to the Leverett House kitchen. On the opposite side, an underground catering area is wedged between Kirkland and Eliot Houses, branching off to Winthrop and Lowell. Opening the metal doors at the end reveals colossal soup vats, shelves of preserved food, and cramped production spaces.
The Harvard University Dining Services tunnels are an open secret in Kirkland, occupying an infamous place in the oral tradition of late-night dining hall dwellers. During River Run, wide-eyed first-years are ritualistically shepherded through them so that they can take shots in other houses. On other nights, curious upperclassmen might venture into them to explore, while seasoned veterans use them to beat the rain on their way to Leverett or Winthrop. The mystery, mystique, and misinformation surrounding the tunnels undoubtedly contribute to their appeal.
For students, the tunnels are mythologized, becoming an alluring unknown that entices us.  This romanticization, however, distracts from and depersonalizes them, ignoring their problematic aspects and the people who traverse them daily.
Past the rose-colored lens, pale yellow sludge smears down a peeling wall, melting into a putrid pool of indeterminate liquid. Crushed cockroach remains clump around an empty mousetrap. The stagnant stench of garbage suspends itself in the air with nowhere to escape, and grimy walls oppressively close in on either side of the fetid swamp. Down a ways, a decaying dining hall cup rests on a pipe with torn insulation. Exposed wires, suspicious molds, and scuttling insects are visible in every direction.
The rank catacombs are a reflection of the disregard with which HUDS workers are treated by the University.
A Crimson article from 1938 described the tunnel walls as once being “immaculate,” “white,” and “spotless,” noting that the workspace was scrubbed annually, mopped constantly, and repainted in alternate years. Today, the lack of attention and resources from Harvard has let the space fall into a gloomy disrepair, and the present couldn’t be further from what the article described. Despite repeatedly asking administrators for better spaces, our dining staff have been consigned to uncomfortable, potentially unsafe conditions that call into question the tunnels’ compliance with health codes.
The culpability is as much on the tunnel-goers as it is on Harvard.
During River Run, students have repeatedly damaged HUDS spaces, showing a callous disregard for the staff who make their lives better. The moldy cup perched on the pipe was almost definitely discarded by an adventurous undergrad who didn’t give a second thought about what would happen to it or who might have to pick it up. Each additional piece of trash or dirt we bring in with us can contribute to the permeating dumpster-like odor hanging in the corridor and the indescribable slimy residues pooling on the floor. Students who go down into the tunnels while people are still there also interfere with workers’ jobs by causing unwelcome distractions.
We forget that they’re not just “the tunnels” — they’re HUDS tunnels. While we are understandably attracted to the unknown, we should also strive to better understand it and thoughtfully consider who and what goes unseen in the unseen. Every underground space at Harvard exists for a reason, and re-evaluating our relationships with those spaces is an important step to treating service workers with the respect they deserve.
The University, too, fails to consider the unseen. Harvard should likewise take steps to ensure that they’re treating both the tunnels and their users with respect. By listening to their employees and allocating resources to improve working conditions, the whole community would benefit. Until then, the liminal hallway is a gray reminder to do better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The name “Governance of Emerging Technology and Technology Innovations for Next-Generation Governance” sounds a bit like someone asked ChatGPT to come up with a phrase that spells out GETTING.
However, apart from the somewhat entertaining acronym, the launch of GETTING-Plurality by Harvard’s Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Ethics is nothing to laugh at. Together with the Harvard AI Safety Team, a student organization founded last spring, these new initiatives represent a welcome enterprise undertaken by Harvard affiliates to tackle the myriad concerns arising from the recent boom in AI and adjacent technologies.
And what a boom it has been! The past couple months’ headlines have been saturated with news of AI development, from GPT-4’s launch to Midjourney version 5 to Google and Microsoft announcing AI integration in their services.
The necessity of conversations around AI usage and how to ethically govern tech integration seems undeniable, and it’s heartening to see the ways in which the academic world is confronting this challenge. The interdisciplinary nature of groups like GETTING-Plurality — bringing together philosophers, legal scholars, computer scientists, and more — is especially commendable.
However, the moral quandaries facing AI advancement are far from being fully addressed.
AI ethics is a problem here and now. GETTING-Plurality and HAIST seem to focus more on long-term issues in the dangerous future deployment of AI. Though these potential existential threats emanating from AI are formidable, immediate concerns are even more pressing.
At this very moment, AI is being used to police, surveil, and discriminate, in biased ways that further harm already disadvantaged demographics. The philosophy of longtermism, with its ideological ties to eugenics, will not cover this current violence. We call for a newcomer into the still-developing space of AI ethics at Harvard to substantively work on mitigating AI’s destructive effects on marginalized communities right now.
We also find it alarming that much groundbreaking AI research is coming from private companies who are largely motivated by profits. This can result in a mentality focused on building quickly and recklessly in order to compete with the other companies, leaving less room for ethical consideration. This sad state of affairs is deeply worrisome, especially given all the potential for malign abuses of AI technology. Any research into AI ethics must contend with the realities of this market-driven industry.
Finally, institutions must use their authority to shape the trajectory of AI’s development, guiding it along an ethical path. Similar to review boards that approve human subject research, Harvard should create an AI research institutional review board, which will use a cost-benefit framework to evaluate concerns about bias and other harms. Additionally, we call on Congress to create a regulatory agency to ensure the morality of new AI technologies.
As Moore’s law makes way for specially designed AI acceleration, ethics research is becoming increasingly important. With many technologies trained to learn from experience, such research is not only relevant in anticipation of some distant dystopian future — it is vital today, right now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a simple version of this piece, where I explain what Memorial Church looks like, and I argue that it unequivocally embodies the rhetoric of Christian nationalism. Golden cross, golden eagle, the sturdy wooden pews, the stone-engraved wall commemorating the fallen patriots — the space merges Christian and American identities. A critical eye dissects it quickly and leaves through the side doors.
A few years ago, that is the piece I would have written. Part of me still wants to write it now. It is deliciously straightforward, a puzzle piece snuggling cozily alongside the legion of headlines regarding the anti-democratic nature of the ideology that asserts the United States is, and should be, a Christian nation.
But the more I dig into Memorial Church as a space, the more conflicted I become. Campus discourse regarding the church seems to be more about the structure as a reminder of which religious spaces are not included on campus, rather than about the potentially problematic nature of honoring patriots within an explicitly religious building.
Memorial Church sits in a precarious tension with the students of the past, present, and future. It nods to history, but carries questions into today.
***
Memorial Church is a beautiful space. High ceilings, delicately bright light — it is clean, ornate, and serene, with subtle traces of bureaucracy. The side hall that commemorates those who gave their lives in World War I runs parallel to the broad stone wall in the sanctuary that honors those who died in World War II. A gigantic organ stands in the foreground, and the front of the sanctuary hosts a dark, wooden stage carved in a manner that reminds me of my great grandmother’s piano.
But, instead, my gaze was dragged to the two icons at the front.
A golden cross and a golden eagle.
***
On May 22, 1925, the meeting of the Associated Harvard Clubs in Baltimore decided that “the Memorial of the Great War should take the form of a new church or chapel.” Roughly two years later, the President and Fellows of Harvard College (commonly known as the Harvard Corporation) agreed, calling for a “beautiful new chapel in the Yard” to “be a memorial to the Harvard men who gave their lives in the World War.”
This “University Church” was erected to honor the 373 “sons of Harvard” who gave their lives in the World War. The president of Harvard at the time, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, wrote in a letter on June 1, 1926, that the church would be “a fitting shrine for the spiritual life of the University.”
The war, Lowell goes on, was described by many as “a religious war—greater far than any of the old Crusades in its principles.”
The history of Harvard is deeply plaited with the history of the American nation. The ideas that incubated here, and their physical manifestation, demonstrate what the national American narrative values.
Harvard is the nation’s invisible hand.
In using a church as the memorial’s house, Harvard was adhering to a holy and righteous conception of the First World War — a conception shared by a majority of the population.
***
Religious sentiments regarding war are nothing new. The American Revolutionary War saw the 13 colonies called the “Holy Land” and King George III the “Pharaoh.” Both sides in the Civil War used the idea that they were chosen by God as rationale for victory.
But World War I brought a shift: Conversations regarding gender ideals led to the masculinization of Christianity, altering the collective understanding of war as something romantic and redemptive.
Jonathan H. Ebel ’93, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, notes the tension between religion and gender ideals during the Progressive Era in his book “Faith in the Fight.” National leaders, from politicians to clergymen, “repeatedly voiced concerns about the effeminacy and over-civilization of America’s middle- and upper-class men.”
Propelled by eugenics-esque rhetoric, there was a push towards what Ebel calls the “masculinization effort” of American culture, where “churches were both tools and targets.”
Theologians like James I. Vance rallied many towards seeing the true Christian, the masculine Christian, as a man of active faith and an active body. The “muscular Christianity” that developed presented Christ “as an active, often militant man” — the jump to the fusion of religion with the calling of the military was not a difficult association to make.
The true Christian welcomed sacrifice, danger, and the chance to act out his faith.
The Great War was viewed as a religious war, just as Lowell said, but what Ebel highlights is that American soldiers believed not only in the personal calling of war as a redemptive, faith-sharpening experience, but also in the national calling of war as a mission they could stand behind. War was thus seen as a process of spiritual fulfillment.
***
On January 6, 1926, former FAS Dean LeBaron R. Briggs, Class of 1875, wrote in a letter to the families of the Harvard men that “They too heard the ‘voice without reply,’ and listened, and obeyed.”
“‘Greater love hath no man than this’: whether they had or had not formulated a religious faith, they expressed such a faith,” he continued. “Religion calls for no higher sacrifice than his who died to save the world.”
In the prayer at the dedication of Memorial Church on November 11, 1932, the words were uttered: “Here are the precious memories of our young men, to whom love of country was more than love of life, and the call to sacrifice more compelling than the desire of happiness or gain.”
Muscular Christianity had taken hold of Harvard’s campus. Participation in the war was seen as sacrifice — the dual nature of Memorial Church, the cross and the eagle, represent how exactly that sacrifice was viewed by Harvard.
In the side hall of Memorial Church, a sculpture of a crusader and a mourning woman sits, sandwiched between the seal of Harvard and the seal of the United States. The golden cross and the golden eagle draw the eye of all who enter the sanctuary, as does the looming wall of the dead.
***
I hold Memorial Church in my mind like a snowglobe. I turn it over, watch the glitter dance, and try to settle on a sentiment.
Part of me thinks only of the damages of an ideology like muscular Christianity. Steeped in racist tropes that feared the ‘weakening’ of the American race to that of “inferior races,” I wonder if the men who gave their lives had a choice in doing so. If the ideology they swam in at the time conflated being a good Christian with laying down one’s life for the nation, what agency did they have?
Perhaps Memorial Church is a space of mourning, one where we recognize the short- and long-term damages of an ideology pushed by authoritative figures. What can you do if a war is cast as romantic, as redemptive? I grieve the cultural repercussions that stuck as a result of casting the American people (which, more often than not, meant the white man) as the ideal, cloaked in the — knowing or unknowing — mechanism of Christianity.
Yet this understanding erases those who did not resonate with religious understandings of war. Where is their story? Is it fair, is it respectful, for them to be nailed to a wall in a church where people come to pray?
Part of me finds Memorial Church beautiful. War is horrible; the devastation, the death that results, cannot be captured in words. There is something enrapturing about relinquishing the power of understanding in the face of unimaginable violence. In memorializing those who died in a church, mankind says, “This tragedy is not something that can be understood, and we choose to honor that sacrifice by falling on our knees.”
***
But most of all, I see Memorial Church as Harvard, yet again, revealing its hand.
What Harvard chooses to honor, to memorialize via buildings, sculptures, or clubs, reveals what it — and national discourse — value, and what they do not.
The transept of Memorial Hall, seated between Annenberg and Sanders Theatre, commemorates the Harvard students who died fighting for the Union during the Civil War. The grand space resembles a church, with stained-glass angelic figures holding a Latin inscription, which reads, in part: “Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy name may there be glory.”
There is no mention of justice, slavery, freedom, or liberation.
One of the only — and perhaps the only — physical recognitions of Harvard’s involvement with slavery is a plaque the size of a sheet of printer paper, stuck on the side of Wadsworth House.
Harvard has memorialized the association between God and national service. It hides the Crimson Klan; it hides its involvement in colonization in the Philippines; it hides the racist sculptures that speckle its past; it hides its involvement in the creation of napalm. The scars of Harvard’s legacy are often forcibly unearthed by its students.
Every decision that Harvard makes — whether memorialization or obfuscation — writes a narrative. Today, students move through these embedded narratives and attempt to reconstruct them. Yet, we do not have the right to memorialize our discourse in the same physical way, though we have tried. With every protest, with every op-ed, we try. We are the virtual student body, in more ways than one, beholden to the structures that were here upon our arrival.
Memorial Church embodies these contradictions. A structure desired by many to cope with the incomprehensible trauma of total war, yet a structure that associates the fulfillment of patriotism with Christianity. A structure that honors, yet a structure that takes the oxygen that other narratives need to shout.
The conflation of American identity and Christianity that is seen in Memorial Church, and Harvard, through its memorialization, reveals that narrative as a valuable one. The space is, in some lights, beautiful — it nods to an understanding of life that relinquishes agency. But alongside the beauty is a story, an association, that Harvard must take accountability for.
In Memorial Church, the golden eagle is angry, and the cross hovers stately above. I stare back at them, aching to respond.

William Cheng, a professor of music at Dartmouth College and a 2022–23 fellow at Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, loves video games. He has studied and played them through a complicated and trailblazing career in academia, where he says that caring for the “whole person” is often “perceived to be extracurricular and kind of secondary.”
Cheng is the author of “Sound Play: Video Games and the Musical Imagination” and the co-editor of “Queering the Field: Sounding Out Ethnomusicology.” He has also written and edited other books exploring the intersections of music, ethics, and social justice.
Cheng says that his dissertation is one of his favorite projects he’s worked on. The dissertation came out of a realization that his experiences of playing a piano and with a video game controller were similar. In his dissertation, he tried “to understand both by exploring them together.”
“I got to play a lot of video games, and that was fun,” he says.
As a tenured professor at Dartmouth, Cheng teaches “Video Games and the Meaning of Life.” The class involves activities ranging from watching live streams of people playing video games to having intense conversations on the themes present in these games, like the nature of beauty, death, and violence.
Throughout the semester, he is sure to check in with his students, asking them to answer anonymous questions about their mental wellbeing. “Very few people are doing okay,” he says. “When I share these results in class, I don’t know if they’re surprised, but I think they’re hardened by the sense of shared struggle and the possibility of solidarity.”
Cheng’s care for his students comes, in part, from his own experiences in academia.
Cheng explains the mental exhaustion he felt throughout college, graduate school, and his postdoctoral fellowship as the building up of “mental crisis debt,” like credit card debt. He eventually needed to recompense through therapy and severing his sense of self worth from his productivity.
“I didn’t take care of myself,” he says. “I wish I could have received more explicit permission from a book or from a mentor to really just back away and think about what actually matters in the long arc. Not just academia, but also life.”
Cheng says that he has thought about quitting academia “every month or so” since he was in grad school. “It seemed like an individual was too powerless in these now really massive money-preoccupied institutions to make any kind of lasting change,” he says.
Cheng says that he had difficulty speaking about this because he does not want his students to think he is not passionate about teaching. His students are his greatest source of hope, he says, and smiles as he fondly recalls their curiosity, activism, and even their moments of boredom or sleepiness.
Alongside his work in video games and music, Cheng is a scholar of care ethics, advocating for caring for oneself in higher education. His 2016 book “Just Vibrations: The Purpose of Sounding Good” illustrates the problems with striving for rigor, productivity, and merit.
“It can feel so low when your value as a human being is tethered to, let’s say, academic achievement,” Cheng says. “And then, when the domain of your life doesn’t work out, it feels like a blow up to your professional persona or to your personal persona because we have a hard time separating the two in our mind.”
As Cheng sees it, pairing productivity and self-worth is taught to children when they are young. Cheng grew up in Canada playing piano under the system used by the Royal Conservatory of Music, where examiners score students from grades one through 10 as well as those pursuing advanced diplomas. His earliest memories of playing piano focused on passing exams that quantified music. He felt the adjudicators focused on judgment instead of feedback for improvement.
“My constant struggle is trying to figure out who I am aside from the work I do,” he says. “And I don’t think it’s ever too early to start thinking about that.”
Correction: April 3, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that William Cheng is the author of “Queering the Field: Sounding Out Ethnomusicology.” In fact, Cheng co-edited the volume.
Clarification: April 3, 2023
This article has been updated to clarify that the Royal Conservatory of Music also scores students pursuing advanced diplomas.

Disabled.
It’s a word that most people, including me until this past year, avoid like the plague. New words that seem less “tragic” have been created, like “handicapped,” only feeding into the systematic oppression of it all.
Going through my old college applications and personal statements, I caught my past self avoiding labels altogether, using words like “medical condition” to describe my disability.
I remember how much I struggled to find the right words to write — staring at the computer screen for hours, refusing to write the word “disabled.”
It wasn’t the first time I felt uncomfortable about the topic of disability, and it wasn’t the last.
In fifth grade, I went to watch a skit my best friend was in — a skit she refused to tell me about because she thought I wouldn’t like it. This skit ended up being an extract from the story of Forrest Gump. My face heated up and I asked to go get a drink from the water fountain as soon as I realized that the story was about a disabled young boy.
From elementary school to high school, this happened almost any time people talked about anything even loosely related to disability. Any time this occurred, I would consciously acknowledge that I was usually the only visibly disabled person in the room. It felt like a spotlight that I didn’t want. I almost always avoided contributing to the discussion, and felt a sense of relief when we moved onto another topic.
In high school, during an interview with my local newspaper about applying to college during a pandemic, I intentionally avoided talking about the struggle of navigating campus accessibility when looking for my new home for the next four years. I didn’t say a word about it, even though I had gone to my guidance counselor the same day and told her that they should make more resources available for future students.
I refrained from sharing with the reporter that I had been battling to get in touch with 30 different accessibility offices from various colleges all over the Northeast because they had no information about the physical accessibility of their campus anywhere on their website, and, due to the pandemic, I couldn’t visit any campuses to check for myself. I had been heartbroken to find that one of my top schools had merely one functioning elevator on the entire campus. As spring was fast approaching, I became increasingly more anxious about finding a school where I could belong, where I wouldn’t feel isolated due to lack of accessibility.
Not saying something in that interview is one of my biggest regrets from high school.
In retrospect, this avoidance was, in essence, internalized ableism — a term I was not familiar with until entering college and learning about disability advocacy through my peers at the Harvard Undergraduate Disability Justice Club. I now understand that I was never uncomfortable with the topic of disability, but rather, uncomfortable with the stigma surrounding the disabled population. Growing up, to avoid this connotation, I steered clear of associating myself with the term “disability.”
Before coming to Harvard, I never really thought of myself as disabled, or perhaps more accurately, I never admitted to myself that I was.
Being disabled isn’t a terrible thing. Sure, I would be lying if I didn’t admit the symptoms suck, and some days I wish I just felt healthier, but it’s really the inaccessible environment all around us that makes it hard.
Ableism is deeply ingrained in society in ways many are unaware of, such as the gatherings in inaccessible spaces like the top of the Widener Library steps, or the invasive questions asked by strangers.
To provide some historical context, the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, a mere 33 years ago. So to say disability advocacy is a new movement is an understatement. I’m not surprised that society isn’t proactively anti-ableist, and I don’t blame my past self for prior internalized ableism.
Given that this movement has barely scratched the surface and education is so limited, some ignorance has to be taken into consideration. But that does not mean we shouldn’t make an active effort to become anti-ableist.
Thirty-three years ago, dipped curb sidewalks didn’t really exist. So, I don’t expect my friends to actively look for them as we J-walk across Mass. Ave.
Thirty-three years ago, elevators weren’t required in buildings. So, I don’t expect every building at this almost 400 year-old institution to be easily accessible to me.
Two years ago, I wasn’t at all comfortable using the word, “disabled.” So, I don’t expect every person I meet to be eagerly using the ever-so “controversial” word — especially in front of a disabled person. Society may have taught them, wrongfully, that it’s a bad word.
But what I do expect is that an effort is made.
For my friends to offer help stepping up giant sidewalk curbs (even if they need a reminder). For elevators to be priorities in building renovation plans, and for accessible alternatives to be offered. For people to try using the word “disabled,” without any traces of sympathy or guilt.
Educate yourself on disability history: how Judy Huemann and other disabled activists disrupted traffic and hosted a sit-in to fight for the 504 section of the ADA. Learn about ‘inspiration porn,’ and avoid it at all costs. Start thinking about accessibility, and raise concerns when you notice events or places that lack it.
And I’ll keep trying to use my voice to support disability advocacy while reminding myself I can’t avoid discussing disability anymore.

In the office of Harvard Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92, oil paintings share the same space as an ergonomic monitor arm. The light-filled room synthesizes the traditional and the modern, placing relics of the past alongside technologies of the future.
Feldman, who specializes in constitutional law, draws upon established political systems to tackle the emerging, ever-changing domain of the digital world. He’s previously advised constitutional processes in Iraq and Tunisia. Now, he wants to develop systems of governance for social media platforms.
His foray into digital governance began with founding the Oversight Board, an independent body that makes decisions surrounding content moderation and freedom of expression on Meta’s platforms, which includes Facebook and Instagram. According to the Oversight Board’s charter, Meta provides funding and appoints trustees while making a commitment to decisions made by the group. The purpose of the Oversight Board is to “reduce the social harms that could be caused by social media and, in their place, promote a greater degree of social good,” Feldman says.
In the context of social media, “harm” is a loaded term. “We’re not going to all agree on what’s harmful,” Feldman says. He lists examples of what most social media platforms label as harmful content: true threats, the promotion of violence, and discriminatory speech. Other categories are less clear-cut.
“There’s genuine disagreement about whether sexual content should be conceptualized as harmful or not,” Feldman says. “Is there something harmful about sexual content? And if there isn’t something harmful about it, should there still be reasons to restrict it?”
“There has to be a conversational process where we collectively try to figure out what we think is harmful,” Feldman says. He explains that tech companies often define harm in conversation with users, social organizations, and the media.
Even if social media platforms are able to regulate content that is clearly designated as harmful, governing bodies for these platforms would still have to contend with what Feldman calls “humans’ creative capacity to try to get around any rules you set for them.” Feldman discusses “pro-ana” communities: online subcultures that promote anorexia, which has the highest fatality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Although its most overt content is censored by many social media platforms, the pro-ana movement encodes its messaging in subtler, more visual language, masking itself in the aesthetics of art photography and designer fashion.
In a case like this, content moderation becomes a problem of figuring out where to draw boundaries. “If a platform said you can’t talk about the body, or aesthetics at all on my platform, they would eliminate a lot of pro-ana speech,” Feldman says. “But they would draw it so strongly that they would also eliminate people saying you should be happy with your body.”
“If you wanted to make sure that nobody died in a car crash, you could lower the speed limit to five miles per hour,” Feldman analogizes. “Nobody would ever die in a car crash. But you would also then not enable people to go fast for all the purposes for which people want to go fast.”
To Feldman, the key considerations when designing regulatory systems in tech parallel the considerations when crafting legal systems. He explains that separation of powers — a key idea in constitutional government — also underlies the concept of the Oversight Board. “The final decision on content should not be made by the platform itself,” Feldman says.
Another concept he sees as integral to both legal and technological systems is requiring all decision makers to explain why they reached the conclusions that they did. According to Feldman, this idea, which is part of the due process of law, heavily inspired the Oversight Board.
“When you post something and it gets taken down, it’s a human instinct to want to be able to say, ‘Hey, that wasn’t right.’ And it’s very hard to do that at scale, but giving people the opportunity to appeal is one way for people to have the opportunity to be heard,” Feldman says. He added that allowing people to express their opinions is also an important part of constitutional governments.
One aspect of constitutional government that the Oversight Board and similar initiatives have yet to incorporate, Feldman points out, is allowing members of the public to vote on rules. He thinks that many platforms are considering this as a long-term idea; however, creating fair voting systems on the internet can be challenging because people may not take the voting seriously.
Feldman gives the example of Boaty McBoatface, a submersible operated by the United Kingdom.In 2016, the U.K.’s Natural Environment Resource Council opened up an internet vote to decide the name of a new research vessel. After a month of deliberation, the public settled on the name “Boaty McBoatface.” While the U.K. did not follow through in christening the vessel “Boaty McBoatface” — now called the RRS Sir David Attenborough — one of the underwater autonomous vehicles aboard the craft was given the name.
Eventually, though, Feldman believes that the challenges that come with internet voting can be solved, alluding to ongoing experiments to find a “stable” solution.
In regards to tech governance as a whole, Feldman advises caution; just as “no constitution is perfect,” the current “experiments” in regulating technology “can’t solve every problem.” Instead, Feldman says, the focus in tech governance should be on placing checks on power.
While Feldman once was active on Twitter — where he often engaged with content on Ancient Near Eastern languages — he no longer uses social media unless for professional reasons, quipping that he stays off social media at the behest of his teenage kids.
“I think part of it is, I really, really, really love IRL interaction. It’s my favorite thing in the world, and I’m one of those people for whom the social isolation that came with Covid felt like a cost,” he says. “I desperately missed real contact with my real students, with my real friends, and with the rest of the world.”
“At the same time, I recognize social media as fascinating and transformational,” he adds. “ I’m sure, just around the corner, there’s probably just the app for me.”

When a self-proclaimed psychic medium on TikTok started telling me that an old love of mine would soon be in contact and that I should believe her because she had clearly put no hashtags on her video, I had to scrape my brain for any possible candidates. I had not been interested in anybody for months — except for that one guy, the I’m-over-him-but-every-time-I-see-him-again-I-get-nervous guy who annoyingly resided in my subconscious, the subject for my rounds of he loves me, he loves me not when I occasionally stumbled across a daisy. Surely it must be him.
Double-tapping the video was my first mistake. It summoned an inundation of tarot card readings and manifestation tutorials every time I opened the app thereafter. I’d like to credit myself more than to say I fell for the algorithm, but I thought it harmless to toy with the trends and put the TikTok witches to the test — a mistake, I’d come to realize in hindsight. The next time I saw him I swore he looked at me differently, that he was miraculously omniscient and willing to participate in my experiment. Alas, it was just my imagination.
***
The affirmations genre can easily fuel impractical delusions. Before I thought of simply sparking a conversation with my years-old crush, I was repeating variations of I don’t chase, I attract, convinced of its effectiveness by the TikTok creators whom I watched. But testing the concept wasn’t the problem. The problem was that I had believed that such techniques were a convenient shortcut to actual change in my life.
Even worse, it’s easy to believe in these promises when the engagement-driven algorithm latches onto the content you interact with. The “For You” page, once an accessible window to new ideas and interests, quickly morphs into an echo chamber of the same voices and values. In the case of manifestation TikTok, these are superstitions and unfounded techniques promising the fruition of anything you desire. The more I scrolled, the more I was told to repeat phrases, to embrace my delusions, or to use an audio for good luck — and further still, I saw users vouch for these methods, attesting their legitimacy, telling viewers to try it themselves and make sure they truly believe it for it to “work.”
Why did I find this comforting and not unsettling?
***
Manifestation TikTok, content that suggests methods for changing our realities, has flourished only in recent years, during a time when much of the world feels out of our control. In 2020, Google searches for “manifesting” increased by 400 percent. The perceived autonomy that manifestation grants, assuring that our wishes do not have to stop at thought but may appear in our real lives, is understandably a refreshing change from the incessant distress of the news. “In a time when dating feels like a hellscape, we’re witnessing the live collapse of nearly every system, and we’re still on the hook for student loans, you might as well try lighting some incense and asking for what it is that you really want,” wrote one author for Nylon.
Thus, those who engage with manifestation content adopt an experimental mindset: If the world is going to crash and burn, there’s no harm in attempting to manifest a better future for ourselves individually. Because it feels like there is nothing to lose, perhaps the “3-6-9” method — writing down what you’d like to manifest three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon, and nine times at night — for personal developments in love or friendship or finances will help counteract the constant cycle of troubling updates.
Although manifestation TikTok may be a last resort for some, it is a lifestyle for others. Samantha Palazzolo, a popular TikTok creator, promotes “Lucky Girl Syndrome” in her videos, a manifestation technique where she encourages her viewers to repeat the affirmation “I’m so lucky” to channel lucky circumstances into their lives. In an interview with The Cut, Palazzo said the technique “shows that I have control over my life and that I can be responsible for myself and do what I want.”
As we attempt to grapple with our own realities, the dubious and the borderline-fictional don’t seem harmful — if anything, they’re the most harmless to indulge. At the very least, this mindset keeps us scrolling.
***
These manifestation trends encourage taking shortcuts with minimal stakes. Participating in them is all too easy, which further incentivizes people to engage with them. I don’t truly believe that filming a six-second video with a random frequency audio will bring sudden abundance and luck into my life, yet my phone usage history would say otherwise. And when I have a bad day after not taking every command on my “For You” page the night before, I have a tinge of regret for doing so.
Perhaps it is easier to blame our misfortunes on the arbitrary or the insignificant, and perhaps resorting to such justifications draws us farther and farther away from facing the root of our problems and desires. Embracing our skepticism of these methods can help remind ourselves that manifestation trends ultimately serve as temporary escapism. We can’t “3-6-9” our way to our dream job or the end of political turmoil; but we can present our most authentic selves at those interviews, stay engaged with social change, and, above all, learn to sit with these feelings of discomfort and uncertainty that come with the turbulence of the world today.
For me, my years-old, nearly worn-off infatuation was unnecessarily prolonged by my attention to TikTok trends, and I still have yet to unravel myself from the strings of “fate” and “luck” which have recently occupied my screen.
Or maybe, I’m afraid of disappointment and need to repeat affirmations of luck more than ever, convincing myself that “I’m so lucky” to manifest more conviction into my reality.
I might just need a TikTok detox.

Supergirl severs her partnership with the paternalistic Superman. She realizes her powers don’t actually make her “different from the other girls.” Veronica and Betty rekindle their friendship strained by rivalry for Archie’s fleeting favor. Petunia Pig finally leaves Porky, her deadbeat husband, a literal chauvinist pig.
These scenes are from the panels in “Breaking Out,” one of the stories in the July 1970 edition of “It Ain’t Me Babe Comix,” in which popular female comic characters revolt against the men dominating their lives and defy their creators. The “uprooted sisters” team up “into small groups not unlike witch covens” and go picketing for women’s history and self-defense classes. They consider if they should “take that acid we’ve been saving and commune with the moon,” while Supergirl frees the inmates of a women’s prison.
“It Ain’t Me Babe Comix” was the first entirely women-created comic book and was produced by artist Trina Robbins. It grew out of the “It Ain’t Me Babe” newspaper created by the organization Berkeley Women’s Liberation and led to the development of “Wimmen’s Comix,” which was run collectively by female artists, including Robbins, from 1972 to 1992. Both are held in collections by the Harvard Schlesinger Library.
All three of these works developed alongside second-wave feminism. Coupled with the revolutionary spirit of 1960s movements for Civil Rights and against the Vietnam War, second-wave feminism advocated for women’s reproductive rights, job opportunities, and freedom from sexual assault and harassment. These themes shine through in the comix Robbins helped create.
Much like her art, Robbins is a colorful character. A fixture in the 1960s L.A. arts scene, she befriended legends of Sunset Strip, including David Crosby of the Byrds, Jim Morrison, and Mama Cass. Robbins is even the subject of the first verse of Joni Mitchell’s “Ladies of the Canyon.” “Trina wears her wampum beads / She fills her drawing book with line,” Mitchell sings.
“Comix with an ‘X’ is underground comics,” Robbins says. As we interview her, we can see eclectically-decorated bookshelves of awards and figurines and a near-life-sized nude female mannequin posed in her Zoom background.
“Underground comix was an art form of the ’60s and ’70s,” Robbins says. With the accessibility of creating and discovering comics on the internet and a mainstream openness to comics involving taboo topics like sex and drugs, she believes, “It really doesn’t exist anymore.”
But the desire to discuss drugs and sex was not the only reason “It Ain’t Me Babe” had to go underground.
“If you wanted to do a comic that actually paid you money in 1970, you had to draw superheroes. You had to do muscular guys beating each other up,” Robbins says. She was the first woman commissioned to draw one of the notoriously muscular female fighters in comics — Wonder Woman. “Women don’t do muscular guys beating each other up. That’s not what we’re into.”
Though some women certainly are into muscular men who fight (see: Marvel fans), the stories told in the comix Robbins helped produce are more grounded in the consciousness of its female creators. Grounded, but of course, no less fantastical.
The stories told by “It Ain’t Me Babe,” each drawn by a different artist, add imaginative twists to lived experiences. For example, one strip entitled “Monday” imagines a woman free from the crushing mundanity of secretarial labor — the Queen of the Jungle. She catapults from vine to vine, “eager to return home after many tiring battles against injustice and oppression.”
Another, “Remembering Telluria,” features bold and intricate panels depicting an ancient society ruled by Ma Mata, “the Great Mother, Beating Heart of the Earth.” It follows Ma Mata’s handmaiden and protégé, Maia, who goes on a mystical trip and sees visions of future industrialized urban life and “wars fought by violent men who had forgotten the Great Mother.” Maia awakens to discover herself in that modern hellscape. She had been plugged into a male doctor’s simulation machine all along.
The first issue of “Wimmen’s Comix” in 1972 debuted Robbins’ “Sandy Comes Out,” the first-ever comic strip featuring an “out” lesbian that was nonpornographic in nature, Robbins says.
Sharing the coming-out story of her roommate Sandy, Robbins imagines her internal turmoil as she questions her identity, framing lesbianism as “a positive alternative to the dehumanizing nuclear family.”
While progressive for the times, the piece was an outside-perspective looking inwards — a tension that Robbins acknowledges.
“I was still a straight woman doing it,” says Robbins.
In the comic, Sandy wonders if lesbianism could be “some way to smash phallic imperialism.” The comic portrays penises as inherently patriarchal and explains lesbianism by describing genitalia, ignoring the existence of trans lesbians and potentially denying them of their womanhood.
“It’s what Sandy said,” Robbins wrote in an email. “In 1972 there were no, or at least a microscopic number of trans women. I ask you to be aware that this was the very beginning of that kind of awareness, if it even existed yet!”
The stories also overwhelmingly feature white female protagonists, and rarely include characters of color.
“That was not our choice, to be all white,” Robbins says. “We got no contributions by Black women. It was as simple as that.”
Even though the comix were open to submissions from women of color, the perspective of the comix’s various contributors is one distinctly of white womanhood. In the story “Oma” in “It Ain’t Me Babe,” the female protagonist’s tranquil life homesteading is disrupted by brutality from Native Americans. In “Wimmen’s Comix” No. 8, “Virginia’s Story” follows a white woman who imagines different ways to kill a Black man in her home she presumes has come to rape her.
In an email, Robbins wrote that the creator of the “Oma” comic “now says that she regrets having done it.”
When asked what she would change about “It Ain’t Me Babe” or “Wimmen’s Comix,” Robbins responds, “Nothing.”
“They were perfect for what they were. A lot of the work was beginner stuff.”
To be sure, Robbins has made her mark on comics history — with some calling her the “Real-Life Wonder Woman of Comics Herstory.” She believes that the initial reception of “It Ain’t Me Babe” indicates that it inspired women to share their stories as they had not been able to before.
“We knew we were affecting women from the very first issue. The first issue had a call for entries,” Robbins says, “and immediately, we started getting comix from other women.”
“It was fantastic. There were as many different styles as there were women. And many of them were self-published,” Robbins says. “And it’s just, it’s endless. It’s endless. The possibilities are endless.”

When we meet Nikola Jurkovic ’25 on Zoom, he’s sitting in front of a whiteboard covered with equations. We chat about his interest in folk punk music; his headphones push his hair back into a kind of emo swoop. Jurkovic comes across as friendly, but also guarded: He seems to want to make a good impression.
Jurkovic tells us he first learned about the philosophical movement called effective altruism from the comments section of a YouTube video about veganism during his gap year. When he moved from Croatia to Harvard, he joined the Harvard Undergraduate EA group and eventually became its president. “I think I’ve been looking for ways to make the world better for a really long time,” he says, “I think as far back as I can remember.”
EA, its proponents will tell you, is aimed at “doing good better.” It starts with the problem that the ways that we approach charity, aid, and other kinds of good-doing are clouded by human biases, and tries to find the best solution using statistical tools. For example, an effective altruist might argue that donating money to foundations that provide malaria treatments maximizes your lives saved per dollar spent.
The movement began in the early 2010s as the brainchild of the philosopher Will MacAskill. In the years since, it has flourished in both in-person spaces, like conferences, as well as blogs and forums. Users map out their worldviews in long, technical posts, debating what exactly different EA principles look like in practice, the merits of various criticisms of the movement, how to adapt to the more meritorious criticisms, and how to counter the less meritorious ones.
EA has also garnered support from a number of high-profile acolytes.
“This is a close match for my philosophy,” Elon Musk tweeted last August about MacAskill’s new book.
“Effective altruism — efforts that actually help people rather than making you feel good or helping you show off — is one of the great new ideas of the 21st century,” celebrity academic and Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker wrote.
One of the highest-profile effective altruists was the former billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, whose commitment to donate much of his wealth to EA causes turned out to be impossible after his cryptocurrency company, FTX, collapsed due to alleged fraud. His commitment also turned out to be disingenuous: In a postmortem interview with Vox, he described his apparent embrace of ethics as “this dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right shibboleths and so everyone likes us.”
Nevertheless, EA’s profile has continued to rise. Even at Harvard, some students find the pull inescapable: “Effective altruism is a huge trend on campus, seeping into everything,” Henry Haimo ’24 told the New Yorker in March, in an article ostensibly about the decline of the humanities.
When Harvard’s undergraduate EA group started on campus a decade ago, though, EA was not so widespread. At first, getting students to join was a challenge. “I realized that the idea of HEA seemed crazy: ‘join us and we’ll try to figure out how to maximize the good we do in the world!’” Ben S. Kuhn ’15, the co-president at the time, wrote in a 2014 blog post. “But my mistake was letting other people know that I knew HEA seemed crazy. As soon as they realized that I myself felt goofy, it was game over for convincing them to get involved.” He described expanding the group’s influence through a combination of savvy advertising tactics and a slate of famous speakers such as the philosopher Peter Singer, one of the most prominent intellectuals associated with the movement.
Today, there are several different EA groups across the University, including at the College, law school, and GSAS, as well as in the Boston area. (In this article, “Harvard EA” refers to the undergraduate group unless otherwise specified.) Jurkovic guesses there are “between 20 and 50” students involved in Harvard EA’s regular programming; there are dozens more in its introductory fellowships and hundreds more on the mailing lists.
Harvard markets itself as “developing leaders who make a difference globally,” and pop culture spins this principle into myth: Here is a university whose students will go on to save the world. EA is a movement that claims to know how to do it, from shifts in diet — a lot of the people we meet are vegan, in recognition of the statistically unmatched suffering that factory farming inflicts on chickens — to shifts in career, like the students who have devoted their futures to trying to prevent human extinction by AI.
“Most of us want to improve the world,” the Harvard EA website says. “But figuring out what that ‘something’ is, let alone actually doing it, can be a difficult and disheartening challenge. Effective altruism is a response to this challenge.” Can it live up to that goal?
If you are not already a committed effective altruist — and if you are interested in a discussion group that zigzags from deworming methodology to Bayesian statistics to the number of animals killed for food in the U.S. in the last 30 seconds — your first involvement with EA at Harvard might come through the introductory Arete Fellowship, a seven-week program that explores different effective altruism topics every week.
Daniela R. Shuman ’24, a Computer Science and Statistics concentrator interested in urban development, is one of the Arete chairs. She did the fellowship herself a year ago and “fell in love with the whole concept,” she says. She guesses there were around 40 fellows last fall.
We ask Will A. Nickols ’24, the other chair, if we can sit in on one of the sections. After some back-and-forth, Nickols suggests we attend the second week of the fellowship, which focuses on global health.
We get there before the meeting room opens. The discussion leaders, Nick C. Gabrieli ’24 and Jorge O. Guerra Jr. ’24, a former Crimson News editor, are sitting in near-darkness on the stairs outside the Adams House Upper Common Room, chatting: “What else are you up to this semester?” “What do you see as the limits of randomized control trials?” The vaulted blue ceiling looks like the night sky.
Claire Guo ’24, one of the Arete fellows and a former Crimson News editor, wanders up wearing two baseball caps; she wants to know if the leaders are participating in the junior class-wide game of Assassins.
No, Gabrieli tells her, adding, “I feel like I’m in the market for developing more hobbies.”
At 6 p.m., we file into the meeting room and assign ourselves to armchairs. There are three fellows in attendance, and another will show up halfway through. Gabrieli and Guerra walk us through the vocabulary terms from the readings — two blog posts, a lecture by an Oxford Professor, a TED talk, and several charts about life expectancy in different countries — asking the group to define and react to them.
This week, the discussion involves identifying your “problem”: So you’ve already decided you want to do good. How do you figure out what to do?
EA takes cues from rationalism, a commitment to logic rather than feelings as a basis for decision-making. For the Arete fellows, this requires learning a lot of terminology. For example, the “counterfactual impact” of an action is the result of doing that action, relative to the result of not doing it. Say you want to volunteer in a soup kitchen — a lot of EA readings use this example — but there are plenty of other volunteers; if you don’t do it, someone else will. Unless you are extremely good at serving soup, the amount of soup served in a world where you are a server is probably not that different from the amount of soup served in a world where you are not, and you might want to focus your altruistic intentions elsewhere.
At the discussion leaders’ prompting, the fellows — Guo; Nathanael Tjandra ’26; and Kai C. Hostin ’25 — talk among themselves, trying to recall concepts from the readings. More than anything, it feels like a class section.
Gabrieli asks, “What is ‘importance?’” Guo and Hostin look at each other with uncertainty. “It should be able to be inferred, I think, from the word itself,” he continues. “What is the absolute magnitude of the thing we’re interested in?”
There are a lot of math terms, too. One of the readings constructs a complicated-looking product of derivatives to make the conceptual point that importance, tractability, and neglectedness are all vital considerations. Importance is how important a problem is; tractability is how much good can be done relative to effort; neglectedness is how much other people are already working in that area.
Still, the fellows have questions, and Gabrieli and Guerra are happy to discuss them. Should your personal interests play a role in what you decide to focus on? What about problems that require immediate responses, rather than careful calculation of impact? They talk but don’t come to any singular answer.
Near the end of the hour, Guerra brings up GiveWell, a well-known EA organization that maintains a ranked list of recommended charities. He asks the group: Of the top four causes on the website, which one would you donate to, and why?
First on the list is Malaria Consortium, which provides a kind of medicine called seasonal malaria chemoprevention. Malaria treatments are high-importance, and tractable because they are relatively cheap; GiveWell estimates that it costs $7 to protect a child from malaria. Second on the list is the Against Malaria Foundation, which provides malaria nets for about $5 each.
Tjandra, a Crimson Multimedia editor, ultimately chooses the fourth-ranked charity, which provides cash incentives to caregivers in Nigeria who vaccinate their babies. Unlike malaria treatments, he reasons, vaccines are “more generalizable to poor people everywhere.”
Guo asks if instead of providing Vitamin A supplements to areas in sub-Saharan Africa, as the third-ranked charity does, we could try to integrate vegetables rich in Vitamin A into those communities. “‘Eat some yams,’” she says, laughing.
Hostin concurs: “I don’t want to be like ‘Oh, here’s a fish’ rather than teach them how to fish, in a way.”
At the end of the Arete fellowship, you are given a $10 gift card to the charity donation site Every.org. If you donate $10 of your own money, you receive another gift card. But what happens next is up to you: Since Harvard EA has no centralized meetings or agenda, continued membership means “joining the various side groups that we have, depending on what you’re interested in,” Shuman says.
Donating large parts of your income to charity — or earning to give, in the style of Bankman-Fried — are largely out of reach for college students, Jurkovic tells us. Instead, we find out, undergrad EA groups tend to focus on research and recruitment.
Still, the issues Harvard EA focuses on don’t always line up with the picture of EA suggested by the Arete fellowship. Zazie Huml ’25, Harvard EA’s Global Health Programming Lead and one of four people on its board, said when they joined Harvard EA there was “no major initiative” in global health or international development — two of the five major topics covered in the Arete fellowship — and there were only “a couple people” involved with animal rights, a third focus area.
“In Harvard EA we try not to present unfairly biased opinions towards any particular world problem,” Jurkovic says. “We aim to present the facts about the world problems and also give people useful decision-making tools so that they can examine the facts themselves.”
“My entire experience with EA at Harvard last semester was, ‘Oh, this is not for me, this is not my community. They’re not interested in the same things as me,’” Huml says, until someone they met in the organization encouraged them to take another look. “If I was to take initiative within the system, there would be resources to support me,” they recall the person saying. Huml has since led several global health initiatives under the umbrella of Harvard EA, including a “comprehensive study on source apportionment of lead exposure” in lower-income countries in partnership with the Lead Exposure Elimination Project.
So what was Harvard EA doing? “It was only focused on longtermism and AI,” Huml remembers.
Longtermism — week five on the Arete syllabus — is the view that people who will be alive in the future warrant the same moral consideration as people alive today. “If we want to do the most good, that means we want to help the most people,” Shuman says, “and the most people is not at the specific time that we’re living in.” Since future people will significantly outnumber today's people, barring a mass extinction event, longtermists argue that we should devote more resources to preventing “existential risks” like nuclear warfare or engineered pandemics.
This is something of a departure from EA principles in other areas, which our interviewees explain are a refinement of natural human instincts: You already want to do good, and EA just teaches you how to be smart about it. For a longtermist, though, what is at stake is the future of human existence.
In recent years, longtermists have turned their attention to the field of AI safety. As AI models grow increasingly powerful, EA researchers have argued, the existential threat they pose may become insurmountable. They call this the problem of “AI alignment”: ensuring that if or when a superhuman AI comes into existence, its values align with our own, so that it does not kill everyone on Earth.
Some AI safety researchers have been sounding this alarm for decades — but this past year, thanks to the rise of shockingly powerful, publicly available AI models like ChatGPT, the issue has made it into the mainstream. ChatGPT is already prone to spreading misinformation. A “sufficiently powerful” AI could be much worse, researcher Elizier Yudkowsky argued in a recent Time magazine op-ed calling for an indefinite moratorium on AI development. “In today’s world you can email DNA strings to laboratories that will produce proteins on demand allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing,” he wrote.
How do you quantify incalculable destruction? “The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity,” a book by Toby Ord about existential risk, for which Harvard EA runs a reading group, puts the risk of extinction in the next century from unaligned AI at 1 in 10, higher than any other source of risk. Last July, Jurkovic wrote in a comment on the EA forum that “existential risks are high up on the list of most probable causes of death for college aged-people”: Assume that the probability of achieving superhuman AI by 2045 is 50 percent, and assume that the probability of death given superhuman AI is at least 10 percent. Then the probability of death by AI in the next few years might be comparable to around 1 in 6000, he wrote, explaining that this probability is similar to the two largest causes of death for “college-aged people in the US,” suicide and vehicle accidents, although he did not write out the calculations leading to this conclusion.
Jurkovic guesses that there are more people in Harvard EA working on AI than other problems, but points out the existence of organizations with other EA-related focuses, including Harvard College Animal Advocates.
Harvard EA doesn’t have an AI safety program itself, but there are several related organizations that do. One of these is the Harvard AI Safety Team, which was founded in 2022 by Xander L. Davies ’23 and Fiona E. Pollack ’25. Though HAIST is not an EA organization, many members of Harvard EA work with HAIST, and HAIST also receives funding from national EA philanthropy organizations. HAIST and Harvard EA also share members with other local AI groups, including Cambridge Boston Alignment Initiative and MIT AI Alignment.
HAIST hosts reading groups and talks by professors, with a focus on machine learning research, Davies tells us on Zoom. He has curly hair and a black hoodie; the “L” in his name stands for Laser. Although he doesn’t believe that AI right now is poised to destroy humanity, he also doesn’t believe we have the tools to stop it. “I think how I look at it is, it’s currently impossible to get our AIs to not do things,” Davies says, referring to the ease with which users have bypassed ChatGPT-like models’ built-in filters against violent speech and misinformation.
“Rapid progress in AI is becoming more and more economically useful, becoming more and more trusted, while at the same time this stark lack of progress on actually understanding how these systems work, on getting confidence that we actually know how to make these systems do what we want, is very startling to me,” Davies says. “And I think it should be a core priority on the global stage.”
In some respects, EA seems fairly intuitive: Who doesn’t want to minimize suffering as much as possible? In other respects, it pushes you to rethink your intuitions.
Take, for instance, a thought experiment effective altruists often use to illustrate the unique way this philosophy navigates moral quandaries. It’s called “the drowning child scenario,” originally formulated by Peter Singer. Imagine you’re on your way to an important event, and you notice a child is drowning in a nearby pond. Do you jump in to save the child?
Barring circumstances like an inability to swim, most people answer yes. But then, you’re asked the question again and again. Each time, the stakes are higher: What if you will ruin your clothes and waterlog your phone by jumping in? What if you already saved a drowning child last week? What if this child was an undocumented immigrant? What if the pond was far enough away that you would have to spend gas money to get there?
As the hypotheticals escalate, generally, participants continue to decide to save the drowning child each time. But in the real world, when facing situations like determining healthcare access for immigrants or people in other countries, the increased distance leads some people to make what is in effect the opposite choice. EA wants to know: Why should you value those peoples’ lives less than those of people closer to you?
When we spoke to Marka F. X. Ellertson ’23, then the president of Harvard EA, last September, she told us that with EA efforts, “the warm fuzzy feeling just doesn’t matter as much to me as the rational thought that I know that I’ve had a bigger impact.”
“And I actually still do want that warm fuzzy feeling,” Ellertson added, explaining that she donates to local causes that are particularly meaningful to her.
Joshua D. Greene ’97, Harvard EA’s faculty advisor, disputes the idea that EA strips away the warmth of charity work.
Utilitarianism might make you think of “the things that kind of serve a function but don’t nurture our souls or to speak to our heart’s greatest desires, right? And utilitarianism is not just about cold functionality,” he says. “It’s about everything that makes life good or bad, everything that makes life worth living, everything that makes life meaningful.”
Harold H. Klapper ’25, who participated in a Harvard EA fellowship last year, tells us that in some EA dialogues about utilitarianism “get really wild.”
At a Boston-area EA event, for instance, “I’ve had conversations arguing about whether we should kill all wild animals, because they have negative lives,” Klapper says. “An ant colony must just have negative utility in the sense that they’re just not enjoying life, and so it’d be better if we just eliminated them.”
“When things are a movement, you kind of have to buy into the whole thing, and when you buy into the whole thing, you get really wacky and fucked up answers to problems,” Klapper adds.
Effective altruists seek to apply EA principles to personal decisions: what to study, where to work. If you are a college student interested in building EA communities, you might “consider not going to Harvard, as there are a bunch of people there doing great things,” Jurkovic wrote on the EA forum in December, suggesting that going to other colleges without strong EA movements could be better. (Was this something Jurkovic himself considered when applying to Harvard? “No,” he says, laughing.)
A lot of EA discourse revolves around career choice: You will probably work for around 80,000 hours in your lifetime — several of the people we talk to cite this estimate — and you should spend them doing things that count, even if they may not be things you enjoy.
Harvard EA, Shuman says, focuses mainly on “getting high-potential individuals into careers where they can spend their 80,000 hours of their career on solving these issues.”
To get them to that point, EA might also influence Harvard students’ concentration decisions. One such student is Jōsh P. Mysoré ’26; when we meet him outside of Blackbird, he’s reading Giovanni Boccaccio’s “The Decameron” for class. Mysoré completed the Arete fellowship last fall and is considering becoming a discussion leader at some point in the future.
“I love poetry. I loooove poetry,” he tells us. “Will I be going into poetry? No. Because I don’t think it will actually do good for people.” At the moment, Mysoré plans to concentrate in Computer Science and Linguistics.
Computer Science, as well as Statistics and Applied Mathematics, are fairly common concentration choices among the people we meet. Klapper tells us he knows someone in Harvard EA who studies Computer Science and dislikes it, but continues in the field because they believe it’s the most effective use of their time.
Mysoré “was given a certain amount of privilege in my life to even get to this point,” he tells us. “I do think I owe something to the greater good of humanity to do something that impacts more people in a tangible way.”
Does he think anyone should go into poetry, we ask.
“I don't think it’s a contradiction to say that I can hold two opposing viewpoints at the same time,” Mysoré says. “Like in my heart, I’m a humanist, and I’m very romantic.” He tells us that he joined EA specifically to challenge these humanist viewpoints, but his perspective might flip again. “Honestly, I do think there should be poets,” he says.
Mysoré tells us he still believes that EA has a noble mission, even if he disagrees with some of its particular approaches. “I think at the baseline, EA is creating dialogue,” he says. “That is really what counts.”
On Saturdays, Harvard EA throws socials in a house near campus where Jurkovic lives with four of his friends. Half the time, the socials are just for Harvard affiliates; every other week, they are open to students from other Boston-area schools.
Of course, the socials are designed to be fun, but they have a functional purpose as well. “One important part of having a community is that the people talk to each other and have time spent together, so that they can collaborate and talk about their projects,” Jurkovic says.
Though Jurkovic declined our request to attend a social on the record, we can try to reconstruct the vibe from a guide that he posted on the EA forum called “How to Organize a Social.” Indeed, in the post, he records every step of preparing for a social in granular detail, providing recommendations for everything from grocery lists — CLIF Bars, Diet Coke, several varieties of Vitaminwater — to music, such as the Spotify-curated playlist “my life is a movie.” Jurkovic suggests you make it easy for guests to find answers to anticipated questions: “The shoes on/off policy? Where the bathroom is? Where one can get water? What the wi-fi password is?”
Last year, Trevor J. Levin ’19, who is currently on leave as the co-president of the university-wide EA group, also created a list of recommendations for effective retreats: They should happen in the beginning of the semester, when people are less busy; include lots of time for one-on-one interactions and a “structured vulnerable/emotional thing”; and include a healthy mix of new recruits and “moderately charismatic people for whom EA is a major consideration in how they make decisions.” These suggestions were embedded in a long post, which, citing feedback from Ellertson, Davies, Jurkovic, and others, argues that college EA groups should focus more on retreats as a method of bonding.
For Levin, a former Crimson editor, this kind of immersive social situation is vital to capturing those who might be interested in EA but don’t prioritize it.
“While most of the important cognition that happens is social/emotional, this is not the same thing as tricking or manipulating people into being EAs,” he wrote on the forum. Instead, retreats are meant to appeal to those who may agree with EA on some level but have not yet acted on it, and giving them time to “move closer to the values they previously already wanted to live by.”
Since EA was born, it has been very deliberate about the image it projects. The name “effective altruism” was itself the product of a long debate: “This has been such an obstacle in the utilitarianesque community — ‘do-gooder’ is the current term, and it sucks,” MacAskill, the philosopher, wrote in a 2011 email chain. What followed was a period of brainstorming — fusing terms like “utilitarian” and philanthropist” with “alliance” and “institute” — and a series of votes to establish a name for both “the type of person we wanted to refer to, and for the name of the organization we were setting up.”
Now, countless blogs and forum posts are dedicated to determining how best to recruit new members to the EA community. In December 2021, for instance, Jurkovic wrote a post on the EA forum describing an “organic” way to pitch EA to students.
“Person: What do you want to study? Me: Not sure, I’m trying to find what to study so I can have as good of an impact as possible,” he wrote in an example dialogue. “If their level of enthusiasm stays high or grows, pitch an intro fellowship or a reading group to them.”
Even if some people choose not to become effective altruists, Shuman tells us, they could still take away valuable ideas from the movement.
“The point is not to create a club, but rather to create a world of people that want to do the most good, and EA just has a set of tools that it thinks are probably the most good,” Shuman says. “We want everybody to think in these terms.”
“I’m gonna talk from a removed, omniscient perspective,” Mysoré says, kicking his chair back and folding his arms behind his head. EA spends a lot of money on space, food, and socials, he tells us. “At a certain point you have to ask yourself: What is effective about that?”
Most of Harvard EA’s money comes from larger EA organizations like Open Philanthropy, a grantmaking foundation largely financed by Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz, the latter of whom co-founded Facebook. Open Philanthropy distributes money to a range of EA-related causes. Put simply, it is an organization that “cares about making the world better,” Jurkovic says.
We ask him how Harvard EA uses its grant money.
“It’s not my area of expertise,” Jurkovic says. “But ...” He pauses for 15 seconds. “Yeah, just sometimes we get funding for club activities.”
In 2022, we later find out, part of an Open Philanthropy grant was used to send Arete fellows and the University-wide EA group on a weekend trip to Essex Woods, a serene, Thoreauesque venue an hour north of campus that charges about $5,000 per night. According to GiveWell, donating $10,000 to the nonprofit Malaria Consortium could save the lives of five people.
The schedule was similar to that of a corporate retreat: workshops, games, dinner, hot tub, Hamming circles. Well, maybe not the last one. Hamming circles are an activity where three to five participants sit down together and talk through one problem facing each member in 20-minute chunks. It’s “similar to what happens in a pair debug,” a post on an EA-related forum explains. These problems might vary, the post says, from “Is it possible for me, specifically, to have a meaningful impact on existential risk” to “I need to secure $250,000 in seed funding for my startup” to “I’m expected to speak at my father’s funeral and I have nothing but scathing, bitter, angry things to say.”
Open Philanthropy also issued a $250,000 grant for the Centre for Effective Altruism to “rent and refurbish” an office for the Harvard AI Safety Team in Harvard Square for one year.
Davies, the HAIST co-founder, tells us that the HAIST office is “pretty research-y.”
“People are often at whiteboards, talking about problems with each other,” he says. “I think it feels like people are really trying to make progress on this technical problem, which I find exciting. It’s maybe a little startup-y in vibe.” In a post on the EA forum in December, Davies wrote that “investing effort into making the space fun and convenient to use helped improve programming, social events, and sense of community.”
In August, Open Philanthropy recommended an $8.9 million grant for the Center for Effective Altruism to lease an EA office space for five years in Harvard Square. While the space would have been unaffiliated with Harvard EA, a forum post announcing the office promised that part of it would contain “meeting spaces for students at Harvard and other Boston-area schools,” and thanked Levin and Jurkovic for their help in developing the project.
Forum members, including Levin and Jurkovic, threw out potential names for the space. Some of the suggestions were mythological — “Daedalus,” who advised Icarus not to fly too close to the sun — some cosmological — “Supercluster,” “Earthrise” — and some silly, like “Aardvark,” from a user who argued the name sounded similar to “Harvard” and would show up first in alphabetical lists.
“Don’t like including the actual words EA in the name of the space,” Levin (who, for his part, liked “Apollo”) wrote in the comments. “It increases the chances of hypocrisy charges (from people who haven’t thought much about the effects of nice offices on productivity) for getting a nice central office space while ostensibly being altruistic.”
But the Apollo House — or Aardvark House, or Supercluster — never materialized. According to Levin, after CEA signed the lease and began preparing the space, Open Philanthropy notified them that the grant was under review. As a result, Levin tells us, CEA is now trying to sublease the space to get the money back.
CEA and Open Philanthropy did not respond to questions about the current status of the Harvard Square office grant.
In addition to money for spaces and retreats, Open Philanthropy has an open request form for university group funding, and regularly recommends grants to undergraduate organizers. Other EA-affiliated organizations also fund events and projects. Huml, the Global Health Programming Lead, tells us that this is part of what makes EA a valuable community in which to pursue global health work.
“To be totally transparent, I don’t 100 percent align with the values,” Huml tells us. “I think that they are an incredible platform and have a lot of resources — and those resources are financial, they are access to experts in very specific fields.”
Three Harvard students, including Davies and Gabrieli, were recipients of Open Philanthropy’s fall 2022 University Organizer Fellowship, for which the organization recommended a total of $3.1 million across 116 recipients. Gabrieli declined to be interviewed for this article. Davies says he doesn’t know if he’s allowed to disclose how much money he actually got, but that he considers the grant to be “an hourly wage,” since he quit previous jobs to focus on developing HAIST.
In February 2022, Open Philanthropy recommended a $75,000 grant to Pollack, the other HAIST co-founder, “to support her work organizing the effective altruism community at Harvard University.”
When we reach out to Pollack, she tells us over email that she is “no longer organizing for the Harvard Effective Altruism group,” but has spent about $14,000 of the grant on HAIST expenses with Open Philanthropy’s approval: $7,200 to monthly software costs like Airtable and Squarespace, and most of the rest to accommodations for a workshop that HAIST hosted with the MIT AI safety group in Arlington, Virginia.
Harvard EA is aware that this allocation of money can appear at odds with its stated mission. After the Essex Woods retreat, organizers sent out a feedback form. “How much did the spending of money at this retreat make you feel uncomfortable?” one question asked.
We talk to Levin, the University EA co-president, and he likens it to the way that companies spend money on recruitment. “The idea is that there are problems that are much more talent-constrained than money-constrained,” he tells us. AI safety, a problem that relatively few people are working on, is an extreme example of this, he says. “The question then becomes, ‘Okay, well, if we have money and not people, how do we convert between the two?’”
Levin pauses and corrects himself: “My train of thought there sounded kind of like I was saying, well, if you have a bunch of money, what do you do with it, right? That is not what I think.” What he does believe is that physical environments like retreats can rapidly accelerate the rate — by up to 100 times, he writes on the forums — at which people get on board with EA principles.
Several people in EA, Levin guesses, joined because of their experiences on a retreat. “That is absolutely something that we would have paid this money for,” he says.
Shuman believes that this outreach is particularly effective in Cambridge because of its highly motivated, change-driven student body. “Harvard and MIT have done the vast majority of vetting for people who are highly ambitious,” she says.
Shuman tells us that the international EA community places a lot of importance on this kind of community building. “If they can invest $1,000 in getting five high-potential individuals to, instead of doing AI research, do AI safety research, that’s a pretty good use of money,” she says. “It could save a lot of lives, potentially.”
In a 2020 survey of EA Forum members, 76 percent of respondents were white and 71 percent were male. Though there is an imbalance, the Centre for Effective Altruism argues that diversity is important for several reasons.
“If an EA-aligned newcomer concludes that effective altruism is not for ‘people like me,’ they may not get involved, and the EA community may be less effective,” its website reads. “We don’t want to miss important perspectives.”
We ask Jurkovic if he’s aware of demographic imbalances within EA groups at Harvard. He pauses. “I think it is quite important to have a community which is welcoming to everyone,” he says. “EA sometimes shares a problem with the cause areas that it tackles” — meaning STEM fields — “which is that many of them have more males in them than average.”
Shuman — “the only she/her” leading an Arete section, she tells us — echoes this sentiment, saying that these numbers reflect existing disparities in STEM and philanthropic fields.
“It’s just a skewed pipeline,” she says, “which is a problem.”
“I can say from personal experience that we’ve had quite diverse groups,” Nickols says. “In terms of gender, it does tend to be more male-skewed, and that’s something that we’re continually working on.” He acknowledges that Harvard EA “is probably predominantly white and Asian, but not more so to Harvard’s general population.” (The organization does not keep demographic records of its members, so we can’t verify this.)
Nickols says that the applicants for Harvard EA’s fellowships also tend to skew male. “Given that word of mouth is our biggest kind of spreader, it might just be possible that guys who have done it in the past are friends with more guys and tell them about it,” he adds.
In recent months, the EA movement has been embroiled in controversies related to race and gender in its communities.
One of these controversies revolved around Nick Bostrom, a philosopher whose ideas led to the development of longtermism; four of his works are cited in the syllabus for Harvard EA’s Precipice Fellowship.
In January, Bostrom posted a letter to his website apologizing for a comment he wrote on a forum in the mid-90s, which claims that Black people “are more stupid than whites” and contains the n-word. In the letter, Bostrom castigates his past self for using the slur and writes that the comment “does not accurately represent my views, then or now,” but does not reject the possibility of genetic cognitive differences between races. He leaves this question to “others, who have more relevant knowledge.” The letter continues with a section about bioethics that opens: “What about eugenics? Do I support eugenics? No, not as the term is commonly understood.”
In March, Time magazine interviewed seven women who said they had been sexually harassed, coerced, or assaulted within EA spaces, particularly in the Bay Area. The scene’s overwhelming maleness, tech-bro culture, and impulse to quantify and rationalize messy real-world dynamics created a deeply unsafe environment, the women said. One described having dinner with a prominent researcher nearly twice her age who told her that “pedophilic relationships between very young women and older men was a good way to transfer knowledge.”
“We were of course upset by both of these issues,” Jurkovic wrote in an email to us about the Bostrom letter and Time investigation, “and have spent time figuring out how we can improve our diversity and make sure we're a welcoming community to women and people of color.”
Although some of EA’s focus areas deal with global health and economic growth in underdeveloped countries, its frameworks generally do not foreground race or gender. A version of the spring 2023 Arete syllabus posted on the Harvard EA website only mentions race in the overview of Week Four: Animal Welfare.
“One of the most important ways we can fail to identify the most important moral issues of our time is by unfairly shrinking our moral circle: the set of beings we deem worthy of our moral concern,” the syllabus reads. “For example, many whites in the US failed to identify that slavery was the moral issue of their age by excluding Blacks from their moral circle. To truly make the world better, we must look beyond the traditional moral horizon for those who are unfairly neglected by mainstream society. This week, we discuss one such group of beings: nonhuman animals.”
We ask Nickols, the Arete co-chair, about this framing. He tells us that it is important to keep the quote “in the context of where it was originally formulated.”
“Obviously the idea here is not to equate certain racial groups with animals or anything like that,” Nickols says. “Over time, though, the expanding moral circle idea is that white people who, before, held these extremely racist and terrible views — as the generations went on, and as culture shifted — began to see people, regardless of their race, as all morally equal.”
“We have not reached a point where racism is totally gone,” Nickols says, “but there is definitely a shift in the right direction here. And more generally, the idea is that as time goes on, it is quite possible that the circle will continue to increase.”
One thought experiment designed to demonstrate the danger of misaligned AI goes like this: Say the owner of a paper clip factory obtains an ultrapowerful AI and instructs it to maximize paper clip output. Although the AI is programmed to pursue a seemingly harmless goal, it might — if its understanding of values is not quite the same as ours — turn everything in the world into paper clips. That this scenario seems kind of silly is part of the point. Researchers are not concerned that AI will be “evil” per se, but that its pursuit of any objective, including “good” ones, might have unintended consequences.
“AI systems donʼt always do what their developers intend,” the Arete syllabus reads. “They replicate human biases, achieve their goals in surprising and destructive ways, and are vulnerable to external manipulation.” As a call to action, this is a compelling place to start. As a taxonomy, though, it is less an observation about AI than it is about systems. Existential risks like climate change might first destroy the people who did the least to create them; any movement created by people is, in a sense, only human.
This point came up in the wake of the FTX collapse — what did it mean that a group seeking to fundamentally change the world relied so heavily on existing distributions of power? — and it has come up again in the months since, in the course of writing this article. Can you optimize your life? What if the thing we construct in our idealized image turns out not to look so different from us after all?
For Andrew N. Garber ’23, a former Arete leader, considering questions is the point of EA. There is a common misconception that effective altruism is a destination, when really it’s more of a framework, he tells us: “It is more concerned about the question than any one specific answer.”
In any event, when we ask Jurkovic what he hopes EA will look like in the future, his response is straightforward. “The goal is to help people make the world better,” he says, half smiling. “As much as possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Santa Barbara County Planning Commission voted Wednesday against a proposed project that would construct three water storage reservoirs on former University land holdings in central California.
The commission voted 3-1 against the project after local California farmers and Harvard affiliates denounced the project and voiced concerns during the meeting about environmental impacts that could arise from building the reservoirs. The project would be distributed across a 6,500-acre project site, and each reservoir would cover an area of five acres and store 45 acre-feet of water.
California farmers said during the meeting that the project would pose a serious risk to the water supply in the region. The area is located in a critically overdrafted groundwater basin, according to Roberta “Robbie” Jaffe, a local farmer who is the co-owner of Condor’s Hope Vineyard.
“The reservoirs would have pulled out potentially millions of gallons of water in one year,” Jaffe said. “There are lots of shallow wells around there for residences and cattle, and it would have eventually, over time, just really decimated all of that.”
The project site is part of more than 7,500 acres of vineyard land previously controlled by the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s $50.9 billion endowment. In 2014, Brodiaea Inc. — a Delaware-based company fully owned by HMC at the time — purchased the vineyard land for $10.1 million dollars.
In 2020, HMC spun out its natural resources team — including its ownership of Brodiaea — to a new investment management firm, Solum Partners. HMC remains a limited partner in Solum Partners, meaning the vineyard land is still indirectly part of Harvard’s endowment, though the University’s investment arm retains little involvement in the day-to-day operations of Solum or Brodiaea.
Hannah Weinronk, a staff member at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, said during the meeting that Harvard “has a track record of selling their land investments when it’s advantageous to them, no matter the effects on the community it has invested in.”
“I ask that the commission please vote in opposition of the permit application, which will only give control of water to a corporate entity at the expense of water rights and farmers’ livelihoods in the Cuyama Valley,” Weinronk said.
Kelsey Ichikawa ’20, who also attended the meeting, said there were “deep contradictions” between Harvard’s academic emphasis on climate and sustainability research while also maintaining investments in natural resources.
“It saddens me that’s also happening in California where I grew up and where my family still lives,” she said. “I’m asking you to push back against this external investor who, let’s be honest, is not accountable to your constituents and is not accountable to the public good.”
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment, citing a company policy against commenting on individual investments.
The planning commission’s vote on Wednesday to deny the project was only tentative, as the Santa Barbara County Development Review Division must now produce a report with findings for denial of the project. Brodiaea, however, will still be able to appeal the final vote to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Anne E. Applebaum discussed her experiences reporting on regions of Ukraine occupied by Russia at the annual Petryshyn Memorial Lecture held by the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute Wednesday.
During the lecture, Applebaum — who has reported on the Russia-Ukraine war since it began in February 2022 — discussed the impact of Russia’s occupation of Ukraine and its historical context. HURI Director and History professor Serhii Plokhii moderated the event, attended by more than 50 people.
The Petryshyn Memorial Lecture is delivered every year by a nationally or internationally recognized Ukrainian studies scholar.
Applebaum opened by reflecting on the word “occupied,” stating, “occupied is a word that conjures up a specific set of emotions.” Applebaum said prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Eastern Europeans remembered occupations by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union but thought of such memories “as if they belong to the past.”
“It’s become pretty clear that the past, in the famous saying, the past isn’t even past, and in the territories of the old Soviet empire, that’s true in a stunning and shocking way,” Applebaum said.
Applebaum said Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, is a key source of Russia’s military strength as it is a center for Russian military bases and political prisons.
“Crimea has become the place where the [Russian] occupation emanates,” Applebaum said.
Asked whether she expected Russian soldiers to defect ahead of a predicted upcoming Russian offensive attack this summer, Applebaum said she had not seen any evidence of this yet. Applebaum said the strength of Ukrainian resistance will likely be the decisive factor in the war’s outcome, rather than Russian morale.
“In terms of the offensive, which is coming and which people are talking about, the more interesting question is how organized is Ukrainian resistance in those territories and can that make a difference?” she said.
Applebaum said propaganda from the Russian government induces “trained apathy” in its citizens, which she said encourages Russian citizens to stay out of politics.
“There isn’t really a public sphere there. There isn’t a place where people are having debates or discussions,” she said. “The idea of thinking about politics is itself dangerous.”
In an interview after the event, Applebaum said the war in Ukraine has prompted American media outlets to invest in learning about the history of the region and to use that knowledge to frame their reporting.
“It has also been a war in which false use of history has been part of the propaganda of the other side, Russian propaganda, and so being able to understand and recognize that has been an important skill,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications specialist Jo Ellen Stryker discussed the future of HIV prevention in a student workshop at the Harvard School of Public Health last Thursday.
Chief of the Prevention Communications Branch in the Division of HIV Prevention at the CDC, Stryker explored the evolution of the HIV prevention campaign over recent years, including efforts to combat the stigma around the disease and promote testing, treatment, and care. The school’s Center for Health Communication and the Health Communication Concentration co-sponsored Thursday’s event.
One of the major ways the HIV campaign has evolved is in its shift in framing and messaging to be more inclusive, according to Stryker.
“It includes gay, bisexual, other men who have sex with men, transgender people, particularly transgender women, cisgender black women, and people who inject drugs,” she said.
In recent years, the campaign has taken on a more positive tone from discussing the problem in combative terms to promoting collective resiliency. In line with these developments, the campaign changed its name from “Act Against Aids” to “Let’s Stop HIV Together.”
Stryker also said the campaign is taking an increasingly holistic approach. The campaign previously targeted specific audiences with distinct goals, like improving treatment and increasing the prevalence of testing.
“In the past, we had very discrete campaigns for discrete audiences,” Stryker said.
Rather than having the desired effect, the campaign found this approach “can be very stigmatizing to people, feeling like you are singling out a particular group.”
A communication scientist by training, Stryker focuses on taking public health data and applying it to communications campaigns.
“I was always a little bit on the fence as to whether I wanted to be in academia or not,” Stryker said.
Stryker’s passion has always fallen “where the science meets the practice,” a quality which drew her to the CDC.
“Not every place at CDC is fortunate enough to have the resources to have a very robust communication program, but HIV does,” Stryker said. “Having the opportunity to really adjust our communication practices and to be able to see the difference that it’s making in our campaign, in our communities, with individuals — it’s very rewarding.”
Throughout her time leading the Let’s Stop HIV Together campaign, Stryker worked to expand the program’s outreach and communication initiatives. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Stryker spearheaded a self-testing pilot program for the CDC, offering HIV testing even during pandemic lockdowns.
Now, Stryker is working to launch a new testing initiative in partnership with Emory University. The program, called “Together Take Me Home,” uses the Let’s Stop HIV Together campaign to market free HIV tests to areas that are disproportionately affected by HIV. Over the next five years, Stryker hopes the program will distribute more than a million free tests.
After outlining the campaign’s new initiative, Stryker told students at the School of Public Health that it is “impossible” to pursue a career in the field without honing communication skills.
“Be thoughtful and intentional about your messaging, your framing, and to be thinking always not just about the audience that you’re trying to reach, but the potential effects of your messaging on others who might see it,” Stryker said.
Beyond the field of public health, Stryker believes everyone can play a role in preventing HIV.
“Understanding the facts, talking openly about your sexual health with your sexual partners, and ensuring that you are supportive and caring for people living with HIV, those are things that we can all do,” she said.

Harvard Law School is partnering with law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP to launch a new pre-law fellowship program targeting first-generation and low-income participants, the school announced in a press release Wednesday.
The yearlong fellowship, called “Future Leaders in Law,” will kick off with its first cohort in July. Participants will begin the program with a weeklong stay at the Law School, where they will also visit Paul, Weiss’ New York City headquarters.
The program will also provide fellows with access to LSAT prep resources and mentors affiliated with the Law School.
“The Future Leaders in Law program is the latest example of Harvard Law School’s longstanding commitment to developing more ways to make legal education attainable for students from every background and, in doing so, enabling them to pursue their highest aspirations while further expanding excellence in law schools and throughout the legal profession,” Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 said in the release.
The program, which will cover all participation-related costs for fellows and provide them with a $3,000 stipend, is open for application to current college juniors and seniors, as well as recent college graduates.
Fellows will also participate in a monthly “Empowerment Seminars” from January to May, which will offer workshops and other opportunities that aim to better prepare participants for applying to law programs.
In the release, Monica E. Monroe — the Law School’s assistant dean for community engagement, equity, and belonging — said the purpose of the program is “to ignite excitement about law as a career path.”
“Harvard Law School is committed to the idea that broadening the legal profession is integral to its future success, and I am delighted to be part of this newest effort to support a diverse array of applicants to U.S. law schools,” she added.
In the release, Paul, Weiss Chairman Brad S. Karp spoke about the importance of the “unique life experiences, talents, and viewpoints” of lawyers at his firm.
“We are proud to partner with Harvard Law School on this critically important initiative that will provide the next generation of diverse lawyers with access to world-class education,” Karp said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disability rights advocates and policy experts discussed the importance of expanding accessibility and changing perceptions of disabilities in the United States during a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Wednesday evening.
The talk, titled “Disability: The Critical but Absent Part of Public Policy,” featured three Harvard Kennedy School graduates working across government and academia to promote disability rights. The panel was co-sponsored by the HKS Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging and the HKS Alumni Board.
Michael A. Stein, co-founder and executive director of the Harvard Law School Project on Disability, moderated the panel. Stein began by remembering internationally renowned disability rights advocate Judy Heumann.
“We are still mourning and thinking of our dear friend Judy Heumann, the most iconic — both domestic and international — disability rights advocate, who left us a little bit over three weeks ago,” Stein said. “It is in her memory and in her spirit that we consider today’s forum.”
Brooke Ellison ’00, a disability rights activist and associate professor at Stony Brook University, opened the discussion by reflecting on her experience with disability and how it was shaped by her time as a student at HKS.
Ellison, the first quadriplegic student to graduate from Harvard, said two harmful views of people with disability have long prevailed in society — a moral view that understands disability as a “price you had to pay for wrongdoing,” and a medical view that attributes disability solely to “medical failure.”
“I was very much indoctrinated into the socialized thinking that a disability was an aspect of my identity that I needed to be ashamed of,” Ellison said, adding that she was able to “deconstruct and then reconstruct” her identity while studying at the Kennedy School.
James R. Langevin, a former U.S. Representative for Rhode Island and the first quadriplegic member of Congress, said the Americans with Disabilities Act changed the perception of accessibility measures from a “common courtesy” to a civil right.
“After the passage of ADA, that paradigm shift showed that accessibility must be a civil right, that people with disabilities have the right to live active and independent lives,” Langevin said. “It wasn’t a perfect solution. It was a chance to start, and it’s an ongoing effort.”
Sara Minkara, special advisor on international disability rights for the U.S. Department of State, asked members of the audience to reflect on what they think when they see a person with a visible disability.
“Society does not yet expect us to be out and about living our lives fully,” Minkara said.
Minkara asked attendees studying public policy how often disability appeared in their studies. “Probably not as much as it should,” she said. “Why is that the case?”
“We are not seen, and if we are seen, we are not seen from a point of value,” Minkara added.
Stein closed the event by thanking the panelists and encouraging attendees to use the event as an opportunity for reflection.
“Let us try to reflect on this being an opportunity to move forward and increase disability inclusion, awareness, and equality across the University,” Stein said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Harvard students occupied University Hall from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday in protest of the school’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
Organized by Our Harvard Can Do Better — a campus group that advocates against campus rape culture — the demonstration follows a wave of protests this semester, including a walkout, an email campaign, and a march, against Harvard’s sexual misconduct policies and its continued employment of professor John L. Comaroff, who is under fire for sexual harassment allegations levied by graduate students.
Comaroff has denied all allegations of harassment and misconduct.
University Hall — located in Harvard Yard — houses the offices of several of Harvard’s top administrators, including the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and dean of the College.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana spoke with and listened to the demonstrators for roughly 50 minutes in the middle of Wednesday’s demonstration. Protesters voiced concerns about Comaroff’s continued employment as a professor, as well as what they see as the University’s lack of action on sexual assault and harassment.
Khurana agreed to reach out to organizers to set up meetings, but he did not share any concrete plans in response to their demands.
On Twitter, Our Harvard Can Do Better is also circulating an email template for supporters to prompt Khurana to make a public statement.
“I am writing in solidarity with the student protestors currently occupying University Hall, and asking you to send a college-wide email stating sexual violence is a crisis on campus,” the email template reads.
Wednesday’s demonstration comes after Harvard released its first University-wide anti-bullying and non-discrimination policies last week. The University is waiting until after the release of new regulations from the Department of Education to publish its updated Title IX policies, Garber announced in an email to University affiliates last week.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton pointed to new hires by Harvard’s Office for Gender Equity: three new Sexual Harassment/Assault Resources and Education employees in spring 2022 and Restorative Practitioner Jonathan Berry in January 2023.
Newton declined on specific criticisms made during the demonstration.
The protesters sat in University Hall’s bottom floor, sharing speeches, chanting, and playing music. They held signs with phrases reading, “Time’s Up,” “No More Complicity,” and “Justice for Survivors.”
In various speeches and chants, students pointed to recent developments in a federal lawsuit filed by three Anthropology graduate students against the University for allegedly ignoring reports of sexual harassment and retaliation by Comaroff, a professor in the African and African American Studies and Anthropology Departments.
In particular, they condemned Harvard’s recent request for summary judgment on the last count of the suit, which alleges that the University illegally obtained one of the graduate student’s therapy records and shared them with Comaroff.
“Stealing health notes can’t be done, legal ethics 101,” they chanted.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean and Harvard President-elect Claudine Gay placed Comaroff on a semester of unpaid leave in spring 2022 after two University investigations found that Comaroff’s verbal conduct had violated Harvard’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies. Comaroff returned to teaching non-required courses in fall 2022.
Comaroff’s lawyers — Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, Janet Halley, and Norman S. Zalkind — wrote in an emailed statement that Comaroff “is not a ‘sexual abuser,’” saying that the University only found him responsible for an instance of verbal harassment.
“The protesters would have Harvard make decisions based upon rumor and manufactured outrage instead of the facts its own investigation found. All members of the Harvard community should find that demand disturbing,” they wrote in the email.
They added that Comaroff “should not be fired.”
“The idea that Harvard should fire him based on unsupported allegations, ignoring the final results of its own very thorough investigation, is disturbingly incompatible with basic values of fairness and due process,” they wrote.
In its press release Wednesday, Our Harvard Can Do Better reiterated calls for Comaroff to resign from his position. The campus group’s demands do not include Comaroff’s termination.
Rosalie P. Couture ’26, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she was frustrated with the suggestion of more conversations and the lack of administrative action.
“We’ve talked to everybody in the Title IX office. We can talk to talk all day, but at the end of the day, we need to be speaking with decision makers who have the power to actually act on any proposals that we put forth,” Couture said.
“Harvard themselves have experts that have laid out very clear ways for them to address sexual violence on campus and Harvard just is not doing anything,” she added.
Clarification: March 30, 2023
This article has been updated to clarify that Our Harvard Can Do Better is calling for John L. Comaroff’s resignation, not his termination by Harvard.
Correction: March 30, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the University president’s office is located in University Hall. In fact, the president’s office is located in Massachusetts Hall.

BOSTON, MASS. — The Harvard men's lacrosse team suffered two losses this past week: the first to Charles River rival Boston University and the second to Ivy League compatriot Dartmouth. Both games were monumental for the record book as the win on Tuesday marked BU’s first upset over the Crimson since 2017 and the win on Saturday marked Dartmouth’s first victory in the Ivy League since 2015; the game broke a 35-game drought for the Big Green within the competitive league.
There were similarities between the two games, mainly with the Crimson offense having trouble finding the back of the cage. Sophomore middies Owen Gaffney and Andrew Perry were markedly absent from the scoresheet, Perry tallying one goal on the week, and Gaffney finding himself as a facilitator on the feeds with 2 assists and a goal against BU. Gaffney has stepped up in this role and has looked confident in moving the ball quickly and effectively in the sets. Ball movement looked strong and decisive on the attacking end, with good looks and feeds inside that just didn’t connect for a goal. Unable to build momentum with these possessions, the offense had a hard time breaking ground and creating secure leads. First-year attacker Teddy Malone was a bright spot in this plight during the Dartmouth game, scoring the first four goals for Harvard.
Another area in which the team looked a lot more successful was in the ride and the middle of the field. This improvement is due to better ball movement, awareness of the changing shifts coming in from the box getting open, and junior goalie Christian Barnard getting the ball out of the crease quickly and cleanly. Barnard tallied his second goal of the season in the BU game, showcasing his lacrosse IQ in taking advantage of the ten-man ride which took the BU goalie out of his cage, leaving it open for a full-field Hail Mary attempt.
This idea of lacrosse IQ was apparent in the ride, with the Crimson appearing more aggressive and physical than it had all season. The slides were crashing to make contact and the attackers berated the defense until the thirty, securing the ball and extending possession times for the attacking unit.
“We have been working on improving the pressure of our ride to force rushed decisions out of our opponents, which is something we had a lot of success with against Dartmouth last year and something we hope to bring back,” senior defensive-middie Chase Yager said.
The offense was able to successfully cause these turnovers because the defense was heads-up at locking off opposing attackers and middies down low. Yager, as well as first-year defenseman Charlie Muller and sophomore defenseman Martin Nelson, were particularly cognizant during these periods and were able to make heads-up plays that won the ball back for the Crimson.
“I think the team has continued to perform well clearing the ball and giving the offense opportunities to work,” Yager noted. “Our faceoff unit fought hard and won us some key faceoffs at important moments in the game, but I think we need to continue to execute when we start to get momentum.”
First-year attacker Sam King worked well with Malone and senior attacker Hayden Cheek on the offensive sets. There was a lot of rotation of players during the Dartmouth game, with first-year middie Logan Ip and junior middie Mark Stephens cracking the lines. There was also a personnel change between the two contests with sophomore FOGO Andrew DeGennaro taking a majority of the reps during the BU game and first-year Matt Barraco stepping in against Dartmouth. The faceoff continues to be an area in which the team needs to improve in order to successfully capitalize on momentum from defensive stops and goals on attack. Without the ball, the team could not find a rhythm, and was consistently forced to fight hard for the ball off the draw.
In the sense of lacrosse being a game of possession, the team had moments of greatness and moments of weakness. The squad has shown throughout the season that it struggles with stringing together four consistent quarters of lacrosse. The Dartmouth game proved this, with Harvard pulling away a four-goal lead into the fourth quarter, only to ease up on the momentum and give room for the Big Green to find lapses in attention that allowed their players to score and ultimately win in overtime. The Crimson offense didn't score for the last nineteen minutes of play, including the extra time allotted for overtime.
“It was a tough game for us,” King started. “We struggled in six-v-six offense all game and allowed Dartmouth to get back into the game — we’re super frustrated but understand what we’re capable of.”
Against the Terriers, the Crimson did not seem to have control of the ball. The team came out slow and sluggish and was playing catchup; it failed to take a lead on the scoreboard, and despite having a run at the end of the game, could not make up the ground it had ceded. To be effective in the competitive league, Harvard’s squad must discover a way to string possessions together to create dynamic opportunities for success.
“I think that we played well on both sides of the ball at different times. In the first half their goalie was making a lot of saves, but our defense was playing great. Then in the second half when we started to score, we started to let up on defense. So I think we really just need to focus on trying to put it together. We know we have the talent and everything we need, but it’s just a matter of showing it,” noted Barnard following the BU game.
On the defensive end, communication is an area the Crimson will harp on in practice before the game against Colgate this weekend. The one-on-one coverage seemed stronger in both of the games, but there were still gaps created by late recovery slides when sending the double to the dodging player, giving BU and Dartmouth the chance to attack the middle of the fan. Because the one-on-one looked much more solid in these games, the slide came late a few times — especially against BU — which caused the rotations to also delay and create opportunities for the opposing team. An example of this was in the first quarter when Yager successfully played one-on-one against his attacker for almost a full thirty seconds behind the cage before the slide was sent; the play ended in a Terrier goal because the slide was late to crash and the BU player was able to re-dodge and get a step on Yager topside. Against Dartmouth, the defense got caught ball-watching a few times which allowed the Big Green to feed the inside and put pressure on Barnard to make clutch saves in big moments.
“Looking to the next game we’re going to really focus on improving our defensive communication to help with slide decisions to avoid some of the one-on-one goals we let in,” noted Yager.
After this weekend, the team will have no out-of-conference play scheduled. Every game will be critical in clinching a place as one of the four best Ancient Eight teams in the hopes of making it to the Ivy Tournament. The Crimson squad takes the field against Colgate up in Hamilton, N.Y. on Saturday at 1:00 p.m. EST. The game will also be streamed live on ESPN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In only four years in her role as the head coach of Harvard fencing, Daria Schneider has made quick work of the Ivy League. In addition to winning two team Ivy League championships, in 2020 and 2023, Schneider has coached several players to individual Ivy League championships. Moreover, she is the first female coach of a men’s Ivy League fencing team, setting a new standard for equality amongst the Ancient Eight schools.
Harvard men's fencing (23-2, 4-0 Ivy League) has had a strong season that included an Ivy League Championship. This year’s championship was played in Ithaca, NY, where the Crimson topped the four other schools that qualified for the tournament. Their final match was against Coach Schneider’s alma mater, Columbia, where Harvard won 16-11. The Crimson proved itself on the individual side of the tournament as well, with senior Filip Dolegiewicz who won the individual sabre title, and sophomore James Chen who won the individual foil. The two fencers had busy days at the tournament but were extremely successful, each posting 10-2 records.
The two losses this season came in close matches with Ohio State and Notre Dame, who have won four out of the last five NCAA national championships. Due to her outstanding coaching and results, Schneider was named this season's Ivy League Men’s Fencing Coach of the Year.
While she is new to the Harvard program, Schneider is not new to the Boston area. She was born in Berkeley, Calif., but at a young age moved to Brookline, Mass., a Boston suburb on the Green Line. Around the age of ten, she started fencing. Of the three styles of fencing, foil, sabre, and epee, Schneider found most of her success in sabre. She won gold at the 2003 and 2004 Junior Olympics for Team USA. After her time with the junior team, she joined Team USA for five seasons and was issued the honor of team captain.
During her time with Team USA, the United States won the world championship in 2011 and 2012. While fencing professionally, Schneider studied Russian Literature and fenced at Columbia University, where her fencing career at Columbia was just as impressive as her one with Team USA — marking a 124-20 record and winning the NCAA sabre championship in 2007. She showed great leadership as she did with Team USA, earning the title of co-captain. Upon graduation, she became an assistant coach at Columbia and was also inducted into the Columbia Athletics Hall of Fame.
Even though Schneider is now a full-time coach at Harvard, the idea of fencing again for fun one day is not completely out of the question. She is still entertaining the idea of a competition or two in the future as a “vet” fencer.
“Maybe as a Vet fencer! I’m only five years away from Vet 40!” the head coach joked. “All kidding aside, I might do a competition at some point but it would be for fun.”
Schneider’s contributions to the sport of fencing go beyond her skills and coaching. When she became the interim head coach of Cornell Fencing in 2016, she was the first female head coach of a men’s Ivy League fencing team and one of very few female head coaches amongst all Division I programs.
“The importance of it to me is that I am not denied access to a job I love and I think I’m decent at because of my gender,” she said.
She has certainly proved through her many achievements the value she adds to the programs she is a part of. As head coach, Schneider sets an example for other Harvard teams and other Division I programs of how strong their teams can be with female coaches at the helm.
In addition to creating a strong program, her staff has shown that having women on the coaching staff is healthy for the student-athletes.
“As far as my team, I have had many athletes share anecdotes of times they’ve been relieved that there are women on our staff who they can go to for things or just see be in leadership roles and be inspired by but more importantly to see women leading be normalized,” Schneider commented.
Both the women's and men’s fencing teams at Harvard have had seven fencers qualify for the NCAA championship set to take place in Durham, N.C. on March 23-26. Throughout the season, the team has worked to create a strong team environment that makes Schneider proud.
“I’m most proud of my players for finding respectful ways to ask questions and make the learning process a dialogue instead of leaving us to exist in a monologue. Especially with our seniors and some of our juniors, I’m proud of their efforts to build meaningful relationships with their coaches and teammates and to see us as human beings as well as leaders and educators,” Schneider reflected

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in its history, the Women’s Beanpot will be contested in an NHL arena. On March 21, the TD Garden announced that the 45th Dunkin’ Women’s Beanpot Championship will be played at TD Garden, home of the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics, on Jan. 23, 2024. Additionally, the NESN will broadcast the two games throughout the New England region.
In her remarks from the announcement, the President of TD Garden, Amy Latimer, emphasized the effects of the decision on players and the growth of women’s hockey overall.
“We are thrilled to announce that TD Garden will be the proud home of The Dunkin’ Women’s Beanpot Championship in 2024,” Latimer said. “As a former collegiate athlete, a fan, and an executive in the sports industry, I am so excited for aspiring female hockey players, the current student-athletes, and the fans, to have this unforgettable experience. TD Garden and The Beanpot are amazing platforms to showcase the talent and amplify the growth of women’s hockey.”
In honor of the announcement, junior forward Shannon Hollands, sophomore goaltender Alex Pellicci, and players from the other Beanpot schools were invited to TD Garden as the Boston Bruins celebrated “Women in Sports Night” on the same night as the announcement.
The tournament will also mark the first time that the Women’s Beanpot has a title sponsor. After serving as the first-ever title sponsor of the Men’s Beanpot in 2023, Dunkin’ will extend its sponsorship deal to cover the Women’s Beanpot in 2024.
The Women’s Beanpot, an annual college hockey tournament consisting of Harvard, Boston College, Northeastern, and Boston University, has traditionally rotated between the on-campus rinks at each university. Following Boston College’s hosting of the 2023 iteration of the tournament, the 2024 tournament was scheduled to be hosted by the Crimson at Bright-Landry Hockey Center. While TD Garden will host the 2024 championship and consolation games, the opening round will likely still occur on Harvard’s campus.
The move to TD Garden comes on the heels of other recent developments to further showcase women’s ice hockey. In January, the Crimson took the ice against Quinnipiac in the nearly 40,000-seat Fenway Park as part of the 2023 Frozen Fenway Series. Furthermore, the NCAA women’s ice hockey tournament was expanded from eight schools to eleven in 2022. The NCAA Competition Oversight Committee recommended the change as it grew the size proportional to the men’s field of 16.
Similar to the decision to expand the NCAA tournament, the relocation of the championship game to TD Garden brings the Women’s Beanpot to the same level as the men’s. The men’s version of the Beanpot, held on the first and second Monday of each February, has always been showcased on the big stage. Following the first tournament, which was played at Boston Arena, now known as Matthews Arena, the tournament has been contested at either the Boston Garden or TD Garden, which replaced the former in 1996. For Harvard senior captain Kyra Willoughby, the move was long overdue.
“I think it means everything,” the Academic All-Ivy Leaguerd said. “It’s an overdue decision to elevate women’s hockey and put it on the same level as the Men’s Beanpot.”
With the Women’s Beanpot moving away from its traditional slot, the Tuesday after the Men’s Beanpot, and on to Jan. 23, the 2024 tournament will put all eyes on women’s hockey.

We’ve done it. We’ve gotten through another season of midterms, finally handing in that paper we’ve been stalling on for weeks, taking that test in the Science Center everyone crammed for. But now that we’ve gotten a very well-deserved break, let’s take a moment to reflect back on this midterm season before gearing up for finals or yet another round of midterms, since apparently I learned more than just my Quizlet flashcards.
Studying Early is a Myth 
I’ve heard people swear up and down that if you just start early, studying really won’t be that bad!! Apparently, I’m supposed to sit down a week before my exam, open up Quizlet, and get to work. These same people claim that if I study for an hour every day leading up to the exam, when the time comes, I will “know the material.” If I study early instead of cramming, I’ll do… better? I think the theory is that my actions have consequences. Ugh.
Common Sense is Your Best Friend 
Picture this: it’s the night before my midterm, and it’s getting to that time around 11:30 p.m. where if I power through I’d have maybe two more productive hours until I pass out. You might be thinking: But the midterm! You have to study! That’s where you’re wrong. LS1B? It’s your body. Econ 10B? I spend money everyday. Gov 20? I turned in my absentee ballot. You’ll figure it out. Common sense is king.
Escaping Your Dorm is Key 
Here’s another time where much to my dismay, all the responsible people are right. Getting out of your dorm room to study, even if it’s at Capital One Cafe, crowded around a tiny table with friends, makes a huge difference. Sure, maybe you get distracted by the sidewalk sign (whose handwriting is that good??) or maybe you waste 20 minutes staring out the window people watching, but you got outside. You sat down with your work and no matter how many times you put your notes down to gossip with your friends, it was still more productive than rotting in your bed. Great work.
It’ll Actually Be Okay (Really!) 
I have had my fair share of pre-midterm breakdowns and I have, on several occasions, walked out of an exam room thinking wow, I understood maybe a third of those questions?? Don’t get me wrong, I was not being dramatic and I really did understand less than half of the material, but I usually end up doing a little better than I feared. You probably will too.
Midterm week was a shitshow little stressful — I won’t deny it. While finals may be around the corner, I really do believe that with two midterm seasons under my belt, I get a little better at studying every time. I hope you do too.

Dozens of Harvard students occupied University Hall from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday in protest of the school’s sexual harassment policies and continued employment of John Comaroff.
Students postered the John Harvard statue with papers calling for the resignation of John Comaroff and explaining the purposes and goals of their occupation.
Inside the North wing of University Hall, students gave speeches, chanted, and played music. Above, Austin Siebold ’23, a co-organizer of the event, gives handouts to attendees.
Signs taped to the walls of University Hall called for “Justice for Survivors” and Comaroff’s resignation. One sign directed at Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana read “Rakesh can’t fix this with a selfie!”
Students entered and exited the building for the first seven hours of protest until Harvard University Police Department officers blocked non-ID holders from entering.
William M. Sutton ’23, left, begins his “shift” in University Hall’s downstairs bathroom. Student protesters maintained a presence in the bathroom to prevent being locked out.
Two volunteer legal observers from the National Lawyers Guild attended the occupation to monitor police conduct.
Siebold speaks to Interim Dean of Students Lauren Brandt (left) and Dean of Administration and Finance Sheila Timba (right). Students also spoke to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana for 50 minutes earlier in the day.
Students left University Hall at 9 p.m. after eight hours of occupation.
The protest concluded in front of the John Harvard statue with protesters chanting, among other phrases, “Hey hey! Ho ho! Comaroff has got to go!”
