After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off the Mar 31 release of his feature on Dreamville Records’ “D-Day: A Gangsta Grillz Mixtape,” Atlanta rapper JID took the Shine stage at North Carolina’s Dreamville music festival by storm.
JID kicked off his show with the energetic banger “NEVER,” with opening lyrics “Never been shit, never had shit,” echoing through the festival. His set was heavy on the 808s, the power from the speakers driving the audience into a frenzy. The reverberating acoustics were accompanied by extensive screen effects. Strobe lights and hallucinogenic images of animals and football tackles lit up the stage. At another moment, the screen behind him displayed different variations on the initials JID, like “Juggling’s Incredibly Difficult” or “Jesus In Disguise.” These artistic elements elevated the performance into the type of intense audiovisual experience only a festival can provide.
“I like to take my sets slow… from the past to the future,” JID said, before diving straight into his 40-minute show. Indeed, the resulting performance was a progressive collage of his discography. There were some nostalgic songs that lingered on the past like “Sandstorm,” during which he brought out his sister, Mereba to sing with him. But there were also renditions of some of his most famous singles, like “Workin Out,” “Meditate,” and “Baptize,” during which the trio of Mereba, EarthGang, and JID (aka Spillage Village) united on stage. JID’s confidence radiated with lyrics like “My verses will live if I die for sure,” with peace signs all around. “Down Bad” saw rapper and songwriter Bas joining the squad up on stage, leaving the crowd going wild.
He also included a healthy dose of new and experimental projects like the artistic depiction of the Cartoon Network’s show “EdEddnEddy,” which features a sample from A Tribe Called Quest’s song "Scenario.” “A good artist copies samples. A great artist steals,” JID shamelessly admitted in between tracks.
There were also moments where JID freestyled with no music to back him up. Admittedly, he messed up in “JIDtranada Freestyle,” saying that he was “so mad [he] fucked it up.” But this didn’t stop his flow on songs like “Off Da Zoinkyes,” which he delivered a capella to the undying cheers of impressed festival goers. He even gave the audience a glimpse of the new “D-Day” mixtape with the track “Barry from Simpson.”
Although his audience was understandably less familiar with these tracks, JID got the crowd into the groove with call and responses: “If you feeling good, say fuck yeah Jiddy.” The rapper proved himself able to handle the high-energy atmosphere without breaking a sweat. “I gotta take the gloves off, it’s not time to be a gangsta yet” he said. Indeed, when the gloves did come back on during the song “Stick,” his stage presence multiplied, bouncing off the crowd’s.
Although his performance was high in energy and quality, it was clear that the rapper’s main priority was his audience’s safety. When the audience started chanting ‘medic’ for someone who felt ill during “Sandstorm,” JID immediately stopped the song and saw to it that they got medical attention. On “Stick,” JID asked to open up the mosh pit, guiding the crowd by counting down to the beat drop in the beginning of the song. At the end of the performance, he made sure that everyone in the crowd was okay and that any people who needed help received it right away. There were also several times during the concert where he asked the crowd to take some steps back so that the people in the front could get some room to breathe. Fans could be heard saying “Not like Astroworld,” evidently trusting the rapper in his efforts to keep this festival safe. He kept the atmosphere light with jibes like “How you get hurt on Sandstorm?” and “Sorry for going too hard,” but his intentions were clear: He would not let anyone in the crowd go overlooked.
The rapper ended up going over the time set aside for his set, perhaps a sign of how much fun he was having with the crowd. As a result, his microphone got cut off by the production crew. The rapper later tweeted “I’m so sad I couldn’t perform Surround Sound, I ran over time” ending it with the promise of “we gone follow up at Coachella.” On that hopeful note, JID proved that a high-energy, crowded concert can be conducted safely without jeopardizing any of the fun bits.

Ever since smash hit “Made in Lagos” dropped last summer, Nigerian rapper Ayodeji Balogun (also known as Wizkid or Starboy) has established himself as a giant in the African music scene. Wizkid lived up to his flourishing stardom in his performance at this year’s Dreamville festival, confidently growing into his international fame as the headliner of the festival’s Rise stage.
After DJ Tunez warmed up the crowd with remixes of “Love Nwantiti” by Ckay and “Fall” by Davido, Wizkid took the stage in Raleigh for the first time in Dreamville history. He entered the stage slow and steady, taking his time throughout the concert like the seasoned performer that he is. His “Ginger” performance was smooth like honey, accented by the spiced orange flair pants he wore. Wizkid’s four-karat smile reflected off the gigantic jewelry piece around his neck, speckles of diamonds bouncing off his iridescent shades. Safe to say, Starboy’s outfit was expertly curated to be reminiscent of the sunny, carefree quality in his songs.
DJ Tunez served as Wizkid’s hype man throughout the concert, urging the crowd to sing along to his adlibs. Together, they vibed out with the crowd through “No Stress,” and “Grace,” maintaining the serene ambiance throughout their set. The energy was reflected in the crowd, which turned to uninhibited dancing to the sinuous beat. Some festival goers could be heard whistling and clapping to the beat together, tapping into the communal experience that Wizkid’s tracks seek to bring out in listeners.
Wizkid shouted his day-one fans out with a special acoustic performance of “Ojuelegba,” from his sophomore album “Ayo,” which Starboy called the African national anthem due to its symbolism for the Nigerian youth. In singing the heartfelt lyrics “I am feeling good tonight / This thing got me thanking God for life” Wizkid expressed how grateful he is to celebrate his first time at Dreamville with the crowd. Throughout the concert, Wizkid paid extra attention to members of the Pan-African diaspora in the crowd, shouting out the flying flags from Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad, to name a few. He brought all of these ethnicities together for a performance of “Joro,” which is a Yoruba slang word that translates as ‘come, let’s enjoy.’
Wizkid’s larger-than-life stage presence reflected his years of experience as a musician. Throughout the set, he was filled with energy, jumping up and down and climbing atop the speakers in an effort to better engage with the audience. He was quite the flirt, blowing kisses for the women in the front row and spraying them with multiple water bottles during “Soco.” On “Come Closer,” Wizkid sang “One fuck can’t hold me we gotta go twice,” then adding “three times, four times,” sending a sly smile to his cheering fans as he sang. His stage design reflected that charisma, the backdrop of African women with crowns on their heads at the center of his performance. He made sure to slow it down for an acapella rendition of “True Love,” where the harmonizing back vocals elevated his singing to a new level.
He wound down the show with “Essence,” which had the audience dancing for minutes after the concert ended — an after-effect of the serotonin boost that only a Wizkid concert is capable of delivering.

27-year-old Atlanta native rapper Lil Baby had “Sum 2 Prove” as headliner for the first day of Dreamville festival. Not only is Baby a non-native to the festival’s location in North Carolina, but he is also not signed under the label Dreamville, unlike a majority of the main artists on the lineup. Despite all of this, Baby owned the Shine stage like it was his own. Working hard to not miss one verse, he effectively delivered the best performance of the night.
Being 20 minutes late is almost a given for any headliner at any major festival — something about the anticipation escalating with a promise for a great performance. In Lil Baby’s case, it did just that: A roar from 50,000 people or so erupted the moment he entered the stage, before he could even start rapping. The guitar chords of J. Cole’s “pride is the devil” playing before Lil Baby walked on stage sounded like a promise fulfilled indeed, since Baby is a feature on the track. Sure enough, Baby’s lyrics “Break it down, weigh it up, and bag it up,” played right after the rapper appeared on stage, his entrance as quick as his flow on the track.
Baby didn’t miss a beat during the song, or at any point in the show, for that matter.
Donning a red suit and a tour t-shirt, Baby didn’t break a sweat during the high energy performances of “Sum 2 Prove,” “Drip Too Hard,” or “Woah.” He strutted side to side with an entourage of back up dancers that formed silhouettes around him, casting long shadows on the LED display as they backed it up to the beat. They weren’t the only ones twerking — the crowd came alive with dancing and mosh pits to the heavy trap beats and high heats accentuated by the booming speakers. The heavy 808s could be felt thrumming up from the ground and surrounding all around the stadium on tracks like “All In.”
Since Baby was so busy delivering line after line flawlessly, his stage relied on its visual display more than others before him. Images of his self-founded record label 4pF (during “Yes Indeed) and barking dogs (during “My Dawg”) flashed in inverted spectrums of colors. The intense lights that washed over the crowd created a trippy strobe-like effect. The crowd grew even more enthusiastic to this audiovisual exposure, chanting along to lyrics like “Wah-wah-wah, bitch I’m the baby” on cue with the pulsating fire effects.
Part of what made the concert so special was the deep connection the fans had with Baby. The entire stadium could be heard chanting in a powerful unison, coming together over their love for the rapper’s music. On “Close Friends,” for example, they quieted down to sing along with an emotional reverence, since the song encapsulates the pain of heartbreak. Baby returned the favor, working hard to repay their love through his tireless rapping through the busy setlist. He switched from the bars of “On Me,” to the chorus of “Get Money,” to the verses on “Every Chance I Get,” without more than a few seconds pause between each. It was hard to believe in the lyrics “I’m a human, I’m not perfect” in moments like this — when the only indication of his strain was Baby taking off his jacket as the concert heated up.
As if unsatisfied with his performance up to that point, Baby promised that he would turn the crowd all the way up before launching into the last two songs of the set: “Girls Want Girls” and “Freestyle.”
Lil Baby ended the show with a smile of gratitude, but the happy fans who walked out of Dreamville festival that night were sure they were the lucky ones to have witnessed such a dedicated performer in his element.

“America Has a Free Speech Problem,” says the New York Times Editorial Board. No it doesn’t, says Salon. Free speech is again the topic du jour (if not du siècle), and it’s a complicated issue. Much of the discourse is muddled, and the latest contributions are no exception. We approach the issue with the humility of a student Editorial Board, but we do feel the Times has hit on some common, misguided tropes of the anti-cancel-culture discourse.
Progressive support for stigmatizing some ideas certainly exists. But its threat, relative to other past and present interferences with free speech, is overstated. Looking back at the legally-imposed self-censorship of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” or further back to an American culture generally hostile to people of color who spoke their minds, it’s difficult to believe that America has historically had a better approach to free speech. Instead, the costs of our prior restrictions were disproportionately borne by the underprivileged. Perhaps the redistribution of that burden feels, to some, like its net increase.
Similarly, properly recognizing legal restrictions on free speech as more dangerous than social stigmatization allows us to contextualize the effect of “cancel culture.” When Republican-led state legislatures impose restrictions on critical race theory and discussion of some gender identities, they impose restrictions that can be enforced by the state, not by uncomfortable seat-shifting and ambiguous gazes. We are emphatically and unequivocally against legal restrictions on constitutionally protected speech, no matter their source.
The Times, to its credit, has covered these legal restrictions. But their editorial page is valuable real estate, and the balance of words they devote to one cause or another sends a message about their priorities. It would be a mistake to suggest, on the slender reed of some questionably phrased polling questions about “race relations,” that cancel culture is the greater threat. Society has always set some social costs to less “acceptable” speech — most Nazis don’t have a lot of friends, and haven’t for a while! — and we suspect that even the Times would not want to stop doing so. A more productive discourse would recognize this fact and frankly discuss where these soft lines should be, rather than pretending anyone is in favor of having no lines at all.
To be sure, we are broadly in favor of a healthy sphere of discourse in which participants feel empowered to share their beliefs. But by clarifying the anti-woke talking points that so often dominate the discussion, a clearer roadmap to safeguarding such a sphere emerges.
Students, professors, and Americans more generally should advocate forcefully for their views. As a culture, we should learn to live with criticism. In turn, we should focus our reproval not on those who criticize but on the powerful people who sometimes suspend, fire, or ban when they shouldn’t.
The way to beat back a cultural stigma you think unfair isn’t to speak in generalities about cancel culture; it’s to defend your specific ideas and alternatives. Contest the cultural terrain, if you're so inclined! Call out views you disagree with, and sign your name when you do. If your critics respond, sometimes harshly, so be it. So long as administrators and governments hold fast in their responsibility to protect you from unreasonable institutional recrimination, let the best speech win out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Suffocated for more than two years by an agonizing pandemic whose global grip only finally appears to be loosening, Muslims around the world look forward to the revival of community life with the recent start of Ramadan — a month of fasting from sustenance and sin, observed each day from the hours of sunrise to sunset.
For Muslims who practice this ritual, Ramadan is a profoundly special period. The month’s value sits uniquely at the interface of personal and collective spiritual growth, where, in abstinence of worldly pleasures, our devotion to Islam can be cultivated both within ourselves and our Muslim communities at large.
For me, this year’s observance of Ramadan promises a particularly exciting, though almost unfamiliar, return to spiritual community. It marks my first communal iftar — the meal to signify the conclusion of the daily fast — and my first taraweeh prayers — the set of community-led, nightly prayers distinct to the month of Ramadan — in three years. Perhaps most exceptionally, this will be my first Ramadan away from home, at Harvard.
Before Covid-19, I had never considered that it would be a luxury to no longer merely imagine, but to live a proper, in-person, Ramadan on Harvard’s campus. And at a time when my memory of a communal Ramadan has begun to slowly erode, the newly-resurrected opportunity to cherish this sacred experience with the Harvard Muslim community this year — from iftar to taraweeh to simply our presence with each other — should be fundamental to remembering this month’s central project of community-building.
But tonight, I’ll be breaking my fast in an organic chemistry lab.
Canonized as the boogeyman of undergraduate pre-medical requirements, organic chemistry is certainly no small mountain to climb. It is often regarded as the most well-oiled machinery in the industry of pre-medical hazing, whereby introductory science courses are often cruelly designed to carve hierarchies of the most “capable” future scientists and physicians — and all those who elect to prioritize other passions or even their own mental health are systematically discarded as the “weeded out.”
My organic chemistry lab section, though — a four-hour-long program of molecules and mechanisms from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. each Monday night — has the additional pleasure of weeding me out from parts of my first experience of an on-campus Ramadan. Tonight, and every Monday night in April, I will exchange my communal iftar for my lab coat, my taraweeh prayers for my lab notebook, and my religious community for my lab section. This month is my first Ramadan on campus, and it is my first Ramadan in a lab; the fact that I must — in the words of course staff — find a way to “balance” the two reveals the existence of an insidious infrastructure festering beneath Harvard which judges marginalized identities as inconveniences.
Students of underrepresented backgrounds should not be pushed so far to the margins that they must plead loudly and uncomfortably to belong at Harvard. Yet I have done so since January: I requested accommodations for additional, earlier lab sections and for options to exit the lab early so that I might still be able to partake in our communal iftars and prayers. But the fruits of my labor — the permission I have since received to break my fast for a predetermined period of less than twenty minutes in a side room in the lab — are rotting. They reduce the spiritual richness and complexity of Ramadan to a transaction of food and drink and entirely distort the obligations of my religion as a loss in productivity and in caliber as a pre-medical student at Harvard. To reconcile lab and Ramadan, it seems, is code for reconciling being at Harvard and being Muslim.
These scars of unbelonging for Muslims are inscribed far and wide around Harvard’s campus. The soul of this issue lives not only in organic chemistry labs, but also in Harvard’s very foundation — in the small and poorly-lit lone prayer hall Harvard cast aside for its hundreds of Muslim students in the basement of a freshman dormitory, or in the only two permanent Halal meal stations across 12 undergraduate Houses for which Muslim students must compete.
I once believed that our requests for belonging were grueling demands, as if my Muslim identity somehow strained and exhausted a corporation that grew $11.3 billion during a pandemic — the very pandemic that made me a virtual student last spring and my memories of a communal Ramadan feel like shards from a distant past. I once believed that erecting a Muslim prayer space comparable to the impressively-towering presence of Memorial Church, that offering Halal dining stations in each undergraduate House, or that extending accommodations for a religious practice observed by nearly two billion adherents would be too taxing on Harvard. I once believed that when it came to institutional support for the expression of my identity, I should settle.
But the boundary between accepting the status quo and reimagining a better, more just future is porous — and it requires crossing. Muslims at Harvard will not be content to break our fasts with the crumbs of visibility this institution affords us. We need — and we expect — this University to mobilize itself in our support, to lift the burden of hoping for more that we Muslims too often shoulder and to finally do more for us.
So, as I break my fast in my organic chemistry lab tonight, I will pray to live that future, for myself and for the rest of my Muslim community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John Chute has lost a lot of people. “I have blocked out in my mind the number of people that I have known that have died tragically. Needlessly,” he tells me. “Freezing in snowbanks. Getting hit by cars on the way to a shelter.” Chute, 41 years old, says putting a figure to it is impossible.
“Countless people. Countless.”
Chute has lived in the area his whole life. For around seven years of his time here, he was homeless.
In 2020, after years on the city’s waitlist, Chute secured permanent housing. But the flow of bad news about those less lucky — people he knows who still live on the street or in shelters — has continued. He stresses the mortal stakes of shelter access, which can be revoked if shelter rules are violated. Common infractions include consuming alcohol and drug use: About half of people experiencing homelessness struggle with substance abuse, and many shelters are dry. “A lot of times, you know, people get banned and you would never see them again. Then you find out they're dead.”
The main subject Chute and I discuss is another way people lose shelter access — one that’s much less sudden, but more sweeping. On April 15 (somehow, in less than two weeks), Harvard’s two student-run shelters will close for the season. The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y, a youth shelter, operate from November through mid-April and also run limited summer programs.
I didn’t consider what it meant for these dozens of beds to go offline until Jim Stewart, a Divinity School graduate and director of The First Church Shelter in Harvard Square, described the “scramble” that, like clockwork, strikes when “the end of the second semester comes up on the horizon.”
In preparation for their seasonal closure, both Y2Y and The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter work to develop an “exit plan” for each of their guests.
Henry N. Lear ’24, HSHS’s Co-Administrative Director, explains that HSHS’s resource advocacy team has been making referral calls to other shelters, knowing from experience that their voice on the other end means “a higher chance of someone receiving a shelter bed.”
Whatever favorability a student calling curries has limits. The First Church Shelter, like all in the region, is virtually always at capacity — stuffed as guests like Chute wait years to access public housing there is little political will to build.
“We get lots of calls from Y2Y and the Harvard Square shelter like: ‘Oh well, this is a great person. He’d fit really well there,’” Stewart tells me. “I’m like: ‘Probably would. But you know, we’re full!’”
Stewart describes the doomed exchange of people seeking shelter across the river — told to see if there are open beds in Boston or Cambridge, only to make the trek and find none. “Clearly there isn’t sufficient resources available to meet the needs out there.”
So I ask Lear: Where will the people staying at HSHS go in two weeks?
Lear is excited to share that three HSHS guests are moving into permanent housing soon — huge, though very much “the exception to the rule.” Others hope to stay with friends and family, though Lear reminds me that many experiencing homelessness have families “they don’t have a great relationship with — hence, homelessness.”
“These conversations, particularly at the end of season, really hold a particular emotional weight,” Lear says.
I asked John Chute about the student-run shelter closures, with language I’d picked up interviewing shelter-runners: How do we ease the transition from one shelter to other resources? He laughs a little — I make it sound like they’re “going from a job to a better job or something.” Fair. I try to drop the euphemisms.
Chute helps me understand the difficulties you face when leaving a shelter, though he’s never been around to experience HSHS or Y2Y’s closures personally. During his seven years of homelessness, he only stayed about five nights in the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which lotteries its beds.
Chute recalls losing the lottery so relentlessly, he decided to ask the student who ran it if he had done something wrong and was shadowbanned from the shelter. “Can you tell me if I am, just so I don’t have to keep coming here?” But bad luck — years of it — was all that was behind it.
When people transition between shelters, Chute says “IDs get lost, stolen, and paperwork is thrown away.” The disruption can cause hiccups in the years-long process of applying for benefits like disability and permanent housing. “Case workers move and they don’t set you up with a new one properly. Stuff like that happens all the time,” Chute says. Though Harvard’s student-run shelters catalog information so that another case worker can, ideally, pick up where they left off, every guest will lose access to the student case workers they have been working with this season.
Even receiving mail — a prerequisite for setting up a bank account, accessing government services, and employment — grows incredibly complicated.
The closure of Harvard’s shelters in mid-April, and their subsequent resumption of regular operations in November, is an obvious byproduct of their marriage to student schedules. Yet Stewart, who has witnessed HSHS’s end-of-season for the past 40 years, thinks an obvious solution exists: hiring full-time staff to assist students in running these shelters so they can remain open for more of  — and ideally all of — the year.
Stewart praises student involvement in Harvard’s shelters, but envisions the day when their work is augmented by full-time staff solely dedicated to keeping the shelters running. Currently, no such staff exists. He pokes at this model: “Do these shelters exist to serve the people looking for shelter, or are they set up to provide an opportunity for people to be of service?”
As a freshman, Lear admits he approached shelter work as a “very much self-serving thing.”
“I did it because I wanted to feel good.”
Now, the work feels very different. During his time at HSHS, “I have been yelled at. I have come off shift, like sobbing. I have dealt with people in the throes of drug overdose.”
Three years in, his biggest focus is doing what he can “for the people that I am obliged to serve.” But, he says, “we’re pinned in by these bigger things.”
Through a process known as procurement, the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter is newly able to apply for funding from the state and City of Cambridge to expand its services. Lear is open to the idea of using this process to hire full-time staff and potentially serve guests longer. “What I’m really hoping for is a model where we can have some mix of professional support,” he tells me. “I am an adamant supporter of whatever steps that we can take to ensure good outcomes for our guests.”
Harvard’s student-run shelters are of a rare breed invented here. That their entirely volunteer-based, student-led model works at all is a testament to the goodwill and dedication of students. In an environment inundated with flashier options, they work late night and early morning shifts and choose work genuinely capable of transforming lives.
Yet the April 15 cliff we are approaching highlights one way this model bends towards student interests, and inevitably destabilizes the lives of those it is designed to serve.
Chute treats the idea of hiring professionals to help run the shelter as a no-brainer. Running a shelter, “is not a joke,” and neither is recovering in one. “God bless anyone that can get out of addiction while being homeless.”
To some extent, Chute says dealing with the issue of a couple dozen beds feels silly. “It’s so asinine, because you can just eliminate the problem,” he says. “Lack of housing? Build housing!”
But, until access to supportive, permanent public housing is less mythical, Chute says Harvard’s student-run shelters should “hire people year-round, definitely.” For someone seeking shelter in our under-resourced Cambridge, “it’s a life or death situation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said he would announce by mid-week whether he will vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Friday evening, saying he was not yet ready to do so.
Scott, who has served in the Senate since 2013, called Jackson a “likable person,” but said, “My question isn’t whether she’s likable or not — it’s her judicial philosophy and how that matches with what I think is in the best interest of our country long-term.”
Just one Republican senator, Susan Collins (Maine), has said she will vote to confirm Jackson, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School who serves on the school’s Board of Overseers. She will not need any other GOP support in order to be confirmed to the bench if every Democrat backs her nomination.
“I think President Biden should have more deference on his cabinet members because those folks work for him, and he has a right to hire and fire them,” Scott said. “When it comes to our courts, that’s a lifetime appointment. It’s not his court, it’s America’s Supreme Court. And so I look at that as a very different process.”
“I’m about two-thirds of the way through mine,” he said. “I have to be there by next Friday, or next Thursday when we vote. I’ll be there probably Tuesday or Wednesday.”
Jackson said at her confirmation hearings last week that she would recuse herself from the challenge to affirmative action at Harvard the court is set to take up in the fall due to her Harvard ties.
Scott also discussed education reform and political polarization at the forum, which was moderated by Arthur C. Brooks, a professor of the practice at HKS.
Scott voiced support for private and charter schools, financial literacy education, and open political discourse.
“Without quality education, it seems like a part of your future just feels like it’s evaporating before your very eyes,” he said. “And as that poor kid, I will say, you get frustrated, and sometimes you get irritated about what’s not available.”
“Really the only people who don’t have choice in education are the poorest parents,” he added.
Scott said he supports charter and magnet schools as solutions to a lack of choice in education, claiming they improve the public school system as a whole.
“Education freedom would really bring more options into those Title I schools and hopefully encourage public schools to get stronger through charter schools, magnet schools, and options,” he said.
Scott was asked about political polarization, which he attributed to the media and the public’s tendency to “read headlines, not stories.”
“Conflict is lucrative — doesn’t matter if you’re on the right or the left,” he said. “The more polarization there is in the nation, the more you tune in.”
In an interview after the event, Scott added that some of the political divide between Republicans and Democrats is more perceived than realized.
“There’s a lot of reasons to look at the divisions in life,” he said. “Some of them are real, most of them are not.”
Paurakh Rijal ’25, who attended the event, said he agreed with Scott’s analysis of polarization in the U.S.
“I feel everybody has common ground to some extent at some point, right?” Rijal said. “Something that he kind of mentioned, which I like to agree with, is this idea that you should go out and try to begin with similarities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beginning in June, a group of 10 Harvard undergraduates will work with the African Community Center of Lowell to support immigrants and refugees from African nations acclimate to life in Lowell, Mass.
Gordon Halm, the director of the African Community Center of Lowell, and Daniel D’Oca, a professor at the Graduate School of Design, spearheaded the project as part of the College’s Mindich Program in Community Engaged Research.
Halm said the goal of the project is to provide necessary tools to recent immigrants as they adjust to life in the U.S.
“Our hope is that this project will sort of highlight the resources available to the simplest person, so that anybody could look at and say, ‘Okay, this is where I could find these resources,’” Halm said. “‘This is where I can better my education, and this is where I can better my trade.’”
In order to discern what resources are in demand, students will have the opportunity to interact directly with the residents through focus groups and weekly trips to Lowell.
“We're hoping to sort of organize a focus group, meeting people where they are, where they worship, where they dine, where they play soccer, and things like that, so that they will be more engaged with the community members,” Halm said.
Students will research local services and businesses and explore the best practices to welcome refugees into the neighborhood, according to the project website, and will also synthesize the information into guides that will be provided to residents.
Examples of necessary resources include legal advice, job training, and education, Halm said.
“If you say to a high school student, ‘What is your next move?’ a lot of them don't have that ambition or the dream of going to schools like Harvard, and other places like that, you know? They all want to stay local,” Halm said. “I want them to bring the best out of themselves in terms of also dreaming big.”
D’Oca said that aspects of the project are still to be determined, as the program aims to cater to the specific needs of the residents.
“We don't know exactly what the pieces will be, because it depends on what people tell us in these focus groups,” D’Oca said. “Secondly, we're also being open minded about the physical format, because we're going to ask people, ‘Do you prefer to look at things on your phone? Would you like a printed newspaper?’”
Students will work with Interboro Partners, D’Oca’s design office, on the project. D’Oca has worked with Harvard graduate students to develop urban plans for neighborhoods in Lowell for the past five years. Through this work, he met Halm.
“[Halm] helped us really understand some of the unique needs and challenges and perspectives of people in the African community there in Lowell,” D’Oca said. “I just thought of him immediately when I was thinking about what to do for the project this summer with the Mindich Program in Community Engaged Research.”
The Mindich Program in Community Engaged Research is accepting applications for the project until April 8.

Taeku Lee will join Harvard's faculty as the first ethnic studies scholar to be brought in as part of a cluster hire by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the school announced Monday.
Lee, currently a professor of political science and law at University of California, Berkeley, will join Harvard as the inaugural Bae Family Professor of Government on July 1. Lee previously served as an assistant professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School from 1997 to 2002.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay said in a February interview that the FAS has identified and is “actively recruiting” four ethnic studies scholars.
Lee’s appointment marks a major step in the decades-long lobby for an ethnic studies concentration at Harvard. Gay originally launched a search for faculty specializing in Asian American, Latinx, and Muslim studies in June 2019. Due to logistical issues posed by the pandemic, however, the search was suspended in April 2020, resuming four months later.
Gay said in a press release that Lee’s hire is a significant contribution to Harvard’s research of “ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration” and will promote the study of racial inequality.
“I am thrilled to welcome Taeku who is a true intellectual leader in this rich, dynamic area of inquiry and a scholar I personally admire,” she said.
The cluster hire accompanies other moves by Gay to build on the FAS’s curriculum in racial and ethnic inequality.
In addition to the cluster hire, Gay welcomed Vivek Bald as Harvard College’s first visiting professor in Ethnicity, Indigeneity, and Migration and expanded the Inequality in America postdoctoral fellowship from two to four scholars.
A $45 million donation made by Asian American alumni in September to expand Asian American studies will fund the Bae Family professorship, as well as the postdoctoral fellowship and the ethnic studies visiting professorships.
Lee said in the press release that he looks forward to shaping ethnic studies at Harvard in the next few years.
“What excites me so much is I’ll be joining one of the preeminent political science faculties anywhere and that I’m getting in on the ground of this genuinely inspired EIM initiative,” Lee said.
“It’s a culmination of many things I’ve dedicated my career towards and to be a part of a group of faculty to figure out what form that inspiration takes at Harvard is well worth the next chapter of my career,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Assistant Professor of Chemical Biology Suyang Xu is working toward expanding the application of topological materials — new materials in the quantum field with the potential to significantly improve our ways of saving information.
Storage information is a key component of technology and has taken various forms throughout the years, according to Xu.
“A crucial aspect of our technology is how we store information. We carve on bones; we write on paper; most recently, we make tiny patterns on silicon wafer,” Xu wrote in an email.
Xu explained that topological materials are distinct from current forms of information storage and will allow scientists to store and control information with “great robustness.”
“Topological materials are new materials beyond the ones people understand and are already using, such as silicon, copper, glass, etc.,” Xu wrote.
“Topological materials are materials where electrons can make quantum mechanical knots at the scale of atoms,” he added. “This can make the information at the scale of atoms very robust, therefore can solve some of the technological bottlenecks and also enable new technologies such as quantum computers.”
Xu wrote that his physics and chemistry background developed during his undergraduate years in China, and later as a graduate student at Princeton, were foundational to his understanding of topological materials.
“Chemistry dictates the synthesis and design materials,” he wrote. “On the other hand, the core principles of topological materials arise from advances in quantum physics. Without a solid background in physics, we cannot properly understand the quantum properties of these new materials or experimentally uncover them.”
Xu’s lab published its most recent article in the scientific journal Nature in July 2021. Since then, the findings from Xu’s work have led Xu and his team to further investigate topics including axions, which are “elusive” elementary particles, and the creation of “next-generation memory devices.”
“Moving forward, we will continue to explore and understand the novel electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of topological materials,” Xu wrote. “We are also planning to explore the chemical properties of these materials such as how they interact with molecules or how they facilitate chemical reactions.”

UPDATED: April 4, 2022 at 12:38 p.m.
Harvard students celebrated the College’s tenth annual Sex Weekend over the past three days, attending a slate of events that engaged them in conversations about sex, intimacy, gender, and more.
Organized this year by Ash R. Johnson ’25, Katherine T. “Kat” Vasquez Sanchez ’25, and Jane J. Josefowicz ’25, Sex Weekend and Sex Week were conceived in 2012 by a group of students who wanted to educate their peers on sexual topics. The organizers work with organizations on campus like the BGLTQ Office and the Women’s Center to arrange and fund the annual events.
This year’s weekend offered participants a presentation on toxic masculinity, a panel about sexual assault advocacy, and a trans sex-ed workshop. It also welcomed students to colorfully titled events like “Feelin’ Chemistry: Psychedelics and Sex”—which featured Richard E. Doblin, the executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—and “Pussy Portraits: Celebrating Genital Diversity.”
The organizers said Sex Weekend’s emphasis on diversity is crucial because many high schools lack adequate and necessary sex education for heterosexual intimacy, let alone queer and more diverse sexual health.
“I didn’t really have sex education in high school. It was action-focused, preventative against emotional and sexual assault, STDs,” Vasquez Sanchez said.
Vasquez Sanchez added that the sex education she received in high school was also “very focused on male pleasures, and strictly heterosexually,” but noted that she appreciates Harvard Sex Week and Sex Weekend’s focus on including non-heterosexual relationships in a “big approach to diversify.”
“It’s essential,” she said.
One highlight of Sex Weekend was a presentation on Saturday entitled “Fruit of the Poisonous Tree: The Drendology of Toxic Masculinity,” which featured James Wilkerson, a Title IX coordinator at Indiana State University.
Wilkerson’s talk honed in on the concept of the “masculinitree” and the seeds of toxicity.
“There's toxic masculinity and healthy masculinity, and guess what? As humans, we are able to have both of them in the same day, sometimes at the same time,” Wilkerson said.
The week’s closing event was entitled “Banging Beyond the Binary: Trans Sex 101.”
Hosted by Jamie Joy, a certified sex educator who focuses predominantly on queer sex, the workshop focused on how to best approach sexual intimacy with a trans partner or as a trans individual.
“Trans people are so worthy of pleasure, and so worthy of positive sexual experiences, and often a lot of trans people don't have the pleasurable experiences because society is transphobic and because a lot of people are so wired and conditioned to touching bodies in this very particular gendered way, and it can cost a lot of dysphoria,” Joy said. “Gender affirming sex can be so beautiful and also so hot and life changing.”
Joy spent the workshop discussing ways to make trans and non-binary people feel as comfortable as possible in sexual encounters.
“We're not trying to replicate cisgender bodies and cisgender sex,” Joy said. “We are trailblazing our own pathways for pleasure.”
“I think there's opportunities for exploring your identity and exploring your relationship to intimacy,” Josefowicz said. “That's super important, broadening people's horizons.”
At the end of each event, the organizers raffled off sex toys. Free condoms and lube were also available to all attendees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After students voted overwhelmingly to dissolve the Undergraduate Council last week, some former members of the now-defunct body met on Sunday to discuss the fate of the UC summer storage program and establish funding protocols for the transition period.
Despite successfully championing the effort to repeal and replace the UC, the former body’s president, Michael Y. Cheng ’22, made few comments at the meeting, which was instead led mostly by former UC Vice President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 and former UC Lowell House Representative LyLena D. Estabine ’24, who helped draft the now-ratified Harvard Undergraduate Association constitution.
The meeting was originally intended to host only former UC members, according to Cheng. However, roughly an hour-and-a-half before the meeting, a message was sent to undergraduates from the UC’s email account inviting them to attend the “first HUA transition meeting.” Cheng said he did not authorize the email.
Concerned club leaders and former UC representatives flocked to the Sever Hall classroom to air their frustration and confusion, citing apparent contradictions in the newly passed HUA constitution.
“I’m very confused as to what exactly the structure of this nebulous organization is,” said former Kirkland House Representative Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23.
Though the HUA constitution states that club funding will be “maintained as normal through the end of the semester,” exact protocols had yet to be established prior to the meeting.
At the meeting, former UC Treasurer Kimani E. Panthier ’24 assumed responsibility for the role of acting treasurer during the transition period, in accordance with the HUA constitution.
“I am willing to operate in this role as long as students get the opportunity to receive their funding,” he said.
For the remainder of the spring semester, an ad-hoc team of former UC representatives will continue to vet club funding requests before passing them to Cheng, de Kanter, and Panthier for approval in conjunction with the Dean of Students Office.
All funding requests approved by the UC prior to its termination will still be disbursed, former UC leadership confirmed at the meeting.
Another group of former UC representatives will review and approve club petitions that were pending before the body’s dissolution. According to de Kanter, roughly 45 of these petitions remain.
At the meeting, de Kanter and Estabine solicited volunteers to serve on the ad-hoc teams.
“People are here today, and I am hoping that they will be willing to continue on,” Estabine said.
Still, some former UC representatives, such as former UC Finance Chair Daniella M. Berrospi ’24, expressed uncertainty.
“Hope doesn’t get the job done,” Berrospi said.
Former UC Lowell House Representative David Y. Zhang ’23 confirmed the UC summer storage program would still occur, though an additional $4,100 would be required to meet this year’s unusually high level of interest.
Estabine said the new body was not yet able to allocate additional funding toward the initiative and directed Zhang to consult Cheng, Panthier, and the DSO.
“Because we don't have the council structure, aside from club funding, we’re not making any additional allocations of money,” Estabine said.
Just hours before the meeting, Zhang sent an email to the more than 1,000 students who had expressed interest in the storage program to ask for additional “manpower” to help run it.
In the coming weeks, an interim election commission is set to form. Per the HUA’s constitution, the first officer elections will take place by the end of April.

Tracy Pun Palandjian ’93, a nonprofit executive and former member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, will join the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — in July, the school announced Monday.
Palandjian will replace lawyer William F. Lee ’72, who is being term-limited off the board. Penny S. Pritzker ’81 is set to succeed Lee as the Corporation's senior fellow.
Palandjian serves as CEO of Social Finance, an impact investing nonprofit that she founded in 2011. She also serves as director of the Boston Foundation, which partners with donors to support nonprofit organizations, and a trustee of the Surdna Foundation.
Palandjian served on the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — from 2012 and 2018, becoming vice chair of the board’s executive committee.
A magna cum laude graduate of the College, Palandjian worked for the consulting giant McKinsey & Company before returning to study at Harvard Business School.
“Harvard changed my life,” Palandjian said in a press release Monday. “It has shaped my ideals, instilled a sense of responsibility that guides my work, and given me lasting roots in this community and country. I am deeply honored by the opportunity to join the Corporation and continue my service to an institution that means so much to me.”
Lee, a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, praised Palandjian’s leadership in the Monday announcement.
“Tracy Palandjian is an outstanding Harvard citizen,” he said in the release. “She has been one of Harvard’s most engaged and thoughtful alumni leaders in recent years, and I know her insights and perspective will contribute a great deal to the Corporation’s work.”
The Harvard Corporation is a thirteen-member body formally known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College. The board weighs in on top decisions across Harvard, including the hiring or firing of the University president, who serves as a member of the Corporation. When vacancies arise, the Corporation chooses its new fellows, who are approved by a majority vote of the Board of Overseers.
Palandjian will join prominent lawyers, academics, and business leaders on the Corporation when her term begins on July 1.

Dearest Reader,
As of Friday, March 25, 2022, the second social season of “Bridgerton” has begun. With love webs, scandals, and new and old faces alike, there inevitably comes drama, procrastination on p-sets, and efforts to ignore Canvas notifications. This season, our most notable additions (and South Asian queens) are Kate and Edwina Sharma, the latter being the Queen’s appointed diamond.
Read on to hear about what kind of Harvard student the “Bridgerton” characters would be. Tread lightly, however, as there may be spoilers ahead.
Viscount Anthony Bridgerton
Anthony, the Ec Bro to end all Ec Bros, constantly tries to justify his certified-snaky concentration by complaining how much pressure he feels knowing he will be inheriting his family’s extremely wealthy consulting firm. In addition, Anthony has the incessant need to glare at every woman who crosses his path because no one can give unsolicited investment advice like he can. Nevertheless, he gets aways with it because he’s actually quite hot.
Kate Sharma
Kate studies engineering or CS because she’s a STEM queen, but also just to spite the males in the field. She’s obviously at the top of her class and is not afraid to confront anyone who questions her abilities. She out-sections section kid and confidently calls people out for their BS. In her free time, she likes to hit the gym and out-bench every man in the weight room.
Edwina Sharma
Edwina came to Harvard believing she wanted to go into Economics, meet a nice Finance Bro (like Anthony), and become a rich housewife. Plot twist, her family actually influenced her to study Ec, and she was just drinking the Kool-aid without thinking much of it. She decides that she needs to think for herself and switches to Comparative Literature because she is fluent in many languages anyway and loves reading. She also chooses an Education secondary because she realizes her worth and now dreams of opening her own school to teach kids how to be strong and independent.
Eloise Bridgerton
Eloise concentrates in Women, Gender, and Sexuality with a secondary in Philosophy. She is the ultimate girlboss, with her independent spirit and fiery passion for women’s rights, organizing forums and panels for like-minded students. She’s not the most outspoken student in class, but she is always judging the men.
Colin Birdgerton
Colin is an academic sophomore but a social senior who is either studying abroad or taking gap semesters. He probably has been present on campus for a total of two semesters throughout his time at Harvard. He’s changed his concentration 5 times and counting. He also can’t stop thinking about that one girl from his Stat class last semester who seemed to have had a crush on him. In reality, she was just giving him attention so she could get p-set help, and now she’s dating someone else. He constantly complains to his girl best friend, who is in fact secretly in love with him, about how “nice guys always finish last.”
Benedict Bridgerton
Benedict was, until recently, the one TDM concentrator in his class. He is the embodiment of “here for a good time, not a long time.” He has now decided to drop out of Harvard after realizing that his family made a donation to the school which secured his place (no wonder there was a building that shared his last name). Good for him, though, school was just holding him back, anyway.
Penelope Featherington
Penelope’s passions consist of hearing, discussing, and spreading the latest news gossip. She’s heavily involved in The Crimson, The Advocate, and every other publication on campus. She is also the moderator of Crimson Confessions. In her free time, she loves to sit in the dhalls and listen in on people’s conversations (leave it to her to know the latest tea). No one really knows what she is concentrating in, but it’s probably something writing related… we think!
Duchess Daphne Bridgerton
Daphne is the ultimate wing-woman and enjoys supporting her friends’ love lives. She is in an extremely committed long-term relationship with her uber rich boyfriend (she’s, like, basically married), and they just celebrated their anniversary. She is a Psychology concentrator for the sole purpose of being able to psychoanalyze the people that her friends are going out with so she can tell them when they can do better.
So, gentle reader, prepare for a season of much scandal as some of our characters find themselves in promising circumstances while others find themselves compromised. P-sets and essays can wait, but this season is truly something you don’t want to miss.
Yours Truly,
Lady Whistledown
