After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty years ago this month, former Arizona senator and presidential candidate Barry Goldwater published his famous book, “The Conscience of a Conservative.” Goldwater accused liberals of ignoring human needs beyond material satisfaction in the opening chapter of his tome: “The root difference between the Conservatives and the Liberals of today is that Conservatives take account of the whole man, while the Liberals tend to look only at the material side of man’s nature.”
I’ve never considered this criticism to be valid, but I must acknowledge Americans have often been given sufficient reason to think of left-of-center figures as cold technocrats. Today’s Democratic politicians claim spirituality but refuse to articulate how their spiritual ideals enlighten a vision of reform. As the former Clinton Administration advisor Rabbi Michael Lerner wrote in his 2006 bestseller, “The Left Hand of God,” over a thirty-year period Democrats granted the Republicans a stranglehold on the politics of spirituality.
For many Democrats, the mention of spiritual political leaders conjures up the image of a fire-and-brimstone evangelical preacher encouraging the flock to support the war in Iraq or combat abortion in the street. Understandably, many Democrats would prefer the party take a neutral stance on issues of faith, or even avoid discussion of spirituality completely.
Yet the party’s aversion to faith is a relatively recent phenomenon. Throughout American history, the tradition of the spiritual Left has been rich: The New Deal was brokered by Social Gospel theologians, Catholic priests and nuns in the social justice tradition, and Reformed Jewish lawyers among others. The Civil Rights movement was cultivated in Southern Black Baptist churches. The feminist, environmental, and anti-war movements were spiritual if not religious in nature. It is only since the Reagan administration that spiritual politics has focused on saving the moral individual rather than creating a just society.
But the tide can change again—and it can change right now. Given current economic hardship and the decreasing influence of the Religious Right in the Republican Party, the Democrats should build an interfaith spiritual coalition to oppose the alliance between the political and religious Right.
The Religious Right is losing much of its influence on Republicans. Some of this is due to a vacuum of obvious leadership; Jerry Falwell passed away in 2007, “Focus on the Family” founder James Dobson left his organization five weeks ago, and much of Pat Robertson’s influence has dissipated.  However there has also been a shift of the conservative base. In 2008, the Republicans nominated a presidential candidate who once referred to leaders of the Religious Right as “agents of intolerance.” Last month, Washington Post writer David Waters noted that the Tea Party movement and in general the rising pseudo-libertarian element on the right, lacks Christian evangelical leaders and rhetoric. The issues the Religious Right exploited during the Bush era—same-sex marriage, abortion, and prayer in schools—are absent from the Tea Party agenda. William F. Buckley’s old alliance between national security hawks, free-market ideologues, and religious social conservatives is splintering.
Although it’s unclear exactly how the Republicans will adapt to the waxing of the Tea Party and the waning of the Religious Right toward November, the focus of the party will not be on spiritual decay so much as expansion of federal power. Three weeks ago political commentator Glenn Beck urged Christians to leave churches that preach a message of social or economic justice. Since the incident, the evangelical preacher Jim Wallis, with support from many social conservatives, has launched the “Million Christians for Social Justice” campaign to oppose Beck.
Although not all Americans make moral decisions with religion as a guide, the majority does. The most recent “U.S. Religious Landscape Survey” illustrates that more than half of Americans attend religious services regularly and pray daily. But 48 percent Americans consider the Republican Party friendly to religion, as opposed to only 29 percent who think the same of the Democratic Party. Democratic politicians need speak at churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples just as much as they need to shake hands at union meetings, city halls, and corporate boardrooms. In the 2008 election, the Obama campaign made significant headway with faith-based voters by going on Christian Radio, talking to religious media, and speaking strongly about issues Republicans refused to address in a moral context: poverty, immigration, healthcare, and the environment. Democratic congressional candidates must emulate this strategy and shed the stereotype of condescension toward faith.
The Democrats would be wise to invoke the rich tradition of King, Lincoln, Whitman, and Huerta and Chávez: progressives who brought their faith to bear upon politics. There are signs of hope on the horizon. A few weeks ago, President Obama’s Faith Council issued a set of joint recommendations for how the federal government can better collaborate with faith-based organizations to face the problems of the recession. As reform efforts continue, Democrats have can gain traction by becoming the party that encompasses the “whole human”—rather than socioeconomic concerns detached from moral premises.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They are the luckiest of the lucky, the most favored of the favored, the crème de la crop. As I sit in limbo waiting for “America’s Most Wanted” to return my calls, they are waltzing off to book contracts and movie deals and exercising royal dominion over small islands. They are the new elite. They were also the old elite. They are the people whose parents work in their chosen professions.
Some of them are sneaky. Every so often I become excited by someone who appears to be a fresh new talent rising on his own wings, and then he turns out to be Oscar Hammerstein’s nephew. It’s not that they are less talented than other people or that they are more talented. They still have to work hard and possess some degree of skill. But that doesn’t mean they don’t have a significant metaphorical foot in the metaphorical door.
On an episode of the British television series “A Bit of Fry and Laurie,” Hugh Laurie observes: “I was Princess Anne's assistant for a while, but I chucked that in because it was obvious they were never going to make me Princess Anne, no matter how well I did the job. It was a question of who you were, rather than how well you did, you know, and I hate that.” This about sums up the feelings of the rest of us as we watch people pelt Kennedy scions with political offices whenever they try to go outdoors.
“I don’t ask for much,” I rail to my parents. “I know you’re attached to me after raising me—or is it rearing?—for twenty-plus years, but I think I’m ready to learn that I was actually deposited on your doorstep as an infant, the surprise product of a torrid affair involving Stephen Spielberg, Maureen Dowd, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and whoever it is who runs the publishing industry these days. Right? Just tell me, so that I can go seize what is mine by right.” They are always depressingly silent at this juncture. “It would explain my hair color and face shape,” I add, holding up a series of diagrams. “Also my love of cats!” They sigh. (“I think I know a guy who ate lunch with George Clooney once,” my mother says, finally.)
Of course, this problem is as old as time itself. It’s always been easier to succeed in an industry if you’d have family in it before you. Look at George W. Bush, Sofia Coppola, Luke Skywalker, Michael Corleone, Harry Potter! Would he have been a famous wizard if his parents hadn’t been so up in the wizarding world? He even had that unsightly scar! And what about Jesus? I’d be able to start a world religion, too, if people thought God was my father. (As it is, Petrism isn’t really taking off. “There shall be no Thursdays!” I declare. “Go turn fish into more fish,” my roommates say, leaving to light their Zoroastrian fire altars.)
So what about the rest of us? Somehow, we are expected to get ahead on the force of our own ability. Who do they think we are, Barack Obama? Right now, for every delighted scion of the right industry there’s dozens of mismatches. So many kids want to break into terrorism these days, and here’s Osama Bin Laden’s son going off to be an i-banker.
There’s got to be a better way. Celebrities looking to pluck someone from deserved obscurity or Stephen Kings seeking to pass the pen to their scions, please, hold an open audition. Remember all those times your son refused to take out the garbage or said your new haircut made you look like a chrysanthemum? You and I don’t have that history! I’ll gladly clean my room, wash the dishes, and, Leona Helmsley Estate, I wouldn’t dream of peeing on the carpet (unless, of course, you would like me to). I won’t bring home strange men or get ill-advised tattoos—at least, not ones that say anything other than Lorne Michaels Is A Wise and Kindly Mentor, Like Yoda, Except Attractive, And With A Better Sense of Humor, Ladieeees… Also, He Is Taller! That’ll fill up a whole ankle!
The finance guru Warren Buffett once argued for the inheritance tax in front of the Senate Finance Committee by saying: “The resources of society I don't think should pass along in terms of an aristocratic dynasty of wealth…I believe in keeping equality of opportunity as much as you can in this country.” Warren was right. But it’s not just wealth. There’s also celebrity, shelter, and the quality of being Miley Cyrus.
Right now, connected parents are one of society’s most inequitably distributed resources. But technically, we are all each other’s thirty-fifth cousins, or something like that. Let’s spread the gifts around. Sure, we should strive for equality of opportunity. But why be self-made? There’s an uncle for that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parties in Harvard’s 12 Houses tend to be stratified between intimate dorm room affairs and massive dining hall extravaganzas. The pilot Student Initiated Programs fund promises to change that. The fund, for which the UC began accepting event applications last Friday, will distribute money for two approved, medium-sized parties this semester. The two Houses hosting the parties, Pforzheimer and Quincy, will match the UC’s contribution. The two parties will be used as a barometer to test the effectiveness of the fund at providing resources for safe, medium-sized parties where alcohol may be served, a combination for which students have been clamoring. Overall, the SIP fund is a step in the right direction toward improving Harvard social space issues, and we encourage students and administrators to support the program.
One of the SIP fund’s greatest benefits is that the parties it will sponsor will be inclusive. Many other similarly sized events on campus—parties that are large enough to feel exciting yet small enough to facilitate personal interactions—are limited to members of a student group or are exclusive in some other way. Students often feel left out of these ideally sized gatherings, a major issue with social space on campus. In response, the SIP fund promises to support exactly the types of events that undergraduates want and that all undergraduates can attend. The parties must be located in a public space but also cannot be advertised via posters or email lists; hence, the parties are intended to be medium in size but simultaneously will be completely open to any student who wants to attend. Moreover, adding to their inclusivity and making them even more accessible, SIP events will be free and will therefore be a financial and social possibility for all students.
Funding these parties will also encourage a good use of social space that already exists. Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke cited the dining hall, House Master’s residence, and the House Junior Common Room as approved spaces for SIP parties. These high-quality venues are ideal for the types of gatherings that the fund will sponsor, yet at the moment they seem to be used largely for sporadic House events. This is a shame, because beautiful and large rooms such as JCRs have the potential to serve as centers for student social life in a broader context. We hope the SIP-funded events will lead undergraduates to understand social spaces within the Houses as places where they can hold many different types of gatherings.
Although the SIP fund is clearly not the much-missed 2003-2007 UC party grants program, it is a more responsible and reformed version. The College cannot legally provide alcohol to underage drinkers—something that the party fund seemed to do. Yet one of the chief assets of the party fund was that it eliminated many socioeconomic barriers to holding good parties on campus. The SIP fund correctly understands this need, but tackles it in a more administratively palatable, and thus more sustainable, way.
Yet, all this being said, Harvard’s social space issues run deeper than what can be solved by a fund that will allow each House one to two parties per semester. Every weekend, hundreds of students are frustrated by the lack of inclusive, high-quality events—as of now, this program will only reach a very small portion of these constituents.
Nevertheless, although it is only a small step, the SIP fund is still an achievement, and students should make sure to attend these parties and put the funds to good use. By supporting SIP-funded parties, students will send the signal that there is a demand for inclusive, medium-sized gatherings on campus, and that the UC and the administration should make even greater efforts to facilitate their existence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I first noticed the pervasive  cultural phenomenon that is the overuse of the word “bro” at a reunion  of high school friends when I entered my friend’s living room to a  chorus of “‘sup bro,” “yo bro-sef,” and even a “dude bro-minator.”  The culprit for this new and odd behavior becomes clearer when I explain  that all of these friends recently became college students. On college  campuses “brother” and “sister” are words that are becoming  synonymous with “friend,” and this has weakened the power that those  words could have.
Formerly constrained to fraternity  houses and re-runs of “That 70s Show,” our generation, especially  college students, has taken “bro” into the mainstream.  I attribute  it to shifting identities, as our generation, placing less existential  emphasis on nation, family, and religion, seeks to fulfill its biological  need for community elsewhere. Perhaps we are so desperate for real familial  connections, and yet lacking in the time to form them, that we attach  the word “brother” or “sister” to people we’ve just met, in  a vain grasp for the unconditional security of family.
However, this may be a mistake. The  justification for my protection of the word “brother” lies in its  strong personal importance. My family hosted three exchange students  while I was in high school, and for each of them, brother was a word  that was earned, and it symbolized the love we shared after living together  for a year.
Nor has that love withered  in the time apart. For instance, Jasdeep Chawla from New Delhi sought  advice from me, as a brother, when he wanted to end his sister’s arranged  marriage. Yigit Dizdarer from Izmir, Turkey was my guide through my  adolescent crises and still my favorite source for advice. And when  Kazushi Hoshino from Kyoto visited me two weeks ago  and I introduced him to my Harvard “bros” as my brother, he wasn’t  fazed and shared my laughter at their confused expressions.
So when I hear “brother”  thrown around as lightly as “buddy” or “dude” it feels  like a slight on the profound friendships I formed with my brothers:  Jasdeep Chawla, Yigit Dizdarer, and Kazushi Hoshino.
Although “brother”  is used too frequently on college campuses in my opinion, I recognize  that I’m lucky in the number of individuals I can call brothers. Therefore,  perhaps the word holds more meaning for me than others because of my  unique opportunities for brotherly relationships. Furthermore, I’m  not trying to belittle the life-long relationships formed in college  (including fraternities and sororities), in fact I would argue that  often the words “brother” and “sister” are used correctly,  but overall, they are used too loosely.
Ultimately, like any other  word, “brother” has a subjective meaning and is therefore variable  between individuals. However, we should remember the power that the  word can have and use it more sparingly and appropriately. Brotherhood  or sisterhood isn’t about shared genetics, simply spending a certain  amount of time together, sharing similar interests, or  mutual inspiration. It’s only about all those things until it’s  about none of those things. Know what I mean broth–err friend?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith has said that the administration will not implement sweeping staff reductions, some department administrators are nevertheless concerned that their constrained budgets will make personnel restructuring inevitable.
FAS is currently in the early stages of the budgeting process that will lay the groundwork for the fiscal year ending June 2011. Despite the drastic measures taken last year to reduce a looming deficit, department administrators said they are looking to cope with further cuts in their allocated budgets.
As FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 has said, she believes that this coming year will be “the year of worst financial impact.”
In an interview last month, Smith said that the FAS administration has not made plans to implement “across-the-board staff cuts,” but he conceded that departments will face smaller budgets and “people may be cut because of changes.”
“Next year is going to be a very tough year, maybe the toughest,” said Government Department Chair Nancy L. Rosenblum, who was forced to reduce a full-time staff position last year to part-time.
The Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures is currently reviewing the possibility of restructuring staff assistance, according to department chair Wilt Idema. While structural changes are not uncommon in FAS departments, the move was precipitated by financial constraints to “see how the staff may be used more rationally,” Idema said.
Sociology Department Chair Robert J. Sampson said that last year’s cuts in staff hours have reduced faculty access to staff assistance, even as concentrator numbers have doubled in the last four years.
Next year, Sampson added, might not be any easier: “It’s fair to say that across FAS, everything is being looked at pretty hard,” he said.
Bill Jaeger, director of Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said that University units must coordinate with the union, as per the organization’s contract, if they are planning for any reductions in staff positions or hours.
But thus far, Jaeger said he has not heard from FAS departments about such plans for restructuring.
“I’ve been taking that to mean that things are a good bit more solid than last year,” Jaeger said.
Kirwan said that FAS will use some of its financial reserves to cushion the persistent effects of last year’s economic downturn. In June 2009, the University announced that FAS eliminated 77 staff positions and reduced work hours for another 15 employees, and 156 FAS staffers took the early retirement package.
Unlike last year—when all FAS departments and administrative units were urged to cut 15 percent of their budgets—the administration is not asking units to cut a standard percentage of their budget. Rather, department administrators are in the process of collaborating with the FAS budget office to identify the core priorities of the unit.
Department leaders are expecting to learn the quantity of their subventions—unrestricted funds distributed by the Dean’s office—in the coming months.
The final list of expenditures are due by May 30, according to a budgetary overview sent by Kirwan to department and center directors in February.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A two-day summer orientation, at least one meeting of all current and incoming House Masters, and casual dinner conversations will prepare the three pairs of newly-appointed Masters before they are suddenly thrust into the many responsibilities of overseeing an entire House.
The centerpiece of the training for the new Masters—Cabot House Master appointees Rakesh Khurana and Stephanie Khurana, Eliot House Master appointees Douglas A. Melton and Gail O’Keefe, and Mather House Master appointees Christie McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten—is a summer orientation where they will meet with College administrators, House staffers, and more experienced Masters.
For example, at past training sessions, incoming Masters spoke with officials involved with University Hall and the Harvard University Police Department, according to Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke.
“It’s a two-day whirlwind meet-and-greet,” Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said.
Besides the orientation, several Masters referenced the upcoming May all-Master meeting where the recently appointed leaders will meet the full group in a formal setting.
Before this meeting, however, several House Masters said they plan on holding informal dinners and social events for the incoming Masters where they will introduce themselves as well as discuss the challenges and rewards that come with their positions.
“Before they come in as Masters, our job is to say, you’re part of this very close-knit network of common interests and common commitment to the students,” said Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67.
Yet the true learning will be on the job, as the new Masters will take on a myriad of responsibilities including tutor selection, facilities maintenance, and budget management.
“It’s just [that] the transition is so fast. It’s from zero to light-speed overnight, and when all the students arrive and the tutors are being trained, there’s really no other way to do it than to jump in and do it,” Gehrke said. “And the great thing about the House system is that there’s such great support.”
Multiple Masters said their Houses’ Allston Burr Resident Deans were vital in easing their transition into these new leadership roles.
“We were trained by our first resident dean, who was wonderful,” Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 said. “We basically did whatever she told us to do our first year because you’re just totally overwhelmed.”
Palfrey said that the first year will be especially tough, as new Masters may not recognize that certain periods of the year—including midterm season and the Harvard-Yale game—are especially stressful while others are fairly relaxed.
Still, many Masters said that they continue to gain more expertise with each year.
“We’ve been here four years, but we still feel like we’re learning,” Gehrke said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 64, she was nearing retirement after 19 years of working at Harvard. Having lost her husband just two years earlier, her job was the only constant in her life.
“My husband passed away, suddenly, unexpectedly in August of 2007,” a former Harvard employee says. “The job was the only thing that didn’t change dramatically in my life.”
But on the morning of June 30, 2009, the Harvard Athletic Department administrative assistant who wished to remain anonymous for this article was told she would be let go.
She was one of about 100 members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers to be laid off.
A week earlier, Harvard had announced that it would lay off 275 employees from across the University following a tumultuous semester of administering cuts to student life and capital projects as well as an early retirement incentive program for staff.
As a result of negotiations with the University, HUCTW members whose jobs were eliminated would be given priority if they chose to apply for other open positions at Harvard.
Of the 80 union members seeking re-employment, roughly 70 percent were hired back.
But in spite of the high rate of re-employment thus far, HUCTW director Bill Jaeger says the union has yet to place the several dozen union workers searching for jobs at the University. “That’s been frustrating in some cases,” Jaeger says.
Much of the difficulty in placing union members who were laid-off in available positions stems from the decentralized hiring process. Union members seeking reemployment meet individually with their union representative and the human resources department at the school that originally hired them to find opportunities elsewhere at the University.
“There are a lot of distant and dark corners in the whole institution,” Jaeger says.
But the former athletic department administrative assistant was fortunate. She received an offer from Harvard in Dec. 2009, but ultimately chose not to accept the job, stating that she would likely retire in a few years.
“Had I been five years younger, I would have taken that job,” she says. “[HUCTW] provided all the tools and plus that anyone would need on a job search.”
SUPPORT AND PERSEVERANCE
Laverne Martinez had just been hired by the Student Receivables Office when she was told that she would be the only member of her team to be let go.
“At my very first meeting, they told us they were making cuts,” Martinez, a union member, says. “I mean, I was the newest employee.”
Martinez had been working at the University Information Systems office since 2001 until she was diagnosed with cancer in 2007.
Two years later, Martinez returned to Harvard and took a term-time job at Harvard Law School before finding a more permanent position at the Student Receivables Office.
But before she had a chance to settle in, Martinez was hit by the first round of layoffs.
The very next week, she met with her union representative, Joie Gelband, who helped her land a job at the Office for Sponsored Programs just five months later.
“I had a very positive experience, and it’s due to the power team that I had, the people I had to work with,” Martinez says. “I was very fortunate to have Joie.”
Like Martinez, Jerome J. Leslie—who was working as an editorial assistant at Harvard Medical School’s Harvard Health Publications—credited the University for its efforts to support those who had been laid off.
“They offered a lot of opportunities for training development,” Leslie recalls. “I never felt like I wasn’t being watched and looked after.”
Leslie had already been considering taking a job that required more technical skills and offered to step down after his department announced it would be making significant cuts to staff.
The turn of events, he says, allowed him to take web design and IT support classes before applying for a new job.
By October, Leslie landed a job with Harvard University Press as an IT assistant, having only started the interview process in August. “I was very motivated myself to make this change happen, to get myself back in employment,” Leslie says. “I was supported from moment one.”
While Martinez and Leslie both describe their experience as ultimately positive, they both acknowledge that there are many who have been less fortunate.
“I was in a better situation than people who were older,” Martinez says. “It was really tough for some of them to get another position.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on Student Life recognized 21 new student organizations and reflected on student complaints regarding interhouse dining restrictions at yesterday’s meeting.
Of the 28 student groups that applied for official College recognition this semester, 21 were accepted, four were deferred, one was rejected, and two were sent to the Department of Athletics for recognition.
The applicants will be informed of the official decisions by Monday, said Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life David R. Friedrich.
The committee—including House Masters, College administrators, and Undergraduate Council members—contemplated lowering the number of groups approved in future semesters to encourage more collaboration between student organizations.
The other issue discussed by the committee was interhouse dining restrictions, which many CSL members said have escalated in severity over the last few years.
The committee agreed that dining restrictions are sometimes necessary, like in the centrally-located Adams House, but some said that farther River Houses should be more open to outsiders.
“Students’ lives are very much impacted at Harvard by where they cannot go,” said Undergraduate Council President Johnny F. Bowman ‘11, later adding, “Dining hall restrictions are very much a part of that, or are becoming more a part of that than they ever have been.”
Early last week, all the Quad houses were paired with sister River houses where dining restrictions will not apply: Currier with Eliot and Winthrop, Cabot with Lowell and Kirkland, and Pforzheimer with Adams—where Pfoho residents were already exempt from restrictions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to bridge the activities of the Government Department and the Institute of Politics, the two groups have embarked on a move toward greater collaboration that would bring more students to events and more guests into classrooms.
In a preliminary meeting on Monday, leaders of the IOP convened with Cheryl B. Welch, director of undergraduate studies in the government department, and Karen Kaletka, the department’s coordinator of undergraduate studies, to synchronize long-term collaborative efforts between the two organizations.
The Government Department and the Institute of Politics have traditionally been viewed as distinctly separate groups, despite the apparent overlap between their academic and intellectual interests.
“The thinking is that we at the IOP serve a lot of undergraduates with a very active interest in politics and public service,” said Kenzie Bok ’11, president of the IOP student advisory committee. “The Government Department is serving undergrads interested in the same things.”
IOP Director Bill P. Purcell said that the meeting made clear that better communication with the government department could yield more opportunities for students, such as bringing guest speakers into classrooms. Purcell cited the time that Government Professor and Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter invited IOP fellow Peggy Noonan to a class last semester.
“When we have people here, we can do more to project those people into the Yard,” Purcell said. “We can do more so that government students know who’s down here, so they make it clear who’s available.”
Purcell said that most of the gains from the increased collaboration will be seen in the future, noting that the summer months—when the IOP finalizes its forum options for the upcoming year and the government department determines its course offerings—is an opportune time for coordination.
The IOP occupies a unique space on campus, considering that comparable government departments at Harvard’s peer institutions will often take the role of hosting government officials when they arrive on campus, according to Welch.
Students at Harvard consequently experience a disconnect between the IOP’s offerings and the Government Department as a distinct academic unit, Welch said.
“The IOP provides a different division of labor,” Welch said, adding that it also has a larger budget which expands the pool of people the organization can invite.
Some students interested in politics echoed Welch’s sentiments, stating that  the government department’s lack of similar offerings detracts the sense of unity among concentrators, and that the dearth of communication deters them from attending IOP forums anyway.
“I think maybe if I’d heard about the [IOP] events a little more I would have gone,” said Anne K. McNerney ’10, a government concentrator, adding that she would have been more likely to attend IOP events had she known that some were relevant to her areas of academic interest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In honor of April Fool’s Day yesterday, members of the Harvard AIDS Coalition presented Senator John Kerry’s office with a giant 9 billion dollar check to show that AIDS is not a joke.
The Harvard activists comprised one branch of an April Fool’s Day campaign involving pranks by AIDS activist groups in New York, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and Florida—all coordinated by the national AIDS and human rights activist group Health Global Access Project. HAC, accompanied by alumni and students from Harvard Medical School and Boston University, rallied in Bowdoin Square in front of Sen. Kerry’s office before going in to present the check and discuss AIDS funding with Sen. Kerry’s Foreign Relations staffer Chris Wyman.
“AIDS is not in recession! Teach Kerry a lesson!” shouted the group of activists as they circled the square in front of the office, shaking the three-by-six and a half foot check in time with their chant.
Passersby stared at the string of zeroes on the check and turned their heads to keep looking even when the students were far behind them.
“This is important because we’ve been pretty disappointed about the level of support the Obama administration and Senator Kerry have given to AIDS and issues of the global poor,” said Matthew F. Basilico ’08, who currently works in Paul Farmer’s office and will begin Harvard Medical School in the fall. “We think there’s a lot Senator Kerry can do as the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee to improve resources abroad and how they’re handled.”
Though Sen. Kerry was in Syria and could not be present, Foreign Relations staffer Chris Wyman ushered the members of HAC and other activists into the senator’s office for a question-and-answer session on global AIDS funding.
“The presentation of this check is a symbol of our hope that Senator Kerry will make this money real,” said Lulu R. Tsao ’12, a member of HAC and rally organizer. “We want to remind him of the urgency of funding these programs.”
Wyman did not hesitate to answer.
“You don’t need to tell me,” he said. “You just need to tell me how to convince other people.”
Though Congress and the Obama administration formally pledged to fully fund worldwide access to HIV drugs and other life-saving programs, their promise has fallen short by about $2.5 billion dollars.
“Senator Kerry is very supportive of this kind of funding, but the economy is not wonderful right now,” Wyman said. He added that he was doubtful that Sen. Kerry alone could garner much support in the Senate, especially from conservative members, but that creating partnerships with Republicans who support global AIDS funding would be an important step.
“I wish I could tell you we’ll just take care of it,” he said. “If there was a feasible way to get it done, he’d do it, or at least he’d try.”
Wyman and members of HAC agreed to remain in contact about potential supporters and how to move the fight for global AIDS funding forward.
“I appreciate your coming,” he said, shaking each student activist by the hand. “I appreciate your caring.”

Starting in 2011, social science concentrators conducting research over the summer will likely be able to stay on campus as part of a new program.
College administrators say they are currently developing a program to support summer research in fields such as economics, psychology, sociology, and government. Called Behavioral Laboratory In the Social Sciences, or BLISS, the program will be modeled after the Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering established five years ago.
PRISE provides students who conduct research over the summer with Harvard faculty with free housing and meals, and administrators hope to extend the opportunity to social science concentrators.
“PRISE is an awesome program, and BLISS is just an active next step,” said Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
The new program may be the only one of its kind among colleges across the nation because of its unique focus on social science research, according to PRISE director Gregory A. Llacer, who will also be spearheading plans for BLISS as head of the newly created Office for Undergraduate Research Initiatives established this February.
Llacer will also be working with FAS Divisional Dean of the Social Sciences Stephen M. Kosslyn and the Office of Undergraduate Education to prepare for BLISS.
College administrators say they will seek the support of outside donors to help finance the new program, as they have with PRISE.
“I think [BLISS] would be especially appealing for donors in the social sciences,” Llacer said.
“It would be a really exciting opportunity for a donor to [contribute to] something novel,” he added.
The development of BLISS was encouraged by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who, according to Llacer, has said she wanted to create a “substantive informative research experience” available to all undergraduates.
Llacer said the College may also create a similar summer program for the arts and humanities, though the launch of that program is likely years away.
Though psychology professor Mahzarin R. Banaji said she had not heard of the program, she quipped in an e-mail that “the program indeed sounds like bliss to me given the struggle we face finding summer research support for our concentrators each year.”
Banaji said she believes that many students who would otherwise choose to do research over the summer miss out on the opportunity because of the prohibitive costs of living in Cambridge.
Psychology concentrator Denetrias J. Charlemagne ’11 agreed, stating that a program like BLISS would be very helpful to students.
“I’m going to be writing a thesis in the fall and the only real form of funding I can apply to now is the Harvard College Research funding,” she said. “It’s hard to commit to coming here all summer.”

The dearth of gallery space has ranked among the major complaints about Harvard’s arts scene for student artists and Visual and Environmental Studies concentrators, who are seeking alternate spaces on campus to showcase their art.
Students are not completely without options of display venues: art can be showcased in places such as Mather House, Adams House, and the Center for Government and International Studies. But none of these areas was technically designed with the explicit purpose of displaying art.
“There is not enough exhibition space on campus. It’s absurd!” said Julia A.F. Rooney ’11, a VES concentrator pursuing a senior thesis in painting. “There are no student spaces where work can be exhibited in a serious way.”
Julia V. Guren ’10, co-director of the Harvard Student Art Show, said that she would like to see “larger-scale” gallery and studio art spaces to accommodate high demand among students. Guren, who is involved in organizing “Arts First,” has been working with the Office of the Arts at Harvard to find a suitable solution for the upcoming show.
“What I’d like to tell you is that the OFA is creating a beautiful new gallery,” said Jack Megan, head of OFA. “But until the funds are made available for that, we’re looking for temporary solutions.”
The lack of gallery space has not only affected students’ ability to showcase their works, but has also impacted the sense of community among visual artists on campus.
The departure of painting lecturer Nancy Mitchnik last spring and the fleeting presence of visiting professors in the VES department have contributed to the lack of cohesion within the studio art community at Harvard, said Scott J. Roben ’12, a VES concentrator specializing in studio painting.
A student-run gallery could serve as a central meeting space for VES students, said Roben—who, along with Rooney, is in the process of exploring the possibility of creating such a central space.
Megan said that just as the performance arts are supported by their theater spaces, a student-run gallery for visual artists would foster “a sense of community among these students, a place for these ideas, a place to feel supported and to be constructively criticized.”
“A fundamental thing that strikes me is that the performing arts at Harvard are almost unmissable,” he said. “We don’t have any kind of equivalent space whose very presence is a statement about the importance of studio artwork in the experience of undergraduates.”

Among a sea of burger joints and pizza parlors, Clover, a restaurant focused on local, vegetarian and mainly organic food, will soon be opening at 7 Holyoke Street.
Currently running out of a food truck at MIT, Clover serves vegetarian food ranging from chickpea fritters to freshly made popovers to French fries, the “gateway drug” for new patrons. The truck is decorated by a dry erase board that changes with the company’s seasonal menu; it provides hot soups in the winter, and salads and seasonal fruits in the summer.
Ayr Muir, the CEO of Clover Fast Food Inc. and a 2000 college graduate of MIT, said that the truck began in September 2008 as a test-run for the menu Muir planned on using in his future restaurant. However, when he shut the truck down after the test-run period of a mere six weeks, Muir’s customers were so vocal in their disappointment that the truck re-opened in March 2009. The time in-between allowed Muir to reorganize for the overwhelming number of customers the truck receives.
“We thought that we would serve 20 to 40 people a day, but it was ten times those numbers, so we needed some time to hire the right people and keep up with it all,” Muir said.
Muir added that he thinks that the food truck’s current large-scale appeal will translate well to the new restaurant space.
“We serve a lot of different people: old, young, blue collar workers, office workers, university people, and I think that will stay the same. The prices are low and the food is really accessible, so no one should be shut out of it,” Muir said.
Harvard students said they were excited about the new addition to Harvard Square and thought that it would provide a unique alternative to the restaurants already available in the area.
“I get tired of having five different places where you can get burritos, so it would be nice to have something different,” Eliza G. Ives ‘11 said.
Chandan G. Lohta ’13 echoed similar sentiments, adding that even though he does not eat out often, he would “absolutely try it out.”
Although their food is vegetarian, Clover’s MIT fan base has reached far beyond the vegetarian community. Muir notes that more than three quarters of their patrons are not vegetarian.
Muir said he hopes that Clover’s new location will be the first of many restaurants. He will also continue with the Clover food truck at MIT, and has plans for opening another truck in either the Longwood Medical or Back Bay area.

This past winter semester, all 550 Harvard Law School first-years donned their formal business attire and assumed the roles of lawyers in a multinational corporation or as legal aid attorneys while Boston lawyers evaluated their performance for course credit.
As part of the Law School’s curriculum overhaul—a three-year process ending Oct. 2006 under former Law School Dean Elena Kagan—a new hands-on course based on solving realistic legal cases was introduced to the first-year curriculum this year.
“Most classes are based on the final answer,” said Law School professor Todd D. Rakoff ’67, who helped design and teach the course. “This course was based on the very first question.”
Faculty have hailed recent additions to the 1L curriculum as long overdue and crucial for adapting the school’s century-old curriculum in a changed world.
Current Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, who spearheaded curricular reform efforts, said in an interview this week that the curriculum changes emphasize the growing importance of approaching law in a “global context.”
With new courses on global legal systems and international law, students are now focusing on areas that “just weren’t important in 1890,” according to Law School professor Joseph W. Singer, who also helped design and teach the problem-solving course.
The curricular changes reflect a stronger emphasis on simulation-based learning, as students previously had not been exposed to such teaching methods until their second or third year, according to David Abrams, the program manager of the new problem-solving course.
In order to accommodate the new courses, the original lineup of 1L classes—including civil procedure, criminal law, and property law—lost one hour a week of lecture time per class, Vice-Dean for Academic Programming Andrew L. Kaufman ’51 said.
“The question you might ask is ‘why didn’t this happen earlier?’” Rakoff said.
BEING ‘A REAL LAWYER’
The problem-solving course, which was first taught to 1Ls during the winter semester, was met with warm approval from faculty at this week’s faculty meeting, where Singer and Rakoff presented a review of the course.
Minow said introducing the course in the first-year curriculum will hone teamwork and communication skills early on during students’ time at the Law School.
Even students who do not go on to practice law will find the course helpful, Minow said, as they will learn to “strategize and to bring an imagination to their work.”
Abrams added that the course may see minor adjustments, such as reducing course size from 80 students, despite its overall success.
Taught as a pilot to 2Ls and 3Ls last year, the course required students to come up with creative solutions to complex legal scenarios as well as practice interviewing or developing options for a client or negotiating and drafting contracts, Singer said.
“We’re not focusing on a particular legal issue, but rather how to help clients think through what their goals are and how to find a solution that works for everyone,” Singer said.
Several law schools have expressed interest in offering a similar course, and Rakoff said that Harvard Law School professors are discussing the possible creation of more advanced problem-solving courses for upper-level students to supplement their hands-on experience in the clinical program.
Though first-year students appreciated the change of pace and new approach to tackling legal issues, they questioned whether such problem-based learning could be expanded to upper-level courses.
Law School student Saish R. Setty said he would not choose an advanced problem-solving course over a clinical course offered to 2Ls and 3Ls.
“You’re not working with simulation [in clinical courses],” Setty said. “You’re working with real problems.”
First-year Marie Ndiaye described the new course as a “welcome joke,” citing that the workload was much lighter compared to her other courses, though she stopped short of discrediting it altogether.
“It’s not a complete sham,” Ndiaye said. “It was kind of like being a real lawyer.”
Though some faculty have raised concerns that the new problem-solving course marks a trend away from theory-based teaching, Minow noted that this class is “only one out of 20.”
Abrams agreed, adding that “it’s a disservice to train people for three years and not give them the tools they need to practice a profession.”
“We’re not even close to turning into a trade-school,” Abrams said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Admissions officers hoisted box after box of decision letters—2,110 acceptances and over 28,000 rejections and waitlist letters—into the back of a waiting mail truck yesterday, then celebrated the completion of this year’s first round of decisions.
A chain of about 30 admissions officers, staff, and students who work in the office passed the boxes of letters from the basement of the Cronkhite Center into the mail truck just before noon yesterday.
“That’s 28,000 broken hearts,” one member of the chain said nonchalantly, passing trays stuffed with rejections down the line.
Another staffer responded reassuringly, “There’s always graduate school.”
After applauding the loading of the final box and waving goodbye to the departing decision letters, the staff proceeded inside to celebrate.
While the admissions officers enjoyed cheese, crackers, and champagne (donated by a grateful alumnus), Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ‘67 toasted the newly admitted class—who would learn of their acceptance via email after 5 p.m. that evening—and extolled the admissions officers’ work.
He praised the increasing diversity in university applicant pools and urged the officers to continue to spread the message that Harvard is accessible to all talented students.
In reference to Harvard’s record-low acceptance rate of 6.9 percent this year, Fitzsimmons said, “That is a tough thing....Today it is a lot more difficult to get into all universities, but I think that is a great thing for America and frankly for the world. We’re using the talents of not just a small group of white, relatively rich men. It’s a great time.”
“In my generation a lot of these people would never even have thought about applying to college,” Fitzsimmons said.
Dwight D. Miller, who said that he has worked in the admissions office longer than any other officer, said that the largest change he has seen over his 42 years on the job is the increasing diversity of accepted students.
This diversification, he said, began with the merging of the Harvard and Radcliffe admissions processes in 1976, eight years after Miller came to Harvard.
The number of applications has skyrocketed as well—Miller says that there were 5,000 or fewer applicants for the 1,200 spots in the Class of 1972, the first year that he worked in the admissions office. This year, applications topped 30,000 for the first time.
The mood in the admissions office was jovial today, but Miller said that emotions often run high one step earlier in the process, at the final admissions committee meeting.
“We have to finally cut out so many kids, and we’re tired from working day and night,” he explained.
When an officer has made a personal connection with a student, perhaps on a recruiting trip, and that student is not accepted, Miller said, “that can be very hard on an admissions officer. I’ve seen tears in the committee room more than once.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 12, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 2 news article "Admissions Office Mails 2014 Decisions" incorrectly stated that a group of workers in the admissions office passed the boxes of letters from the "basement of Byerly Hall." In fact, the admissions office is located in the Cronkhite Center.

Although Harvard is not typically appreciated as the embodiment of athletic talent, a number of our competitors, both upper and underclassmen, have proven this year that our university has not only the brains but the brawn.
One can easily point out the names that have distinguished Harvard for athletic prowess: Colin West, J.P. O’Connor, Caroline Vloka, Andre Akpan, Laura Gemmell, and Jeremy Lin.
Colin West and Laura Gemmell both won national titles in men’s and women’s squash, respectively. Not only did they take home the most-coveted crowns but they displayed complete domination over their competition throughout their seasons. For West, his championship was the perfect end to a colored career; for the freshman Gemmell, hers was the ideal beginning.
Caroline Vloka, a sophomore, took the gold medal for the sabre only last weekend in the NCAA fencing tournament, besting a decade-long rival and propelling Harvard to a fifth place overall finish in competition.
Like West, senior JP O’Connor capped his wrestling career with the highest possible honor: an individual national championship in his weight class.
Finally, although senior stars Jeremy Lin and Andre Akpan didn’t bring a national title to their basketball and soccer teams, respectively, they did bring fans, excitement and national attention that had been lacking for so long.
Led by these talented athletes, a new view of Harvard may be emerging: one that displays not only academic excellence but athletic prowess. With the gold of their trophies and distinction of their careers, these Crimson competitors have put Harvard on the map in an entirely new fashion.

You can basically count the number of big Harvard sporting events on one hand, so when a highly anticipated game comes around, Harvard students jump on the opportunity to celebrate.
Tonight's men’s lacrosse game against Duke is one such event. As the No. 14 Crimson is getting ready to take on the No. 7 Blue Devils at 7 p.m., plenty of supporters will be getting ready to celebrate in the area surrounding Harvard Stadium.
There will be a large tailgate with free Redbones BBQ and Coca-Cola products for all of the Crimson fans, as well as quite a few smaller tailgates being put together by various groups on campus.
The current figurehead of Harvard sports enthusiasm, senior football player Cheng Ho, has been a huge part in spreading the word about tomorrow’s game. Ho helped to organize the Crimson crowd in hugely successful events at several of Harvard’s biggest basketball games this winter.
While Harvard’s policy about tailgating still holds strong (“Beer kegs and items that promote the rapid consumption of alcohol are not permitted at any University athletic function or event” and “grills using charcoal are prohibited within the athletic complex”), we have a feeling the Crimson crowd will still find a way to have a pretty good time.

After a month-long preseason slate that saw the Harvard softball team endure long plane flights, controversy over a newly-enforced pitching rule, and a 10-game losing streak, it’s finally time to really play ball.
This afternoon in Princeton, N.J., the Crimson (6-14) opens the Ivy season with a doubleheader against the Tigers (6-17) before heading to Cornell (12-7) for a two-game set tomorrow. First pitch is scheduled for 2 p.m. today and 12:30 p.m. tomorrow.
“We’re so pumped,” sophomore Whitney Shaw said. “There’s huge emotion, not only because it’s Ivies, but because of who we’re playing.”
This weekend represents not only the beginning of conference play, but also a chance for Harvard to see how it measures up to some of the Ancient Eight’s top squads.
Princeton won the Ivy title in 2008, while the Big Red took the crown in a dominating 2009 campaign. The Crimson proved it could compete with both squads last season—splitting a doubleheader with each and handing Cornell one of its three league losses—but a new season brings fresh faces and unique challenges.
For Harvard, the preseason slate brought tough competition and a number of losses, but that experience could prove crucial to the team as it prepares for the six-week conference marathon.
“Having a tougher preseason makes us realize that winning is not going to come easily,” sophomore Rachel Brown said. “That may have hurt us last season when we had a really successful preseason—we were kind of surprised when we weren’t winning as much as we had hoped. This preseason really got us in the mindset of making adjustments and fixing what we needed to to start winning.”
The Crimson was finally able to make those adjustments pay off on Sunday, when the team swept Fairfield in a road doubleheader that included a 10-run offensive outburst in the nightcap.
“Especially coming off of a long losing streak, we really needed something to prove to ourselves that we’re ready going into Ivies,” Shaw said. “[We needed] to just come out and hit the ball and remember that we still have a lot of power in our bats.”
Co-captain Melissa Schellberg led the charge last week, hitting .467 in four games and recording four RBI and two doubles. But Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, wasn’t alone, as the squad scored 21 runs last week, compared to just 28 in its first 16 games.
“Last weekend was a breakthrough weekend for us,” Brown said. “We realized that scoring a lot of runs is a lot more fun and makes it easier on ourselves.”
Keeping the offense going will be crucial this afternoon against a Tigers squad that relies on a pair of rookie pitchers, Alex Peyton and Lisa Kuhn, who boast ERAs of 3.97 and 4.20, respectively, this season.
The Princeton rotation is bolstered by senior Jamie Lettire, a former Ivy Player of the Year who has struggled to an 0-10 record and a 7.59 ERA this season.
But tomorrow in Ithaca, Harvard will have to rely on its pitching and defense to quiet one of the league’s most potent offenses in the Big Red.
Cornell senior Alyson Intihar, last year’s Ivy Player of the Year, hasn’t missed a beat in her final season. The infielder leads the Ancient Eight with a .435 batting average, and her classmate Elise Menaker has a league-high 20 RBI in 19 games.
“We know that Cornell hits really well,” Brown said. “We’ve all seen their stats, so we know going in what their strengths are, and they’re definitely formidable opponents. But we’re hoping we can string together the runs we need and really rely on our defense, which has been a strength for us.”
The Crimson will also have to rely on Brown, who has continued to carry the majority of the pitching burden in the follow-up to her Ivy Rookie of the Year campaign. The sophomore is third in the conference with a 1.86 ERA and has leads all Ivy pitchers with 86 strikeouts.
“We’ll definitely need to play our game, but when we have all three aspects of our game going, from pitching to defense to offense, we can pretty much play with anyone,” Shaw said.
Today, after thousands of miles traveled and months of anticipation since the disappointing end to last year’s Ivy season—Harvard finished a game out of first place in its division and missed the chance to play in the Ivy League Championship Series—the Crimson women are ready to prove that they belong back at the top of Ancient Eight softball.
“Our first Ivy weekend is always big, regardless of who we’re playing, but knowing that we’re playing two really good teams is going to be beneficial,” Brown said. “We’re going to come out really pumped up, really hungry for the wins. Playing Princeton and Cornell, we’re going to be really fired up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not long ago, the Harvard men’s volleyball team was looking for answers. Now the Crimson is leaving its opponents scratching their heads.
With a 3-1 victory over Newbury last night—Harvard’s third win in a row—the Crimson moved to 5-12 (3-1 EIVA Hay Divison) on the season. But this overall record is not indicative of the squad’s play of late.
Including the dominant 30-20, 30-25, 27-30, 30-22 win over the Nighthawks (22-13, 8-0 NECC), it has been nearly a month since Harvard dropped more than one set.
“Any win is a good win and we’ll take it any way we can get it,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “It probably wasn’t our sharpest match of the last three that we’ve won, but we were pretty solid all the way around.”
Harvard certainly appeared sharp early, as it opened the match at Newbury’s Hellenic College gymnasium with a crushing first set, topping the Nighthawks by 10 points. The offense in particular exploded due to the continued stellar play of co-captain Erik Kuld.
“Erik had a big night…Anytime the game got close he was there for us,” Baise said. “[Kuld] was hitting the ball real well.”
“I’m just feeling pretty good these days,” Kuld added. “Things are working out, and I’m just grateful to be healthy.”
The senior outside hitter had his fair share of opportunities to showcase his healthy arm, racking up game highs with 27 kills on 54 attempts. Sophomore Matt Jones added 22 winners of his own to pace the Crimson offense, all of which was orchestrated by another strong setting effort from rookie Rob Lothman, who dished out 51 assists.
“We’re definitely feeling very comfortable right now,” Kuld said. “We have seven guys who are playing together a lot and know each other well.”
The strong dynamic showed, as Harvard did not miss a beat despite the absence of co-captain Gil Weintraub. The senior sat out a second-straight game with a pulled groin, but the Crimson nonetheless cruised to a second-set victory, 30-25.
Not to be embarrassed on senior night, though, conference-leading Newbury rebounded in the third. Nighthawk senior Josh Aberly notched four kills in the game, consistently evading the Harvard blockers.
“Offensively we were quite strong most of the time, but we didn’t block as well as I would have liked,” Baise said,
Indeed, Harvard still managed to keep pace throughout the set, dropping the frame by a slim 30-27 margin.
It appeared that the home team was primed to continue its rally, as Newbury raced out to an early lead in the fourth as well. But with strong defense from Kuld—who had a team-high 14 digs on the night—and freshman Derek Jansma (12 digs), the Crimson held its ground. Bolstered by a number of timely kills from Jones, Harvard closed out the match without much of a threat from the Nighthawks, sealing the final set, 30-22. With yet another solid victory, the Crimson seemed to prove that its drastic shift in results is not a fluke, but rather a sign of genuine improvement.
“It’s a testament to the seniors and to the perseverance of this team [that we’ve had a turnaround],” Baise said. “We knew we could compete with just about everyone, it’s just taken us some time to fit everything together.”
Despite starting the year 0-11, Harvard does seem to be firing on all cylinders at the opportune time. Sitting in second place in the Hay division with four conference contests remaining, the Crimson has a very good chance at a playoff spot and perhaps even a division crown. While the squad may have began the year on uncertain ground, the men’s volleyball team is now certain that it controls its own destiny.
“If we win and do our job, we’ll find ourselves in a playoff spot,” Baise said. “If we let up, it will be close. It’s up to us right now.”
And with a 3-1 record already this season against the Hay opponents ahead on the schedule, Harvard has reason to be confident.
“If we come out [ready] to play, we can play with any team in the league,” Kuld said. “We’ve shown that, so we just have to go out and do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tonight under the lights at Harvard Stadium, the No. 14 Harvard men’s lacrosse team (5-2, 1-1 Ivy) looks to close out its non-league schedule and head into the remainder of Ivy League play with a win against perennial powerhouse No. 7 Duke.
To the Crimson, the contest represents much more than just another non-conference matchup—it’s a pivotal moment in the process of bringing the team to the forefront of the lacrosse world.
“When I took the job three years ago, I was really exited about the potential this program had,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “One of the visions I had was to try to make Harvard one of the flagship schools for lacrosse in New England.”
Standing in the way are the Blue Devils (7-3, 0-2 ACC), who aim to avenge last year’s upset at the hands of the Crimson—Duke’s first loss to Harvard since 2001.
“That’s last year,” Blue Devil coach John Danowski said. “You have to move on, and many times, losses help you.”
Although neither team is focusing on last season’s upset, both squads have had tonight’s game circled on their calendars all year.
“All semester, the kids were talking about how much the campus was abuzz about the Duke game, that people were excited,” Tillman said. “I think it’s really exciting for everyone around our program.”
The Blue Devils, coming off of a 11-10 win over Brown on Tuesday, now turn their full attention to the midseason test.
“Our focus right now is playing this very talented Harvard team,” Danowski said.
Tillman hopes that the historic venue and likely record-breaking crowd will make this game unlike any other in Harvard lacrosse history.
“When you walk into Harvard Stadium and play in a great venue like that, under the lights and in front of a terrific crowd, that’s going to present some motivation on both sides.”
The young Crimson team will need to focus on channelling its surplus of energy to compete with an experienced opponent like Duke.
“Everyone is going to be really excited,” said Harvard sophomore attack Jeff Cohen. “It’ll be really important for us to manage those emotions, use the excitement and [not] get nervous. Just play with passion and energy and be excited.”
Danowski, on the other hand, is confident that his team can handle the big stage.
“We’re used to playing in big stadiums,” Danowski said.  “This is something we look forward to; it adds a lot of excitement and a lot of fun to the game.”
Although the Blue Devils coaching staff might not have to worry about the big-game environment, it should certainly be distressed at the sight of Cohen on the opposing team.
Cohen, who began his collegiate career with a hat trick and an assist in last season’s 9-6 upset over Duke, has scored a point in every collegiate game he has played.
“I’ve seen an improvement in [Jeff’s] desire to be a complete attacker this year,” Tillman said. “He’s making the guys around him better.”
“I don’t know that you can stop Jeff,” Danowski said. “He’s already one of the great shooters in the history of the game as a sophomore.”
After Cohen’s performance against the Blue Devils last season, it’s not surprising that Danowski has so much respect for the sophomore, who leads his team this season with 19 goals, averaging almost three per game.
“He’s not good at what he does—he’s great at what he does. Before it’s all over, he’s going to rewrite some record books,” Danowski said.
Duke chose to make the trip to the Northeast this year rather than playing Harvard at home because n increasing number of the Blue Devil players grew up in the area. The game will be a homecoming of sorts for Duke All-American senior attack Max Quinzani, who hails from nearby Duxbury, Mass.  Many of his family and friends will be in attendance, and Duxbury High School’s lacrosse team will play a game at Harvard Stadium earlier in the day.
Although this game holds some special significance for the Blue Devils, Tillman recognizes how important this game is to the Harvard lacrosse program.
“To be able to [play lacrosse] Friday night in front of their peers and in front of a great crowd, in a great stadium and against a great opponent, what could be better?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard baseball had a good thing going, but as the rain stopped, so did the team’s three-game winning streak.
Playing in a game that was originally scheduled for Wednesday night, but was delayed due to weather and poor field conditions, the Crimson (6-12) lost in a blowout, 14-1, to Holy Cross (9-8) in Worcester, Mass., last night.
“It was a tough loss, and we never like losing like that,” captain Tyler Albright said. “It’s just frustrating.”
Harvard’s offense struggled for most of the night, kept hitless until the top of the fifth inning.
Meanwhile, the Crusaders’ batters went through a total of eight Crimson pitchers on their way to the team’s fifth win in a row.
“As far as pitching goes, we really wanted to get some guys out there and get them some experience,” Albright said. “It’s just unfortunate that we weren’t able to put all of the pieces together.”
Harvard’s pitchers ran into trouble throughout the game by getting behind in the count. It started early with senior Jonathan Strangio walking the Holy Cross lineup’s first three batters.
The Crusaders’ cleanup hitter, junior Nick Ciardiello, came to the plate and knocked a double to right center, scoring all three base runners.
Ciardiello’s bat had been a major factor in Holy Cross’ recent wins and made an appreciable impact last night with three hits and four RBI. When he scored a run of his own later in the inning, Ciariello put his team up 4-0, still with no outs in the bottom of the first.
Junior Zach Hofeld then came to the mound for the Crimson and was able to strike out one batter before the end of the frame.
Harvard’s offensive drought lasted through the next few innings, while the Crusaders continued to build up their lead, scoring two more runs off a double by senior Brendan McCrea in the bottom of the third.
“[Holy Cross] is a good ball club, and they could really swing the bats,” sophomore Jeff Reynolds said.
The Crimson finally got in on the action when Reynolds hit a line-drive double to center field in the top of the fifth.
But after advancing to third on a wild pitch by the Crusaders’ John Colella, Reynolds was left stranded.
Holy Cross knocked down Harvard’s hopes even further in the sixth inning when, despite Crimson freshmen Robert Wineski and Zach Olson’s efforts on the mound, the Crusaders put together one homer, nine hits, and seven more runs.
“They were just having to throw way too many pitches,” Albright said of Harvard’s rookie hurlers.
The Crimson brought in a batch of new players in the bottom of seventh, including another freshman pitcher, Matt Doyle, but Holy Cross managed to get one more run, bringing the score to 14-0.
In the game’s last frame, a pair of doubles by freshman Danny Moskovits and junior Cole Arledge gave Harvard its first run of the night. A wild pitch, a walk, and a catcher’s interference call loaded the bases, but the rest of the Crimson offense couldn’t capitalize, leaving Arledge and sophomores Jon Smart and J.T. Tomes on base.
Though the loss was Harvard’s most lopsided of the season, the team will maintain a positive attitude going into its next two games this Saturday.
“We’re very confident that we can take Princeton,” Albright said.
The doubleheader will be the Crimson’s first chance to take on a conference opponent and establish itself as a serious threat in the Ivy League.
“Hopefully we can win a bunch of [conference] games, get a championship and head to a regional,” Reynolds said. “That’s still the goal, and that goal’s still very attainable.”

Currier House now has a swimming pool.
If you're suspicious that this is a late April Fool's joke, you're only halfway right. As torrents of rain came down on Cambridge during the past month, Currier was forced to close down both its dance studio and the Treehouse due to flooding.
In an e-mail to Currierwire on Wednesday, Currier House Administrator Patricia G. Pepper told residents that the Dance Studio will be closed for the rest of the year, and the Treehouse will be closed until further notice.
Pepper said that there is water under the floors of both rooms, and despite wet-vacuuming efforts made by the custodial staff, the Treehouse and Dance Studio still look more like swimming pools than they should.
Jena N. Mills '11, director of Expressions, said that the dance company normally holds weekly rehearsals in the studio, but they are currently meeting elsewhere because of the flooding.
According to Pepper, yoga classes—formerly held in the Dance Studio—will resume on Monday and have been moved to the Mousehole, another oddly named room in Currier. Dancers who usually rehearse in the Dance Studio can contact Pepper to have their rehearsals moved there as well.
Don't worry Quad; you're not alone. It looks like the river was affected too. Thankfully the sun is beginning to shine, and spring is in the air. Forget the river Gods. Let's all start praying to the weather Gods for the sake of our nearly translucent skin and severe vitamin-D deficiencies.

At 5 p.m. yesterday, about 30,000 high school seniors had an e-mail from the Harvard College admissions office arrive in their inbox. Of those 30,000 or so students, only 2,110 were lucky enough to be accepted to Harvard. And of those 2,110, only 5 were lucky enough to be interviewed by FlyBy just hours later. Here are their stories.
When Randi B. Michel of Cleveland, Ohio learned she had been admitted she was speechless. “I had to show the e-mail to my parents instead of saying anything,” she said.
Ralphie A. Haro, a student body president from Miami, was at a friend’s house when he looked at his phone and saw that the e-mail had arrived. When he told his friend he was too scared to open it, his pal went into the next room, opened the e-mail for him, and announced that he had been admitted.
Although Haro was also accepted at Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, Duke, and University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, he said he is “90 percent sure” that he will come to Harvard.
Amanda R. Rodrigues of Monroe, CT, is even more certain that she’s coming to Cambridge for the next four years. “Obviously I know I’m going to Harvard,” she gushed. “My parents are sending in the check tomorrow. We’re going to visit on Saturday.”
“I just love the environment” at Harvard, she said. “Everyone is so different and so good at something. When I stepped on campus I just got this feeling that all I wanted was to be at this school.”
Daniel B. Cooney of Westchester, NY, was attracted by the surrounding area as well as the campus. “Boston is great. It’s the best place to go to college in the world,” Cooney said.
Another new admit said Harvard’s ballet company drew her here.
“One of the reasons I applied is that your ballet company is so sick. It’s amazing. I definitely want to be a part of that,” said Paula M. Maouyo, a Baltimore native who plans to study linguistics and Romance languages. “All your dancers are fierce.”
Echoing a grievance raised by many Harvard admits before her, Maouyo gently complained, “The first paragraph [of the admissions e-mail] failed to mention the word accepted. It said ‘we offer you a place in the Harvard Class of 2014.’ I reread it, like, five times.”
Nikhil R. Mulani of Lake Forest, Ill., agreed. “I thought I must have misread the e-mail,” he said. “So I read it again.”
Mulani, who serves as Governor of the Midwestern Region in the Junior State of America program and wishes to study classics and computer science, says he will be choosing between University of Chicago, New York University, Williams, and Harvard.

Chances are that you’ve heard the names of famous people who graduated from Harvard. But what about the ones who never made it past the admissions process?
Harvard rejected the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, who ended up going to New Haven Community College/bulldog animal shelter. While running for President isn’t so bad, maybe if he had gone to Harvard he wouldn’t have lost.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Meredith Vieira, a host on the “The Today Show," was apparently so shaken by her rejection from Harvard that she visited every Saturday in some sort of holy voyage. It wouldn’t be the first time someone visited Harvard; maybe she just really wanted to rub John Harvard’s foot. But despite enrolling at Tufts University, things seem to have worked out all right for her.
Even though Unofficial Tour guides might tell you that only the Catholic Church and Bill H. Gates, class of 1977, have more money than Harvard does, Warren E. Buffett certainly isn’t doing too badly. Buffet, the third richest man in the world according to Forbes’ rankings, was once upon a time denied entrance to the Harvard Business School.
So, rejects from Harvard’s class of 2014, rejoice! Your rejection letter might be putting you on the path to fame and fortune. And for those who don’t believe us, well, hopefully you are on the waitlist.

Norman K. Mailer '43 was overweight and slightly balding when he met Carole Mallory, the woman who would become his mistress for nine years. But, she tells us, he definitely had a mouth worth kissing. Need more details? Mallory's new memoir, Loving   Mailer tells all.
During Mailer's last marriage, he  began an  affair with Mallory, an aspiring writer and former  supermodel and actress. Mallory told us in a recent phone interview that Mailer  was a magnificent lover when it came to the bedroom. “His lips were magic," she said.
Mallory’s memoir, due to be  published this month, chronicles the  relationship  between Mailer and Mallory, moving from their deepest bedtime  secrets  to their mentor-muse literary bonds.
The book, however, begins with a prologue about making love with Warren Beatty. “I wanted to have sex with Warren Beatty to  forget," Mallory writes.
She then chronicles the sexcapade of  the night, beginning with a steamy 30-block make-out session in  the back of a New York City cab, followed by an orgasmic episode on  a swiveling barstool, an equally-orgasmic scene on her apartment table,  and finally sex in the bedroom, cowgirl-style.
But the prologue ends on a slightly different  note. Despite the great sex, Mallory wasn’t looking to love someone  like Beatty. She wanted something more.
“I longed for a relationship where  we would stimulate each other intellectually. I longed for a love affair   with a genius,” she writes.
Mailer was that man. A great writer  and lover, Mailer was able to bring the spoken word into the  bedroom. “In the beginning we spoke with our  bodies. In the end we spoke with our minds,” Mallory told us.
In Loving Mailer, Mallory  exposes  all sides of the famous author, including the darker aspects. “He  lived a life of a practicing alcoholic and was surrounded by enablers,  people who wanted approval and would give him a drink or drag him to  a party,” Mallory said.
After Mailer broke up with Mallory  in 1991, she realized that she needed to write about their relationship.
"I wanted to offer my experiences with Norman, my knowledge  of him beyond the literary personality, and my journey from a woman  who had been focused on the externals of life to a woman who became  focused on the interior realities and the life of the written word," Mallory wrote to us in an e-mail.
Mallory finished the memoir after  Mailer’s death in 2007. What would he say if he could read it now? “If he were living he wouldn’t like it. Now that he’s  deadI think he’d love it,” Mallory said with a laugh.

Recently, a novelty e-mail account flame war broke out on Pfoho's open list after Sigmund Freud invited subscribers to "bring it  like the cheerleaders in that terrible teen movie." Later, Elizabeth I  and Mary I accused each other of heresy and papism before Henry VIII  stepped in to claim England's throne for Edward VI. In response, God  accused these "royal buffoons" of fraud, Friedrich Nietzsche announced,  "God is dead," and many readers were left wondering "what the pfuck is  going on?"
Pfopen subscribers received an e-mail from an account  registered under the alias "Sigmund Freud" complaining of e-mails  containing "a great deal of tribulation over the most insignificant of  issues" and inviting them to "create [their] own novelty accounts and  post in this thread as an acceptable means of venting [their] psychic  and sexual frustrations upon each other."
Freud's e-mail sparked a  flurry of responses from novelty other email accounts registered under names  such as Mary I, Elizabeth I, Henry VIII, Master Yoda, God Almighty,  Friedrich Nietzsche, and Pfranklin D. Roosevelt.
At one point in the thread, God  Almighty responded to the quarreling Tudors by chastising  them for claiming his Pfavor. God added, "I have only ordained one  Earthly ruler in the existence of Creation and his name was George W.  Bush."
Later, Pfopen subscribers accused Nietzsche of conducting a secret  relationship with Freud. Freud denied the rumors, but Nietzsche asserted  in an e-mail addressed to Freud (and sent over Pfopen) that "we went  beyond good and evil when you showed me your will to power, which had an  eternal return. You'll always be my Over-man."
In a subsequent  (and fairly unrelated post), Pfranklin D. Roosevelt reminded subscribers  that "the only thing we have to pfear is pfear itself."
We wanted to get the bottom of this Pfopen Pfunny business, but  most Pfaux historical personalities were unwilling to submit to an  interview. The mastermind behind Nietzsche, however, agreed to talk via Gchat so as not to out him/herself.
In  the interview, Nietzsche refused to shed much light on his relationship  with Freud because "gentlemen don't kiss and tell..." He did, however,  note, "suffice it to say, his will to power was indeed strong, VERY  strong."
When asked how God could have e-mailed Pfopen if he was,  in fact, dead, Nietzsche responded, "We've probably regressed, science  and secularization killed him, negate that, ergo we have resurrected  him, what we need is more nihilism."
Nietzsche also strongly  believes that this sort of discourse is important to Pfopen as it "is  uniquely endowed with an enlightened readership (notwithstanding God's  presence) and tight house spirit."
