After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard could be prevented from enforcing its sanctions on members of single-gender social groups under a measure included in amended legislation proposed by Republicans in the United States House of Representatives.
The proposal, an amendment included in legislation to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, would ban schools that have “a policy allowing for the official recognition of a single-sex student organizations” from imposing penalties on members of the groups. Because Harvard does not have a policy officially recognizing final clubs and Greek organizations, it remains unclear if the legislation—still subject to change—would apply to Harvard.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Melodie Jackson wrote that Harvard is "monitoring" the higher education bill, though she made no mention of the social group provision, instead pointing to proposed changes in the federal student aid program.
Representative Elise Stefanik ’06, a New York Republican and a Harvard alumna, has been pushing the amendment, according to a staffer for a Republican on the committee. Stefanik—through a spokesperson—said she has been working on this legislation with colleagues for several months.
"Congresswoman Stefanik believes all schools should respect students' right to freely associate," Stefanik's communications director Tom Flanagin wrote in an emailed statement Monday evening. "This amendment is not specific to Harvard and will protect Constitutional liberties across the country."
Flanagin wrote that, though Stefanik was not herself a member of a single-gender social group while at the College, she understands the "value of single sex organizations" and helped cofound the Women's Initiative in Leadership at the Institute of Politics while an undergraduate. A former Crimson editorial writer, Stefanik is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.
The College’s social group penalties bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations on campus from student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships. Faust first announced the sanctions in May 2016—but the policy was immediately plunged into more than a year of controversy and turmoil as students and faculty alike protested the penalties.
Representative Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who offered the amendment, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening. More than a dozen Republican lawmakers on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce—which is reviewing the legislation—also did not immediately respond to questions about whether the legislation was targeted at or would apply toward the College’s policy.
The proposal comes less than a week after the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—voted to penalize members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations. The language of the amendment, in part, echoes the College’s chosen policy: Under the proposal, subject schools would be barred from denying letters of recommendation, team captaincies, or student organization leadership positions to members of single-gender social groups.

The proposal also forbids subject schools for taking further “adverse action” against members of single-gender clubs, including withholding financial aid, restricting access to on-campus housing, or taking other punitive measures. Harvard’s policy does not currently include these measures.
Faust and Lee announced the Corporation’s decision to stick with the May 2016 penalties in a letter to Harvard affiliates Dec. 5.
“We cannot ignore the responsibility we bear in relationship to our students’ experience in these settings and their effect on the broader community,” Faust and Lee wrote in the letter. “The USGSOs have a very different relationship to the campus than was the case a generation ago, and it cannot be seriously disputed that the overall impact is negative.”
The House committee will meet Tuesday to mark up the bill, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several property owners contend that a letter sent by Raj Dhanda, owner of the Crimson Galeria, to Cambridge officials falsely touted their support for Dhanda’s attempt to prevent the opening of a local medical marijuana dispensary.
In the letter to Cambridge mayor E. Denise Simmons, Dhanda wrote that he “communicated with several major property owners in Harvard Square and “they are all opposed to the proposed Marijuana Dispensary at 98 Winthrop Street.”  The letter mentions Harvard Square property owners Gerald L. Chan, Peter Palandjian ’87, Eric D. Schlager, and Richard L. Friedman.
But Palandjian, Friedman, and Schlager have all recently said that they in fact did not oppose the opening of Healthy Pharms, the marijuana dispensary, and did not wish to be included in Dhanda’s letter.
“He did communicate with me. I told him clearly I was NOT willing to join him in opposing it,” wrote Palandjian, who owns multiple properties in the Square including buildings housing Qdoba and Tatte.
Friedman, the president and CEO of Carpenter & Company, Inc—which developed businesses like the Charles Hotel—wrote in an emailed statement that he talked on the phone with Dhanda, but that he never consented to have his name in the letter. “I never authorised my name to be used in an objection and factually I have no opinion on the use contemplated,” Friedman wrote.
And Schlager, the CEO of real estate investment firm The Bulfinch Company, also said he vaguely remembered a phone call with Dhanda. “These conversations were private and we were not expecting to be characterized in a public way and honestly I don’t recall precisely what was said at that time,” he said, adding that his company had not taken a stance on the dispensary.
Peter Mancusi, a member of the communications firm representing Dhanda in the lawsuit, disputed that his client misrepresented the business owners’ responses.
“Raj Dhanda has deep respect for his fellow real estate entrepreneurs in Cambridge. The January letter was written in good faith based on conversations at the time and well before a lawsuit was even contemplated,” Mancusi wrote in an emailed statement.
“What other developers decide to do with respect to the marijuana dispensary proposed for Harvard Square is within their discretion,” he added. “Mr. Dhanda is undertaking this litigation to protect the value of his properties, and will pursue his claims to the fullest extent of the law.”
Chan and Simmons could not be reached for comment.
Palandjian said he has since emailed Dhanda, demanding that he retract the letter and issue a clarification to his original statement.
Dhanda, through his communication firm, refused to say whether or not he would do so.

The “Mather is ugly” roast is pretty low-hanging fruit amongst undergrads at the College. The library, however, is lowkey pretty nice. The cozy two-storied chamber of knowledge is armed with a computer lab of Macs and PCs, color printing, and spinny chairs that entertain me while I contemplate how I’m going to salvage a C- in Hebrew Bible. Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Sociability: The actual library is teeming with desks both large and small scattered throughout little nooks around the building, making it a perfect place to get focused group work done or to put your headphones in and bang out papers in solitude until the wee hours of the morning. It is one of the rare places on campus that is completely quiet.
Crowds: Given that it is a little far from Yard-centered activities, there are seldom actually people in the Mather Library. Your only competition for seats are other Mather residents, who typically work in the dining hall or side study rooms.
Ambiance: The actual feel of the library somehow is always warm, which is fascinating because Mather has some of the coldest architecture I’ve ever seen. The carpets, cushioned seats, and stacks of outdated Zoobooks and Sports Illustrateds provide a nostalgic, homey feeling to the concrete chamber of knowledge. If you’ve convinced yourself that natural lighting somehow makes you study better, take a seat by the windows lining the courtyard. Watch the leaves blow and unofficial house canine mascots June, Steve, and Laika run around and live far less stressed lives than you.
Amenities: There isn’t a whole lot going on in this library, but it is a few steps away from the Mather dining hall, which always has sandwich-making array, four cereal options, and juice/milk/soda machines loaded for Brain Break (starting at 9 PM). Plus, Mather is right by Louie’s, so if you need a late night 30-rack to get you through exam prep, acquiring one won’t be a problem for you.
If you somehow find yourself seven counties away and in the Mather House courtyard, we highly recommend that you take some time to hastily submit your discussion posts from the Mather Library. It’s cozy as heck, and no one will walk in on you napping in the corners because few people venture as far to Mather as it is.

We know you Riverhouse folk can’t go more than 5 minutes without sh*tting on the Quad, but hear us out. Cabot D-Hall is actually a pretty great place to study.
There are smaller rooms you can sit in if you need to, but past 8 p.m. Cabot D-Hall isn’t really poppin’. Yeah, there are some groups of people studying/watching Netflix/chatting quietly, but it’s not super busy. Yours truly had a table all to herself. Granted, during reading period/midterms/exams, this probably won’t last. But from 8:30 p.m.-3 a.m., it’s a mostly quiet place to work. And they have food.
Speaking of food, @frosh, there’s no swipe, so you can just waltz on in and have the usual selection of bagels and bread, or you can get fancy and have some pita bread, hummus, or whatever else they have out without having to worry about being turned away.
My favorite part about Cabot D-Hall? How bright and cheery it was. People were genuinely excited to bump into each other (no, not literally, no one is ever literally excited to bump into someone in a d-hall… unless it’s your crush ;) ). Also, two people dropped off about a dozen cupcakes and just left them. Someone else brought half a bundt cake. Cabot is a place of shared food. Perfect for moochers.
So here’s the skinny of it. Cabot D-Hall has a lot of pep (see: Dean Khurana hosted a Christmas tree decorating party for the tree in the D-Hall*), but is actually a pretty nice place to study. Just beware: your butt will go numb after sitting on the wooden chairs for a few hours, and there is a vacuum that will come around midnight and make noise that will devour the world.
*Please note: Christmas decorations not included year-round
