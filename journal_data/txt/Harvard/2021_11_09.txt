You may wonder what can go wrong in a suburban Northern Californian town — however, when newlyweds Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) and Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti) move in, it is no surprise that the resulting drama will be well worth the two-year wait for Season Three of “You.” Viewers should strap in and get ready for a season filled with Joe’s predictable violence paired with Love’s frustratingly self-destructive willingness to hit characters with blunt objects.
While falling out of love with his wife in their new home in Madre Linda, Joe preys on yet another woman that has caught his eye: his neighbor Natalie Engler (Michaela McManus). However, Season Three breaks from the typical “You” arc of Joe stalking his obsession for the entire season: Natalie lasts all but one episode before Love can get rid of the competition.
In the new season, viewers now have to juggle the emotions and killing sprees of two murderers, and it works in the show’s favor. Joe’s obsessions become bland and predictable as the season progresses, but the deepening portrayal of Love’s character provides the exciting mystery that audiences have come to love from the series. Love struggles not just with the expected troubles of suburban life but also conforming to the mold of her marriage and of womanhood — all while maintaining her status as Joe’s primary enemy in the show and a murderer herself. This is what makes Love the scary figure in the season — she is unpredictable. While the series previously focused on a nearly overdone view of Joe planning out his actions, Love has a spontaneous, vicious spirit that allows much of her violence to unexpectedly spring upon viewers.
Similar to Season Two, Joe is thrown into a new and unfamiliar environment that successfully switches the pace of the show. The setting of Season Three draws parallels to visions of destructive suburbia from films such as “Vivarium,” illustrating that, for Joe, the suffocating nature of the suburbs entraps him in a prison-like marriage. The claustrophobic atmosphere of this proverbial prison adds more depth to the show’s main theme of Joe trapping others in, as he finds himself in an inescapable situation for the first time.
In an MTV interview, Pedretti spoke about the dynamics of a married woman trying to fit within the confines of suburban womanhood, and how Love turns to violence to cope.
“She's really ready to lose her mind, and it's this little respite that allows her to build up her ego and her sense of value,” she said. As Love’s characterization becomes more complex, the show offers a unique take on suburban sexism, moving away from basic, stereotypical depictions of suburban idyll to show how Love turns to extreme violence to find her own value as a woman and mother.
The season reaches a fever pitch in one of the series’ most dramatic moments, when Love screams at Joe, “Why don’t you love me anymore?” in the pouring rain. This visibly dark scene brilliantly illuminates Love’s psychology, showing the roots of her insecurities. By placing Love in a high-risk scenario where she and Joe must find a place to bury Natalie’s body, the show does a great job of showing how impactful her neglectful husband’s behavior — combined with Love’s own insecurities as a wife — has been on Love’s sense of worth. “You” Season Three directly hits at these themes of value and insecurity within marriage that other shows seem to gloss over, and it is refreshing to see this raw, realistic struggle unfold.
This season also sees a delivery change that fits well with the unnatural setting: Joe speaks mainly in conversation with other characters, in contrast to the way his ominous private thoughts dominated the narrative in past seasons. Joe speaks the most with Love, tearing him out of the scheming world of stalking in his mind and into the present with his wife.
In contrast with the scenes of superficial suburban couples that add a sense of normalcy to the season, scenes of Love’s spontaneous killings occur at an unexpectedly fast pace. This distinction between the slow, boring nature of their town and the quick cycle of Love lashing out highlights Love’s inability to fit into the life she always wanted: a normal marriage with a loving husband. From her initiating an extramarital affair to murdering two people at the beginning of the season, Love quickly becomes the villain of “You.” The season flips the “enemies to lovers” film trope, giving watchers whiplash as Love becomes Joe’s rival. Furthermore, Joe shifts from fully focusing on his next obsession to saving his son from Love’s violence, adding a compelling additional dimension to his characterization.
While flashbacks are typically overused as a strategy to give backstory, the creators of “You” use them thoughtfully and sparingly to portray Joe’s tendencies to flee from potential abandonment and obsessively protect damaged women. In turn, Joe is fearful when he learns that Love has given birth to a boy, rather than a girl as they expected. Instead of being a daughter he can protect, his son Henry becomes a representation of Joe as a child, whom he now must prevent from turning into someone like himself. The visual style of the flashbacks— showing hazy, confusing black-and-white scenes from Joe’s childhood — adds to Joe’s depth and explains why his past is so puzzling to viewers and himself.
Joe’s inability to handle the rejection of someone he loves is simple: Joe fears being abandoned. And he will do anything to not abandon his child — even if that means remaining married to a serial murderer. Joe’s dedication to providing for his son powers the plot, building Joe’s image among viewers as the story’s “hero,” protecting his child from Love.
Much to the delight of “You” fans, Season Four was confirmed within days of the release of Season Three. With the full-circle conclusion of the season focused on Joe — now known as Nick — in search of his new obsession Marriane (Tati Gabrielle) in Paris, “You” has yet again promised viewers another season of Joe searching for his soulmate. What can go wrong this time?

In his latest single, “Telepath,” Conan Gray would like listeners to know that he sees it all in his latest single, One of four singles he has released this year, “Telepath” explores the continued, “old news,” and “reused” patterns of an old lover sliding back into the narrator’s life, and Gray sees through them. Although Gray seems exasperated and confused, the single seemingly contradicts this emotional rollercoaster with the energy and danceability of a disco-pop single. The musicality and rhythm of the single reflect a relatively newer side to Gray’s music, something that listeners may anticipate as a preview to his upcoming album.
As the song begins, a synth beat establishes itself for a few seconds until Gray’s iconic voice, breathy yet crystal clear, hits with the first lyrics: “Don’t even finish that sentence, babe.” The song’s first verse continues with the same beat behind Gray’s voice and the melody continues until listeners reach, arguably, the catchiest part of the song: the pre-chorus.
“God, it’s just so you, you’re just so predictable,” Gray bemoans, but this pre-chorus is anything but. Here, listeners fall deeper into the mentality that Gray is trying to capture with the meaning of the song. With the syncopated lyrics hitting offbeats of the accompaniment, those few lines of the song pop out even more to listeners. No wonder Gray chose to promote his song on TikTok by making videos to audio of just the pre-chorus.
But the catchiness of the song in general owes a fair amount to other musical eras. Its groovy and whimsical tone, musical nuances, and consistent rhythm are reminiscent of songs like “Take On Me” by a-ha or “Don’t You Want Me” by The Human League. The sounds that he’s created and produced in “Telepath” evoke recycled tones from these classic ’80s tunes, but translated for 21st-century teens and young adults, with lyrics that speak to that audience. This release is very much in line with current pop trends that seem to signal a larger global callback to the disco era, like Dua Lipa’s 2020 album “Future Nostalgia,” Doja Cat’s single “Say So,” or BTS’ global hit “Dynamite.”
In an interview with NME about his upcoming album, Gray said, “...as any human being, I experience a giant myriad of emotions” and that in anticipation of the album, people should “expect the full range of human emotion out of me.” Gray has cultivated an image and brand for himself as the writer of sad, soft, and slow hits with songs like “Heather,” “Lookalike,” “Comfort Crowd,” and “Crush Culture. With the release of “Telepath,” Gray has shown his listeners and fans that those emotional compositions are not the only range he can work within. Listeners may look towards Gray’s future with hope and anticipation, but also with a certain degree of caution. Hopefully, the singer-songwriter’s current shift to high-tempo, high-energy works isn’t necessarily a sign that he’s lost his identity as a uniquely soulful artist among the high-profile releases that follow a trendy schema of throwback sounds.

“To say it was anyone’s fault / would be to not understand / the headwind that every love faces.”
Such is a typical line drawn from award-winning poet Andrea Gibson’s newest collection, “You Better Be Lightning,” (set to be released on Nov. 9). In these 38 poems, Gibson puts some of their most emotionally-charged personal experiences on the page, all in the exploration of what it means to love in the modern world. The result is a work that shows Gibson to be one of today’s premier poets, capable of moving readers through scenes of what life — and love — is actually like in the real world. In short, it is a collection that readers of contemporary poetry will not want to miss.
In “You Better Be Lightning,” Gibson is about as open as a poet can be. Their poems are deeply personal, touching on everything from their elation at finding love to the pain of the ensuing breakup to their thoughts of depression and suicide. Gibson’s queer identity — and the struggles that have come with it — also features proudly and prominently in the text, as Gibson attempts to be a beacon of hope for readers dealing with similar struggles. Though not every poem in “You Better Be Lightning” is upbeat, the collection itself is still enjoyable to read. Gibson’s focus on love — and its power as a force of hope and inspiration through thick and thin — is crucial to this end.
On the whole, Gibson’s poetry in “You Better Be Lightning” is casual but evocative. They paint powerful pictures of the entire spectrum of human emotion with modern language and a colloquial tone that is easy to read. Gibson also makes their thoughts accessible by illustrating them with details such as “I beg every light green on my way to her house,” and “she left her red sock / in your white laundry” — drawn from the familiarity of everyday life. They also steer clear of being too cryptic without being shallow in meaning: One can choose to read “You Better Be Lightning” both for surface-level meaning or for deeper insights and enjoy Gibson’s work either way.
It is also clear that the poems in “You Better Be Lightning” are meant to be read aloud and even delivered by Gibson themself, who is known for their recitations and spoken word performances. Although reading these poems on the page is not the same experience, the way in which Gibson structures and formats their poems allows the independent reader to experience some of the thrill of hearing them in person. Spacing and indentation play a pivotal role in “You Better Be Lightning” allowing the reader to understand how Gibson would have read their poems aloud, and even perhaps hear the faint traces of their voice.
All in all, “You Better Be Lightning” is a gem of contemporary poetry: It is touching and moving, yet grounded in reality. As such, it deserves all the attention it can get.

Bernard Haitink is dead. And Nathalie Stutzmann is in. A desultory reader of music news would be surprised to see two major headlines about orchestral conductors within a week of each other. The suggestive timing of Stutzmann’s new job and Haitink’s death, however, cannot be ignored.
Haitink, a Dutch master conductor, passed away at the age of 92 on Oct. 21 in London. He was known for a long tenure at the helm of the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, considered the most prestigious orchestra in the world, between 1961 and 1988, alongside the philharmonics of Berlin and Vienna, both of which he guest conducted on several occasions. In his later years, he was principal guest conductor of the Boston Symphony between 1995 and 2004 and principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony from 2006 to 2010. These, plus engagements with the London Symphony, the London Philharmonic, and several others, made his figure ubiquitous across Western Europe and the United States.
His death made waves around the classical music world, with tributes pouring in from both sides of the Atlantic. He was a “gentle giant,” known for his reserved style of conducting and rejecting the image of fiery conductor-impresario that others embraced. His extensive recordings consistently hold their own against newer ones, and his effect on Dutch, British, and American orchestras astounded audiences for decades.
Stutzmann, 56, is a French conductor and contralto who most recently made news as principal guest conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra since 2020. Then on Oct. 13, she was named the next music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. News outlets hailed the announcement as “groundbreaking,” and “making history.” A New York Times headline read, “A Female Conductor Joins the Ranks of Top U.S. Orchestras.”
The first woman to lead a major U.S. orchestra was Marin Alsop, who in 2007 was appointed to the Baltimore Symphony, a position she left earlier this year. Others argue that title should have gone to JoAnn Falletta, the music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic since 1998. In any case, Stutzmann will join a very select group of women on the podium in the U.S., and the press has generally called her the second woman conductor of a premier U.S. orchestra.
While the headlines about Stutzmann and Haitink seem unrelated, what they both point to is that the turn of the century in classical music is happening just now. Haitink was a decidedly twentieth-century figure who made landmark recordings of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Mahler worth their weight in gold. Anyone looking for something new, however, would not have found it in Haitink’s discography.
Stutzmann’s ascension, however, helps usher in the twenty-first century. The Atlanta Symphony grew immensely under the 20-year tenure of Stutzmann’s predecessor Robert Spano, who specialized in commissioning, performing, and recording new works by American composers. Stutzmann has promised to continue that tradition, while also bringing her specialties — French music and Baroque styles — to the orchestra. The Baroque as “new” may raise eyebrows, but in fact this music for decades has been displaced by increased Romantic programming in major orchestras’ repertoires. Stutzmann’s reintroduction of the Baroque, while certainly not new music, comes as something novel for many audiences.
Classical music moves notoriously slowly. It is a field where antique pieces like Stravinsky’s 1913 “The Rite of Spring” are often still called “modern.” It is a field where there is almost complete stagnancy in the racial makeup of orchestras and their staffs. It is a field where many thought the 2017 #MeToo takedowns of conductors James Levine, Charles Dutoit, and Daniele Gatti would be a turning point, only to see the aging Dutoit and Gatti back on European podiums mere months later (Levine died earlier this year).
Women were only allowed to join orchestras embarrassingly recently, and as the clamor over Stutzmann’s position shows, a woman conductor is still something newsworthy. Female composers have also struggled to break into orchestral repertoire; for decades, bygone figures like Fanny Mendelssohn-Hensel, Clara Schumann, and Amy Beach were tokenized as the “female composers.” Only in the past few years has there been genuine attention to the engaging works of Florence Price, Betsy Jolas, Joan Tower, Missy Mazzoli, and others.
Changes in the concert hall are difficult when the main attractions are the 19th-century European warhorses we’ve been taught to love. Nathalie Stutzmann is for now the face of progress. Only time will tell if this is truly a turning point, or if orchestras will continue their conservation of old times. Haitink and his peers were the safe choice for decades, but that generation’s final bow will force the philharmonics of America to turn their clocks forward — to Stutzmann and beyond.
The last Haitink/Stutzmann article was in 2003, when Haitink, then 74, and the Boston Symphony performed Debussy’s opera Pelléas and Mélisande at Carnegie Hall, with contralto Stutzmann, then 38, as Geneviève. Almost twenty years later, we begin to enter the middle of the twenty-first century. When will orchestras finally leave the twentieth?

Last month, OnlyFans found an unexpected client at its doorstep: the Vienna Tourist Board. After its posts of nude artwork were banned from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, the Vienna Tourist Board turned to the social platforms’ X-rated counterpart. Now, the cultural hub and capital of Austria is finally able to make its magnificent selection of Egon Schiele, Richard Gerstl, Koloman Moser and Amedeo Modigliani works available to the public. These are only some of the artists the museums teased on their website and in a cheeky promo video in September, titled “Vienna Strips on OnlyFans.” This bold move — now operating under the slogan “Vienna laid bare” — is the latest cause célèbre in the art world, rekindling the discussion on the ethics and extent of art censorship.
In the eyes of Facebook, Vienna is a recidivist. In 2018, the platform removed a post from Vienna’s Natural History Museum containing an image of the “Venus of Willendorf,” one of the world’s oldest symbols of motherhood and fertility. It may have survived 30,000 years of human history, but evidently, it couldn't survive Facebook;s nudity policy. To the social media behemoth, a piece of art cherished in the Stone Age is far too daring. Vienna isn’t the first victim of social media’s draconic censorship of sexual depictions in art, either. From banning medieval illuminated manuscripts to censoring a pop art painting of a woman licking an ice cream, Facebook has had a less-than-ideal history with suggestive art. If the state of art didn’t already seem Orwellian enough, consider that a photo of “The Little Mermaid,” a public statue deemed Denmark’s national treasure, was too topless for the site.
These social media “community guidelines” effectively sideline an entire genre of fine art from mainstream platforms, which is especially debilitating for artists and art institutions working in today’s digital age. Social media is an indispensable marketing and networking tool for the art world, allowing artists to promote exhibitions, showcase their portfolio to an international audience, and even be discovered by curators. It’s not an understatement that platforms like Facebook and Instagram have democratized art-making, serving as important launchpads for rookie and untraditional artists. Yet, despite stating in their community guidelines that they “allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures,” Facebook’s surveillance algorithm is often at odds with artistic freedom of expression.
During the pandemic, social media has been one of the few ways for museums to showcase their art under social distancing guidelines. Social media has undeniably played an important role in globalizing and widening access to art over the past years, but currently, this art is at the mercy of nipple-targeting AI algorithms. The opaqueness and inconsistency of social media community guidelines don’t help either. On the same platforms that ban medieval art, a simple hashtag or two can bring users to a slew of pornographic content.
According to the Supreme Court’s current constitutional definition, a work must “lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value” to be considered unprotected obscenity. The artistic and intellectual merit of displaying Vienna’s masterpieces far transcends this definition, and it’s problematic that major (U.S.-based) social media companies are letting AI decide for its users what does and doesn’t constitute “artistic value.” A more careful and humanized consideration of art is needed to safeguard and render accessible humanity’s rich culture and creative endeavors.
Not only does online art censorship hold people back from revisiting past artworks, but it also stops them from taking artistic risks in the future. Norbert Kettner, the director of the Vienna Tourist Board, is concerned about the possible consequences such censorship has for the next generation of art. “Young artists depend on online channels,” he told The New York Times. “We think and we feel that there’s a sort of unconscious self-censorship that is going on in the brains of these artists. ‘What can I post?’ That’s even more serious. The algorithm is suddenly in a position to determine our cultural legacy for tomorrow.”
It’s one thing to censor Rubens alongside hate speech and defamation; it’s another to censor art so strictly that OnlyFans is the only platform that leading art museums can showcase their collections in. Critically, the restrictions that social media platforms impose on artists also further sexualize and stigmatize artworks that reproduce the human body in appreciation of its beauty and perfection. Especially given that social media is a wellspring of inspiration and opportunity for self-actualization for young artists, it has a responsibility to whitelist all art, nude or not. The beauty that these masterpieces hold is far too complex and ambiguous for algorithms to assess.
The Vienna Tourist Board acknowledges that posting pictures of artworks on OnlyFans isn’t a sustainable solution. Rather, it is using this opportunity to voice long-held complaints about art censorship. "What we've experienced during the last days is this huge international and global interest in the topic, and this is actually more important to us,” Helena Hartlauer, a Vienna Tourist Board spokesperson, said in an interview with NPR. “Vienna laid bare” doesn’t have to stop at just creating sound and fury — it has the potential to spearhead the much-needed liberation of art.

Imagine a museum containing a carbonite statue of Han Solo, the Notre-Dame Cathedral, and a Costa Rican beach. This is the museum that Jeffery Thomson curates in his upcoming poetry collection, titled “Museum of Objects Burned by the Souls in Purgatory” after a small gallery located in Rome of the same name. Mirroring the experience of a physical museum, each poem is dedicated to a piece of art, though he defines “art” loosely — and often finds it in unexpected places. Aptly titled, “purgatory” indicates the subtle theme of half-death that permeates his work, as each piece of art has “died” in some sense. Throughout the collection, Thomson pulls each piece of art out of death and into purgatory, where they can be reimagined, revived, and reconsidered.
Thomson opens his collection with a quest for truth. His epigraph, a quote from “The X-Files” — “The truth is out there.” — is a daring yet effective promise. As the collection begins, the reader quickly learns that Thomson is a man of his word. The truth, certainly, is out there; the book discovers it and reveals it in potent lines and staggering revelations, line by line, poem by poem. In one breathtaking example, Thomson asserts, “We have broken / the world so often / we have the pieces… we do not understand / why they do not / fit back together.” In another poem, he argues, “only / the best can / pretend to / fall for / nothing’s / easier than / failure.” Clearly, Thomson can find truth in the mundane as well as the extraordinary, and revelations like these are commonplace in the book.
Each poem in “Museum of Objects Burned by the Souls in Purgatory” is a meditation on a specific artistic relic — all of them dead, gone, and lost, yet still made piercingly relevant. The collection is an art and culture history lesson, and the reading experience is intimate. Since the poems do not simply describe pieces of art, but also interpret and learn from them, Thomson becomes a personal museum tour guide. After each title, he sets up the poem with a bit of context: the materials used, the location of the art, or quoted material from pop culture that speaks to the work. These precursors are one of the most interesting aspects of the collection, often working with the poem to illuminate the work in a new way; for example, “Transparent crystal, facial sections of a human head, silver plate” is the material list for one of the poems.
Thomson effectively juxtaposes pop culture with historical artwork, using both in tandem to convince the reader of the value of art from all sources. His choices for subject matter are not pretentious. His sternum (“Ode to my Sternum”) deserves a poem just as much as Marco d’Agrate’s statue of Saint Bartholomew (“St. Bartholomew Flayed”), and both deserve to exist in the same collection as lyrics quoted from Tupac. He challenges himself to find truth in each piece of art; he dares the reader to trust him on his quest.
Thomson’s wide variety of cultural references make the collection a fast-paced, head-spinning journey across space and time. For example, he opens his poem entitled “Día de los Muertos'' with the word “Odysseus.” Three lines into a poem that initially appears to be about the Trojan horse, he jolts the reader back to the present day, writing, “The virus began in an animal, perhaps a bat.” In a meditation on a Mexican coral reef, he references “those Chinese soldiers standing / forever buried beneath the earth” (the Terracotta Army, of course). Thomson’s brilliant, complex connections create intellectual whiplash in the best way possible. In contrast to what the title suggests, these poems are not all based on historical work from Rome, nor are they based on art that has since died and been in purgatory. His work is excruciatingly current, even when he draws inspiration from the past.
Even with these striking truths and fascinating subject matter, Thomson’s poetic expertise shines through, using structural variation, shape, and diction to bring the artwork to life. The collection does not stick to one consistent structure; rather, poems blend from one style to the next depending on what the art requires. Thomson also adjusts the shape of his poems to impart further meaning onto the artwork. Fittingly, for the poem “Two Halves of the Skull of John the Baptist,” Thomson splits the poem into two sides that can be read either as one complete poem or as two separate pieces. Thomson’s skillful and precise diction creates vivid imagery and distinctive lines that stick with the reader long after the collection is over. The diction ranges from remarkable and complex (“Obsolete antediluvian”) to punchy, daring, and effective (“what shit what piss / what wind what air”). Thomson takes care to match his stylistic elements to the artwork itself, the two working in unison to find truth in each piece.
“Museum of Objects Burned by the Souls in Purgatory” is Thomson’s resultant depiction of the process of experiencing art. This is where the collection draws its greatest strength. The poet is speaking to the reader directly and, through the artwork, he lets the reader into his own life as well. His poetry is not just about the art in front of him. Through the great martyr Demetrius, he confronts his experience with young gay love; through a myth about stones, he confronts his experience with grief. Art becomes accessible with Thomson’s expert touch, and on his tour through the museum, the reader finds the truth.

“What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?”
So asks Lana Del Rey, dubbed Patron Saint of Internet Feelings, in her latest album “Blue Banisters,” released Oct. 22. The album continues the singer’s tradition of sad, witchy balladry and explores her archetypal themes of tumultuous love and feelings of disquietude. This time, however, Del Rey also focuses on family and friendship and healing, which become just as important as her relationship with her lover. At once timeless and timely, traditional and experimental, “Blue Banisters” is Del Rey’s reckoning of her troubled past with her present surroundings (both physical and cultural) as she revisits her earlier style while presenting her most polished voice yet.
The titular track “Blue Banisters” revels in the quotidian. Sparse, simple piano chords let Del Rey’s dreamy and pensive voice shine, while casually intimate details and dialogue such as “Jenny handed me a beer, said, ‘How the hell did you get there?’” enhance the song’s storytelling power. It’s almost as if Del Rey were sitting in a porch rocking chair with a beer in her hand, telling you matter-of-factly about the man who promised to “fix her weathervane [and] give [her] children.” “Blue Banisters,” like many of the songs that follow in the album, rejoices in domesticity and simplicity, in healing and sisterhood — a focus that beautifully complements Del Rey’s complex emotional emptiness after her lover fails to keep his promises and abandons her: “There’s a hole that’s in my heart all my women try and heal.”
What follows in the track “Arcadia” is one of Del Rey’s sweetest, purest vocal performances in her career and is nothing short of a melancholic triumph. “Arcadia” is at once a love song in which the singer encourages her lover to “run your hands over me like a Land Rover” and a mournful elegy of a self-proclaimed “lost little girl.” Del Rey longs for a place of belonging, a place which the dolefully crooned “America” no longer is. The cinematic violins and rolling brass in the background of “Arcadia” swell in the next track, “Interlude - The Trio,” which overlays heavy trap beats over a Western-inspired brass theme written by Italian composer Ennio Morricone for the movie “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.” The interpolation of the hip-hop beats with classic strings and soaring trumpets signals a cultural reckoning that underlies several of Del Rey’s songs — “Text Book” has her “screamin’ ‘Black Lives Matter’” — and is especially significant following the final lyrics of “Arcadia”: “You’ll need a miracle/America.”
The interlude also marks the album’s synthesis of Del Rey’s earlier, beat-heavy, hip-hop-adjacent “Born to Die” and “Ultraviolence” eras with the slow balladry of her recent works. In many ways, “Blue Banisters” is a tribute to Del Rey’s earlier style: The tracks “If You Lie Down With Me” and “Nectar of the Gods” were actually written in 2013, just a year before “Ultraviolence” was released. And it shows. The rhythmic, often monosyllabic choruses of songs like “Text Book,” “If You Lie Down With Me,” “Thunder,” and “Living Legend” harken back to the moody pop choruses that defined “Ultraviolence” and “Honeymoon.”
Some of the tracks are better executed than others. “Text Book” suffers from uninteresting verses and a predictable chorus, and a more streamlined album could do without it. “Nectar of the Gods,” with its bare acoustic and simple honesty about the futility of falling in love (“I used to sing about people like you, now I just get high”), is a striking exception, depicting the singer’s dependence on drugs and driving in order to escape a turbulent romance and chronic loneliness.
“Dealer,” featuring uncredited vocals from Miles Kane, deals directly with these feelings of betrayal and drug-fueled melancholy. Kane implores his lover: “Please don’t try to find me through my dealer.” One of the most experimental tracks on the album, Del Rey interrupts Kane’s hypnotic pleas with unrestrained wails of “I don’t wanna live/I don’t wanna give you nothing.” “‘People don’t know what it sounds like when I yell. And I do yell,’” Del Rey told Jack Antonoff for the Sept. 2020 issue of Interview Magazine.
And thank God she does. Del Rey’s Jeff Buckley-esque howls in “Dealer” constitute a refreshing, albeit shakily delivered, contrast to the melodious, fluttering alto that runs consistently throughout the rest of the album. They set it apart from the singer’s similarly minimalist, ballad-heavy album “Chemtrails Over the Country Club,” also released in 2021. With “Blue Banisters,” one thing is for certain: Del Rey’s vocals are primed to head in a new direction, and the road looks promising.

Any TV adaptation of a video game, especially one as beloved as “League of Legends,” must find a way to engage audiences even without the defining feature of gameplay: interactivity. “Arcane,” a Netflix original series developed and produced by Riot Games, overcomes this challenge with spectacular animation and a plot whose fast-paced drama approaches that of the greatest “League” matches — like the 2021 Worlds finals, which took place just hours before the first three-episode act of “Arcane” premiered on Nov. 6.
While “League” fans know Vi (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld), one of the game’s 157 playable “champions,” as a gauntlet-wielding Warden in the metropolis of Piltover, the first act of “Arcane” focuses on her difficult childhood in Piltover’s underground counterpart, Zaun. Piltover, a commercial and cultural center, sits on a cliff where the sun reflects off both countless glass windows and the ocean below. In contrast, residual fumes from a catastrophic chemical leak shroud Zaun in a constant state of half-light. Every shot combines painterly, almost rough, strokes of color with seamless movement to create a unique visual style that complements the recurring idea of duality: between not only the twin cities of Piltover and Zaun, but also Vi and her younger sister Powder (Mia Sinclair Jenness).
The siblings’ relationship lies at the narrative heart of “Arcane,” whose haunting opening scene intersperses a child’s plaintive song with violent artillery blasts. After a Zaunite stand against the oppressive Piltovan Wardens ends in fiery destruction, Vi finds her parents among the dead and narrows her eyes in disgust at their killers; the brief changes in her expression last more than long enough to convey the hatred for Piltover that leads her to a rebellious adolescence.
Contemplative moments like these give the series’ character development a level of nuance impossible to achieve in-game, where “you don’t get that close to the characters,” as “Arcane” co-creator and executive producer Christian Linke said in an interview with Screen Rant.
Through plotlines that unite characters from Piltover and Zaun, “Arcane” also exposes the societal injustice that spares no one in either city. Vi crosses paths with Piltovan inventor Jayce (Kevin Alejandro), another “League” champion, when she and three friends break into his luxurious penthouse. Upon the quartet’s return to Zaun, they struggle to protect each other from the Wardens scouring the city for someone to punish. Meanwhile, Piltover’s Council of wealthy merchants threatens Jayce with banishment for conducting illegal research, despite his theories’ undeniable potential to generate life-saving magic. These parallel stories show how Piltovan administrators’ obsession with maintaining the status quo stifles social and scientific progress, to the detriment of Piltovans and Zaunites alike.
Characters’ periodic references to the “Arcane” invoke the forbidden magic Jayce longs to replicate — and, through the fourth wall, the series’ title. Thankfully, with its consistently clear exposition and dialogue, “Arcane” is anything but. Longtime “League” players will surely delight in seeing familiar faces onscreen in situations other than fights to the death, and some newcomers to the franchise might even feel inspired to download the game after watching Act 1. At the very least, both groups should stick around for the next two acts, due for release on Nov. 13 and 20: The brilliant artistry on display in each episode places “Arcane” in a league of its own.

MEDUZA, an Italian electronic dance music trio known for their hit single “Piece of Your Heart,” recently collaborated with Hozier (Andrew Hozier-Byrne) in “Tell It To My Heart.” While somewhat mainstream, the collaboration is a rather fun and charming piece that captures the characteristic sounds of each artist.
Though the tone of “Tell It To My Heart” is rather frenetic and seemingly upbeat, the song’s lyrics still carry the typical melancholic and somber moods of Hozier’s repertoire. Hozier’s opening lyrics immediately make the theme clear. Bemoaning the fact that his lover is keeping themself closed off from him, Hozier warbles: “I can’t work you out / Are you thinking about something better?” While not a particularly novel theme, Hozier expresses lovely thoughts such as “The only time you smile is in the photographs” and “Whatever time we have I’m not gonna waste / Before we turn to strangers tryna love in the dark.”
The collaboration is a stellar execution. The EDM scene and Hozier is certainly not an expected intersection. “Tell It To My Heart” sounds far different from any of the other works in Hozier’s oeuvre, containing neither the slower tempo “Take Me To Church” made Hozier known for, nor the deep acoustic guitars of “Would That I.” Nonetheless, his sonorous voice that normally lends itself to blues, soul, and gospel perfectly fits the synths and pounding beats of MEDUZA. Just as Hozier sings the chorus “Tell it to my heart” for the second time, MEDUZA replaces the beat of the drum with the sound of an actual heartbeat, while in the music video a metal bust grows around a beating heart. While an unusual and unexpected collaboration, the sound of MEDUZA’s track intertwines nicely with the timbre of Hozier’s voice.

Pitch-black darkness silenced the crowd before the Din & Tonics started their set with a unique spin on the classic song “New York, New York.” Glowing gloves in the dark formed shapes of people dancing, and the iconic “I Heart New York” slogan delivered an unforgettable start to a show highlighting three of Harvard’s renowned a cappella groups.
On Friday, Nov. 5 the Din & Tonics, Lowkeys, and Opportunes each sang in their first A cappella jam since the pandemic in a show titled “Carbo-Low Din: A Bulking Opp Jam.” The long wait for the combination of three Harvard a cappella groups performing their classic alumni songs — as well as a variety of new song choices — sparked an excitement in the theater that could never be felt online.
Their set took an unexpected turn with a request from the group to have the audience act out a scene that introduced their second song of the night: “My Favorite Things” by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. By including audience members in their performance, the Din & Tonics were successful in shrinking the distance between the group and the audience — reeling the audience into an outstanding set filled with a refreshing contrast of songs, hilarious facial expressions, and dance moves that added spunk to each song they sang.
Through their humorous song introductions that engaged the audience in banter, attendees could not help feeling that they were as much a part of the show as the Dins themselves. This warm, inviting stage presence suffused the entirety of the show. They ended their set by reassuring the audience that they had all gained 12 new friends after singing “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” by Randy Newman.
After the Din & Tonics’ outstanding first set, the Lowkeys took the stage with a vibrant and exciting entrance that was anything but low-key. Their entrance in striking red and black outfits was in itself exciting enough to get the crowd cheering, and their seamless start to their first song “More” by Lawrence kept the energy high. The set further distinguished itself through a reverberating beatboxing solo that had audience members in awe, as the powerful bass vibrations carried an enticing new sound to the stage and shook the ground under their feet.
Building from this momentum, the Lowkeys followed with a clear highlight of the night: “No Diggity” by Blackstreet. The combination of an aca-classic tune with passionately expressive choreography allowed the audience to forget that there were no instruments on stage.
While each group had a distinct stage presence that grabbed the attention of the audience, the last group of the night took the opportunity to leave a lasting impression on the audience and ran with it. The Opportunes focused on choreography much less than the Lowkeys, but they were able to shine as the closing act of the night by showing off their vocal range through both sing-along classics and catchy pop hits.
The highlight of the night was the Opportunes’ powerful rendition of “Where Have You Been” by Rihanna. By combining seamless group choreography and stunningly catchy harmonies, it was no surprise that this song in the middle of their set got a standing ovation.
Even though the Opportunes’ finale found itself in treble by having the group confusingly pretend to exit the stage and then continue with their final song — elongating an already long show — the Opportunes’ dominating stage presence ensured that the audience would leave the show still humming the tunes from their set.
So, Dins, Lowkeys, and Opportunes, when is the next a cappella jam?

On Oct. 21, when Alec Baldwin went into work on the set of his latest film, “Rust,” a day that started out as usual quickly turned into tragedy. While shooting a scene, a prop gun Baldwin was using for a scene mistakenly fired a live bullet, killing the film’s prolific cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza.
For those not involved in the world of filmmaking, it can be difficult to understand exactly how something like this could have happened. The misguided popular conception of what a “prop gun” is proves a part of that. Rather than a specially designed fake gun or computer rendering, the makers of “Rust,” like many other filmmakers, used real guns loaded with blanks (bullets with no tip) to shoot scenes where a character fires a gun. A designated crew member is supposed to ensure that a gun contains no live rounds before handing it off to an actor; a failure in this step could prove fatal and, in the case of “Rust,” it did. An assistant director picked up one of three prop guns laid out by the film’s armorer and handed it off to Baldwin, who needed it for a scene. Unbeknownst to either of them, the gun actually still contained live rounds.
It goes without saying that what happened on the set of “Rust” is a tragic accident caused by human error, but that doesn’t mean it occurred in a vacuum. Just earlier this month, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) asked its members to vote on the possibility of a strike against poor working conditions, including overly-long work schedules, unfair pay, and safety hazards. The result? A resounding 98.7 percent of union members responded “yes.”
One of the main reasons the IATSE decided to vote on a strike is the oftentimes hazardous conditions film crews are forced to work in on set. In a recent article from Deadline, it was reported that there were more than 50 reports of 14-hour workdays within the first seven months of 2021. Forcing employees to work for such extended periods of time without sleep is not only inhumane, but also increases the likelihood that mistakes such as what happened on the “Rust” set will occur.
It’s worth noting that some of the support for the IATSE’s potential strike came from employees who worked on the set of “Rust,” including Hutchins herself. In an Instagram post made two days before her death, Hutchins reposted a photo of the “Rust” crew on set with the caption partially reading, “Standing in #IAsolidarity with our @IATSE crew here in New Mexico on RUST.” The post was originally shared by “Rust” actress Frances Fisher.
In light of what happened on “Rust,” what was once an average post now feels especially haunting. But it also highlights a bitter truth about incidents like this one: They’re often the aggregated result of several compounding abuses and disregard for the safety of those who work in filmmaking. Her death isn’t the first of its kind, and unless there’s systemic change within the film industry, it likely won’t be the last. In 1993, Brandon Lee, the son of actor Bruce Lee, was shot and killed by a prop gun on the set of the film “The Crow.” His death was ruled an accident due to negligence and heightened the discussion surrounding safety on film sets as well as the need for protection. Still, not much happened as a result and the conversation surrounding the circumstances that led to his death eventually fizzled out, a fact that is now painfully obvious.
Now, almost three decades later, the world is watching a similar tragedy unfold, and all one can hope is that there’ll be a real change this time. Some workers have already called for the use of only computer-generated gunshots in film as a way to avoid real guns, but others have brought up the difficulty in making the gunfire appear genuine. Such special effects are also a lot more expensive, bringing with them the types of costs that producers are often trying to cut. But if no effort is made to at least improve on the technology used, then the blatant disrespect Hollywood has for those who make it run becomes more pressing. There is absolutely no making up for the loss of human life, but the very least that could be done is to ensure that nothing like what happened on the set of “Rust” will ever happen again. Such efforts at improving the safety of everyone working on a set will not only help guarantee that everyone who goes in the morning to work on a film set can return home to their family that night, but will also ensure that crew members don’t have to come into work and leave traumatized. And if there’s no way to do these kinds of scenes safely, then the question arises about whether they need to be done at all.
Hopefully, things will be different moving forward. Still, it’s admittedly idealistic — very little change has occurred in the years since Lee’s death, and even outside of incidents like what happened on the set of “Rust,” Hollywood has shown its true colors time and time again. One needs to look no further than the #MeToo movement, when Hollywood faced countless accusations of sexual harassment but did little, if anything, to address them. When audiences watch movies on screen, it can be easy to forget all that goes into making them. And oftentimes, what goes on behind the scenes is not entirely pleasant. The movie industry has a long history of using, abusing, and endangering their workers, and what happened on the set of “Rust” is just the latest incident. Only time will tell if positive change will truly be made, but in the meantime, the “Rust” tragedy just serves as confirmation of Hollywood’s pressing need to protect its workers.

While the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) usually keeps a tight grip on the secrets it reveals for its upcoming movies, the MCU had an unexpected leak for their upcoming film, “Eternals.” Even though the spoiler didn’t come from the usual culprit of leaking spoilers — read: Tom Holland — fans and crew are still disappointed about the premature end credit reveal.
While the film won’t hit theaters in the United States until November 5th, the news broke out after a press screening that Harry Styles will be joining the MCU as Eros (aka Starfox), Thanos’ brother. The singer and actor appears during the film’s after-credits scene, and Variety journalist Matt Donnelly leaked the spoiler over Twitter. Eros is an Eternal, a race of immortal beings that guard Earth against the Deviants, and though he has a complex character arc, Eros is still a supporting character in the MCU. The question of how the MCU is going to fit Eros into future films remains unanswered, especially because introducing Harry Styles into the cast almost ensures that he will be getting more screen time than the character of Eros would have otherwise received.
Styles’ casting also makes it unclear what value he will bring to the character of Eros. Styles had his film debut in “Dunkirk” in 201 7, and will appear in two upcoming films: “Don’t Worry Darling” and “My Policeman.” Coming out of the highly successful “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” that brought in $423 million worldwide, it seems that Disney executives may have cast a popular figure to entice a new audience to tune into the following films about the reimagined Marvel multiverse, which signals a departure from the Avengers and the characters fans have grown to love.
“To our colleagues & friends in the press & fan community who will be watching #Eternals in the days ahead, please help preserve the experience of this incredible film,” Disney’s President of Marketing, Asad Ayaz said on Twitter. “Please do not post spoilers and reveals that so many have worked so hard to protect.”
Kit Harrington, a new member of the MCU who plays Black Knight in “Eternals,” was also disappointed about the leak. “I’ve lived in a world where spoilers happen for a long time. I realize they can happen. It’s just disappointing that people do it,” Kit Harrington said during an interview with The Playlist. “Let people go to the cinema and experience it when they pay for their ticket and do it that way, rather than spreading it online where they might not realize they’re coming across stuff.”
With the highly anticipated “Spiderman: No Way Home” releasing soon after “Eternals” on Dec. 17, it is disappointing to see a leak of the cinematic universe’s future. But, who knows, maybe this is just the start of Harry Styles’ career as the next Robert Downey Jr.

The historic Harvard Glee Club hosted its third annual “Hand in Hand Concert” on Oct. 29. After a year off due to the pandemic, America’s oldest collegiate choir took the stage at Sanders Theatre, as choirs from Princeton and Yale Zoomed in from their respective campuses, for a celebration of global choral music.
Starting out in a sprint, Yale’s 90-voice all gender chorus kicked off the night with their rendition of Nathanel Dett’s “Ave Maria.” The deep bass undertones highlighted the lightness of the tenors and sopranos, building a strong synergy of vocals. “Don't be shy everybody, it's our first concert of 2020!” said Yale’s School of Music’s professor of choral music, Jeffrey Douma, eliciting cheers from Woolsey Hall, Richardson Auditorium, and Sanders Theatre alike. After that brief interlude, they fluidly switched into Church Slavonic for a rendition of Rachmaninoff’s “Ave Maria,” followed by a live premiere of “Meditation,” a composition by post doc poet Joel Thompson. The Yale Glee Club indeed quite literally lifted the atmosphere with their escalating harmonies, offering an unconventional spin on standard choral work. They premiered another piece with Arianne Abela’s lively song “Because You Sang,” then picking up the tempo in “Angel Band,” where “my spirit loudly sings” sounded just as the vocals crescendoed. They rounded out their performance with two school songs, “Football Medley” and “Bright College Years,” which featured digs at John Harvard that elicited snake hissing sounds from the Sanders crowd.
From the first note, the Princeton Glee Club kept the crowd guessing. Under the direction of conductor Gabriel Crouch, the soprano-dominant choir stepped out to form an unconventional setup of singers — unlike a traditional choir where the singers stand in sections according to voice part, there was a scattering of voices throughout. This formation allowed them to keep the men in the center — helpful for choirs with a greater number of women than men. The Tigers chose to focus on a maritime theme in their repertoire. In “The Bermudas,” they combated the technically difficult repertoire of harmonies head on, like the nautical storm that it depicts. Likewise, the three-movement Francis Poulenc piece was indeed a very arduous and strenuous work, missing just a few more baritones and tenors to counterbalance the cacophony of tritones and overpowering sopranos. However, their performance ended on a high note, flying paper planes from the Harvard balcony and garnering more than three rowdy cheers for Old Nassau.
Although the sons of Eli Yale and the Princeton Tigers put up a good fight, the Crimson’s attention to detail made for an unparalleled collegiate choral performance.
Performing last but certainly not least, the Harvard Glee Club took the stage with William Walker’s “Southern Harmony,” transitioning the night into a more calm and romantic territory. “It has been 616 days since we last took this stage,” conductor Andrew Clark noted, before reflecting on the choir’s mournful yet aspirational attitude at a time when other choirs around the globe fell silent. Then, the choir embarked on a global and temporal journey, beginning in Russia with a world premiere arrangement of Pavel Chesnokov’s “Svete tihiy.” Vladimir Morosan’s TTBB arrangement made for an intimate listening experience, where each accent could be detected due to the controlled undertones of piano fortitude. The chorus then traveled back to medieval Italy with Monteverdi's “Nymph’s Lament.” Accompanied by a cello and a trio of lute instruments, the sweet mezzo soprano high notes of soloist Benjamin Wenzelberg ‘22 sounded as delicate as the plucking of the strings. Wenzelberg portrayed the theme of torment so meticulously that the transfixed crowd was compelled into a standing ovation, surely the highlight of the night.
Descending south of the equator to Cape Town, Bongani Magatyana’s interpretation of family and property in South Africa in the world premiere of “Iinkomo” was evident in the valiant layering technique and staccato polyphony. The journey continued on to mainland China in the folk song “Mountain Song,” performed with the help of soloist Andrew Lu ‘24, whose precise intonations stayed true to the linguistic traditions of China's regional choral traditions. Samuel Webbe’s “Glorious Apollo” featured the senior-led semi-chorus that brought the audience back home to Black choral music in America.
Finally, the Harvard Glee Club’s president, Jay Sastry ‘22, offered some light-hearted entertainment in the form of one stolen Princeton Tiger, pictured here, and then proceeded to tear Old Nassau a new one in the “Football Songs” after the controversial loss at the Harvard-Princeton game the previous weekend.
The night didn't escape without flaws, with both the audio and video aspects of the simulcast virtual performances preventing the audience from fully engaging with the beautiful harmonies due to the flattening effect of the speakers. However, these difficulties couldn’t outweigh the benefits. The Princeton Tigers, for instance, compensated for the audio difficulties with skillful camerawork that captured soloists up close and personal, using the virtual setup to their advantage. Despite performing in masks, the Yale Bulldogs sounded clear as a bell, thanks to months of acclimating to performing in them. Meanwhile, the male dominated ensemble of tenors and basses at Harvard blended the microphone gaps so beautifully that their performance merged into an indistinguishable spectrum of unified voices — a true representation of choral excellence — but it is likely that this magic didn’t fully carry over to the virtual listeners.
Whether one came away from the night thinking John Harvard reigned victorious or not, the important cause behind the event was that all proceeds went to Save the Music, a national nonprofit whose grants support music programs in public schools across Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Jersey. It goes without saying then, that the night succeeded in achieving the true mission of any Glee Club: choral performance in the name of unity, good humor, and joy.

Have you ever wondered what Hatshepsut, Marie Antoinette, and Hillary Clinton have in common? Dr. Andrew Lear '81 has the answer. Lear, former professor of Classics and History at Harvard, Columbia, and NYU, is an expert on gender and sexuality in the ancient world. To account for the lack of LGBTQ+ representation in history and art tours, Lear founded Oscar Wilde Tours in 2013, Shady Ladies Tours in 2016, and most recently, the nonprofit organization We Were There in 2021. He has helped visitors uncover themes of gender and sexuality at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and other institutions around the world. His newest tour, “We Were There” at the Met, reflects the nonprofit’s mission to educate people about LGBTQ+ history, culture, and art, featuring powerful women and queer figures in the museum’s collection.
Lear focuses on pieces in the museum for which themes of sexuality, gender, and race are present but not explicit. One might appreciate the beautiful marble bust of Antinous without recognizing him as Emperor Hadrian’s lover, or admire a grand painting of a horse market without noticing the lesbian who sits in the middle. Lear highlights the tiny details — like the Adam’s apple and masculine hands that reveal the central figure of “Merrymakers at Shrovetide” to be a man in drag, not a woman.
Every artist or character depicted in the artworks on this tour faced obstacles, battling misogyny, sexual assault, homophobia, and societal stigma. Lear shares their stories of resilience and explains how each found their own way to flourish. For instance, Hatshepsut was a powerful pharaoh despite male opposition, Artemisia Gentileschi — a survivor of sexual assault — became one of the first famous women painters, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s paintings of lesbian couples are considered beloved products of the post-impressionist period.
As museums make an effort to diversify their collections, the biases of the art world have been brought to the public’s attention. This makes it easy to dismiss older pieces of the Met’s collection as entirely unrepresentative of diverse communities. “We Were There” is a reminder that, while greater representation is still needed, art of or by women and the LGBTQ+ community has existed for millennia and has been revered at the Met since its establishment.
“There were people like us in history,” said Lear. “It’s not actually all straight, cisgender, elite white men. No, it’s a much more complicated story than that.”
The tour will launch at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Nov. 20.

In the spirit of performance opening back up to the public following a year-and-a-half long quarantine shutdown, Boston Ballet produced a new digital showing titled RestART to usher in their 2021-22 season. The work, premiering on Oct. 28, hopes to restart the arts in Boston by providing a sneak peek into what can be expected in the following ballet season. The showing has five parts: Yin Yue’s “A Common Movement,” an excerpt from “Romeo and Juliet,” an excerpt from Jorma Elo’s “Ruth’s Dance,” and George Balanchine’s “Apollo” — concluding with the Grand Défilé, a finale piece including all the dancers.
“A Common Movement,” the opening piece, filmed in the Boston Common, epitomizes a new beginning for the arts. The cinematography and color palette was washed in beiges and blues and placed against the muted sunlight of an autumn day in Massachusetts. The contemporary piece is choreographed to a 1920s style trumpet, drawing parallels between the energy of life that is as present now as it was a century ago. Dancers matched the high energy with light and brisk footwork, pointed flicks, and taps that spotted each eight count. Clean lines throughout the piece not only highlighted an attention to the craft, but to how that craft relays emotion to the audience.
Dancers were later showcased in groups of two to four, each making use of the camera frame at different points in time. The casual nature of the film works in balance with the warm and fluid interactions between the small groups was reminiscent of a walk through the park — or, more specifically, a walk through the Boston Common. Performers managed to float and glide through their leaps while remaining completely grounded in their movements.
A subsequent movement in this opening piece brought the dancers back together in a group with a swing jazz rhythm, movements that flowed through curved backs and widespread arms which projected an energy comparable only to baseball and blooms on a spry Sunday. The floor sequence directly following quite literally embodied blooms and a living forest floor, as dancers stretched across a slanted lawn as if coming alive after a long winter.
The excerpt of “Romeo and Juliet,” courtesy of Korea National University of Arts, bled romance and innocence through and through. Second soloist Soo-Bin Lee and artist Seokjoo Kim presented the well-known romantic tragedy. The duo managed to maintain the classic charm of the piece without rendering it stale or boring. Lee’s refined technique and Kim’s elegance in motion presented the drama through fresh eyes. Jorma Elo’s “Ruth’s Dance” presented a similar delicateness on the warmly lit stage of the Boston Ballet Studios. Soloist Addie Tapp and principal Lasha Khozashvili moved like the clockwork of an antique watch through light yet intentional extensions and lifts. The piece presents as playful yet deliberate — like the familiar movements of a childhood game.
The penultimate piece was George Balanchine’s “Apollo.” Boston Ballet stays true to the classic choreography and presents the show in the staple white wardrobe and bright white lighting, which allows the piece to be seen in all its theatrical and dramatic glory. The striking final pose formed by principals Paulo Arrais (Apollo), Lia Cirio (Terpsichore), Viktorina Kapitonova (Calliope), and soloist Chyrstyn Fentry (Polyhymnia) was accompanied by a dramatic dim in the lighting and color change of the backdrop from blue to a honey brown — which only adds to the theatrical experience. The slightest bend of an elbow or other minute details throughout the performance embodied the energy of Greek Theatre. These details prove Boston Ballet’s attention to specificity in motion and, furthermore, specificity in art.
With this reintroduction into the world of ballet and art in general, the Boston Ballet restates its claim as an institution of refined craft and cultured creativity that is fully equipped to provide the city with the fresh energy that it has so long been missing.

Cambridge is gorgeous in autumn. As the leaves change color across Harvard Yard and the air on the river takes on a new, crisp quality, one can’t help but feel lucky to live in such a beautiful place. Nonetheless, as midterm season finally passes into the rearview mirror, some students have planned celebratory weekend trips with their friends into towns such as Providence and New Haven. While students looking to get out of Cambridge next weekend have many options at their disposal, one lesser-known contender may prove itself worthwhile: Pete Davidson’s Native New York City.
The city was first brought to the public’s attention on Nov. 1 of this year, when an article in Page Six mentioned that superstar Kim Kardashian recently touched down in Pete Davidson’s Native NYC, and that the pair had been spotted holding hands. While this “NYC” may have previously escaped fans’ notice, knowing that Pete Davidson currently resides there certainly answered the question of why a celebrity like Kim Kardashian would be visiting this particular hamlet. Immediately, people began commenting upon the creative nomenclature of the destination.
A small town of 8.4 million people, Pete Davidson’s Native NYC appears to have a few quaint attractions for tourists of all ages. “The Empire State Building,” for instance, is an office building standing 1,250 feet tall that rests in the middle of Pete Davidson’s Native NYC. Tourists can climb to the top and see if they can spot Pete Davidson from the observation deck. Nearby, visitors can easily find a series of shops, restaurants, and billboards known to townsfolk as Times Square, where they can try to catch a show put on by one of the local theaters. Surely, Davidson must enjoy having these attractions so close at hand in his hometown. And for the more intrepid souls on Davidson’s turf, one can take a ferry to see the large, green sculpture of a woman holding a torch that locals call the “Statue of Liberty.” Quirky!
Most importantly, however, when visiting Pete Davidson’s Native NYC, tourists should be on the lookout for 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Davidson’s place of work. Here, more obscure comedians like Will Ferrell get together with Davidson to film his late-night sketch comedy show, “Saturday Night Live.”
Believe it or not, before being christened Pete Davidson’s Native NYC, the town was called New Amsterdam upon its establishment in 1625. And in addition to its primary role as a homebase for Davidson, Pete Davidson’s Native NYC is also the backdrop of famous novels such as F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby” and J.D. Salinger’s “The Catcher in the Rye.” Astute readers may remember this seminal quote from Salinger’s work: “Pete Davidson’s Native NYC is terrible when somebody laughs on the street very late at night. You can hear it for miles. It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed. Hey, is that Pete Davidson? Never mind!” Living in a town steeped in so much history, it’s no wonder that Pete Davidson has become such a fixture in American popular culture himself.
If you’re seeking a respite from the hustle and bustle of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a quick getaway to Pete Davidson’s Native NYC guarantees a peaceful weekend with a few activities available. How Davidson has gotten away with hiding in his obscure hometown for so long is a wonder. Perhaps for a longer vacation, students can check out Michael J. Fox’s Native Canada.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“These. People. Existed.” Jeymes Samuel’s Western “The Harder They Fall” doesn’t begin as one would expect — that is, not with a guitar tune in a saloon, and not with sweeping wide shots of Monument Valley, but with large white text on a black background. Samuel’s film revives a quintessential American genre that summons imagery of John Wayne as Ringo Kid or Clint Eastwood as Blondie. Yet “The Harder They Fall” doesn’t just subvert genre expectations with a Black ensemble cast, it also stresses the importance of Black figures as a central piece of history, and an often forgotten element of the mythic, cinematic West.
The film follows Nat Love as he reunites with his old lover Mary Fields, only to embark on a quest for revenge when his old enemy Rufus Buck is released from prison. The film trails Love and his plan to kill Buck, while also tracking Buck’s efforts to reshape the town Redwood into a paradise for his gang. The film’s main cast are all based on real life figures, such as Stagecoach Mary or Cherokee Bill.
Samuel infuses his film with the visual ethos of Western cinematography. “The Harder They Fall” pays careful attention to the power of landscapes: From the opening shot displaying Love’s childhood home being swallowed by the desert to the closing shot illustrating Love chasing Fields across the open, rugged landscape, Samuel’s imagery is befitting of a John Ford Western. Moreover, during some of the film’s many face-offs, Samuel emphasizes scope — not just with the sweeping desert, but also through framing. His extreme wide shots place characters on opposite sides of the frame with vast negative space between them; it suggests a grandeur not just to the Western landscape, but also to the film as a visual medium. When Cherokee Bill and Jim Beckwourth talk, for instance, Samuel shoots the scene from a bird’s eye view, with long emphatic shadows that crawl down the length of the screen.
The film also aims for a modern twist with fun, punchy dialogue and bright primary colors over the warm earth tones of traditional Westerns. For instance, the fight scene between Trudy Smith, Buck’s right-hand woman, and Fields takes place in a barn filled with bright red, yellow, and blue dyes. The production design on the fictional town of Redwood also opts for an almost-childish, surrealist appearance with its pastel blue, red, and yellow buildings. Samuel’s visual style is an integral part of his storytelling, and that style includes aggressive pop-up text. For instance, when Love kills a man who helped murder his parents, each of his gunshots are punctuated by a word in the film’s title – “The,” “Harder,” “They,” “Fall.” The film also features heavy amounts of split screens, which heightens the feeling that this is a modern take on an old genre.
The film also includes an excellent soundtrack. Rather than opting for traditional folk, the score instead plays reggae and rap by Koffee and Jay-Z over shootouts and landscape-shots. Samuel also uses diegetic sound to wonderful rhythmic effect — for instance, in one scene, Fields pounds the butt of her rifle into the ground, starting a drumbeat that leads into a song. It’s a memorable character moment that introduces Fields as a tough, no-nonsense kind of woman.
However, the film does fall flat in developing most of its characters. As the main antagonist, the audience is given little insight into Buck: We don’t know much about his motivations, why Smith is so devoted to him, or why Cherokee Bill obeys him. All we know is that he is a violent, terrifying man — in short, a bland, generic Western villain. Moreover, the supposedly shocking revelation that Love and Buck are half-siblings somehow comes off as wildly boring, flat, and befitting of a cheap soap opera. It’s a jarring moment that is further cheapened by the poorly chosen melodramatic opera music that plays in the background. Ultimately, this “twist” adds no emotional weight to the final scene, which leaves audiences feeling underwhelmed after the film ends. Moreover, despite the stacked cast, the acting is somewhat bland. For example, while Fields is a sultry counterpart to Smith, Zazie Beetz’ acting is often hamfisted and over-the-top.
While his film doesn’t quite stick the landing, Samuel’s take on this classic genre is certainly a fun watch. “The Harder They Fall” pays homage to the decades-long canon of Westerns that came before it, while updating it with Samuel’s unique visual style. Putting greater emphasis on forgotten Black figures in the American West – and revitalizing their presence on the big screen — means that “The Harder They Fall” also transcends its genre-blending fun. “The Harder They Fall” was released on Netflix on Nov. 3.

Take a look at the top-selling songs of 1990 and you’ll see Paula Abdul with her R&B groove “Opposites Attract,” New Kids on the Block’s disco hit “Step by Step,” and Vanilla Ice’s “Ice Ice Baby,” cited by many as introducing hip-hop to the mainstream. If you refresh to 2021, you’d see that a lot has changed except for one thing: Mariah Carey tops the charts in both years.
How does anyone maintain relevance across two generations? The answer lies in one track — a song that defies the normal rise and fall of the average pop hit. Instead, it enjoys perennial commanding popularity for four weeks every year. After months of dormancy, it suddenly plays incessantly in shopping malls, in a tight rotation on the radio, and in the trenches of social media. Even if listeners “don’t want a lot for Christmas,” “there is just one thing” that they can’t go without: Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.”
There is a wide body of music scholarship on Mariah Carey’s 1994 single, as it continues to influence American pop music. Though the song has been charting on various lists since 1995, the “unofficial anthem of the holiday season” hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time in Dec. 2019 and did it again in Dec. 2020
Carey and a few select others struck gold. The pop music canon relies on impermanence and rapidly changing tastes (when was the last time you listened to Rihanna’s “We Found Love,” the top song from this time just a decade ago?). Yet sometime in November every year, millions turn off their Saweetie and Polo G and switch to antiques like Burl Ives’ “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas” (1964), Andy Williams’ “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” (1963) and Nat King Cole’s “The Christmas Song” (1961), as if they were written this year.
American Christmas art relies on a sense of collective nostalgia for midcentury simplicity; the black-and-white scenes of “It’s a Wonderful Life” make color film seem futuristic, the primitive animation of “Frosty the Snowman” and claymation of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” look back to a time without CGI, and the big bands of our Christmas standards make listeners salivate for a time when jazz reigned supreme.
New additions to the canon must look back to the past in some way. Carey’s single is no exception. In a 1994 interview she said of the work: “It's very traditional, old-fashioned Christmas. It's very retro, kind of '60s,” in other words, harkening to the other Christmas staples that enjoy enduring popularity. It is no wonder that so much of our current Christmas music was recorded in the 1950s and ‘60s, or made to sound like it was.
It’s worth mentioning the immense sums of money hiding behind the sleigh bells and chimes. Carey herself makes a large six-figure sum in royalties every December from the song, and countless sales departments use the song to get potential customers in the Christmas (spending) mood. This past week, when Carey posted a video on Twitter in which she smashed a pumpkin with a candy-cane baseball bat while dressed in a Santa suit and declared “It’s time,” she began the annual economic rush to which she provides the soundtrack.
This December, like every December, it’s time to do exactly what you did last December. It’s time for families to lean into their traditions, visit grandparents, and reheat old customs to celebrate. As science fiction fans wait for the invention of time travel, they would do well to realize that the technology has existed for decades. Every December, we do our collective best to travel back to circa 1960 by consuming old art, dressing in old styles, and re-enacting old lifestyles. Mariah Carey in 1994 took advantage of this impulse and crafted the perfect time-machine song. Long after Carey is gone, she’ll still be offering rides back to a time she didn’t even live through. If history is any indication, we’ll also still be taking her up on her offer.

It's a Friday night around 6:00 and a group of brave and talented artists has courageously made its way to their rehearsal space in the Quad. Quickly, doors are being opened and closed. People are rushing inside, where the heater is effectively suppressing the cold November air. “Pirates, pirates!” director and Crimson Arts Editor Chloe E.W Levine ‘22 shouts. The adrenaline rises. The tension is palpable. Then, the orchestra starts to play, cutting through the silence. The rehearsal begins.
“It’s a tough time of the year for everyone’s physicality,” Levine says. Cough drops and tea have become a staple for many in the cast and crew. While every other Harvard student can take a step back from their daily routine to battle a cold, this group has to power through. Time is a scarce resource these days. After all, it’s only a matter of days before everyone must draw their swords.
On Nov. 11 at the Agassiz Theatre, the Harvard Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players will celebrate the much-anticipated premiere of “The Pirates of Penzance,” a comic opera. “We want this show to be a celebration of theater after having been away from this space for so long“, Levine says. The operetta revolves around the life adventures of Frederic, a young courageous pirate apprentice, torn between duty and love, past and present. It is a comedy about one of humanity’s greatest questions: Follow your heart or follow your mind?
“Gilbert and Sullivan were very naturalistic for their time, they were trying to breathe life into their characters,” Levine says. “In order to honor their actual intention, a lot of what my work as a director is, retrofitting intention to things that were written for the rhyme.” Humor is ever-changing. Jokes that were hysterically funny in the 19th century are inevitably bound to be less well-received in the 21st century. Thus, Levine tried to transfer the old golden standard of comedy onto today’s society, all in the hope of creating a version of the show that makes sense to a modern empathetic audience member.
However, comedy is not the only thing that changes with time — so does society. Sadly, “Pirates of Penzance“ refers back to ingrained stereotypical gender roles. The girls in the show are merely pretty and bubbly — that’s it. To avoid falling into this pitfall, the director and the entire cast sat down and talked about each girl as an individual, discussing their inner feelings and deepest desires. “Sometimes other productions don’t really look into that and just portray them as silly, air-headed girls, but they are interesting people”, one of the actresses, Evelyn J. Carr ‘25, says.
To everyone feeling intimidated by the fact that “Pirates of Penzance“ is an operetta — don’t be! “This show is the perfect introduction into opera”, Max Allison ‘25 says. Allison plays the romantic lead, Frederic. While thrilled to be back to live theater, this excitement is connected to a certain level of anxiety and respect. “This is my first time singing in an operatic style, it’s very different from what I have done previously,” he says.
“I hope the audience leaves with a sense of joy of finally being back in the theater and with the reminder to not take themselves too seriously,” Olympia M. Hatzilambrou ‘24 says. Hatzilambrou, who plays Mabel, the female lead and Frederic’s romantic interest, has a very personal connection to Gilbert and Sullivan’s work as well. “Pirates was my gateway Gilbert and Sullivan show,” she says. “Mabel has been my dream role since 8th grade, it’s wonderful to finally get to fulfill that dream, especially with such a brilliant cast and crew!”
They certainly share a very special bond, strengthened by the stress and anxiety, but also the excitement and joy, of putting on a show as a team. “We are all here to help each other become better artists,” Hatzilambrou says.
“Everyone is here to support each other and make sure that you are having fun, and that you are healthy and happy!” Carr says. “We have the perfect balance between getting the work done but also having fun. We really do have an incredible director.”
“The show is so confusingly brilliant”, Hatzilambrou says. Confusingly brilliant indeed.
A slow romantic waltz, sword fights, a kick line, swashbucklers, and the iconic bend-and-snap, this rendition of “Pirates of Penzance“ has it all.
“The Pirates of Penzance“ premiers on Nov. 11 at 8 pm at the Agassiz Theatre, with additional performances scheduled for the following weekend.

Just when you thought Marvel had already conquered every possible inch of the realm of pop culture, think again! Studio 8H, the legendary filming site of “Saturday Night Live,” will be the new home of Marvel fan favorites for two back-to-back weeks. Jonathan Majors, fresh off his buzzworthy debut as He Who Remains in the Disney+ series “Loki,” will be hosting the show on Nov. 13, followed by Simu Liu, the beloved star of “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” on Nov. 20. Both of these actors represent a new wave of Marvel stars, as they are only in the beginning stages of character arcs that are bound to continue throughout many films and seasons of television.
Beyond getting excited to see some of your favorite superheroes (and supervillains) try out goofy sketch comedy, the fact that “Saturday Night Live” is providing such a massive platform to stars like Jonathan Majors and Simu Liu should be celebrated. While it is true that every Marvel fanatic is aware of these actors and their obvious talent, “Saturday Night Live” is so different from anything Marvel produces that it will undoubtedly introduce a whole new demographic to these relatively new stars.
Moreover, pairing a lesser-known star like Jonathan Majors with an extremely well-established musical guest like Taylor Swift, who will be promoting the release of her latest re-recorded album “Red (Taylor’s Version),” only further amplifies the potential positive effect the show can have for an actor’s popularity. The same can be said of Kieran Culkin, a standout on HBO’s “Succession” who recently hosted the show on Nov. 6 with musical guest Ed Sheeran.
Although it must be tempting for “Saturday Night Live” to constantly recruit big name stars to host the show for the sake of ensuring high ratings, this trend of handing the stage over to budding talent is even more exciting. Audiences are already aware of how talented hosts and comedy legends such as Kristen Wiig and John Mulaney are at sketch comedy — and while space should and likely will always be made for them, hopefully the show continues to allow audiences to be surprised by the breadth of comedic talent present in Hollywood newcomers. With network television slowly but surely succumbing to streaming giants, “Saturday Night Live” possesses an increasingly rare form of cultural capital, and it is rather admirable for the show to employ that capital to broaden the scope of pop culture.
Inversely, it is rather remarkable that Marvel, which used to constitute a rather niche aspect of American culture, has garnered so much popularity in the public sphere that it can now send even some of its newest stars to the hallowed halls of 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

Where a great film evokes excitement and contemplation, a lesser one stumbles and is forgotten. As Ridley Scott’s latest addition to a stagnating filmography, “The Last Duel” lands in this latter rung, struggling to maintain narrative consistency. The movie follows the final severing of a dying friendship between knight Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) and squire Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) when De Carrouges accuses Le Gris of raping his wife, Marguerite (Jodie Comer). Riddled with jarring contrasts in tone, dialogue, and character development between its first and second halves, the film clumsily clashes with itself.
In principle, “The Last Duel” is a noble effort, heralding a unique perspective on the #MeToo of antiquity. At the core of the film, the rape trial becomes a debate of his word versus hers. With their pride on the line and no witnesses to attest to the truth, they leave the verdict in the hands of God. Based on a true story, the film cleverly twists historical accounts to send a message, paralleling contemporary cases of sexual assault. The film first omnisciently portrays all three perspectives (one being the husband’s) to imbue the audience with the power of divine judgment and subtly, but succinctly, guide it toward the truth. This method of storytelling is extremely powerful; the striking contrast between male and female perspectives is deeply unsettling, calling upon male viewers to examine their own biases and assumptions more closely.
“The Last Duel,” in its jarring structure, alienates a core part of its audience: women who are already aware of the horrors of sexual violence. The film glorifies toxic masculinity and overtly diminishes the importance of justice for survivors. With the humorous but dissolute Count Pierre d'Alençon (Ben Affleck) absorbing the attention of the audience, “The Last Duel” revels in loose and scandalous behavior rather than cautioning against it.
That being said, Scott and his crew squeezed the most out of a burdened plot. The performances from the four big names were inspiring and spectacular. Where Affleck breathes life into the Count, Comer’s wretched soul-piercing stare is deeply moving. Likewise, Driver and Damon add nuance to their characters’ tropes with subtlety and humanity. The costume and set design is as intricate as it is immersive, anchoring an otherwise sporadically-cut free-flowing film.
The strong, cohesive execution hides the weak screenplay and conflicting theme. The first half of the film plays very naturally, and the range of emotions felt by De Carrouges and Le Gris resonates with audiences. Independently, too, the last half wrestles between lies, honor, and delusion, strongly conveying a familiar dissonance that challenges the viewer’s beliefs without estranging them. To top it off, the titular last duel lives up to its reputation in gut-clenching, climactic form. It alone provides a sufficient excuse to appreciate the whole, wild experience of the film.
Ultimately, the film fails to tie its many threads together. At random points in the movie, characters flip on their heads. The level-headed charisma of Jacques is suddenly replaced with a rabid, lustful, and single-minded fiend. The logical but harsh conviction of Jean crumbles into a more irrational but caring husband. The firm independence of Marguerite loses its strength because of motherhood. Accordingly, the “The Last Duel” sends mixed messages — an inconsistency perhaps best highlighted in its dialogue. For the most part, the characters stay true to the lexicon of Middle English; but occasionally an odd phrase, distinct to contemporary vernacular, slips into conversation between characters, like Damon’s phrase “I am broke. I need money.” These moments, though sporadic, shatter the carefully constructed illusion of realism.
It is no surprise, then, to know that the screenplay’s three writers, Affleck, Damon, and Nicole Holofcener, each created one character’s narrative before synthesizing the three. Worst of all, however, the film is overly reliant on these incongruous arcs to achieve a compelling narrative. If “The Last Duel” comprised only the expository stories of Jean and Jacques, the movie would be a brainless medieval action flick without a message to drive home. Yet if the film only portrayed the rape trial, it would leave audiences without an emotional connection to the characteres, and any moralistic instruction would be trivialized. Unfortunately, the film’s ultimate message lies buried beneath its tangled storylines.

Behind the Cambridge H-Mart, a small outdoor theatre named Starlight Square set up purple banners and a small central stage. Here, The Asian American Playwright Collective presented Playfest 4: three programs of eight 10-minute plays on Sept. 17 and Sept. 18. Boston-based Asian American and Asian Pacific Islander playwrights, actors, and directors gathered to portray a variety of AAPI experiences. The brevity of each play was limiting in some contexts and endearing in others — while some plays attempted to span years, others used the short timeframe to highlight an enlightening conversation with broader subtexts — but all eight plays worked collectively to illuminate a rich discussion of AAPI experiences across generations in America.
A play that did this particularly well was “This Not Noboru” (dir. Hortense Gerardo). In the play, a retired physicist speaks with Dor (Karla G. Yang), a psychiatrist who pretends to be a robotics data analyst. The physicist, Ino (Lisa Fermin-Granada), called her son at 4:30 a.m. before the scene of the play and asked him what loneliness is. Dor asks Ino questions about Noboru Wataya (Jeomil Tovar), a robotic cat she made and converses with throughout the play, and it is implied that Dor is asking these questions to assess Ino’s mental health. The play asks where the line between real and imaginary lies after children grow up.
The play uses the small stage to its advantage to meditate on motherhood, loss, and aging through humorous interjections by Noburu and moving dialogue. At one point, Ino explains, “For me, Noburu is both dead and alive. You know, he reminds me of the things that have made up the days of my life. In that sense, he’s more real to me than my dead friends, or even my son, who answers my question about loneliness by calling a robotics firm to check in on me.” Fermin-Granada performs beautifully, balancing the line between confusion — at times the watcher is unsure if Ino is actually mentally impaired — and pride.
Another play that explores intergenerational family dynamics through a single conversation was “Door” (dir. Nico Pang). Andi (Jupiter Le) and Jamie (Jeomil Tovar), a gay couple, ruminate on their experiences with loss, family, ancestors, and love. Andi is troubled by the feeling of disappointing his ancestors, as his mother struggles to accept his sexuality. Jamie tells Andi of his experience with coming out, disclosing that he wished his mother died so that he could be free. The two describe their thoughts, and though the play never reaches a resolution and Andi never reconciles his feelings, the conversation sheds light on second-generation AAPI youth and their relationships with their parents’ expectations.
“Two Sides Same Coin” (dir. Michelle M. Aguillon) took another approach, presenting a narrative over a longer period of time. The play follows Gabby Torno (Karla G. Lang) and Mike Dodge (Jeff Lee), who are of similar age and are connected by the Vietnam War. Gabby’s father was a pilot who died bringing refugee orphaned children from the Vietnam War, while Mike was one of the children who was brought over by his father’s crew. The format of the play has Gabby and Mike standing at a distance from each other in the middle of the stage. Gabby and Mike tell the story linearly and with prose-like dialogue. Each speaks on their own, and when they interact, they act out their meeting and eventual friendship. Though the story attempts to explore themes of sacrifice and connection, the narrative pace is ultimately too ambitious. Instead of dwelling on the development of their relationship through their evolving subjective traumas, the majority of the play has the two characters narrating their stories apart.
The last play of the event, “Like Candy from a Baby” (dir. Michael Lin), showcases innovative live sound production. The foley artist (Tori Queeno) performs sounds that follow the narrative of two babies attempting to steal butter cookies from their exasperated mothers. From dropping bags of sand, to pouring water into glasses, to opening a creaky door contraption, to munching on a handful of Pocky sticks in front of the microphone, the foley artist’s compelling sonic performance on one side of the stage is full of small acts of creativity that bring the play to life. Humorous and intriguing, the play gives voice to the two babies and their mission to get into a locked cabinet of cookies. The mothers, one of whom is going to a baby shower to reconcile with her sister after their own mother’s death, have dialogue that interplays with the babies’ actions, and the stage — though small — holds these three worlds (foley, baby, mother) successfully.
These innovative short plays brought the small place to life. At times, fire alarms played in the background, and the integration of these plays with their outdoor environment enhanced the performances. Though some plays more successfully explored intergenerational relationships and the range of AAPI experiences than others, the event as a whole invited the audience to reckon with the nuance and recollection of immigrant experiences.

“The Souvenir Part II,” Joanna Hogg’s continuation of her 2019 semi-autobiagrophical drama, could have easily fit into a clichéd mold. A film about filmmaking at its core, the 2021 sequel might have joined the ranks of “Mank” or “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” flashy films that focus on movie production. But in a refreshingly sincere and intimate spin, Hogg creates a masterfully executed picture that elevates the prose of life into an emotive story about the making of a young director.
The film picks up where “The Souvenir” left off, following Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne), an aspiring director, as she continues with film school and navigates the trauma of a manipulative relationship. Disenchanted with her thesis project, she chooses to abandon it and, against the advice of her professors, produces a surrealist picture that revisits her past.
“I wanna show life as it happens in real life,” says Julie in an interview toward the end of the film. Hogg’s picture remains deeply committed to this mantra in depicting the intricacies of this real life-inspired story. Hogg relegates the behind-the-scenes of film production to the back seat, instead focusing on the interpersonal side — the stress and the trauma of past abuse. The result is a slow-paced, but incessantly insightful look into the life of a young director. The unintended consequence is audiences’ head scratching when the film devotes excessive attention to plotlines it fails to resolve or adequately address, though this aligns with the reality that life itself rarely offers closure.
Tilda Swinton, who plays Julie’s mother Rosalind (and is Honor Swinton Byrne’s real life mother), is mesmerizing, but doesn’t steal the spotlight. Her supporting role allows both actresses to bring a genuine sense of warmth to the screen and makes for a relationship with exceptional depth.
Unlike the veteran actress, the rest of the crew are relative newcomers, and this is apparent in the endearing earnestness of their performances. Somewhat counterintuitively, the rough-around-the-edges delivery enhances the film. Granted, there is a stiltedness to the friendly banter Julie engages in with her crewmembers — the arguments resemble faux high school drama, and awkwardness permeates the get-togethers with her parents. However, they manage to encapsulate the expectations of how those exchanges should look, if not exactly how they play out in reality.
Any issues with acting or pacing, however, dim in light of the remarkable cohesion of Hogg’s vision. Her close, lengthy shots from a static camera induce a sense that the audience is let in on a secret of sorts, watching from a few feet away, unbeknownst to the characters. This feeling is reinforced by the production design. Whether it’s a shot of a driving van, a cramped movie set, or a narrow corridor of a British apartment, the tightly confined set designs add an extra layer of intimacy.
The sound design serves the same purpose. Effects that would typically be no more than background noises, from leaves rustling in wind to muffled footsteps in the room next door, take center stage, reinforcing the sensation that the viewer is indeed there, surrounded by the same environment.
Conspicuously missing for the most part are saturated colors and music, and for a good reason. Hogg uses a distinctively warmer palette and uses music only a handful of times. It’s always sparing and deliberate, with a very specific focus in mind: the few scenes devoted to the filmmaking process. Whenever Julie finds herself on her set, working on her production, the screen quite literally jumps to life as saturation increases and music overpowers the otherwise ubiquitous background sounds. This remarkable confluence of the aural and the visual emphasizes the role of films as more than a source of entertainment, but also a transformative avenue for self-expression bound only by the creator’s willingness to gamble and innovate.
“The Souvenir Part II,” with its seemingly unassuming plot and characters, was a gamble that could have easily failed. But in her unwillingness to compromise in the bold pursuit of depicting her experiences with all their intricacies, Joanna Hogg crafted a compelling depiction of a young director’s growth that allows the audience and the protagonist to feel the same appreciation for the art of filmmaking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Audiences of “A Mouthful of Air,” Amy Koppelman’s deeply personal tale about postpartum depression, will likely want to leave with a greater understanding of such a complex and underrepresented issue. However, it is difficult to walk away from the nearly two-hour film without a distinct sense of hopelessness, disorientation, and uncomfortable despair. Based on Koppelman’s 2003 novel, “A Mouthful of Air” chronicles the struggle of new mother and children’s book author Julie Davis (Amanda Seyfried), who suffers from crippling postpartum depression and anxiety. In a candy-colored and sunlit 90’s New York partially sketched in crayon, Julie is submerged in a world of doubt and darkness, as the film opens with an unnervingly calm shot of her suicide attempt. While Seyfried proves to be a phenomenal actress, “A Mouthful of Air” is underdeveloped in every aspect from storyline to character development, failing in its sincere attempt to raise awareness of postpartum depression.
Julie is the focal point of the film, and Seyfried’s emotive face dominates nearly every shot. This focus benefits the film by avoiding the unnecessary graphics of suicide à la “13 Reasons Why” and showing off Seyfried’s dramatic range — but it also makes Julie’s lack of character development impossible to ignore. The film suggests, through blurry flashbacks and crayon animations, that Julie’s mental illness stems from a vague history of abuse and abandonment from her father. The backstory is never fleshed out nor adequately explained, undermining the film’s emphasis on how common and uncontrollable postpartum depression can be. Instead, Julie’s father is referenced in conversations with her mother for half the film before appearing without warning or closure in Julie’s suburban life for a few minutes of screentime.
The entire film feels like it’s walking on eggshells: Koppelman is worried about taking risks with such sensitive material and viewers spend the entire film waiting for Julie’s inevitable collapse. Julie’s conversations with her therapist (Paul Giamatti), her husband Ethan (Finn Wittrock), and her mother (Amy Irving) feel forced and scripted, every line drawn directly from a mental health PSA. Her therapist even quotes Sylvia Plath. While the film does depict some of the tension between the couple, Ethan’s character only begins to scratch the surface of the heartbreak in loving someone with mental illness. Their love, their narrative, and their learning go woefully underdeveloped, perhaps an unfortunate byproduct of the Julie-centric approach.
Crayon-drawn animations and Julie’s children’s stories are sprinkled throughout the film, providing some respite from the tightly framed close-ups of Julie’s despair. These short interludes are certainly better than the graphic depictions of self-harm and grief that Koppelman could have leaned on, but they do end up adding to the facile nature of the film.
While audiences may want to leave this exploration of postpartum depression as an ally, it can be difficult to critique the effectiveness of Koppelman’s film as someone who has never experienced motherhood or postpartum mental illness. But after watching two hours of traumatic pain end in what felt like Julie’s inevitable suicide despite external support and love, it is impossible not to feel hopeless and lost. In trading away nuance to avoid risks, the film fails to educate viewers on the complexities of postpartum depression and falls short of meaningful engagement. Viewers leave with more questions than answers and a vague feeling that they are subscribing to some terrible stereotypes. Instead, meaningful engagement with the film can occur outside of the theater. A single Google search can unearth an extensive range of personal accounts and lead to honest, eye-opening, and deeply moving reflections. But audiences shouldn’t be required to do research to understand a film.
Koppelman’s “A Mouthful of Air” presents vital visibility for postpartum depression, but does not reach deeply enough into its characters’ complexity to sufficiently accomplish the task of education. For an introduction to postpartum depression, check out OASH’s and Mayo Clinic’s overviews.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Kenneth Branagh, the director best known for a slew of 1990s Shakespeare adaptations, delivers a black-and-white film set in 1960s Northern Ireland, one could be forgiven if they expect a high-brow historical drama. But in “Belfast,” Branagh takes audiences on a trip down memory lane. Not unlike Cuarón’s “Roma,” Branagh’s film tells a touching, unabashedly human story of eerily normal family struggles in the midst of nightmarish circumstances.
“Belfast,” a semi-autobiographical drama set in the eponymous Northern Irish capital in 1969 and 1970, chronicles the struggles of a working class, Protestant family living in a Catholic neighborhood. During The Troubles, a period of sectarian and nationalist conflict, such living arrangements proved tenuous. Today, the question of Northern Ireland remains delicate, with renewed tensions in light of Brexit.
Fortunately, though the black-and-white picture is told from the Unionist perspective (corresponding with most Protestant views) of Buddy (Jude Hill) and his parents (Caitríona Balfe and Jamie Dornan), it represents the complex conflict in all shades of grey. Branagh isn’t afraid to use sharp juxtaposition to get this point across. For instance, an on-screen assertion that Catholicism is a religion of fear quickly cuts to a Protestant pastor beginning a frenzied sermon by saying “Protestants, you will die.” Neighborly prejudice is juxtaposed against neighborly kindness. And instead of placing the blame squarely on the Catholics, the film also depicts the violent Protestant mobs escalating conflict in the city.
Branagh’s portrayal of violence, however, is much less successful. While nostalgic, “Belfast” is by no means a film that looks at the past through rose-tinted glasses. But unlike films such as “In the Name of the Father,” which depicted a world where violence was so commonplace that people had to learn to live with it, Branagh’s picture begins on August 15, 1969, just the second day of violent clashes in the city, and the second day of the 30-year-long presence of the British Army. And yet instead of showing the impact of the sudden outbreak of violence on the film’s characters, the neighbors seem unfazed as they erect barricades.
That being said, emphasizing normalcy in the face of violence helps the film create sympathetic characters. Despite the grim reality of the times, Branagh’s “Belfast” is at its best when it allows audiences to feel emotionally attached in protagonists’ everyday struggles.
At first, the black-and-white might reinforce a sense of disconnect. But somehow, it does the opposite: Explosions are less flashy without reds and yellows. And without color, the historically accurate sets are given short shrift. More importantly, pairing the film’s colorlessness with the relative brightness of the monochromatic palette highlights the character’s emotions and body language, making for a more immersive experience and almost forcing the viewer to sympathize.
Furthermore, the film goes out of its way to make its black-and-white setting more familiar through its frequent references to the past. Even though “Belfast” is set in 1960s and 70s Northern Ireland, “Star Trek” is playing in the living room, jokes about Westerns with Raquel Welch and Buddy’s trips to cinema with the obligatory cup of soda and a bag of popcorn go a long way toward making the setting much more relatable.
The performances play a key role in highlighting Branagh’s focus on human emotion. Hill endows his protagonist with unparalleled innocence and affability. His face expresses the frustration and the confusion with the murky rules of the adult world one would expect from an actual child. He brings a sweet awkwardness to his character’s relationship with his school sweetheart Catherine (Olive Tennant). Hill is unhindered by his lack of experience, the only obstacle being the script’s occasionally stilted dialogue.
The film’s supporting characters also do a good job: Judy Dench’s talent is not wasted, and she has the chance to shine with her trademark witticisms. Even more stunning is Caitríona Balfe’s depiction of Buddy’s mother. Afforded the most difficult task by far, with scenes ranging from an emotional breakdown to dealing with mobsters and a hostage situation, Balfe more than delivers and is responsible for some of the film’s dramatic highlights.
Branagh’s bold pursuit of his vision pays off. “Belfast” is a consistently convincing, engrossing family story that successfully asserts itself against the film’s nightmarish reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An MIT president once likened an education from our Cambridge rivals to "trying to get a drink of water from a fire hose." Harvard may not require this firehose approach to learning, but it certainly permits it. Many of my peers will remember at least one semester that left them gasping for air, and many would be hard-pressed to remember a semester that didn't.
There's a romanticism to the idea of jumping headlong into a challenge and reaching our limits as we just try to push through. There are also genuine practical reasons to be drawn to the firehose approach, and it's worth reflecting on those before we condemn it. Ultimately, though, overcommitting does erode curiosity in dangerous ways that are easy to overlook when we’re filling our Crimson carts and comp schedules.
In the real world, we can't possibly be expected to fully understand every fact or tool we put to use. Programmers don't exegete every library they import, and engineers don't demand proof for every theorem they use. The same applies to research, where getting to the frontier requires tolerating a very incomplete and pragmatic approach to learning. Certainly, it would be absurd to require fully understanding Plato (whatever that means) before moving to Aristotle. It follows that working with incomplete knowledge of overwhelming information is a valuable skill.
Even more practically, if the biggest limit on your productivity is external motivation, then that’s another good argument for overcommitting. If you more than double the work assigned to yourself, then even if you only truly grasp half of it, you’re still better off on net.
In our list of ever-less-respectable reasons to overcommit, we eventually reach ego. If I can show how smart I am by taking a harder class, I'm tempted. Even if I don't understand the material particularly well at the end, the ego remains undented; after all, it was an unreasonably difficult class.
Despite these driving causes, some more persuasive than others, the firehose approach has serious costs. I'll focus on only one: getting comfortable with partial understanding.
If you're at Harvard, odds are that at some point you were constitutionally incapable of accepting on faith things that you couldn't understand for yourself. It's difficult to do as much academic work as admission requires without this kind of intrinsic curiosity. Likewise, it's difficult to do that work as well as required without the kind of insights (however embarrassingly shallow in hindsight) that come from rigorously questioning what you are taught.
I certainly felt that compulsion for full understanding once. I don't anymore. I know a lot of much brighter friends who have undergone similar transitions.
The mechanism is very simple. By sufficiently overcommitting, it becomes impossible to learn the material of each class or extracurricular fully. Instead, you're forced to learn just enough to fulfill your commitments. If you do this for several years you will, unsurprisingly, become accustomed to understanding things only as much as is necessary to do your work well.
In my case, not only did the need for full explanations start to fade. I became actively impatient with such explanations because I became used to not having enough time. Now, even when I do have time, that impatience remains ingrained by habit.
It would be inappropriate to blame Harvard. Firehose learning often starts well before enrollment, and besides; what could Harvard do? Cut its most rigorous classes? Limit the number of commitments students can take on? Such blunt responses would entirely misunderstand the problem.
Instead, the responsibility lies broadly with us. If I've made any progress, it's in realizing that a general “need to know” is deeply valuable. Even in the best case, where drinking from the firehose leads to learning more material in the medium term, it chips away at that need to know in the long term.
Surely, we can strike a balance. Some firehosing is useful to build the skills necessary to eventually do real work or research. It will occasionally be necessary to use a result we can’t prove or quote a passage we don’t fully understand. But we can plan our commitments at Harvard so we only have to do so rarely. And at the very least, we should feel a little guilty whenever we do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Arabic word for human, Insaan, comes from “forgetful.” I cannot think of a more fitting root.
The school year always seems to go by too quickly and not quickly enough all at once. Regardless of the relative speed one feels on any given day, however, there is no doubt that the routine can very quickly feel like a black hole. I have noticed especially in the college environment that it is so easy to get warped into a cycle that blocks out every other aspect of life. It becomes almost impossible to escape the Harvard bubble and soon, you can forget that there was ever a world outside of campus.
In these first few months of my freshman year, I have devoted a lot of time to getting my bearings. Unfortunately, that means a lot of time dissecting assignments and managing classes and extracurriculars within the confines of Harvard’s campus. Sometimes, when the weekend rolls around, I don’t even register it — so consumed by this tunnel vision, I can easily lose track of time and forget the days of the week.
Even on days that I have chosen to step away for a study break, I find myself still surrounded by the pressure of being “at school” in a sense. My days off are usually spent at venues in the Square itself and every once in a while when I do venture into greater Cambridge or Boston, I still feel bombarded by college logos and familiar faces on the trip with me. I am almost afraid that I will forget what a normal, non-college city looks and feels like.
A few weeks ago, I took the weekend for a hike in New Hampshire with some friends. It is astonishing what a single excursion can do. Stepping away from the land of cellular service for just a handful of hours can only be described as refreshing. For the first hour, my fingers twitched to check my email or text my pset group, as the day went on, I found myself flushed of any school-related thoughts for the first time in over two months. Instead, I was able to take time to truly observe the world around me with a clear head.
Seeing the undisturbed world was like stepping out of the fog. It is hard to put into words the connection I felt with nature in a way that I never have before. Something inside me came awake and screamed at me to drop my trivial worries and escape to this world, the real and raw and unfiltered world that we were meant to be in. I felt a surge in me that this was the place we all truly belong in, the world without the obstructions and distractions of our modern world.
When we reached the end of our hike, we took a moment to share our reflections. We all shared how mentally revitalized we felt. One individual pointed out that it is easy on campus to lose track of time with schoolwork — we don’t even blink when four or five hours have passed on a lab or pset but it seems that we are rationing time when it comes to personal health and spiritual recharge. We forget that we are human beings and not just robots that can perform the same task every day without a break to appreciate the simpler things in life.
I have realized since then how important — necessary, even — it is to take healthy doses of breaks to the outside world. These breaks don’t have to be elaborate: When my parents visited for First-Year Family Weekend, we ran mundane errands together. Our Saturday morning TJ Maxx and McDonald’s run felt more fulfilling than another hour of studying in a campus cafe. While we shopped a half hour away from Cambridge, I watched regular families go about their day and thought to myself how real those lives appeared.
In my head, I calculated that while our lives at Harvard right now feel like our end-all-be-all, there will soon come a moment where we have to step out of the bustling Harvard bubble with our experiences and actually use them in the world. It’s hard to remember that while we are at Harvard now, it is only a tiny window of the broader world we are a part of.
I sometimes feel like a pantomime going about the motions of a Harvard student day in and day out. I stick with the status quo so tightly that it slips my mind to ever make time for myself. I believe it’s important for all of us to internalize the potentially suffocating nature of a college environment and, more than that, the necessity to periodically step away from it. Some days, it is in fact more beneficial to step away from our screens than to crank out another hour in front of our iPads.
It’s wonderful to be surrounded by the colorful Harvard life but we must also remember that there is a real world out there, the world we truly belong in and will have to return to once this four-year dream is over.
As Insaan, it is inevitable that we will from time to time forget what day it is, or that there is a world outside our campus microcosm. It’s important to take a breath and remember that we belong to something bigger.

The Biden administration’s most recent attempt to cut costs may be its most costly decision of all: When the administration scaled back its $3.5 trillion social safety net bill to $1.75 trillion, it dropped free community college. We are disappointed by this decision, which fetters and delays a much-needed investment that, in the long run, would promise to benefit our entire country and economy.
President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill may now only be half of its previous cost, but the administration will pay the price elsewhere. This cost will come in the form of lost talents and abilities that would have benefited our future workforce and society as a whole. Indeed, research demonstrates that access to college enables people to flourish in the job market and become more active and productive citizens more broadly. To that end, the financial barriers that prevent individuals from pursuing higher education create losses and harms that are in fact communal, even when they appear to be individual and marginal. In other words, education always pays off: It’s one of the best investments that we could possibly make.
Why else should the Biden administration work harder and faster to make higher education accessible across the board? Perhaps because of the fact that, in the United States, college tuition costs are disproportionately steep and inequitable to begin with. All that it takes is a quick internet search to see that the average cost of college tuition in the United States is among the highest worldwide. And even beyond that, our system further burdens individuals with massive student loan debts that exacerbate the problem with time. Against this backdrop, we are disheartened and fearful that, as long as the Biden administration continues to put the provision of free community college on the backburner, students will continue to be dissuaded from higher education or in financial duress because of it.
We have opined in favor of student debt relief in the past, but while necessary, this alone will not suffice to heal our ailing and inequitable higher education system. Debt relief is reactive in nature, as it benefits college graduates only after they have taken out loans and experienced financial burdens during their college years. Tuition-free community college, on the other hand, helps improve higher education accessibility in the U.S. from the outset by lowering the barrier to entry and allowing those who otherwise cannot afford higher education to enroll and obtain a degree. Tuition-free community college offers what debt relief cannot, leaving us troubled to see it cut from Biden’s current spending package.
During a recent CNN town hall, Biden made us all a promise: “I promise you — I guarantee it — we’re going to get free community college in the next several years, across the board.” We maintain hope that Biden will stay true to his word, even if this commitment is appearing increasingly fickle and distant at the moment. But in the meantime, we urge the administration to take deliberate steps to help compensate for this blunted promise, such as providing a larger increase in the Federal Pell Grants awarded to low-income undergraduate students.
We have opined on many issues related to higher education and explored what we think it ought to be. We maintain that higher education can – and should – take on many varying forms. But in all of these forms, it must be one thing: accessible.

Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health received an award from the National Institutes of Health last month for their program focused on improving data science in Africa.
The program — “Research Training on Harnessing Data Science for Global Health Priorities in Africa” — is a collaboration with scientists at Heidelberg University to create a “training hub” at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to build the capacity of data systems in Africa. Through a strong data science infrastructure, the researchers believe Africa will make strides in its healthcare systems and its fight against climate change.
The Harvard-affiliated program was one of 19 research initiatives that the NIH recognized on Oct. 26 with a total award of $74.5 million.
The initiative will also include UKZN South Africa’s partner institutions in Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda, which make up the Africa Research Implementation Science and Education Network. The program aims to strengthen the data science capacity of those partner institutions, with a focus on tackling critical global health challenges through data.
“The whole vision really comes from a long-standing partnership — and that’s the key word we use — between us and our collaborators,” said Wafaie Fawzi, a principal investigator of the program. “Our common purpose is really to have an impact on the health of populations.”
According to Fawzi, “data science is a new field that’s bringing together various disciplines from statistics and epidemiology to computer science and machine learning.”
The program is designed as a “hub and spoke” model, per Fawzi. The so-called “hub” of the program is in Durban, South Africa, at the UKZN South Africa, where researchers plan to establish a new master’s degree program in health data science. The goal of the hub, Fawzi said, is to “train the trainers,” who will eventually become the “spokes” of the program by bringing their expertise to the program’s partner institutions in Ghana and Nigeria in West Africa, and Tanzania and Uganda in East Africa.
Fawzi said that data on public health and the environment in Africa already exists. The program aims to develop a generation of data scientists in Africa who can use the data to improve public health in the region.
“The purpose of this proposal is to train the next generation of leaders in this area that can harness the data that’s already there, and make use of it for the benefit of population health.”
The researchers believe that the self-sustaining program will lead to better management of limited medical and hospital resources and more precise diagnoses, according to Fawzi.
The coronavirus pandemic reaffirmed the importance of expanding data science studies in African nations, Fawzi said.
By being able to organize health and resource data effectively, African nations will be one step ahead in pandemic preparedness, which Fawzi says relies on “the ability to access data from multiple sources in a short period of time, in a way that can be integrated across places and across domains.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just 10 days after its last strike, Harvard’s graduate student union announced a new strike deadline Monday — if the University does not address its “unfair labor practices” and offer an “acceptable deal” by Nov. 16, student workers will go on a “strike of undetermined length.”
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers will hold a special membership meeting next Monday as a final opportunity to avert picketing beginning the following day, according to an email to members. If the strike begins, the union will hold similar meetings every three days where members can motion to put the continuation of the strike to a 24-hour membership-wide vote. The strike would continue until the union votes to end it.
Should HGSU-UAW strike next week, it would be the union’s third strike in less than two years. In 2019, the union went on strike for 29 days. Last month, it went on strike for three days.
The union and Harvard have not met for a formal bargaining session since Oct. 27, the first day of the previous strike. The union continues to call for higher compensation, new procedures to handle discrimination and harassment complaints, and union security.
HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said Monday he thinks progress in bargaining has slowed because the University does not want to engage with the latter two demands.
The union wants an agency shop, which would require all student workers represented in the bargaining unit to contribute to union activities or a student worker health fund. It is also requesting that Title IX hearing and appellate panels be composed of a majority of third-party individuals. In its latest package of proposals released Oct. 26, the University remains opposed to both provisions.
“Those are the two major issues still that we’re very far apart on,” Mancilla said. “Any discussion of compensation or the other articles in the contract that have not been settled yet are really being held up because of that — because the University does not want to engage with those proposals.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Monday that the two parties have continued informal discussions since the conclusion of the previous strike.
“The two parties have met since HGSU-UAW’s three-day strike ended on Oct. 29, in off-the-record conversations, concerning issues on which the two sides have not yet reached an agreement,” Newton wrote. “The University remains committed to reaching an agreement with HGSU-UAW.”
The union also alleges Harvard committed multiple unfair labor practices tied to last month’s strike. HGSU-UAW claims that University police officers, faculty, and administrators intimidated strikers during picketing and that Harvard is now threatening to deduct wages from those who participated without sufficient explanation.
An unfair labor practice is an official complaint to the National Labor Relations Board, which triggers an investigatory process.
Newton added that Harvard is “unaware” of any actions that would warrant filing an unfair labor practice.
“The University is unaware of any illegal action taken by any member of the University administration or HUPD during the three-day strike that ended on Oct. 29, nor has HGSU-UAW provided, to date, any specific details regarding such allegations,” he wrote.
According to HGSU-UAW Sergeant-at-Arms Maya I. Anjur-Dietrich, the union plans to file the new unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB later this week and is currently finalizing details.
The new complaints will join two others the union has open before the NLRB. In July, the union filed an unfair labor practice alleging that the University had failed to provide information about the bargaining unit and Harvard policies. The next month, the union filed another unfair labor practice, this time for “Refusal to Bargain/Bad Faith Bargaining,” according to the NLRB website.
In announcing the strike deadline Monday, the union said Harvard must address the unfair labor practice charges and provide “a significantly-improved counter proposal” by Nov. 16 to avert another strike.
If the University offers the union a contract before the strike deadline that addresses some, but not all HGSU-UAW’s demands, Mancilla said the bargaining committee would put the agreement to a membership-wide vote asking student workers if the new offer is good enough to call off the strike.
If bargaining comes down to the wire and the University returns such an offer on Nov. 15, the union will hold a membership-wide vote on it starting at 6 p.m. The strike would still officially begin at midnight, but union leadership would advise members to refrain from withholding labor for 24 hours until the vote’s conclusion at 6 p.m. the next day, according to the announcement.
Based on those results, members would either strike on Nov. 17 or return to work.

Harvard’s Sex Week, an annual series of events featuring student panels and workshops on sexual health and intimacy, began on Monday.
During the coming week, student organization Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College, or SHEATH, is hosting a wide array of discussions ranging from BGLTQ intimacy to sex toys. This year’s programming includes 19 events from Monday to Sunday, such as “A+ Students, F Boys: A Student Panel on Dating and Hookups in College” and “What, What, In the Butt?: Anal Sex 101.”
Andie E. Turner '20-’22, co-president of SHEATH, said Sex Week’s goal is to generate “natural, organic, ongoing conversation” with College students about sex and sexuality.
“We include events that are as inclusive, diverse, encouraging of open dialogue as possible for students who both have come to Harvard with little to no sex education in their hometowns, which is my case, or students that had grown up in families or communities that have much more of an open discourse with regards to sexuality, sex intimacy, but just want to further their knowledge,” Turner said.
Sex Week, which began in 2012, was canceled last year due to Covid-19. Despite initial fears of low attendance, SHEATH co-president Karina A. Pimenta ’22 said the turnout for the first few events of the week was “overwhelming.”
“This is the biggest attendance we've ever had for Sex Week ever, since its creation,” Pimenta said. “We were a little stressed with how we're going to replan things to accommodate for that amount of people, but we're really happy with the turnout.”
Pimenta and Turner reported audience numbers reaching 360 students who packed into Sever Hall’s auditorium for the three events hosted on Monday.
“I think it's a really awesome opportunity for the campus, for students, to learn a lot more about sex and to change a culture of taboo, and basically just make it so that people have more knowledge and can have safer, funner sex,” audience member Shojeh C. Liu ’23 said.
Jamie Joy — a queer Jewish sex educator and guest speaker for the discussion “Kinks & Fetishes & and Taboos, Oh My!” — said they were “very pleased” that students filled the auditorium.
“To have students creating this program for other students is a really big deal, and especially on a campus that has a long history of not necessarily being sex positive or a queer positive space,” Joy said. “They're trailblazing.”
Pimenta said she feels that the panel discussion on kinks, fetishes, and taboos on Monday empowered students to have more open conversations about sexuality. She praised Joy for their efforts to engage the audience with the themes of the week.
“They opened the floor up for discussion, like, ‘Hey, talk to the person next to you, ask them what they're comfortable with, what they like, what they don't like,’” Pimenta said. “Having an opportunity to talk within here obviously doesn't reflect on the day-to-day outside of Sex Week, but hopefully, it's one of the first steps for people to have that opening.”
Meadow R. Hall ’24, an attendee, described the discussion as “very welcoming.”
“Being in a room — a lecture hall, specifically — to just learn more about it and see how all of our peers interact within that community was really nice,” Hall said. “It was also very comforting, especially coming from a Bible Belt town where sex is very taboo, to just be in a community where you having the relationship with your body and your partner's body is totally fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers have developed a method to deploy gene therapy — altering genes to help treat or prevent disease — in specifically targeted cells, potentially opening doors to powerful therapeutic applications.
The group, which also includes researchers from MIT, was able to detect specific RNA sequences inside target cells and turn on an artificial gene — known as a transgene — in those cells to produce a desired protein, per a paper published in Nature Biotechnology last month.
Due to the ease of distinguishing different cell types by looking at their RNA sequences, researchers chose the RNA as the target identifier, according to Evan M. Zhao, a postdoctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and co-lead author of the paper.
“RNA accounts for many of the differences within a cell, so it’s the most programmable part of the central dogma — DNA to RNA to protein — where you start to see drastic differences between different cells in your body,” Zhao said. “So even though the muscle cell or a skin cell has drastically different protein sequences and RNA, the DNA is the exact same.”
According to the paper, the group developed RNA sequences called “eukaryotic toehold switches,” or “eToeholds,” that bind to ribosomes — the sites for protein synthesis in cells — in a way that inhibits the expression of its specific protein unless another target RNA sequence is present.
When the target RNA sequence is detected, the inhibition is disrupted and the protein coded by the eToehold can be expressed.
Angelo S. Mao ’10, co-lead author and technology development fellow at the Wyss Institute, said this allowed the group to turn on a specific gene by testing for whether or not the cell has a “target RNA of interest.” This also avoids off-target expression of proteins in other cells, which presents dangers because a desired effect in one cell type or body part may be harmful in another.
Mao said that the specificity of this new technique has many potential therapeutic applications, such as making cancer cells produce a toxic protein just inside those cells that leads to cell death — essentially causing the malignant cells to eliminate themselves
“If you know that the cancer cell has this particular RNA signature, then you can engineer the eToehold to produce an apoptotic protein, for instance, like a toxin or a protein that’s going to lead to cell death,” Mao said. “You program it so that it’s only expressed in the cancer cell that has the mutation.”
According to Zhao, the next steps for the group’s research include introducing logic gating into the technique, so that the detection of RNA sequences can be sensitive to logical “and” or “or” conditions, and exploring the implementation of detecting small molecules in addition to RNA sequences.
“We’re working on making them better, so we’re working on making the module more concise, making it more robust to make it work more often,” Zhao said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders in the news and tech industries argued in favor of government legislation to combat the spread of misinformation in digital media at an event hosted by the Institute of Politics Monday.
The event — entitled “Global News and Technology Leadership in Challenging Times” — featured Nobel Peace Prize-winning journalist Maria A. Ressa, former New York Times CEO Mark J. Thompson, McClatchy CEO Craig Forman, and Google’s Vice President of News Richard Gingras. Nancy R. Gibbs, who serves as the director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy at the Kennedy School, moderated the discussion.
Gibbs asked panelists to explain the financial and reputational decline in traditional “legacy” media.
Ressa argued that “incentive schemes” of the internet are not aligned with democracy. While traditional news sources operate under a hierarchy of editors who meticulously scrutinize reporting, digital media platforms today treat fact and fiction “identically.”
Forman argued that newsrooms’ shift to the internet and social media led to a “battle for audience attention,” in which news sources played to emotion and entertainment to attract audiences.
Thompson explained how the rise of technology disrupted print journalism’s economic model. While newspapers used people’s reliance on their services to generate revenue through subscriptions, the internet undermined that economic model by offering information to users for free.
Referring to legacy media as “lazy” and entitled, Thompson said newspapers did not respond to digital disruption fast enough.
While Gingras, the executive at Google, acknowledged that the internet disrupted traditional news sources, he argued that the internet increases the free flow of information and promotes free expression.
Free expression, he noted, is a double-edged sword.
“The key question is how do we manage the [free] expression,” Gingras said. “How do we win back the trust? How do we understand what people really need and want from journalism?”
Panelists also shared their views on the extent to which digital media platforms are responsible for mitigating the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and fake news.
Criticizing media platforms, Thompson argued that algorithms cannot effectively distinguish misinformation from truth.
He also pushed back on the argument that the spread of misinformation is “an inevitable byproduct” of digital media, which has many positive effects.
“I’m not sure that the net of this, particularly in civics, is necessarily positive,” Thompson said.
Gingras argued that politicians share blame for the spread of misinformation online.
Ressa responded by introducing a “chicken and egg question.” She acknowledged that leaders frequently manipulate the “information ecosystem,” but asserted that the ecosystem itself enables them to engage in such manipulation.
Ressa, whose investigative journalism exposed wrongdoing by the Filipino government, was the target of a misinformation campaign on social media launched by the government in retaliation.
“What happened in the Philippines, for example, I don’t think it would have been possible to have filed so many charges against me in two years without the aid of astroturfing online,” she said.
Forman argued against the “blame-game,” and advocated for sectors across society to collectively take action against misinformation.
Ressa proposed legislation that regulates algorithms, which she claimed make people susceptible to misinformation and as a result undermine democracy.
“If no guardrails are in place, we will not have integrity of elections without integrity of facts, which means I could go to jail,” she said. “I’ve got skin in the game.”

Non-marine crabs began to live on land at least 100 million years ago, according to recently published research by evolutionary biologists, including Javier Luque, a researcher at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.
The researchers studied an amber fossil of a complete crab dating back to the Cretaceous Period, which began almost 150 million years ago. Amber fossils form when organisms are preserved in tree resin, indicating that crabs had migrated onto land by the time of this fossil’s formation.
Researchers had previously predicted that crabs began colonizing land at least 125 million years ago, but the earliest previously known fossil record of non-marine crabs only dated to roughly 75 million years ago — leaving a 50 million year gap.
Luque and his colleagues — including researchers from China University of Geosciences, Yale University, Lynn University, Yunnan University, The University of Regina and the Longyin Amber Museum — published their findings in Science Advances last month.
Luque said the fossil is the most complete fossil of a crab ever discovered.
“It is virtually complete with antennas, eyes, mouth parts, and even super tiny hairs all over the body,” Luque said. “Moreover, it has preservation of soft to lightly mineralized tissues that are seldom preserved, such as the lungs, and the gills inside the body.”
The Longyin Amber Museum acquired the fossil in 2015 after discovering it on the jewelry market. Luque said he was contacted about the discovery in 2018.
“So these researchers from China discovered it in the market, they recognized the importance, they rescue it, and they had it in their museum,” Luque said. “One of them contacted me because they knew I was studying the crab evolution and asked me what did I think and if I wanted to study it and that's why we started the project in 2018.”
The fossil is being studied as part of a larger project working to piece together the evolutionary history of crabs through the study of living crabs and fossils.
Luque said the Cretaceous period was a “crucial moment for the evolution of crabs,” as the species became a “bigger player in the evolution of life in the oceans and inland” by moving into new non-marine habitats.
“One of the things that this animal challenges is our understanding of how many times and in which groups the invasion into novel habitats has occurred,” Luque said.
Luque said this discovery is part of the “cretaceous crab revolution” — the mass expansion and species diversification of crabs that occurred a hundred million years ago.
“One of the things we want to see is why certain groups of crabs are so diverse and have hundreds of species, whereas a few other groups have only one species,” Luque said. “And the question is, ‘What can we predict about the evolution of crab forms through time based on their genes ecology?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Undergraduate Council President Noah A. Harris ’22 and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22 defended the Council against accusations that it committed tax fraud by failing to maintain its nonprofit status in an interview Monday.
Presidential ticket Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23 and Joy Y. Lin ’23 launched their campaign last week on the premise that the Council is “incompetent” and is committing tax fraud by not filing for nonprofit status.
The UC has not filed for non-profit status since 2008, and its non-profit status was revoked in 2012, according to filings with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
By failing to register as a nonprofit, Zimmerman argued that the UC “dissolved” itself, citing the Council’s constitution.
The UC constitution mandates the Council register as a nonprofit with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In the event that it fails to do so, the UC must dissolve itself and redistribute its funding.
“If the corporation dissolves without a legal successor, then its residual assets shall be distributed among the house committees and the First-Year Class Committee, on a per-undergraduate basis, if possible,” reads Section 12.4 of the UC constitution.
“According to their own bylaws — the very thing which defines them and allows them to do things — they no longer exist, and they haven’t existed for nine years,” Zimmerman said in an interview.
“Harvard deserves a student government that exists,” Zimmerman and Lin wrote in an email sent over House email lists. “Help us build it.”
Harris and Gan refuted the Zimmerman-Lin campaign’s allegations in the interview Monday. Though they acknowledged that the Council has not filed as a nonprofit since 2008, they said the Council is under no obligation to do so, given its capacity as a student organization within Harvard.
“The UC is not officially registered as anything with the state government. The UC is an organization that falls under Harvard College and the school’s status as tax-exempt. As a result, the UC has tax-exempt status,” Harris wrote in an emailed statement after the interview.
Harris and Gan both said they do not know why the Council stopped filing for its nonprofit status almost a decade ago. Gan speculated that the Council stopped filing because a nonprofit status offered few benefits compared to the amount of time it took to maintain.
Gan said the UC constitution needs to be updated to supplant “outdated clauses.”
“We need to update the Constitution because it’s old. It’s been a while so we’re working on that and we’re going to be doing a full overhaul of the constitution because of these outdated clauses,” Gan said.
Gan added that she wants candidates to devote their campaigns to strategizing “how we’re going to improve the lives of people” rather than focusing on the fine print.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The human resting metabolic rate and levels of physical activity have declined in the United States since 1830, according to a recent study by researchers in Harvard’s Department of Human Evolutionary Biology.
The study found a 6 percent reduction in human resting metabolic rate since 1830, which suggests an average decrease of 27 minutes of “moderate to vigorous” daily physical activity, such as walking or jogging. The researchers attributed the change to a decrease in physical activity due to technological advancement.
The study was conducted by Andrew K. Yegian, a postdoctoral fellow in HEB and Daniel E. Lieberman, a professor of Biological Sciences and HEB, along with Louisiana State University’s Steven Hymsfield. The findings were published last month in Current Biology.
Lieberman, whose lab the study was conducted in, said the idea to use temperature data to depict the change came from a study he and his lab read that attributed the decrease in human average temperature to changes in the demand of the immune system.
“I was particularly interested in the fact that they had inferred in the paper that the reason for this decline was less immune function,” he said. “It's not an unreasonable hypothesis, but there's a bunch of other studies which kind of disprove that, or call that into question.”
“So, I thought, I don't believe that,” he added.
Lieberman said he set out to understand metabolism as a result of industrialization and trends of declining physical fitness rather than decreasing immune function.
“Let's see if we can use body temperature as a thermometer to estimate how much less physical activity people have been doing,” he said.
Yegian said he believes it is crucial to quantify the decline in physical activity.
“It's really important to start putting numbers on that so that we can get a sense of ‘Okay, what were the levels back at a certain point in time?’ and ‘How many people get that kind of physical activity nowadays? And ‘What kind of increase in activity would it take to get to that point?’”
Lieberman said even minor technological changes to everyday life impact humans’ overall physical activity.
“Our modern world of elevators and escalators and shopping carts and, you know, all these devices that we've created that have made manual labor more rare,” he said.
Lieberman said this broader decline in physical activity among humans can be seen around campus.
“We know that the vast majority of Harvard students don't exercise very much,” he said. “Back in the day, Harvard students didn't have elevators that could take them up various buildings, and they had to walk around campus because there weren't shuttle buses.”
This change has significant repercussions for human health, Lieberman said.
“It should concern us all, because it affects long-term health, and heart disease, and cancer, and Alzheimer's, and diabetes, and the list goes on,” he said.
Lieberman said the decrease in physical activity requirements by universities in the United States contributed to this decline.
“We dropped [physical activity requirements] before we realized just how bad the physical inactivity epidemic was going to be,” he said. “We're now seeing the consequences of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard survived a late surge by Columbia to hold on for a 3-2 victory in New York City on Saturday night in its last away match of the season.
Harvard (7-5-3, 2-2-2 Ivy) clinched its first season above .500 since 2016 with Saturday’s away win over Columbia (1-10-4, 0-4-2 Ivy). After going up 3-0, the Crimson conceded two late goals but was able to hold on for its third victory in its last four games.
“We certainly should have avoided conceding two goals in the last ten minutes of the game, but staying calm and trusting in our ability to play helped us get past that and secure the three points on Saturday night,” said first-year defender Ludovico Rollo of the match. “We played quite well for almost the entirety of the game, but when hiccups will happen — and they will definitely happen — we just have to make sure that we minimize them by trusting in ourselves and our teammates to get tackles in and play some beautiful footy.”
Rollo was one of four first-years to start for Harvard in a very young lineup, along with fellow defender Jan Riecke, midfielder Sam Bjarnason, and forward Alessandro Arlotti. Arlotti and Riecke have been essential for the Crimson this season, with the former leading the team in points and the latter playing nearly every minute of the season at center back. Rollo and Bjarnason have featured heavily as the season has progressed as well.
Harvard was carried to victory by goals from its top three points earners on the season. Junior forward Martin Vician opened the scoring for the Crimson in the 26th minute after Arlotti found him with a ball over the top, which he finished with his first touch past the onrushing keeper. The goal was the Bratislava, Slovakia, native’s sixth of the season and his fourth in Ivy League play.
Harvard outshot Columbia 18 to seven on the night, with 10 on target to the Lions’ four. Columbia received two yellow cards compared to one for the Crimson, handed out to senior forward Alfred Perez in the 89th minute.
Sophomore midfielder Willem Ebbinge doubled Harvard’s lead in the 67th minute following a clever interchange between him and Vician. Vician held up a long ball between two defenders before finding Ebbinge on the overlap with a no-look pass. Ebbinge picked up the ball and cut inside near the corner of the box, dancing through three defenders and curling the ball into the far bottom corner.
The goal brings Ebbinge up to thirteen points on the year with two goals and nine assists; these nine assists in fourteen games put him fifth in the NCAA in assists per game (0.64). Vician’s assist brought him to three points on the night, with his strong performance netting him Ivy League player of the week.
The game seemed to be all but wrapped up when Arlotti netted the Crimson’s third goal in the 81st minute. Senior defender Havard Hjermstad whipped in an early cross from midway through the Columbia half, with Arlotti rising highest at the back post to head the ball home and extend Harvard’s lead to 3-0. The goal was Arlotti’s eighth on the season, bringing him to a team-best 22 points on the year.
The Lions came alive following this third goal, finding the back of the net just moments after conceding. After a cross was chested down in the Harvard box, junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson was beaten by a strong strike from the edge of the box to bring the score to 3-1 in the 82nd minute. Nilsson ranks thirteenth in the NCAA in saves per game, averaging five saves per 90 minutes played.
Columbia grabbed its second goal in the 87th minute after a ball over the top was smashed home into the roof of the net to put the game within one. Despite this late surge, the Crimson held on in a nervy final three minutes to secure its first winning season since 2016.
“When we have that much quality throughout the team roster, we have the ability to overpower teams for a full 90 minutes,” Rollo said of the team’s depth. “This game isn't a perfect example of that, due to the two goals conceded at the end, [but] we have gotten more and more consistent in full games throughout the course of the season, and we'll only look to improve this over the future.”
A guaranteed .500 finish is a massive improvement for a team that finished 0-14-1 last time out in 2019 and finished with only two and three wins in 2017 and 2018 respectively. This improvement speaks to the impact of coach Josh Shapiro in his first season, who won four NCAA DIII National Championships in ten years as head coach of Tufts. With time and more of his own recruits, Shapiro seems poised to lead the program into a bright future.
Harvard will wrap up its season at home versus Penn with senior day this Saturday on Jordan Field, with kickoff slated for 1 p.m. Both teams enter the matchup at 7-5-3, while the Crimson has the edge in Ivy League play, at 2-2-2 compared to 1-3-2 for Penn. Harvard sits in fourth in a talented Ivy League, behind a third-place Cornell who was nationally ranked for the majority of the season, and can retain that position with a win versus the Quakers.

Love It: PSLs Are Flowing Through My Veins - Salaidh Perez
To quote my dear roommate on one cold Tuesday night: “Bitches see a drink named Count Frapula, and they immediately drop all their money  — that’s a full week’s paycheck, bestie”.
In case it wasn't obvious: bitches is me. I am bitches.
In my defense, I’m from sunny Los Angeles—a true California girl if you will—and as stereotypical as it may be, Starbucks and the sorts are water to my body and poison to my bank account. I am that girl with the ever growing list of different coffee orders on her Notes apps and the one whose local baristas know by name. So when seasonal drinks finally hit the shelves again, it’s time to trade in my regular order of a grande iced Americano with 3 pumps of vanilla, 1 of Hazelnut, and 1 of Cinnamon Dolce (with sweet cream, of course), for an iced—or hot, depending on the day—pumpkin spice latte with almond milk and pumpkin cream cold foam.
And why shouldn’t I?
I’ve been told repeatedly now that living in California has deprived me of the chance to experience seasons. So, what better way to learn about and enjoy said seasons than through tasty drinks that put us in the mood and quite literally put the spirit inside us? Well rounded liberal education and transformative experience, anyone?
Forget the leaves changing color; nothing feels more like fall than walking back to your dorm after classes as a light drizzle surrounds you and the warm PSL you’re holding in your hand. And once the winter really hits, I’ll be enjoying my first snowfall with a hot Peppermint Mocha (from inside my dorm, of course).
And if coffee isn't your cup of tea, not to worry: I have reviews on other types of drinks too. Playa Bowls’ Pumpkin Spice Smoothie is definitely a must. Craving a sugar high to get you through that all nighter? Go ahead and try out one Bartley’s Count Frapula. Yes, cafés may really only be throwing in some maple sugar and pumpkin flavoring into their everyday drinks and calling it a day, but what about it? They’re good and won’t be around forever, so why wait for next year when you can get them today? You know what they say—don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today​​.  Too bad I can’t apply that to my homework.
Seasonal drinks are a way to stay in the seasonal spirit 24/7. Whether you’re psetting or romanticizing the walk to your dorm from the Science Center, as long as you have a PSL in your hand, you’ll never feel more fall-y or Rory Gilmore in your life.
Hate It: We are Feeding into Capitalism - Rachel Ok
One word: marketing. That’s all I think of when I see ads for a new seasonal drink. Cafés just ride on the wave of holiday festivities to sell another drink that tastes like sugar and highly appeals to sleep-deprived college students living each monotonous day with an endless stream of psets and essays. If you’re one of the people eagerly waiting for the time of the year when plain vanilla lattes switch to pumpkin spice lattes, I encourage you to step outside and take a walk. Enjoy the company of your friends and family instead of feeding into your caffeine addiction, I beg of you.
The seasons come back around every year — no matter what that ad is saying about exclusive fall flavors. There’s really no need to celebrate the natural cycle of nature like it’s a baby that needs coddling. Instead, I invite you to celebrate the passage of time in other ways: completing that weekly Ec10a pset, having a crying session with your friends during midterm season (the superior season to celebrate), begging for dorm heating to turn on once winter starts rushing in.
Secondly, can we please talk about the peppermint obsession? I’m fine with just candy canes and mints, but do we really need to include peppermint in everything during the winter? I know I’ve triggered a whole army of mint-chocolate-chip ice cream lovers, but I still cannot understand it. Why spend extra money on that minty-fresh flavor when your toothpaste is right there?
Don’t get me wrong, I love celebrating holidays. Noticing the leaves change color as the air starts getting colder and seeing holiday decorations appearing in the dhalls gets me in such a festive mood. But is it necessary to throw money out in the name of capitalism just because Starbucks changed the name of a drink and added a bit more sugar and spice? (answer: it really isn’t).
