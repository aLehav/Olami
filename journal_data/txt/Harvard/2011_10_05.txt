After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Administrative Board, the disciplinary arm of the College, has announced that it is reaping the benefits of new its new policies regarding plagiarism. The board recently released the number of academic dishonesty cases they saw in the 2010-11 school year, 272, a nearly 150 percent increase from the previous years. John L. Ellison, Secretary of the Ad Board, attributed the increase to newly instated policies regarding the punishments that the board can enforce in response to plagiarism.  The policies allow for more leeway in judging cases and provide for penalties that vary in seriousness with the crimes they are made to address.
We applaud the changes, which provide a much-needed reevaluation of University policy toward plagiarism and academic dishonesty.  In today’s world, academic dishonesty is becoming increasingly difficult to define, and  increasingly in terms of severity.  The fact of the matter is that certain infractions are worse than others, and punishing all cases of academic dishonesty alike necessitates a system in which the rules are either draconian or too lax to fit a sizable portion of the cases.  For the Ad Board to switch to a system that allows for a variation in severity, not just in crimes but also in punishments, is a welcome sign.
It appears that professors likewise appreciate the change, as Ellison remarked that the increase in cases reported likely results from the professors no longer fearing to send a student to the Ad Board.  This is a positive change for a number of reasons, not the least of which being that it guarantees the student a fair trial.  A situation in which the professors are unwilling to report infractions by the students for fear of meting out too harsh of a punishment is not only a strong sign that something is the matter with the system, but also can result in an unfair response; the professor acts as arresting officer, judge and jury.  Furthermore, such an unwillingness to report instances of academic dishonesty keeps the school in the dark about how actually pervasive (or not) such a problem really is, hindering their ability to adequately respond to it.
Switching away from the older system also has the advantage of giving students a more clear idea of how proceedings with the Ad Board work. Rather than simply believing that being sent to the Ad Board always results, through some opaque and unknowable process, in being asked to take a semester-long leave of absence, students now, through the gradations of the penalties being handed down, are given a more clear view of the process and logic behind the Ad Board’s decisions. That being said, many students still find the process confusing and inadequately explained. The resources to understand it are available; We would suggest that those people refer to the Ad Board’s website, or ask their tutor or proctor for more information about the board.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve never really liked debit cards. They bother me.  Bank of America’s recently-announced five-dollar-per-month usage charge is a good thing. If industry watchers are to be believed, it’s a Sign of Things to Come and will ripple from bank to bank like another East Coast earthquake. One can only hope this coming wave is the death-knell of debit and hastens a new dawn in the world of personal payment. One might also ask why that’s even remotely desirable.
It’s not the plastic that bothers me. What’s not to like? Unless you’re trying to stay off the grid, break the law, or save up by making it annoyingly hard to spend your own money, a debit card is leagues ahead of cash in just about every conceivable way. Convenience is through the roof. It’s small and lightweight. It won’t stretch out your wallet and ruin the leather. You can get one with a picture of just about anything you like—Spiderman, Jell-O, monster trucks. Get mugged walking back to the Quad? Perfect! Just call it in and watch that money flow right back (if you can find an ATM nearby). And best of all—no stupid coins.
My dislike of debit stems from one simple fact: Despite years spent searching for answers, I have never once identified any good reason to pay debit over credit. Something about it just doesn’t add up—specifically, my precious, precious rewards points. Or, for that matter, my credit rating. And yet many people choose debit over credit every day, in every city, on every street corner, and inside every storefront with a card reader. Isolated in my OCD-like concern and finding no allies for my cause, I’ve been left to lament this broad absence of utility-maximizing behavior in an age when every last dollar counts. Watching a friend pay debit is like watching him aim for the recycling bin but hit the trash instead. Every. Single. Time.
Granted, some debit cards do have limited rewards programs. But there are a whole host of reasons—primarily, different interchange fee structures and a lack of potential revenue from interest charges—that force banks to be less generous than they can be with credit cards. There’s also something to be said about limiting expenses, at least nominally, to what you’ve got in the bank. But debit overdraft fees can bite just as hard as credit over-limit ones and at the end of the day, personal responsibility can be practiced just as well with a credit card as with a debit card, checkbook, or even straight cash.
Debit cards may still have a place in tomorrow’s world of personal finance. In the post-financial-meltdown era, not everyone can qualify for a credit card, and perhaps mom and dad still aren’t ready to trust their angsty, vindictive teenage son or daughter with a risky piece of plastic. But fear of splurging and not even knowing it is no longer a valid excuse to go debit.
The Internet brings hope—even to those of us with the most serious self-control issues. Banks can send out automated texts and email whenever just about anything happens; keeping tabs on a balance becomes less than mindless. Spend a few minutes setting up incessant notifications and have your checking account autopay the bill in full every month and you’ve virtually replicated the debit card lifestyle, but with double the perks! If you're beyond irresponsible and you're also something of a Luddite, though, maybe just stick to cash.
It’s too soon to know for sure, but in scrambling to keep debit cards viable ahead of new government regulations, banks might finally catalyze the homogenization of magnetic payment that I’ve always secretly hoped for. And with a bit of luck, I can start thinking about other things when I buy my coffee.

The Crimson’s recent staff editorial about the rise of Greek life on campus, “The Cost of Exclusivity,” caused a minor storm. Such a reaction is understandable, given that the piece was riddled with inaccuracies, stereotypes, and faulty logic. The article soberly claimed Greek organizations are discriminatory, asymmetrical gender-power-dynamic-perpetuating drains on campus cohesiveness. The truth is that Greek organizations are positive institutions that foster deep and lasting relationships among students. Greek organizations are single-sex because that is crucial to promote their purpose of friendship, not out of a desire to exclude. Finally, students join Greek organizations primarily to grow closer to one another, not to drink.
Most Greek organizations are not co-ed because single-sex organizations provide members with a unique sense of camaraderie and security that often cannot be found in co-ed organizations. The reality is that men want time to be alone with other men, just as women want time to be with other women. Why else are “Girls’ Nights” and “Guys’ Nights” a part of our cultural language? Shared experience and worldviews, combined with the absence of competition over the opposite sex, create a unique and more comfortable dynamic optimal for building relationships.
The editorial charges that Greek organizations contradict the values of the university’s non-discrimination policy. The authors fail to notice that the policy only prohibits discrimination “unrelated to course requirements,” making an exception for reasonable discrimination. Just as single-sex sports discriminate based upon gender to ensure fair competition, Greek organizations do the same to promote friendship.
The Crimson seems convinced that Greek organizations’ “gender division” will “reinforce the asymmetrical gender ratios and power dynamics that we so often see at final clubs.” The authors seem unaware that they are probably the only ones on campus who think this is a problem in Greek organizations. I know of no female students who have complained that they feel systematically unsafe or pressured in Harvard’s fraternities. I presume Harvard’s male population feels similarly unthreatened by the sororities.
In an impressive feat of sophistry, the authors argue that sororities cannot counteract final clubs because “an organization predicated on gender as a fundamental division cannot counteract an organization that is predicated on the same principle.” Many sorority members disagree, and in fact argue that non-recognition for single-sex organizations only entrenches final clubs’ control over the social scene.
The Crimson accuses Greek organizations of relying on “arbitrary exclusivity” and turning away guests “because of gender or appearance.” Fraternities often do admit more female than male guests, but this is due to space, money, and liability constraints, as well as the imperative to ensure that brothers can socialize together. It is not arbitrary. The Editorial Board demands absolute inclusivity, but we all know that the world doesn’t and can’t work like that. The Crimson would know, as a hired bouncer guards the doors to some of its parties to maintain exclusivity.
The claim that Greek organizations turn away guests due to appearance is unsubstantiated and is based, I can only assume, upon crude stereotypes of fraternities and sororities. Greek organizations hold rushes open to the entire student body and count among their members students of diverse races, socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, sexual orientations, and interests. One would hope that such serious accusations would stand on firmer ground.
Far from degrading social cohesion, Greek organizations are some of the most powerful community-strengthening institutions on campus. Strong friendships, not alcohol, are why students primarily join. The authors might have known this had they done some research beyond watching ABC Family’s Greek and discovered that some fraternity members do not drink at all or that sororities ban alcohol entirely. The Crimson frets about the “fractionation of Harvard students to off-campus venues” negatively impacting “campus unity,” yet they ignore the many unifying bonds that Greek organizations create between students who might otherwise never have met each other. To many Harvard students, membership in a Greek organization is not the “price to pay for a safe drinking environment,” but the source of their closest friendships.
Many in the Greek community at Harvard were offended by The Crimson’s editorial. Baseless and hurtful accusations were leveled with little evidence backing them up. There is certainly a discussion to be had about Harvard’s policies on social space and drinking, but it was unfortunate that the Editorial Board chose to turn that discussion into an excuse to air half-baked conspiracy theories about organizations they apparently know very little about.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The calls to jihad emanated from the terrorist’s computer halfway around the world. In return came an aerial drone directed from halfway around the world that would silence him forever. No war was declared, no trial was held, and no troops were deployed.
Anwar Al-Awlaki, the al-Qaeda field general killed last week by a C.I.A. Predator drone strike in Yemen, was an important target not for what he did but for what he said. Unlike Osama bin Laden or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, al-Awlaki was not an architect of specific terrorist plots. Nor was he a major recruiter within Yemen or the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Rather, al-Awlaki’s danger came from his ability to bridge the gap between radical Islam and Western culture.
The rise and fall of Anwar al-Awlaki epitomized this new form of combat in which the significance of borders and bullets, the currencies of war to this point, disintegrates and information becomes the new front line.
He was among the first jihadists to go viral. Born and educated in America, he was able to use technology to access and indoctrinate potential operatives remotely—homegrown terrorism from 8,000 miles away. Nearly all of the terror attempts on American soil in the past decade have cited him as a major influence: Nidal Malik Hasan, who killed 13 and wounded 30 at Fort Hood in 2009;  Faisal Shazad, the attempted Times Square bomber; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called “underwear bomber” on Christmas Day, 2009.
Al-Awlaki was the first U.S. citizen to be placed on the C.I.A.’s “kill or capture” list. The drone strike that killed al-Awlaki and other terrorist leaders raised myriad questions about its legality: Can the American government  kill one of its citizens outside of a warzone without due process of law? There is no doubt about either al-Awlaki’s guilt or the strategic need for his assassination.  And if we’ve already decided to declare war on a concept such as “terror,” then anyone who incites is fair game.
When fighting a war of ideology, symbols are the most important targets. For a group that hated the respective economic and military hegemony of the United  States, the potency of the attacks on the World Trade  Center and the Pentagon laid in what those buildings represented.  Conversely, the killing of Osama bin Laden was a much more significant symbolic victory than a strategic one. Al-Qaeda is only as strong as its support among the communities that provide it with young and impressionable recruits, so the War on Terror amounts to competing public relations campaigns between the West and the radical Islamists.
Al-Awlaki’s crimes were those of provocation, not of personal violence. His strengths were his words and his ideas. Merely killing the man himself is only the first step. To truly destroy him, we must delegitimize him and neutralize his legacy in the eyes of his followers.
While living in San Diego, for example, al-Awlaki was busted on two separate occasions for soliciting prostitutes. Remember when those photos of Osama bin Laden watching himself on TV surfaced right after his killing? Or the pornography and marijuana that was recovered from his compound? When trying to destroy the foundations of an ideology, exposing its spiritual and ideological leaders as sanctimonious frauds is far more powerful than any number of Hellfire missiles.
Influencing public opinion has always been a key objective in any war, but its importance is magnified when the participants are not defined specifically by nationality or ethnicity. In the first two world wars, propaganda was secondary because battle lines were defined by nation: Governments were trying less to influence anyone to their side and more to retain civic opinion amid major sacrifices.
The Cold War was the turning point in the role of ideology in war. While there were two polar monoliths—the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.—true battles played out in the hearts and minds of those who ruled and lived in countries that were wavering between the American and Soviet paradigms. The War on Terror is even more nebulous: a leaderless movement uses any and all tactics to fight against a way of life that is only best represented by two nations, America and Israel. We are past the era of the nation-on-nation warfare of the 17th through 20th centuries or the proxy national battles of the Cold War.
Al-Awlaki represents the culmination of this transition between physical and ideological warfare. His threat was intangible and digital. His assassination was remote and surgical, occurring in a nation with which we were not at war. His nationality was irrelevant—even though he was nominally an American, he was an enemy of the state. But he was rightfully a top tier target. Men like him are the most dangerous combatants in a war without borders or defined adversaries. When there is no dictator to kill, no territories to conquer, information and ideas become just as important as insurgency and IEDs.

Less than a week after the University announced a restructuring of the Harvard library system, Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary L. Kennedy and a panel of Harvard affiliates fielded questions about the reorganization and shared their ideas for the libraries’ future at a forum in Sanders Theater yesterday.
Throughout the event, entitled “Harvard Library Thinks Big,” audience members and those watching the panel via video-stream participated by posting questions through an online tool and tweeting comments with a pre-specified hashtag, “#hlsc11.”
The questions largely focused on the five affinity groups into which Harvard’s 73 libraries will be assembled as part of the restructuring.
The groups, which will be organized around libraries’ subject areas or content types, will focus on University-wide issues such as collection development and risk management. Group heads will be nominated from within the Harvard library community.
According to Kennedy, the restructuring is meant to give every Harvard library a voice.
“We now have a straight line to a decision-making body that can make recommendations to the president,” she said.
One question posed by audience member—which received more than 20 votes in the online tool requesting an answer from the panel—was “When will the hiring freeze be lifted?”
Kennedy stressed that administrators would have to consider the ongoing changes to Harvard libraries before bringing in new employees.
“We are asking if it is fair to bring someone on to do a job that after we finish this work may not make sense to have,” she said.
One research librarian from the Harvard Law School Library, who asked to remain anonymous, asked Kennedy to address librarians’ concerns that technical experts, such as cataloguers and bibliographers, will be removed from their local collections and become a part of centralized library services.
While Kennedy assured the audience that the changes to libraries would not negatively impact services, the Law School research librarian said that she was “not really” satisfied with Kennedy’s answer.
“I don’t think that they realize what we rely on to do a good job,” she said, adding that these experts help students select useful research materials.
Vice Dean for Library and Information Resources at Harvard Law School John G. Palfrey, who moderated the discussion, addressed the audience’s anxiety.
“I sense a struggle in the room,” he said. “As painful as this may have felt to some of you, this is in fact our challenge.”
Yesterday’s interactive forum was the first event for a program titled Harvard Library Strategic Conversations, which is a series of discussions about the future development of the Harvard Library.
“As I go to libraries, I think, how cool would it be to carry Widener with me and take it to a site in Giza with me?”  asked Harvard Egyptology Professor Peter Der Manuelian, a panelist. “The library is starting to move out of the building and come maybe into your pocket.”
Research Director at MIT libraries MacKenzie Smith also spoke about the  role of technology in libraries.
“The world is dividing into the very important print-based collections, which are not losing value, and the increasing digital collections that are being created now,” Smith said. “They aren’t even like apples and oranges. They’re like oranges and tang.”
Smith also emphasized that university libraries need to collaborate and innovate in order to remain relevant.
“It is a global world now, and libraries like Harvard and MIT need to do more to build shared services across other institutions,” Smith said. “Other organizations like Google will do them and we will be invisible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Woody Allen’s 1977 classic, “Annie Hall,” a 9-year-old version of the protagonist is depressed.
When asked why he is upset, young Alvy says grimly, “The universe is expanding ... and if it’s expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything!”
To this his frustrated mother replies: “What has the universe got to do with it? You’re here in Brooklyn! Brooklyn is not expanding!”
On Tuesday, three Harvard graduates were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for their joint-discovery that the universe is not only expanding, but its rate of expansion is increasing—a discovery that shook the field of astronomy by overturning the common belief that the universe’s growth was slowing down.
Saul Perlmutter ’81, Adam G. Riess, and Brian P. Schmidt—the latter two each received both masters and Ph.D.s in astronomy from Harvard—worked in two teams in 1998 to study a special type of supernova known as the expanding star. They concluded separately that a mysterious force, referred to as “dark energy,” is pushing galaxies away from one another at a surprising rate.
The discovery enables scientists to predict what the universe may be like in the far future, specifically that it will be colder as light emitted from one galaxy will never reach another because they are traveling away from each other at a rapid speed.
The universe will keep expanding until there is no more energy in the universe, leading to an energy death, according to Abraham “Avi” Loeb, the chair of Harvard’s Astronomy Department.
Perlmutter and Schmidt led two separate teams that used a particular sub-category of supernova, or an exceptionally large explosion of a star, to gauge the expansion rate of the universe, which is 14 billion years old and has been expanding ever since the Big Bang.
The study seems to refute the thinking that the universe might implode, a theory which is popularly called the “Big Crunch.” The researchers were attempting to understand how quickly the universe was decelerating when they realized their calculations indicated acceleration.
Reiss said that he was “stunned, absolutely shocked” when he first saw the results and at first thought he was wrong.
“Anyone who has done scientific research or a chemistry lab in high school knows it is easy to make mistakes,” Reiss said in an interview. Only the fact that another group of researchers generated the same results stopped him from looking for the mistake he thought he must have made, he recalled.
Reiss said that his studies at Harvard’s Astronomy Department directly led to the basis of his discoveries and that the findings of Harvard Professor Robert P. Kirshner, who was Reiss’ thesis advisor, were important to the research.
Kirshner introduced Reiss to the idea of using exploding stars to calculate the expansion of the universe and was involved in the study that lead to the surprising results.
“The discovery that this expansion is accelerating is astounding,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said in a release. “The acceleration is thought to be driven by dark energy, but what that dark energy is remains an enigma—perhaps the greatest in physics today.”
Perlmutter, who lead the Supernova Cosmology Project, will receive half of the $1.4 million prize while the rest will be split between Schmidt, who lead the High-Z Supernova Search Team, and Reiss, who helped interpret the data for Schmidt and was the lead author of the 1998 paper in the Astronomical Journal where the results of the study were fist published.
The new discovery fitted very well with what Einstein considered his “greatest blunder.” In his general theory of relativity, Einstein needed an expanding universe but at that time the universe was thought to be more stable. Einstein introduced a constant that would help the numbers come together but then abandoned it, believing it to be a failure. An accelerating universe changes Einstein’s failure to brilliant foresight and for that Reiss and Schmidt were also awarded the Albert Einstein medal for furthering his research.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, Barry’s Corner—located at the intersection of North Harvard St. and Western Ave. in Allston—has an air of emptiness, housing an abandoned car dealership, a vacant Citgo, a 7-Eleven, and a large parking lot. But Allston resident Irene S. McCall remembers it as the location of her childhood home.
“We had what they called the backyard, all the houses in a ring, one big backyard that everybody played in and used as children,” McCall says.
But in the 1960s, the location where McCall spent her “beautiful, beautiful childhood” was bulldozed over by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which seized the land with the intent of building more luxurious housing.
“They just took homes from the people that were well-kept, some of them weren’t, but people had lived there all their lives,” Allston resident Rita M. DiGesse recalls.
In time, the City built the Charlesview Apartment Complex—a concrete cluster of housing for low-income families—that turned the former neighborhood in a ”cement city,” DiGesse says.
Barry’s Corner’s transition from what residents say was a family neighborhood to a lifeless intersection left residents suspicious of the BRA. When Harvard purchased the land decades later, their mistrust shifted to the University.
Today, residents say they feel that Harvard’s newly-approved recommendations for Allston represent a chance for the University to reinvigorate the neighborhood. Still, they say that they are worried that history will repeat itself in what they characterize as a perennial exclusion of community members from neighborhood planning.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
Last month, Harvard approved the five recommendations of the Harvard Allston Work Team—a 14-person group commissioned by University President Drew G. Faust to help plan the University’s next steps in Allston. In a letter to residents last month, University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp outlined Harvard’s intentions to move forward with their plans in two stages. In the first phase, the University will begin planning mixed-use structures in Barry’s Corner, including housing for faculty, graduate students, and other Allston residents, as well as retail outlets. In the second phase, Harvard plans to hire third-party developers to build and maintain the housing and retail units.
Specific plans outlining the University’s next steps in Allston are still in the works. Harvard has spoken casually with many local and national companies, including real estate investment trust Boston Properties, but no deals have been set in stone, according to Mahmood Malihi, who is an executive vice president of Leggat McCall Properties, the firm that advised the Work Team and helped shape the recommendations.
“The idea is to create housing that is similar between graduate housing and neighborhood living, and have a mixture of the two,” says Malihi. “Co-developers enable us to create housing for the market as well, therefore activating Barry’s Corner in the near-term.”
In the past year, Harvard says it has advanced significantly in achieving its goals, leasing land to Stone Hearth Pizza Co. in the heart of Barry’s Corner, and turning the former Citgo into a commercial bakery, Swiss Bakers.
A TROUBLED PAST
The transition of McCall’s cherished home to what DiGesse characterizes as a “cement city” began in the 1960s.
In 1961, the BRA announced its plan to rebuild a neighborhood with luxurious housing, according to “Building a New Boston: Politics and Urban Renewal, 1950-1970” by Boston College Emeritus Professor Thomas H. O’Connor.
But in order to create these improved facilities, the “blighted” neighborhood—as the City characterized it—had to be torn down, O’Connor writes.
But Allston residents maintain that the homes were well-kept and unjustly demolished.
“Literally there were old ladies sitting on their chairs in the front porch trying to fight it,” Allston resident Leonard W. Kelliher says. “They forced the elderly people off the porch and bulldozed it in front of them. Nobody was happy with the way this was all done.”
O’Connor’s book confirms Kelliher’s description of residents’ forcible removal.
“The final act in this human tragedy came in October 1969, when BRA officials and more than 50 Boston policemen arrived on the scene to forcibly evict the last three families who still remained in their homes and refused to leave” O’Connor writes.
McCall remembers helping her sister move her belongings before her house was taken by the BRA.
“That was sad,” McCall pauses. “That was sad. It was just terrible.”
But the City didn’t build a “$4.5 million, three-hundred-unit, ten-story luxury apartment complex,” in Barry’s Corner, as they had promised, according to O’Connor’s book. Instead, it built an “ugly gray monster,” Kelliher says, referring to the Charlesview Apartment Complex located near Harvard Business School.
“The event is scarred into the memories of people in this neighborhood ... This is what the city can do to you,” Task Force member Brent Whelan ’73 says.
HARVARD ENTERS BARRY’S CORNER
In the 1970s, Harvard began surreptitiously buying 250 acres of land in Allston under subsidiary companies of a different name.
After holding land adjacent to Charlesview for decades, the University in 2007 made a land swap agreement with the apartment complex’s board of directors, so that Harvard could consolidate its Allston land holdings by taking ownership of the Charlesview site. By agreeing to move its complex, the Charlesview board could provide residents with much sought after housing and amenities.
In 2008, the BRA presented Allston residents with a plan to transform Barry’s Corner into a community hub, which would house restaurants, cafes, and a park. At the time, the University’s 50-year master plan included academic and institutional buildings flanking two sides of Barry’s Corner.
But in Dec. 2009, financial constraints caused by the economic crisis caused the University to halt construction on the Allston Science Complex, deferring hopes of a vibrant Barry’s Corner along with it.
As a result, some residents say they are hesitant to believe that Harvard will follow through with the new plans for Barry’s Corner.
“There’s an awful lot of secrecy. We don’t know what’s in the back of their mind and what they plan on doing,” says Kelliher. “The neighborhood doesn’t trust Harvard, which is a shame because they’ve done a lot of good, but they put that element of doubt in our minds.”
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM
After decades of frustration, some residents say the reason they are hesitant to believe that Harvard’s plans will finally be realized is because many questions remain unanswered.
“Will [Barry’s Corner] just be a dormitory type structure where relatively short-term people stay? Or will it be an extension of the community, an opportunity for new people and families to come together and be part of the Allston community?” Whelan says.
Kelliher echoed Whelan’s sentiments, saying, “They [representatives of the University] constantly came back to us, but they haven’t paid much attention to our suggestions. It’s still up in the air about what’s going there.”
Residents also say they do not want to see high-rise buildings, and hope that any new construction will be neighborhood friendly.
Looking at what Barry’s Corner is today, some residents say they feel any developments on the two-acre plot of land will be an improvement.
“Anything is better than an empty lot,” DiGesse says. “I think that the land is not totally utilized, it’s under-utilized and it’s been that way for a long time.”
But despite hardships in the past and fraught relations with the University, some residents add they feel the housing developments will benefit the community.
“I just hope everything will be good,” McCall says. “I just hope for the best for everyone.”

As part of her two-day visit to Capitol Hill, University President Drew G. Faust met Tuesday with four Democratic members of the Congressional deficit-reduction “supercommittee” in the hopes that the committee will think twice before slashing funding for student aid and science research as it looks to trim $1.5 trillion from the national debt.
Accompanied by Stanford President John L. Hennessy, Faust met with Democratic Congressmen Xavier Becerra of California, James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Faust also met with Democratic Senator Max S. Baucus of Montana, who serves as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
“The conversations were excellent, very lively,” Faust said in an interview after the meetings. “I felt like we were generously heard when we discussed how important the universities are to the creation of the future of our nation. Universities are a part of the solution to the challenges the United States faces.”
The committee, which consists of six Democrats and six Republicans, was created by the debt limit deal reached in early August. The agreement reduced spending by $2.1 trillion over 10 years and allowed for an immediate increase in the nation’s debt ceiling.
Harvard relies on the federal government for a significant portion of its budget, receiving about $600 million annually, largely in the form of grants. Including funds disbursed to Harvard’s teaching hospitals, annual federal support for the University totals approximately $1.2 billion.
Harvard has increasingly looked to the federal government for science research and student aid funding since the 2008 financial crisis, during which Harvard’s endowment fell nearly 30 percent from $36.9 billion to $26 billion.
But as a highly-partisan Congress attempts to reduce deficit spending, universities have become concerned that higher education funding may be slashed.
In the past year Harvard has increasingly reached out to industry and business, seeking new partnerships that will help higher education gain more clout on Capitol Hill.
This collaboration among universities, businesses, and Washington came up several times during Tuesday’s discussions.
“We talked about the importance of partnerships with business and showing how common interests with other sectors will result in positive outcomes,” Faust said. “[These partnerships are] about jobs, about the future, about the next generation of students, and about what’s in the national interest.”
On day two of her Washington, D.C., excursion, Faust will meet with several private sector CEOs and university presidents Wednesday for Bloomberg’s Business Roundtable.
Faust also met with William Kristol ’73, founder and editor of The Weekly Standard, to get his perspective on the Washington political landscape.
The supercommittee must present its proposal for deficit reduction by Nov. 23, and Congress will then vote on the proposal by Dec. 23. If the bipartisan committee deadlocks and is unable to produce a proposal, then automatic spending cuts totaling $1.2 trillion will take effect.
Faust said that she was hopeful that higher education funding will not be significantly reduced as the supercommittee looks to make the cuts.
“These individuals who are involved in the supercommittee are dedicated to finding a way forward, and they are very optimistic that the committee will find a way forward that suits our nation’s needs,” Faust said after her meetings. “For that reason, it was a very reassuring set of conversations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having joined Harvard only a few months ago, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 called reforming the Harvard University Library system his “number one” priority at Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Professors packed into the meeting—the first of this academic year. Beyond the procedural necessities that are part of the year’s first meeting, professors in attendance at Tuesday’s gathering reviewed the evolving composition of the school’s faculty.
After the effects of the financial crisis constricted faculty searches, and the 2009 FAS retirement package shepherded the exit of many more seasoned professors, the seniority and demography of the existing FAS body has shifted.
Faculty members and administrators also discussed goings-on at the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and plans for Harvard’s upcoming 375th Anniversary.
TOP PRIORITY
In his remarks, Garber acknowledged that he is still learning to navigate the University’s organizational structure, after returning to his alma mater this fall. But he firmly defended the libraries as the top priority for the University.
In particular, Garber discussed the development of five library “affinity groups” as a step in developing the University’s vision of a collaborative, centralized library service.
“We have reached a milestone in this process with the decision of the library board to endorse an organizational change into five affinity groups,” Garber said at the meeting. “The purpose of this change is to enable the library system to work much better, to encourage coordination, and a better sense of shared service.”
The affinity group structure, announced late last week, will organize Harvard’s 73 different libraries into five different groups, each centered around a shared intellectual purpose.
“We are consolidating the libraries in a way that will save money, and that money saved will be plowed back into acquisitions and expanded services,” University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 said. “It will make the library much stronger.”
Darnton affirmed that the library will be taking stock of its resources and will aggressively move toward its top priority of purchasing new volumes—or, as Darnton put it, “acquisitions, acquisitions, acquisitions.”
FILLING UP THE FACULTY
During the meeting, Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser addressed concerns that faculty attrition in FAS has been higher in recent years.
According to Zipser, FAS will engage more searches to ensure that the school will have the enough professors across its divisions to support its needs.
As FAS aggressively cut departmental budgets over fiscal years 2010 and 2011, faculty searches became more tightly regulated. In the Dec. 2008 Faculty Meeting, Smith announced the suspension the majority of faculty searches.
As a result of that regulation, the school-wide retirement package introduced in 2009, and natural faculty attrition, FAS faculty growth slowed to a halt.
This crunch followed nearly a decade of active growth in the school, expanding the faculty from 588 to 720 professors. Zipser said that while FAS did not intend to grow as rapidly in the coming years, she hoped that recent positive returns on Harvard’s endowment would allow the University to increase its proportion of senior faculty members.
“The number of assistant and associate professors is declining ... We are promoting faculty a little faster than they are retiring so we can keep the size of the faculty flat,” Zipser said.
There will be 43 searches across FAS this year—an increase from 34 in the previous academic year and a significant step-up from the 24 in 2009.
“We want to be between 40 and 50 searches per year to maintain the strength of each division,” Zipser said.
These searches are largely facilitated by the improved financial situation of FAS.
Formally announcing the decrease of its structural deficit to $16 million, Smith said that the recent announcement of the endowment’s 21.4 percent return was a welcome relief for the school.
“Budget discipline has also allowed us to pre-fund a number of capital projects, so we don’t have to take out additional debt,” said Smith, who again repeated his commitment to formally close the deficit by the end of the fiscal year.
ODDS AND ENDS
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds affirmed that the College will continue to aggressively combat binge drinking, calling it a “very high and serious priority.”
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds affirmed that the College will continue to aggressively combat binge drinking, naming its restriction as a high priority of the College.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Allan M. Brandt also discussed the possibility of introducing new guidelines for graduate theses.
Finally, University Marshal Jackie A. O’Neill encouraged Faculty members to attend Harvard’s upcoming 375th anniversary celebration on Oct. 14.

CORRECTION: OCTOBER 15, 2011
The Oct. 5 article "Garber Prioritizes Library Reform" incorrectly suggested that the size of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ tenured faculty decreased since the school-wide retirement package was introduced in 2009. In fact, while the number of total tenure-track faculty members has decreased, the number of tenured faculty members has grown.

Sporting various baseball caps, six Harvard professors showed off the lighter side of the General Education Program Tuesday night by presenting different academic aspects of baseball, from history to physics.
“Everything you need to know about life you can learn from either baseball or ‘The Godfather,’” said a smiling Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, opening the evening. In much the same way, all eight facets of the Gen Ed curriculum can be explored through baseball, Harris pointed out.
The presentation, “Gen Ed at Bat: A Discussion of America’s Favorite Pastime,” endeavoured to explore each of the eight categories.
Though an academic look at the sport, the evening maintained baseball’s friendly, competitive air. Stepping up to the podium, each professor was announced in true baseball fashion with “walk-up music” playing in the background and a statistical biography displayed on the projector screen.
History Professor Jill M. Lepore led off the night, offering a historian’s approach to the sport. Lepore posed the question ‘Who was the greatest shortstop of all time,’ and then defended her own choice, Honus Wagner, in historical terms.
“History is the act of making an argument by telling a story about dead people in which each part of that argument requires evidence,” said Lepore, demonstrating her point with baseball cards, photographs, letters, and statistics.
History of Art and Architecture Professor Robin E. Kelsey followed with a brief history of baseball cards and their relationship with photography and culture.
“Photography and particularly photographic portraits have historically been an agent of racial equality,” Kelsey said. “I think that egalitarian spirit carries over to the baseball card.”
Law School Professor Michael J. Klarman spoke about the relationship between race and baseball, focusing on the causes and impacts of desegregation on the game.
Following Klarman, History Professor Andrew D. Gordon spoke about the cultural exchange baseball engenders. Gordon authored a book published in Japanese about Japanese star Daisuke Matsuzaka’s difficult transition into Major League Baseball in the U.S.
Steven R. Levitsky, a government professor, followed Gordon and spoke about baseball as a cultural and political force in Latin America.
Physics Professor John E. Huth closed the night with the physics of pitching. Huth alternated complex equations with baseball animations and short demonstrations to describe, among other things, the confounding nature of a knuckleball.
A fairly small but spirited audience actively participated and challenged the presenters’ assumptions about the game.
“I thought they were going to take the fun out of baseball, but it was actually a lot of fun to look at the sport academically,” said Mark Paskowsky, who attended the presentation with his wife Laurie B. Forcier, senior academic projects manager at the Graduate School of Education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students from various racial and socioeconomic backgrounds came together yesterday night to discuss their perspectives on wealth and diversity at Harvard, in an informal discussion sponsored by the Harvard Foundation.
While more than two-thirds of Harvard students receive some form of financial assistance, many of the roughly 30 undergraduates who attended the event expressed frustration with the lack of discussion around issues of wealth at Harvard.
Some contended that conversations about diversity tend to be confined to race, culture, and religion, but fail to center around social class.
Discussion facilitator Bronwen B. O’Herin ’12 introduced the event by noting that, though Harvard has the largest endowment of any university, fewer than one-eighth of its students come from the poorest 40 percent of U.S. households.
The taboo nature of speaking about socioeconomic status at Harvard took center stage after discussion participants were asked to describe their experiences with issues of class on campus.
Several students said that their Harvard experiences had made them reconsider the social class with which they self-identify.
“When I first came to Harvard I considered myself to be lower middle class ... but that perspective changed when I began to speak with my roommates, and that’s when I discovered that I was actually closer to upper middle class,” said Olamide V. Olatunji ’14.
Among students in attendance, there was also a consensus that assumptions about wealth are tied not only to individuals but to the Harvard name in general.
“Everyone believes just because you go here, that you’re going to be rich and successful,” said Michael Fountaine '12-'14.
The discussion also touched upon how social class affects students’ activities and self-presentations.
The arts, in particular, were characterized as extremely time consuming, rendering lower-income students with on-campus jobs unable to participate.
Other student groups that require international travel were deemed inaccessible for students with little disposable income. These constraints led some students to question the true breadth of opportunities for lower income students at Harvard.
Students highlighted specific clothing items and behaviors as being used by students to indicate socioeconomic status.
“I think wealth displays itself in very interesting and subtle ways like whether or not you work on campus,” said Winta Z. Haile ’12.
Other students cited the common Hunter rainboots and Longchamp purses for women, and boat shoes for men, as markers of status.
Attendees largely agreed that Harvard should encourage a sustained dialogue about diversity on campus in order to combat pressures to flaunt or to hide socioeconomic status.
“The goal should be acceptance over homogeneity,” Fountaine said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors in the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department (SCRB) have moved into the newly-renovated Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building, marking the first time the building has been entirely devoted to stem cell laboratories since the consolidation was proposed in early 2009.
The department was slated to expand into the Allston Science Complex until construction on the site was halted after Harvard’s endowment plummeted during the 2008 financial crisis. SCRB now occupies the entirety of Fairchild and the adjacent Bauer Life Science Building.
Laboratories in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, which formerly were housed in Fairchild, relocated to the Northwest Science Building last year and renovations to Fairchild additionally displaced a number of existing stem cell labs to temporary space in Bauer and Northwest.
These labs, joined by others from across Cambridge and Boston, moved back to Fairchild starting in August, according to Lee Rubin, Director of Translational Medicine at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.
Rubin’s lab used to be split between multiple floors of Fairchild but has been consolidated onto one floor since he moved back on September 8. He said he has noticed a palpable improvement in his colleagues’ moods since then.
“The space is really fabulous,” he said. “I sort of underestimated how wonderful it would be to have everyone in my lab on the same floor.”
The shift brings many SCRB labs into closer proximity but does not represent total centralization.
Labs have vacated Northwest, according to SCRB Professor Jack Strominger, but some remain in the Conant Chemistry Lab, the Longwood Medical Area, and at Massachusetts General Hospital.
A few will share space between Fairchild and MGH, said Jennifer B. Shay, Lab Manager for the Musunuru and Cowan Labs.
“There are some professors that have more ties to MGH or are MD-PhDs,” Shay explained.
Still, not all of Fairchild is currently filled. A visit to the building reveals a buzz of activity as lab groups settle in—but also some rooms that are still empty.
“There’s still two or three spaces for new faculty members that haven’t been appointed yet,” said Strominger, confirming that searches are underway. “It takes time to find outstanding faculty.”
“It’s great to be able to grow into more space,” said Shay. “At MGH, I felt like we were already at capacity. All the benches and desks were filled.”
Nancy Poole, staff assistant for Associate SCRB Professor Konrad Hochedlinger and Assistant SCRB Professor Chad Cowan at MGH, will move to Fairchild as an administrative coordinator. Although she said that moving to Harvard was probably never a practical option for Hochedlinger, other researchers jumped at the opportunity for bigger and better spaces. Administrative offices and lab space are more integrated in Fairchild than at MGH, Poole added.
Rubin said he has heard nothing about SCRB moving to Allston in the future. Although he is confident that any space provided there “will be fabulous,” he added that he is happy with the department’s current accommodations.
“I like being in the center of things. Maybe I’m easy to please,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard grappled with the fallout of the 2008 economic crisis, the disappearance and reappearance of snacks at monthly Faculty Meetings became a sign of the Faculty of Arts and Science’s economic health.
So when Economics Professor Jeremy C. Stein looked to convey the instability of the U.S. economy to faculty members in Tuesday’s Faculty Meeting, he reached for the well-worn metaphor.
I see a few of you looking at the cookies, and I guess you’re probably wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to the cookies?’” Stein said.
Nervous laughter followed.
PARLIAMENTARIAN PROCEDURE
Tuesday’s Faculty Meeting was uniquely well-attended. A solid contingent of professors appeared early at the meeting to chat with their colleagues and enjoy pre-meeting coffee and snacks.
Tardy professors filed into the crowded room for fifteen minutes after the 4:00 meeting began.
But one Harvard affiliate was notably absent: meetings in Washington, D.C., kept University President Drew G. Faust away from her seat in University Hall.
Dean of the FAS Michael D. Smith stepped in to run the meeting in her absence.
After several dry announcements and votes, Smith called for a faculty vote to renew Music Professor Thomas F. Kelly’s term as parliamentarian, the faculty member who ensures that meetings abide by procedure.
After a set of resounding “yays” and not a single “nay,” Kelly officially assumed his post.
Smith turned from his seat at the front of the room to congratulate Kelly on his position.
“Tom, you are now installed,” he said.
JAZZY INTRODUCTIONS
For their attendance, professors were rewarded with news about libraries, an update on FAS’s financial situation—and an unexpected musical performance.
While Smith was introducing the deans who would speak at the meeting, music suddenly filled the Faculty Room.
Somewhere in University Hall, an enthusiastic musician, unaware of his audience, played an upbeat jazz tune on the piano.
Smith, with a slight smile, continued with his announcements.
“Dean Allan Brandt—with music,” Smith said, introducing the Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The music continued, but undaunted, Smith went on to introduce the next speaker.
“Dean Hammonds, with musical accompaniment,” he added.

Punctuated by OutKast song “Hey Ya!” and videos of lip-syncing to pop icons Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas, Dannielle Owens-Reid and Kristin Russo led a serious discussion about LGBTQ rights Tuesday night.
Co-founders of the website “Everyone is Gay,” the duo brought their website to life when they addressed LGBTQ teen discrimination and answered audience questions at the event sponsored by the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies.
“One of the most important things we try to get across to readers is that issues you go through do not depend on who you go to bed with,” Russo said. T
he pair said that they hope that the website—which contains a variety of material including an advice section, webcasts, and an online accessories store—creates a safe space online for teenagers who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender.
Several audience members said they follow “Everyone is Gay” regularly.
“I followed them for one and a half years before I came here,” said Nathan H. Pointer ’15. “When I found out they were coming, I was really excited.”
Owens-Reid and Russo showed photographs of children and adults ages 11 to 19 who had committed suicide because of the bullying they encountered as a result of their sexual orientation.
The pair emphasized the importance of everyday kindness, not just political activism.
“You don’t have to march in a parade to help,” Russo said.
Owens-Reid and Russo presented a slideshow depicting facts about LGBT youth and discussed the local resources available to victims of harassment.
Following their performance, audience members asked questions ranging from inquiries about the pair’s cats to questions about coming out in religious families.
“The Q&A session I think is really useful because LGBT sex and relationship education is absent in high schools and colleges,” QSA Co-President Samuel J. Bakkila ’11-’12 said.
QSA Co-President Emma Q. Wang ’12 initially had the idea of hosting Owens-Reid and Russo.
“‘Everyone is Gay’ is something I looked at with one of my friends at brain break and we giggled over it,” she said.
Owens-Reid and Russo have been on tour traveling to schools to perform.
Russo is also the founder of the website “Lesbians Who Look Like Justin Bieber.”
She said that the website generated comments asking for advice, which became the inspiration for the April 2010 founding of “Everyone is Gay.”
The duo’s next project will consist of short student stories in the form of online videos that they will post on their website, they said.

Harvard’s teams had an up-and-down week, giving this edition of the Fab Five the appeal of a Lindsay Lohan movie—the early performances were solid, but who knows what you’ll get these days.
5. Football (2-1, 1-0)
The Crimson sent the Lafayette Leopards (1-4) deeper into gridiron misery, trouncing them 31-3 last Saturday. The team travels to Cornell this weekend, but winning may not even be a priority. Leaving Ithaca after the game will be more than enough for the players to look forward to.
Last Week: 5
4. Field Hockey (6-3, 2-1)
Riding a four-game winning streak and an overtime victory over Vermont last weekend, Harvard will need to put together another beastly performance to top Stanford. The Cardinal comes to Cambridge this weekend ranked 4th in the nation.
Last Week: Not Ranked
3. Women’s Tennis
Top doubles partners Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana will compete away from the rest of the team in California this week. The remaining members of the Crimson will get the chance to prove themselves at the USTA Billie Jean King Invitational in New York.  If scheduling works out, the women may even have the opportunity to watch a post-season baseball game—there’s not much of that going on in Boston right now.
Last Week: 3
2. Sailing
After a ninth-place finish at the Danmark Trophy, the co-ed sailors will lace up their boat shoes again this weekend at the Team Moody Trophy at URI. Unfortunately, the men will not have anyone to keep them company, as they race individually in the New England Men’s Singlehanded Championship this weekend.
Last Week: 2
1. Women’s Golf
The Crimson finished tied for ninth place with Yale at the Nittany Lions invitational over the weekend, and have two weeks to prepare for the Harvard Invitational. The team will have to decide if it should drop its strategy of practicing technique and instead consult Elin Nordegren for her vast knowledge of club warfare to improve its chances of topping its Ivy League foes. I think they’ll take the traditional approach.

The Harvard women’s soccer team rallied from a halftime deficit to defeat Fairfield University, 2-1, on Tuesday afternoon.
After an exciting overtime win at Yale this past weekend, the Crimson (7-4, 2-0 Ivy) came back to Ohiri Field to take on the Stags (3-4-3, 1-1 MAAC) in a nonconference matchup. Despite going down 1-0 in the opening minutes, Harvard found its offensive rhythm in the second half, with two goals coming from sophomore Peyton Johnson, who is also a Crimson sports comper, and rookie Meg Casscells-Hamby.
“We were sluggish in the first half, for sure,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said.  “[The fact that we were] recovering from an emotional game [against the Bulldogs] showed up in the game.”
While the hosts appeared most dangerous in the opening minutes of the game, Fairfield grabbed an early lead thanks to forward Kasey Schulz’s tally.  Less than eight minutes into the game, a poor clearance by the Crimson defense found its way to Stags midfielder Nikki Stanton, who slipped the ball to Schulz outside the box.  Schulz’s low shot deflected off a Harvard defender and beat a diving freshman goalkeeper Cheta Emba.
The Crimson, who started the game with many of its regular starters on the bench, struggled to find an answer for the goal. Despite dominating possession of the ball in the midfield, Harvard did not create many offensive opportunities for the first 20 minutes of the game.
Johnson believed the timing of the game had something to do with the slow start.
“Playing on a weekday is always tough,” the midfielder said.  “Your mind is in a lot of different places, and it is hard to leave all of that across the river.”
But the Crimson went into halftime on a positive note.  Before the whistle blew, Johnson unleashed a 30-yard shot towards the top corner that Fairfield goalkeeper Kelly Boudreau had to tip against the crossbar.
After numerous halftime substitutions, Harvard was able to counter its slow start.  In the 54th minute of the game, co-captain Lindsey Kowal put a corner into the middle of the box, and Johnson headed low past Boudreau to tie the score.
Harvard had a chance to make it two goals in as many minutes when freshman midfielder Lauren Urke’s long cross flew high past sophomore midfielder Elizabeth Weisman’s head.
As rain clouds moved in and opened up over Ohiri Field, both teams attempted shots from distance to test the goalkeepers’ ability to handle the ball in the wet conditions. In one of these instances, Casscells-Hamby fired a shot right at Boudreau, who fumbled the ball.  Two Crimson forwards rushed to slide home the rebound, but Boudreau recovered quickly, and the score remained tied.
Casscells-Hamby would only have to wait five more minutes to beat Boudreau.
Kowal again took a corner that was cleared back to her on the wing, and her follow-up cross found Casscells-Hamby in the middle of the box.
The freshman volleyed the ball into the top of the goal to give Harvard the lead in the 66th minute.
“Lindsey serves a great corner,” Johnson said.  “It’s pretty nice when a center back has two assists on the day.”
Casscells-Hamby’s goal underlined a strong performance by her and other members of her freshman class.
Both Emba and rookie goalkeeper Bethany Kanten had crucial saves, while Urke continued to make plays in the midfield.
Casscells-Hamby said she and her classmates have had a smooth transition to the college game.
“None of us have really felt like freshmen,” she said. “We all just feel like a part of the team.”
After the goal, the Crimson changed its formation slightly to provide more defensive cover, while the Stags made a late push for a tying goal.
Fairfield senior forward Jasmin Corniel, a halftime substitute, used her physical presence to drive the ball down the wing and test the Harvard defense with numerous crosses in the final minutes.
With two minutes left in the game, Corniel put in a cross that was headed towards goal, directly in between Kanten and onrushing Stags attackers.  Kanten barely won the race to the ball, punching it clear before colliding with a Stags forward.
From there, the Crimson maintained possession and ran out the clock, registering a midweek win to help carry the squad into Ivy League play this weekend.
“We took a different tactical approach [in the second half],” Johnson said.  “We put different people in different places. We had some fresh legs, and there was also a mentality switch.  We just turned it on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With my makeshift apartment this past summer located a quick 10-minute walk from Camp Nou, the home of FC Barcelona, it’s no surprise that soccer was a defining feature of my study abroad experience in Spain.
Although my trip coincided exactly with the two-month summer offseason of Champions League soccer, there was no shortage of “fútbol” to behold. The Pedralbes area is full of life, and pickup soccer games are almost always being played in parks near the city’s center.
But it wasn’t until a few days before I left Spain for the comforts of Cambridge—and the nearly forgotten pleasures of the hamburger and reading signs in English—that I finally went to tour the stadium and hall full of trophies at Camp Nou and take in the history of the club, which effectively parallels the history of the city itself.
After the man handing out audio guides at the museum entrance set the language on my headset to Castellano, I was ready to embark on a tour of another world.
The words “més que un club” (“more than a club”) imprinted on the stadium seats in a bold yellow took on new meaning when contextualized by Barça’s role in the maintenance of the Catalan identity of Barcelona, as the club retains the prefix “FC” (rather than permanently adopting the “CF”—club de fútbol—of so many other Spanish teams) among other subtle yet powerful messages.
The final exhibit in the museum tour is a mural-like video presentation in a long, ambling corridor depicting the greatest goals in Barça history. It’s a sort of history that’s foreign to United States.
Even though I was abroad during the offseason, some soccer related article appeared in the local newspaper every day, whether about a new, young player the club was thinking of signing or Messi’s recent hangout with LeBron James. Soccer is more than a sport in Barcelona; it’s an obsession.
It got me thinking: why don’t we watch soccer in the United States like they do over in Spain?
Despite falling in love with the beautiful game at age four, I grew up watching football, basketball and baseball. And I’m not complaining: March Madness is still my favorite thing on television, and I’d still watch an American football game over most any other sports contest.
I saw my fair share of Boston Breakers matches when I was little, watching in awe as Mia Hamm would dangle defenders down the sideline and Kristine Lilly attempted to counterattack the Washington Freedom’s star forward.
But the league went under in 2003, after playing just three seasons. And compared to my careful following of Boston’s major sports teams, I rarely watch the New England Revolution, opting instead to shift my focus onto European soccer.
The WPS, a second, more recent attempt at women’s pro soccer in the US, plays some games at none other than Harvard Stadium. And still, we ought to get more involved in the world’s most popular sport.
The oft-critiqued lack of scoring in soccer is one of the reasons I love to watch and play the game, because it adds intensity to the individual goal-scoring moment. If you’ve never watched a soccer game with a Spanish commentator, that needs to change: “GOOOOOAL” is one of the most perfect, universal phrases ever uttered on television, and the cry typically goes on for at least a few minutes.
Soccer is a game of moments, of the suspenseful second, because any play could be the one in which the game is won or lost.  Last Saturday, a quick, well-executed header in the first half put Yale up, 1-0, over Harvard men’s soccer, a deficit from which the team could not recover. A few minutes into overtime a couple hours earlier, a penalty kick in overtime had lifted the women’s team out of a stalemate with our Ivy rival. Last year, a whopping 43 out of 56 Ivy League soccer matchups were decided by a single goal or ended up tied after two overtimes.
Game-changing plays transpire in only seconds: the shot that just nicks the keeper’s hands and makes it over the crossbar, the free kick that sails just out of reach of an outstretched hand, the snipe from thirty yards out. And that single, glorifying shot or save is better for the other 89 minutes of palpable tension.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just about a month into her freshman year, freshman volleyball player Kristen Casey is already a big hit. The 5’11” outside hitter has already been an impact player, helping lead the Crimson to an 8-5 start.
“She’s light-years ahead of where she ought to be as a freshman,” said co-captain and libero Christine Wu.
Though Casey is a versatile player, she has been most effective as an outside hitter. But she remains a threat in every element of the game—she’s second on the team with 134 kills, and her 114 digs are third-best on the squad.
“She’s very much fitting into our system,” Harvard coach Jen Weiss said. “She’s the missing piece to our puzzle ... She’s a strong, athletic volleyball player with a really diverse game.”
This past weekend, she recorded career-highs with 19 kills and 22 digs in a five-game victory over Ivy-League rival Penn—the only other school she strongly considered as a recruit. Casey was dominant throughout the contest, recording the last point in a come-from-behind victory.
“[It] was a smart hit over the block,” co-captain Sandra Lynne Fryhofer said of Casey’s last shot. “It really showed what type of player she is ... She could have just gone for the big kill, but instead found the right spot on the court.”
Despite Casey’s individual success, the Crimson’s play is a balanced effort rather than one that relies heavily on a few key players. To excel within the scheme, Harvard's players have to remain within the team concept.
“There isn’t responsibility on any one player,” Fryhofer said. “Everyone has to focus on playing their position and not trying to do too much.”
In addition to her strengths on the court, Casey also seems to bring a sense of calm and composure uncommon in freshmen.
“[Casey is] a competitive and confident player,” Fryhofer added. “She goes all out, and if she makes a mistake, she gets over it and moves onto the next play. She has a desire that you can’t teach.”
So far, Casey has had little trouble adjusting to the Crimson’s system—a success which can largely be attributed to her work with the team before the start of the season.
Before coming to Harvard, she visited the campus several times, not only to get a sense of life at the school but also to train with the Crimson squad.
“She’s been on campus quite a few times, and she has fit right in like we thought she would,” Weiss said. “She’s fit in great, both athletically and academically.”
Her success so far is hardly a surprise. The high-school standout garned a number of accolades in the sport during her career before Harvard.
At The Bishop’s School in La Jolla, Calif., Casey was selected to PrepVolleyball.com’s Academic All-American team, and was an All-San Diego Section Division IV first team pick in 2009 and 2010.
Casey’s San Diego-based club team, Coast Volleyball, finished third at nationals this past summer.
“She’s a freshman, but you really forget that because her level of play is so high and her volleyball IQ is so high,” Wu said.
Wu and Casey have forged an excellent combination on the back line for the Crimson, and Wu often sets up Casey’s kills with defensive efforts to keep points alive.
“They’re a great combo,” Weiss said. “They’re both very aggressive and compatible. Christine has been the defensive player to set up Casey’s offense.”
The freshman attributes some of her personal success to Wu’s exceptional leadership and teamwork.
“I pass a lot, I serve, and I receive with Christine,” Casey said. “She keeps me calm in stressful situations and is a great mentor.”
And largely because of the help from Wu and her teammates, Casey has been able to put together a strong rookie season in her own right, consistently bolstering Harvard’s offensive efforts.
“She brings a lot of focused energy, and she really pushes everyone around her to work harder for every single point,” Wu said.

While Harvard stands by a professor's right to free speech, India is not quite as tolerant of Harvard-educated economist Subramanian Swamy. Swamy has been charged with "spreading enmity" between India's Hindus and Muslims, in the aftermath of a newspaper editorial calling for the removal of Muslim voting rights as a collective Hindu-nationalist response to Muslim acts of terror.
Swamy is the current president of India's conservative Janata party. A native of India, Swamy once served as a resident tutor in Lowell House and still regularly teaches summer economics classes at Harvard. He has long been a powerful and controversial force in Indian politics.
The current charges against him concern an article of his, published in July, called "How to Wipe Out Islamic Terror." Echoing the conservative Hindu nationalism of his party, he called for "a collective mindset as Hindus to stand against the Islamic terrorist." He went further to say that any Muslim who refuses to acknowledge "his or her Hindu legacy… can remain in India but should have no voting rights."
On Monday, Delhi police registered the case under Section 153a of the Indian penal code, "spreading enmity between communities." Swamy claims that the charges, coming many months after the article's publication, are an indication of corruption in the Indian government. He believes the charges to be an act of retaliation for his role in exposing the 2G spectrum scandal earlier this year, which implicated important members of the current administration in accepting huge bribes in exchange for the granting of telecommunications licenses.
Regardless, many Indian groups believe that his remarks represent a step back for the diffusion of racial tensions in India.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: October 7, 2011
The October 5 post "Harvard Economist Accused of 'Spreading Enmity Between Communities'" misidentified the Janata Party's prominence in Indian politics.

S. Joon Pahk '00 teaches science to undergrads at Harvard, so it's fair to guess that he's a pretty smart guy.
Everyone who tuned in to Jeopardy! for the past two nights saw definite evidence of Pahk's smarts. After making it through the competitive audition process for the show, Pahk emerged victorious in two rounds of Jeopardy! this week, already earning $79,000 over the two episodes. He will continue his run tonight.
Pahk, who described himself in one online interview as a "polymath," writes crossword puzzles in addition to teaching physics. His cruciverbal challenges have appeared in The New York Times and other publications.   Most of us can't even solve a New York Times crossword puzzle, let alone write one. With that in mind, perhaps it's no great leap to understand his success on Jeopardy!
 You can watch Pahk's two Jeopardy! appearances in two parts each here, here, here, and here, or tune in tonight to see how he fares on his third day.

The sound of music will soon be floating down the halls of Pforzheimer House—but there might be a few missed notes.
The House Masters and several tutors are starting a group of Pfoho musicians who will jam together one to three times a week. The catch: this isn't the typical Harvard band of award-winning cellists and concert pianists. This group is geared toward beginners.
"Harvard students are so hard on themselves, generally, that they don't often allow themselves the joy of being an amateur or a beginner at anything," said Erika Christakis, co-Master of Pfoho and a new guitarist herself. She dreamt up the new jam session as "an informal group where beginner students could meet in our residence and play for one another in a supportive environment, with refreshments and encouragement."
Christakis said she would like to see similar groups develop at Harvard for all sorts of skills, not just music.
"I would love to help facilitate a little more intellectual risk-taking, and I think the House system really provides a platform for that because we know and care about our students as whole people," Christakis said. "It takes courage to try something new."
If the new band of beginners hones their courage enough, Christakis said, they might even brave a recital at the end of the year.

The Lorax can speak for the trees. Well, at Harvard, the trees can now speak for themselves. And it turns out they sound like Winston Churchill, Bill Gates, Mother Teresa, and J. K. Rowling.
In anticipation of the 375th anniversary celebration coming up next week, the University has installed speakers high in the branches of several trees in the Old Yard. The devices play speeches from Harvard Voices, a compilation that was created for the last big anniversary, Harvard's 350th in 1986.
The University Marshall's office recently updated the collection of famous speeches delivered right here at Harvard with new speeches from the past 25 years.
The speakers are intended to "remind people that this is the site of some very historical things," Tania M. deLuzuriaga, a Harvard spokesperson, said.
If you want to listen to the full collection without passersby seeing you staring awestruck at a tree, search "Harvard Voices" on iTunes and download the recordings for free.
The speakers will remain in the trees until the anniversary celebration on Oct. 14.
"The hope is that people will pause for a moment and linger and think about what's being said," deLuzuriaga said. "A lot of what happens at Harvard resonates beyond Harvard. It's nice to think about those things once in a while."
