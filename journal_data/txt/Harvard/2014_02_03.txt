After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On Jan. 15, the Supreme Court heard arguments in McCullen v. Coakley. At issue is a Massachusetts law establishing a 35-foot “buffer zone” around abortion clinics, which protesters may not legally enter. While we support Massachusetts in its attempt to ensure women’s right to seek information or services from abortion clinics, we believe the law is overbearing in its scope, unduly violating the freedom of speech. 
The 35-foot buffer zone law currently in place was enacted in Nov. 2007, and draws support from precedent that has upheld buffer zones of up to 150 feet around polling places and eight feet around abortion clinics. The law is a direct response to the horrific shooting at an abortion clinic near Boston in 1994. This case presents an opportunity to have lasting reverberations not only for the fate of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of free speech and unrestricted access to abortion facilities but also for Martha M. Coakley's 2014 gubernatorial campaign.
Women ought to have unfettered access to the support and facilities that organizations like Planned Parenthood offer. However, a 35-foot dead space which allows for clinic employees to speak to potential entrants about the clinic, yet disallows protesters to non-violently express their views, disproportionately limits one party's First Amendment rights. 
Benjamin Franklin once said that no amount of liberty should ever be sacrificed in order to “purchase a little temporary safety.” In this case, we should heed his advice, especially when the potential threat to security is a peaceful, 77-year-old lady like Eleanor McCullen.
But there is also potential for compromise in this case, and a smaller buffer zone seems indispensible. We do not doubt that if no such zone existed, then the freedom of movement for women attempting to access the clinic would be affected, yet 35 feet is clearly too large a barrier. The eight-foot zone upheld in Hill v. Colorado may well be the optimal size. 
Specificities ought to be hashed out by the court, but we urge them to err on the side of the freedom of speech. While understandable in motive, the Massachusetts law does far too much in abridging that right, and should be struck down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear President Faust,
We applaud you for your statement over Winter Break, condemning the American Studies Association’s proposed boycott of Israeli academic institutions. In making this statement, you have signaled that Harvard University upholds the ideals of academic freedom and the open pursuit of ideas central to the role of scholarship and academic institutions. We urge you, however, to go further and cancel Harvard’s institutional membership with the ASA.
As you wrote, “the recent resolution of the ASA proposing to boycott Israeli universities represents a direct threat to these ideals, ideals which universities and scholarly associations should be dedicated to defend.” After the boycott resolution was announced, the Executive Committee of the Association of American Universities, an association of 62 leading research universities including Harvard, condemned the move as a direct violation of academic freedom: “Restrictions imposed on the ability of scholars of any particular country to work with their fellow academics in other countries, participate in meetings and organizations, or otherwise carry out their scholarly activities violate academic freedom.”
The boycott, however, is not only an attack upon academic freedom. It is part of a global campaign to undermine the moral and political foundations of the State of Israel.
The academic boycott is not aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a complex territorial conflict between competing national groups that can only be solved through bilateral negotiations between the parties themselves. Instead, by singling out Israeli scholars and students, the boycott agenda places the responsibility for ending the conflict entirely on Israel’s shoulders, ignores systemic obstacles to peace within Palestinian society, and paints Israeli society with a wide brush. This, in turn, undermines the efforts of the many individuals and organizations working on the ground in Israel to change the status quo.
Furthermore, many Israeli academics are publically engaged in efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Israeli academic community is made up of professors and students who represent Israel’s cultural, religious and national diversity. On university campuses across Israel, Jews, Muslims, and Christians join together in their common pursuit of academic scholarship. The ASA resolution, then, targets the very institutions working to promote the ideals of understanding and mutual respect that the boycott itself allegedly champions.
Even more, the ASA boycott resolution calls for students and scholars to “engage in research and public speaking about Israel-Palestine in support of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement.” BDS is at the forefront of efforts to delegitimize and demonize the State of Israel by branding Israel as a pariah state. Many BDS leaders openly assert their opposition to State of Israel’s very existence—they oppose a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promote an agenda that they hope will lead to the collapse of the state itself. BDS activities therefore do not merely seek to change the actions of Israel’s government. They seek to eliminate the state and its vital democracy. By condoning and participating in the BDS movement, the ASA academic boycott threatens not only the future of the State of Israel, but also the best hopes for peace in the region.
Finally, we find it upsetting that the ASA has chosen to single out Israel for condemnation. Not only is this focus on the sole state in the Middle East that affords civil rights to all of its citizens hypocritical and wrong. The singular and exclusive focus on Israel is also deeply worrying insofar as the ASA has never before called for an academic boycott of any country’s universities.  The current resolution, then, in both theory and effect, exhibits an all too frequent, widespread, and ominous prejudice against one particular state.
While we thank you for your strong and important message denouncing the ASA boycott resolution, we urge you, as the leader of Harvard University, to demonstrate moral leadership and immediately withdraw Harvard’s institutional membership from the ASA. Other universities, including Kenyon College, Indiana University, Brandeis University and Penn State Harrisburg, have already announced their intention to sever ties with the ASA as a result of the boycott. We ask that Harvard immediately join this group of universities to uphold its values and set an example for other universities around the country, showing that organizations promoting such boycotts will not only be denounced, but will also lose support from America’s leading academic institutions.
Thank you in advance for your attention to this grave and important matter.

Honestly, I have never played Candy Crush.
I hadn’t even heard of it until a few weeks ago. It’s weird: currently one of the most popular games in the world, and I did not know it existed. It is like not knowing Facebook exists until everyone else has made one. Nevertheless, the phenomenon known as Candy Crush is one thing that poked at my conscience this winter break. My experience with the game, though not through actually playing it, has been entirely coincidental and strange.
I came across an article in Time magazine about it. And by the time I finished reading the article, Candy Crush was one of the most brilliantly cruel business ideas I had ever come across. The creators of Candy Crush beautifully exploited human psychology in order to engineer a highly addictive product—but one that that will nonetheless go the way of all fads.
The game was actually released two years ago, but it really gained momentum in 2013. By November, it had been downloaded some 500 million times. Candy Crush’s maker, King, a London-based software company, designed the game almost like a highly addictive drug. 
The objective of the game is to line up three candies of the same color, swipe, and repeat. Players are initially given five lives to solve each puzzle. And once the player runs out of lives, they have to wait 30 minutes before they are given another life. 
But here is the killer: for those players who are a bit edgy and do not want to wait the half hour, they can pay $0.99 and buy another life. It is the perfect time and the perfect way to poke at your wallet. 
A player is on the edge of success and he/she loses his last life. There is no way they can hit the sleep button without given it one more shot; I mean it is only $0.99 right? And it is a never-ending game because the developers add more levels every other week. 
These facts explain my experience, and bewilderment, with Candy Crush. It all began when I was taking the E train into Manhattan last month. For those of you who have not been on the New York City subway during rush hour, you should. Every time I take it, I see all kinds of people: the crazy and the bored, the beggars and the millionaires, the kind and the intimidating. And people are doing one of four things: staring into space, sleeping, pounding on their phones, or speaking about how they were sent from God to save mankind. 
But exactly what are they doing on their phone if there is no internet or phone service? As I saw it, nine out of 10 times, they were swiping a bunch of Willy Wonka Nerd-looking things on their screens into the unknown. 
Of course, I knew it was a game, but the most peculiar thing was that the people I saw playing it were not kids or teenagers or 30-year-old men who look like they are still living with their parents. 
They say you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, but sometimes your eyes do not deceive. In fact, they can make you wonder. 
I saw professionally dressed, sophisticated adults with briefcases. They flaunted success, education, and urbanity; they looked like people who worked on Wall Street or Sixth Avenue law firms. And they played Candy Crush. My eyes saw, and I wondered. 
But Candy Crush is almost like Temple Run or the Harlem Shake or even the Jonas Brothers. It is a fad, and it is bound to slump at some point, but that all depends on when the sugar rush ends, when people decide to move on to another craze.
I suppose this is an unfortunate aspect of technology and pop-culture these days; the fast-pace of life makes prominence shorter-lived, even to the point where the trend lasts for merely a month or two. For one thing, more Candy Crush-like marvels are probably on their way. The question is, will they bewilder and take hold of people’s lives the way Candy Crush has?
I have yet to download the game. And maybe by the time I do, another game will have dethroned it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the break, something really important happened at Harvard Library. It didn’t get covered in The Crimson, or even in the Gazette, but Harvard Library changed its admittance rules so that children under 16 can enter Widener’s stacks when accompanied by an adult with a Harvard ID. I want to tell the story of how this happened, because I think it illustrates something important about Harvard, institutional momentum, scholarship, and motherhood.
Mia You, a graduate student in English at the University of California at Berkeley, lives in Cambridge with her family, including her baby daughter. About a year ago, You walked into Widener Library to do research for a review of a new edition of “Little Women.” She planned to get a few books from the stacks—but was told, as she swiped her library card at the stack entrance, that she couldn’t enter: her baby daughter was strapped to her chest, and children under 16 are not allowed in the stacks.
Two weeks ago, You wrote about this incident for the literary journal “A. Bradstreet.” She explains that she did eventually get ahold of her books—a student worker in Circulation fetched them for her—yet she missed out on the important and valuable scholarly experience of browsing bookshelves.
You noted that according to Harvard’s rules, she would have had to “pay $15-20/hour to a babysitter just to find a few books.” This is simply unaffordable for her. You asked, “Why does [Harvard] not see that supporting and encouraging young female scholars, many of whom who are either mothers or considering becoming mothers, will only benefit the university and the academy in the long run…?” Even worse, the rules weren’t applied consistently—she recounted that last month, when her husband brought their now two-year-old daughter to Widener, “he walked right into the stacks with our toddler on the loose next to him.”
This might be a good cue for a feminist deconstruction of Harvard’s role as a misogynistic, regressive, anti-mother, anti-baby institution. But that’s not merited. In fact, Harvard changed its policy on allowing children into the stacks within two days of You’s post. The updated policy reads: “In library areas where Harvard University-issued identification is required for entry (e.g. Widener stacks), Children under 16 years old may enter when accompanied by an adult with valid Harvard ID; children must be accompanied by an adult at all times.”
Harvard Library Communications wrote that Sarah Thomas, Harvard Library’s new Vice President, called for the policy to be re-examined immediately. I believe that this quick response was not simply out of concern for bad press, but due to a true desire on the part of Thomas and other Library administrators for Harvard’s libraries to be welcoming to women with children.
Nonetheless, this story exemplifies just how long it will take, how hard it will be, for feminists at Harvard to truly make this institution affirming for women, let alone working-class women, women of color, disabled women, and queer women. Mia You wrote in her piece two weeks ago that “the right for a young parent to enter the university library with his or her baby should not be left to hospitality, just as the right for a woman to enter a university library without a male chaperone shouldn’t have been considered hospitality in Woolf’s day.”
Yet it’s not the fault of the undergraduate student worker sitting at the stacks entrance for not extending enough hospitality. Institutions and their rules take a long time to change, and it will be generations more before Harvard has shaken off all the remnants of many centuries of patriarchy. The “no children in the stacks” rule is a perfect example of how patriarchy—like racism, classism, and ableism—perpetuates in institutions over time, even when those running and populating the institutions have the best anti-oppressive intentions.
In 1981, Ruth Hubbard, the first tenured biology professor at Harvard, was interviewed by Judith Walzer as part of a project to collect oral histories of all twelve tenured women at Harvard. In her oral history, Hubbard recounted her experience as a Radcliffe woman and then as a Harvard professor, noting, “I have felt, and I still feel, that Harvard is a bad place for women … Women are still socialized to sit at the feet of great men.” For Hubbard, it was “subtle sexism” that made studying and living at Harvard so difficult for female students in the early 1980s. More than thirty years after that interview, and more than forty years after the non-merger that joined Radcliffe officially to Harvard, Harvard’s history as an institution by and for “great men” has not gone away.
A rule against children in the stacks that’s bound to be enforced primarily on women hurts the scholarship of young mothers. In this case, one outspoken graduate student and one determined administrator managed to make a change. But rules like this one are woven into the very fabric of our university, and it will take hard work and dedication to untangle each of them, one at a time.

There is no reason why I should like football. It is against everything I stand for.
 
Once somebody sent me a chain email that talked about the differences between football season in the North and in the South. It said that in the North women pack for a game by slipping a Chapstick in their back pocket and a $20 bill in their front pocket. Down South, women attending the game need to sport a Louis Vuitton duffle with two lipsticks, powder, mascara (waterproof), concealer, and a fifth of bourbon. Wallet not necessary in the South, the article said—that’s what dates are for. 
 
It also chided that Northern fathers expect their daughters to understand Sylvia Plath, while down South dads expect their daughters to understand pass interference. I found this funny. My dad certainly does not understand pass interference, and if he ever wanted to understand it then I would be the logical person to explain how it worked. And my dad would definitely expect me to understand Sylvia Plath. But then again, he’s a northerner who just happens to live in the Bible Belt.
 
When we moved to Atlanta and businessmen made small talk by gossiping about the SEC, my dad wondered why his new peers had so much to say about the Securities and Exchange Commission. Originally from Manhattan and the Midwest, my parents claim that our family is still living out our “expat assignment in our home country,” even though we’ve been living in Georgia for more than ten years.
 
I guess the move to Georgia when I was 11 was when my mom decided to teach me Football 101. On some Saturdays she would grab a beer out of the fridge (I have still never seen her drink a beer on a non-game day), sizzle burger patties on the stove, and explain the rules of the game as we watched together. I learned about downs and blitzes and safeties and, yes, even pass interference. Together we developed some favorite players, and during the week we’d ping sports articles to each other through our AOL accounts (mine still under parental controls) to prepare for the next weekend’s matchups.
 
Even so, I should not like watching football. Women can’t participate at all professionally, or even in little leagues or high schools. For the guys who get to play it’s frequently as much about aggression as it is about strategy. It is the most concussion-inducing sport. The games are long with every timeout stuffed full of commercials about all of the beers and cars that football-loving manly men should buy to raise their machismo to the next level. College football programs require huge budgets that could be put towards classes or the university’s academic mission. Most of the professionals are ridiculously overpaid. Oh, and did I mention that the only way for women to be involved is through sexy dancing on the sidelines? That makes me fume. Yet somehow, I can’t watch enough.
 
This January I curled up on the couch with my mom to watch Auburn and Florida State play for the national championship. I was vaguely rooting for Auburn (because if you watch the SEC, you have to root for the SEC) but I also didn’t really care who won and I was just content to be watching, and a bit sad to be experiencing the last ever game of the Bowl Championship Series before the NCAA transitions to a new College Football Playoff system next season. Florida State scored a touchdown with only about 13 seconds left on the clock to win the game. Jameis Winston, FSU’s quarterback, threw the ball to his sprinting teammate Kelvin Benjamin who jumped high into the air to catch it in the end-zone. When Benjamin caught the ball, his entire body was head and shoulders above the Auburn defenders guarding him. It was a great play.
 
Back when I was in elementary school and summers were for spending every day swimming at the community pool (and eating Airheads candy), my siblings and I would occasionally go to “the deep end” and play a game on the diving boards. It was a two-person catching game: one person jumps off of the diving board and the other stands on the side of the pool and throws a Splash Bomb pool toy towards the jumper. The game is trickier than it sounds—frequently the pool toy and the jumper never connect: The splash bomb whizzes by before the jumper has left the diving board, or the jumper is underwater and the ball is still in the thrower’s hand, or somewhere in between such that the jumper and the ball just plain miss each other instead of meeting perfectly in the middle for an epic catch. We would play for hours, but only once in every dozen or so tries was the jumper able to grab the suspended Splash Bomb out of the air before going under.
 
Now imagine that same throwing game at the diving boards. Except you are on a football field and throwing the ball to one of 10 other people, and there are 11 people trying their absolute hardest to prevent you from throwing the ball at all. And each of the 11 defenders weighs between 200 and 400 pounds and they are tall and angry. They want to knock you over; their goal is to smush you, or pummel you into the ground, or at the very least knock that ball out of your hand and take it for themselves. And this is not a clear blue pool—you’re instead on a field that is dirty and muddy and has a little dip every now and then, and maybe it’s snowing or hailing. And your hand is sweating and the ball is a spheroid that could oh-so-easily slip right out of your grasp. And you have to locate your teammate a few yards downfield and throw the ball perfectly so that he can jump and catch it perfectly with nobody getting hurt. It seems like a nearly impossible task.
 
Professional players will complete that throw; they’ll catch that pass. Maybe I just like football because the fact that the whole sport can exist at all, that a play ever happens, is a bloody freaking miracle.

Undergraduate Council representatives detailed plans at their weekly meeting Sunday to meet with University President Drew G. Faust to request an additional $250,000 in funding. 
Members also passed legislation regarding the group’s attendance policy, the University’s investment practices, and Operation Ghost Protocol, the Council’s new student outreach effort.
 
Budget concerns are not foreign to the UC. Despite sustained efforts in recent years to increase UC funding by raising the student fee on the term bill, the Council’s budget has not been augmented since 2006, said UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15. Last year, in face of increased demand for funding and a stagnant budget, the UC made funding cuts that resulted in decreased funding for club sports.
The Council’s annual budget of less than $500,000 appears especially insufficient when compared to the multi-million dollar budgets of other colleges’ student governments, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 said.
Mayopoulos announced at the meeting that UC leaders will meet with Faust Feb. 20 to seek funding to the sum of a quarter of a million dollars and discuss other UC objectives.
In an interview after the meeting, Mayopoulos said that an increase in UC funding will have a positive impact on student life.
"We're making it possible that you don't have to run a small business along with running a club," he said.
"Students deserve what they were promised when they applied to this school,” he said. “If you're not part of [an organization] that has its own endowment because it's been around for hundreds of years—if you're trying to do something...that you really care about and you can’t pay for it, that's insulting."
Mayopoulos said that he is confident that if students publicly convey their concerns, the undergraduate body would likely be able to acquire the funds, whether via a term bill increase or direct funding from the University.
Still, Goffard and Mayopoulos said that while they will request $250,000, they would be willing to accept a lower amount if necessary.
Following the budget discussion, the UC shifted focus to voting on two new laws and a revision to a bylaw.
The Ghost Protocol Act, which mandates that student representatives be in dining halls at certain times to answer questions and distribute surveys, passed with unanimous support.
UC members also voted in favor of an update to their attendance policy bylaws in an effort to increase the accountability of UC representatives. Previous rules decreed that a student would be expelled from the Council after three absences from general or committee meetings.
“Our old policy almost assumed people were guilty until proven innocent,” said Kevin H. Xiong ’17, Rules Committee chair.
Under the new provisions, a Council member who has accrued three or more absences from general or committee meetings, or Ghost Protocol meals, will be held under review instead of being automatically expelled.
The UC then passed legislation relating to the University’s investment practices.
The Responsible Ownership Policy Endorsement Act, presented and written in part by the Responsible Investment At Harvard Coalition, advocates that the University and the Harvard Management Company, which manages Harvard’s endowment, ensure that the companies in which they hold a controlling stake abide by specified fair labor regulations.

The largest ever first-hand investigation into slavery and child labor in India’s handmade carpet sector has challenged claims that slavery and child labor have been removed from the industry.
The investigation, “Tainted Carpets: Slavery and Child Labor in India’s Hand-Made Carpet Sector,” was released by Harvard University’s François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights Jan. 28. The study explores 3,215 cases of illegal forced labor in nine states in northern India that contain production sites belonging to 172 carpet exporters.
The report’s author, Siddarth Kara, is a fellow with the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights and adjunct lecturer on public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. He used teams of field researchers—whose names were withheld for safety—to document firsthand cases of severe labor exploitation.
“The working conditions uncovered were nothing short of sub-human,” the report found. “Factories and shacks were cramped, filthy, unbearably hot...filled with stagnant and dust-filled air, and contaminated with grime and mold. Some sites were so filthy, pungent, and dangerous that the researchers were afraid to enter due to the risk to their safety.”
 
“The most disheartening thing is that so much exploitation still occurs in broad daylight,” Kara said.
According to Kara, entire villages were held in bondage due to petty loans and young children were forced to work in factories instead of attending schools.
With a comprehensive, industry-wide study, Kara said he hopes retailers will improve their labor standards. The report states numerous recommendations for retail carpet exports in an effort to eliminate these labor practices.
 
The report states, “the results…are solely intended to catalyze new initiatives to reduce the suffering that exists in a significant portion of carpet production in India.”
 
Kara said that he wants to see improvements such as, “enforcing basic labor law and standards, paying the full minimum wage, raising the minimum wage, ensuring children are in school, eradicating death bondage, prosecuting people breaking the law and elevating the level of supply chain investigation.”
 
Retailers have had mixed reactions to the new report. Kara said he has received responses of all kinds—some companies trying to improve existing labor practices and others denying there is any issue.
 
Kara also gave recommendations to everyday consumers: “Be increasingly aware of the kinds of conditions under which many of the things we buy every day may be produced or manufactured on the other side of the world,” he said.
 
He said he hopes “to see a world where retailers can say more conclusively, ‘These carpets are untainted by any of these offenses.’”

More than 450 participants from more than 35 universities around the world gathered to discuss a variety of LGBTQ issues at a conference this weekend organized by students from Harvard’s graduate schools. 
 
Hosted at the Law School and the Business School, the two-day conference aimed to encourage discussion and action on past successes and current issues in the queer community through a series of speakers, panels, and interactive sessions.
 
Binbin Chen, a participant at the conference and a student at Stanford Medical School, highly praised the weekend's events. 
“It’s Harvard, so the quality of the speakers were unheard of for me, and each module tackled very pressing issues,” he said.
 
Attendees listened to discourse about a number of varied subjects, including LGBTQ athletes, the military, inclusiveness in the workplace, and support for queer issues in the Republican Party. Speakers included Kristen Beck, a former Navy SEAL and a trans woman, Caitlin Cahow ’08, a queer women’s hockey player on the U.S. national team, and Gautam Raghavan, LGBTQ liaison to the White House.
 
AJ Lee, one of the co-chairs of the conference and a student at the Kennedy School ofGovernment, remarked that the organizers made special effort to represent the diversity of the community in both the topics discussed and selection of speakers. 
“[The queer community is] a very broad community with a lot of stakeholders,” Lee said. “So, when thinking of topics and speakers, we wanted to cover as much as we could. We wanted to pay particular attention to communities that are more marginalized or less visible in the larger LBGTQ community.”
 
He added that the conference further set itself apart by approaching these issues in an interdisciplinary manner and by encouraging reflection and action from attendees through “‘ideation’ sessions.” In these sessions, attendees shared experiences and worked on plans of actions related to a specific topic they had selected, such as bullying or trans inclusivity.
 
“They really educated us to deal with certain people in the community, to go out there and be part of it,” said Gardette Hutton, an attendee from Columbia University. “The whole conference itself was very educational and very inspirational.”
 
Although overall he gave the conference a “thumbs up,” Kapena J. Baptista ’16, who did not attend the conference but followed its formation, said that he would like to see an even broader range of topics examined in future conferences. “There are other issues, and there should be equal attention given to these topics.”
Baptista serves as co-chair of Harvard College GLOW, a group for queer students of color. He was also one of the most vocal of those who protested on Facebook when conference organizers announced Daniel K. “Dan” Savage, a well-known sex columnist and writer on queer issues, would be a speaker at the conference. Savage, who Baptista and others argued has made transphobic and biphobic comments in the past, later canceled his appearance due to scheduling conflicts.
 
Organizers said that they plan to continue the conference and noted the possibility of increasing the number of schools involved. 
 
“We’re meeting next week to turn inaugural into annual,” said Ana I. Mendy ’09, a conference co-chair and a student at the Business School.

Whether die-hard fans or not, many students decided to at least tune in to watch the Seattle Seahawks trounce the Denver Broncos on Sunday night, 43-8, as viewing parties around campus energized students for Super Bowl XLVIII.
The Freshman Dean’s Office and the Undergraduate Council partnered together to host a Super Bowl party for the freshman class. Those who attended the festivities in the Cambridge Queen’s Head were treated with snacks like mozzarella sticks, nachos, onion rings, and various beverages.
“I really didn’t have any other place to go watch this other than my common room,” Eric R. Anschuetz ’17 said. “Friends who don’t even watch football normally are here to watch, and it’s free food. I can’t complain.”
Even the campus dining halls prepared a special dinner for the big event. In honor of the Super Bowl, Harvard University Dining Services presented a menu of gameday favorites, which included boneless buffalo chicken wings, potato skins, and quesadillas.
“I like the Super Bowl wings and the potatoes but I feel like they should have more healthy vegetables to make you feel better while you’re eating things like this,” Meg G. Panetta ’17 said.
Although clubs and organizations like the Institute of Politics held viewing parties, many found buzzing events in the comfort of their own dorms or Houses, where students said they enjoyed the experience of watching the game among peers and friends.
“You get to see other people,” said Changlin Li ’14, who was watching the Super Bowl in the Winthrop Junior Common Room. “You get to talk to them when you’re getting food, or discussing scores and plays, or even when you’re selectively groaning with each other.
 
Although some students’ favorite teams never even made it to the Super Bowl, many chose a side to root for throughout the night.
“I usually root for the Cowboys, even though they haven’t been doing so well for the last couple of years,” Saahil R. Mehta ’17 said. “I’m rooting for the Seahawks right now.”
“I’m a big Detroit Lions fan, but today I’m rooting for the Broncos because of Peyton Manning,” Anschuetz said.
 
“Being in an environment where everyone is enthusiastic about the game brings up your own level of enthusiasm, even if you weren’t that enthusiastic to begin with,” Li said. 
However, students cheering for Seattle said they were proud of their team’s showing.
“I’m from Seattle so the way the game is turning out is great by me,” Li said at halftime.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College received 34,295 applications for admission to the Class of 2018, marking a decrease of 728 applications from last year, the University announced Monday afternoon.
Despite the 2 percent decrease in applications for early and regular admission, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that the number of applications has been largely constant in recent years. He did, however, note that there were slight demographic differences, from race to geographic background, in the type of students applying.
Almost a quarter of applicants—22.7 percent—requested an application-fee waiver, 6.3 percent more than last year, and 10.3 percent more than three years ago.
Fitzsimmons said that the increase in students requesting application-fee waivers is an indicator that more students need financial aid and follows a broader trend in the demographics of college applicants.
“More and more of the students out there require financial aid,” Fitzsimmons said.
The percentage of non-white students applying to Harvard has increased, with the exception of Native Americans, Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70 said in a University press release.
“There were also some geographic shifts, including a 5.8 percent decline in applications from the Midwest, a 5.1 percent decline from New England, and a 3.4 percent decline from international students,” she said.
Fitzsimmons said that the slight decline in applicants from the Midwest and New England was “quite predictable” and part of an ongoing trend in the climate of college applicants.
According to a report created by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education entitled “Knocking at the College Door,” the number of high school seniors has started to decline and is projected to continue to do so for the next 15 years. The report also stated that students from the Midwest and Northeast will apply to college in declining numbers, while those from the South and West will apply in higher numbers.
Fitzsimmons said that the number of applications has reached the “upper limit of what makes sense,” explaining that it would not be concerning if the admissions office were to receive slightly fewer applications, as was the case this year.
“It doesn’t do anyone any good if we, for example, decided to write many more search letters and to up the ante in recruiting and end up with 50,000 applications,” Fitzsimmons said. “We could do it easily. Any college can actually do that.”
Thus far, the College has already accepted 992 students from an early applicant pool of 4,692 people under the restrictive early action program, the largest group to be admitted early since the University reinstated its early action program in 2011.
Three other Ivy League schools released the number of applications to their respective incoming classes last month. Brown University saw 30,320 applications, the second largest number in the university’s history. The University of Pennsylvania received 35,788 applications for the class of 2018, a 14 percent increase from last year. Princeton received 26,607 applications, the highest number of applications since it reinstated its early action program in 2011.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty minutes wasn’t enough time to decide the outcome of the Harvard women’s hockey team’s (17-2-3, 13-2-2 ECAC) game against the Quinnipiac Bobcats (17-4-7, 8-3-5) Saturday afternoon at the High Point Solutions Arena. Two come-from-behind goals by sophomores Miye D’Oench and Mary Parker tied the score at two, but the Crimson was unable to score a decisive goal in a 2-2 tie. The contest ended the Crimson’s season-high five-game win streak.
The Bobcat power duo of junior Shiann Darkangelo and senior Kelly Babstock once again shone. Darkangelo had a goal and an assist while Babstock added another assist, upping her season total to 24. The Bobcats is unbeaten when Babstock records a point. Darkangelo has earned at least one point in each of the last four games and leads the Bobcats with 17 goals on the season.
After the first period ended in a 0-0 tie, Darkangelo and Babstock attacked the Harvard defense just over five minutes into the second. After dodging several defenders through the middle of the ice, Babstock dished a hard shot toward sophomore Crimson goalie Emerance Maschmeyer, who redirected the puck straight to Darkangelo. The Bobcat junior grabbed the rebound and immediately sent it back to Maschmeyer, who was unable to block the puck a second time.
D’Oench was quick to reciprocate, scoring for Harvard just over six minutes later. Coming off of a pass from junior captain Marissa Gedman, D’Oench was able to send a high shot past diving Quinnipiac goalie junior Chelsea Laden. The 1-1 stalemate wouldn’t last long however, as Bobcat freshman Emma Woods retaliated with a goal in transition.
The Crimson was able to tie the score again at two apiece midway through the third period off of an unassisted Parker goal that provided the final margin.
“I came off the bench in the top of the offensive zone and I just started skating in,” Parker said. “Then the puck made its way to the front of the net so I just went to the net and poked it in. fortunately it slid under the goalie and went in.”
However, the Crimson offense struggled to regain control after the match was tied up. For the final eight minutes of play following Parker’s goal, Harvard notched only one shot—missing wide. Quinnipiac had 16 total shots in the same time frame, though not all were on target. In the whole period, the Bobcats led the Crimson in shots on net, 15 to seven.
The Crimson continued to struggle during the five minute overtime period. Harvard was only able to get one shot off, a dish by junior Samantha Reber that was blocked by Quinnipiac sophomore Cydney Roesler. The Bobcats was the only team able to get a shot on target in the additional time.
“We shortened the bench and went with the players we felt were ready to go and wanted it and that worked out and got a goal halfway through the third period,” coach Maura Crowell said. “We crashed the whole time. We expected to win always through the overtime and everything so we were disappointed with the tie but we did get behind a couple times so also lucky.”
Even with the tie, the Crimson earned three points this weekend to add to its season total of 28 and retain its lead atop the ECAC, with Clarkson in second with 26 points and Cornell taking the third place spot with 25 points. The team was disappointed it failed to earn the win on Saturday, but Crowe said it knew that things could have been much worse.
“We expected to win because we felt at any point we could have,” Crowell said. “Unfortunately it didn’t happen, but Quinnipiac is a good team and a tie is better than a loss.”
The Crimson won’t have much time to rest as it starts back up with games on Tuesday when it faces Northeastern University in the first round of the Beanpot tournament. Harvard grabbed a 3-2 win last time the two teams met on the ice on Jan. 4.
“We have a quick turnaround with the Beanpot on Tuesday so we have to be well rested and come out with a lot of energy and a lot of fire for 60 minutes,” Crowell said. “We just talked to the girls about the way that they play at the end of the game. It’s awesome when the pressure is on so they just have to bring that at the beginning and try to sustain it for 60 minutes and things will go their way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After kicking off the season over a thousand miles away in Gainesville, FL last weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team (2-1) returned home Saturday to play its official home opener against UMass (2-1).
Showing no ill effects from a tough 4-0 defeat at the hands of the Gators its last time out, the Crimson dominated the Minutemen in all phases of the game, cruising to a 7-0 victory.
Harvard did not drop a single set to UMass, with most of the matches ending in timely fashion. But for a while, it certainly did not look like the team would earn a clean sweep.
Freshman Spencer Liang, playing at first singles, found herself trailing 5-0 in the opening set to UMass senior Sonia Bokhari. But with her back against the wall, the freshman mounted a comeback.
“Even though I went down pretty quickly, I knew that I wasn’t playing my best,” Liang said. “I knew that if I just stepped it up, I would be able to compete with and possibly beat this girl.”
Liang battled her way back into the match, taking five straight games against the UMass star. On Bokhari’s ensuing serve, Liang went up 40-15 with a chance to break, but the Bokhari also showed some resiliency of her own. After surrendering much of the match’s momentum, Bokhari fought back to take the game and reclaim the lead.
“After I lost that game and she went up 6-5, I was kind of like ‘No, did I come back for nothing?,” Liang said. “But I still fought hard and ended up saving set point.”
After fighting off Bokhari’s aforementioned set point, Liang persevered and won her service game to force a tiebreak. She quickly took a 3-0 advantage in the ‘breaker before Bokhari pulled up with an injury on one of her serves and was forced to retire.
Court three also featured a match that would go down to the wire. After winning the opening set 6-2, Crimson freshman June Lee needed to muster a comeback to defeat UMass sophomore Arielle Griffin. The freshman climbed her way out of a 5-6 deficit to force a tiebreak, which she went on to win, 7-3.
“I was feeling pretty confident [going into the tiebreak],” Lee said. “I wasn’t really nervous, and I knew that if I just went for my shots that I would come out on top.”
Another freshman coming up with a solid performance was Monica Lin. Playing on Court two in between her rookie counterparts, Lin took down UMass senior Yuliana Motyl, 6-1, 6-2.
Harvard coach Traci Green said that she was very happy with the performance of the freshman trio at the first three singles positions.
“Our freshmen are showing a lot of poise right now which is very special at this time of the season,” Green said. “You never know what to expect with freshmen, but they are very poised and focused, and hopefully they can keep building on these matches for the rest of the season.”
In the other singles matches, sophomore Amy He defeated Jessica Podlofsky at the fourth position, 6-1, 6-2. At line five, captain Hannah Morrill only dropped one game to Chanel Glasper, winning 6-1, 6-0. In the line six match, sophomore Amanda Lin downed UMass’ Anna Woosley, 6-3, 6-1.
In doubles, the pairing of Lee and Morrill swept Bokhari and Woosley 6-0, while the He and Amanda pair nearly did the same, defeating Podlofsky and Glasper, 6-1. Monica and Liang were locked in a tight battle with Motyl and Griffin, trailing 3-4, but the match was halted as the Crimson had already seized the doubles victory.
“Doubles was really exciting today,” Green said. “We’re still a little bit rusty, but there were so many good things out there from all the teams we saw, and the energy was great.”
The victory for Harvard marks its sixth triumph over UMass in as many tries. Green was pleased with the way her team battled for the first time in front of the home crowd.
“This team has a lot of fight,” Green said. “I think they already know from the matches they’ve already played that they can come back from any position in the match.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third time in the last four years the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team asserted itself as the top school among the Ivy League Big Three.
This weekend in New Haven the Crimson swept the dual meet against Yale and Princeton, beating the Bulldogs, 203-150, and topping the Tigers, 213-140.
Of the 19 events that the teams competed in, Harvard came out on top in 11 of them.
“I think we went into the meet as it being a litmus test for the Ivy League Championships,” senior Chris Satterthwaite said. “This is a meet we have historically done well in but it is also a meet that is historically competitive and I think we were thrilled with the outcome because it’s validation of what we’ve been working on this season.”
The team came out strong on Friday, winning four events, including junior Griffin Schumacher and senior Oliver Lee— who finished first and second in the 50 yard freestyle with race times of 19.96 and 20.22 seconds, respectively. Schumacher’s time landed him an NCAA B cut time, just 0.46 seconds away from A cut status. Swimmers who finished with A cut times are automatically invited to the NCAA Championships in the spring, while B cut times have to wait to fill in the remaining spots at that race.
“The B cuts allow us to enter the pool to be selected to go to the NCAA Championships but the goal is to try and get A cuts,” Satterthwaite said. “We were really pleased with the times because they allow us to get contention into the NCAA race, but we will have another chance to qualify at Ivies.”
Overall, the team finished the meet with 12 different B cut times. As a team, the Crimson also found success in its relays, finishing first in all five races.
Friday began and ended with Harvard relay victories, starting with a 1:19.12 finish in the 200 freestyle relay behind the team of junior Griffin Schumacher, Lee, senior Danny Crigler, and Satterthwaite. The 400 medley relay was won 3:14.04 by senior Jack Pretto, freshman Eric Ronda, sophomore Jacob Luna, and Satterthwaite.
“We were the underdog in the medley relays so it was very exciting to win those…so it really shows the depth of our team,” Lee said. “Relays are always a really fun part of the meet and it’s always great to win them.”
Harvard’s relay dominance continued on Saturday with the team of Pretto, Crigler, Luna, and Schumacher touching the wall at 1:28.34 to seal a victory in the day’s first event. Schumacher, Lee, Crigler, and Satterthwaite ended the day on a high note for the Crimson with a 2:55.13 finish in the 400 freestyle relay.
“The 200 free relay and the 400 free relay are definitely two that we are more competitive in nationally,” Satterthwaite said. “Three- quarters of those teams are seniors so we have been at it for a couple of years and we really enjoy swimming together and making the most of our last season together.”
On the diving block the Crimson had successful meet as well, with divers junior Michael Mosca and senior Joe Zarrella finishing first and second in both the one and three meter events. From the one meter board Mosca won with 321.85 points, followed by Zarrella who scored a 319.70. In the three meter event Mosca clinched it with 351.80 points and Zarrella recorded 343.80.
Several pool records were broken by Harvard throughout the weekend, including a 1:43.43 finish by freshman Jack Manchester in the 200 backstroke. Ronda, a fellow freshman, also broke the pool record in the 200 breaststroke. Both swimmers earned B cut honors for their swims.
“It’s impressive that we were setting so many pool records and some meet records,” Lee said. “A lot of guys were going their best times or close to their best times which is great because it’s still the top end of the season for a lot of guys.”
Schumacher and Satterthwaite combined for a one-two punch in the finish of the 100 yard freestyle, with respective times of 44.04 and 44.27. Luna contributed to the team’s winning ways with a first place victory in the 200 yard butterfly, touching the wall at 1:46.46.
Even though this was a solid with for the Crimson, Satterthwaite said, the team must look forward to future competition.
“This definitely gives us confidence for the rest of the season,” Satterthwaite said. “In the past we have won this meet and we’ve competed for the Ivy League Championship in previous years.  This is reassuring going into Ivies but by no means does it say we are going to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One doesn’t normally associate hat tricks with swimming and diving, but the Harvard women’s swimming and diving scored a rare three-peat, winning the HYP meet for the third year in a row. The victory over Yale and Princeton at the Robert J.H. Kiphuth Exhibition Pool marks the end of Ivy League competition for the Crimson this season.
Harvard started off strong on Saturday, winning seven of nine events, and its success bled into Sunday, when it continued to outpace its competitors.
“We started out going in with a really good attitude,” said junior co-captain Deirdre Clute. “We had a great team meeting about how we were going to fight no matter what and stick to what we know we do well which is have fun and just fight to the end.”
The Crimson victories began with the three-meter dive, where freshman Elina Leiviska and junior Schuyer Moore’s took first and second place, respectively. Both also placed in the one-meter dive Sunday morning, taking second and sixth place, with senior teammate Alex Stanton finishing fourth.
Harvard’s 200 medley relay teams placed first and third Saturday evening. The first group of swimmers included sophomore Danielle Lee, senior Sara Li, sophomore Kendall Crawford, and freshman Victoria Chan, who touched the wall at 1:43.12.
“There’s no better feeling than winning a relay,” said Clute, who swam in the second relay foursome. “First of all you’re watching as the race progresses and you’re cheering on your teammates which is always so exciting.”
The Crimson swept the podium at the 200 free, led by Chan. The freshman was closely followed by sophomore Margaret Ramsey, classmate Daniela Johnson and junior Sarah Sumner, who came in second, third and fourth.
“What we’ve really focused on is making sure that every person plays their role and pulls their weight,” Clute said. “It’s cool to see that in situations like this, maybe we don’t have one stand out, but we have four people that are going to get in the race and race their hearts out.”
Lee finished the 100-backstroke in first place at 54.42, just ahead of freshman Marissa Cominelli and Crawford, who placed third and fourth. In other action, junior Stephanie Ferrell placed first in the 100 breaststroke, and junior co-captain Danielle Schulkin finished third in the 200 butterfly.
Strong performances from underclassmen, Clute said, have given the team the physical spark Harvard used to its advantage this weekend. They have improved morale on the team throughout the season, according to Clute, bringing a sense of energy and enthusiasm to the pool.
“We have amazingly talented freshmen and sophomores across the board, but really it’s just great attitude that helps the team the most,” Clute said. “They come into every meet, and their excitement is just so tangible that it spreads to the rest of the team. I think that, paired with the wisdom and maturity of the upperclassmen make a great duo when it comes to big, stressful meets like this.”
On Sunday, Harvard controlled Yale’s pool as well. Lee once again took first in the 200 backstroke at 1:58.19, giving her three first-place finishes in the meet. Ferrell won the 200 breaststroke at 2:19.51, and sophomore Sherry Liu took first in the 500 freestyle.
Harvard ended the weekend taking first in the 400 freestyle relay, with the foursome of Chan, Sumner, Johnson and Li, a group who all brought home additional victories throughout the meet.
“I’m totally biased but I think we definitely have the most spirit on pool deck, and as captain that makes me so proud,” Schulkin said. “It’s just a fun team to be on, and when you’re having fun you’re going to swim fast. It makes the sport and it makes being on the team more meaningful in a lot of ways.”
Next weekend, part of the team will compete at the Virginia Tech Invitational in Blacksburg, while the remaining swimmers and divers will rest in preparation for the Ivy League Championship on Feb. 20.
“I think we’re going to see a ton of really fast times [at Ivies],” Schulkin said. “This weekend we were going pretty fast, but we definitely have the ability to go extremely fast, and I think that is about to come. I’m not going to make any predictions because I want us to go in with a fighter’s attitude and the underdog’s attitude.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s squash team, tallying two more wins this weekend over ranked opponents was just another accomplishment for a squad that has yet to be defeated this season.
The No. 2 Crimson (11-0, 5-0 Ivy) faced No. 8 Cornell on Saturday afternoon and No. 12 Columbia on Sunday on the road and came away with a pair of 8-1 victories.
HARVARD 8, COLUMBIA 1
The only loss Harvard suffered against the Lions (6-4, 2-3) was at the number three position. After Columbia’s Mohamed Abdel Maksoud and Crimson freshman Dylan Murray split the first two games, Murray forfeited the match due to sickness to give Abdel Maksoud the win.
Harvard co-captain Gary Power defeated Joshua Sehkar in the fourth spot, 11-3, 11-7, 11-5. The Crimson’s fifth and sixth position players, sophomore Nick Hopcroft and senior Thomas Mullaney, cruised to take down their opponents in three games.
Playing in the second position, co-captain Brandon McLaughlin endured a tough, five-set match against the Lions’ Rishi Tandon. The score was tied at two sets apiece in a back-and-forth exchange, with Tandon winning the first and third games and McLaughlin coming back to tie the match in the second and fourth. In a tight fifth set, McLaughlin outlasted his opponent to earn the win, 11-8.
“The Columbia team is a building program,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “The coach there has done a fantastic job. They’re very tough at the top end of the team, and the match of the weekend I would say was Brandon McLaughlin who won his match today in an absolute thriller.”
In the seventh, eighth, and ninth spots, junior Tyler Olson, sophomore Matt Roberts, and sophomore Sam Goldberg helped bring the Crimson to victory with three wins against their respective Columbia opponents.
In 2012, Columbia’s Ramit Tandon shared the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award with Harvard senior Ali Farag, the Crimson’s number one player. Only two Ivy League players have defeated Tandon in his three-year career, with Farag being one of them. In this year’s showdown, Farag came away with the victory in four games, 11-5, 9-11, 11-8, and 11-3.
“The guy I played, Tandon, is a great player,” Farag said. “We played each other in the finals of the individual nationals my sophomore year, so he’s obviously a very good player. I was happy I won in a four-game match.”
HARVARD 8, CORNELL 1
The Crimson came out on top against another Ivy League foe this weekend, beating the Big Red (6-5, 3-2) with only one dropped match.
Mullaney, Olson, and Roberts led the way by outplaying their Cornell opponents from start to finish, each winning their respective matches three sets to none.
Freshman Bryan Koh and junior Nigel Koh had to endure tougher bouts in order to emerge with victories of their own. Bryan faced off against Rishi Jalan in the sixth spot and earned a four-game win after dropping the second set. Nigel defeated Cornell’s Gustav Runersjo in five games to win in the fifth position, outlasting his opponent by an 11-6 mark in the final game.
“Cornell is always a team where we have very tough matches,” Way said. “We’ve beaten them in the last few years, but the score never reflects actually how close those matches are. It was quite a tough battle for most of the guys, and they’re delighted to come away at this time of the season with a win.”
In the number one match, Cornell’s Nicholas Sachvie could not best Farag and fell in straight sets, 11-8, 11-9, and 11-4. Murray and Power also notched two wins for the Crimson, with Murray winning in four sets and Power needing only three.
The sole loss of the day for Harvard came from McLaughlin, who was unable to defeat Aditya Jagtap in the second position. McLaughlin won the first game, 11-3, but Jagtap was quick to answer and snagged the next three sets, 11-5, 11-4, and 11-9.
The Crimson has assembled an undefeated season 25 times in the program’s history. This year, Farag has been undefeated in the number one spot. Hopcroft, Bryan and Nigel Koh, Mullaney, Olson, and Power are all tied with eight wins apiece. In the 11 contests played this season, Crimson players have gone 95-4 in individual matches.
“We trained so hard the whole season, and it shows in the matches now,” Farag said. “Every single match we learn more and more about how to beat our opponent, and I think this weekend really showed how strong we are.”

Happy Monday! Not only is Shopping Week officially over, but you’re probably also regretting eating all those Doritos in one sitting last night while wondering if the Superbowl or BuzzFeed quizzes are more exciting at this point. Here are some questions we have to describe our feelings about this coming week:
 How many times did we think back to Beyoncé's halftime show during Bruno Mars'?
Will yesterday’s warm weather continue or should we give up looking vaguely nice and retreat back to the parka and sweatpants outfit?
How many trips to J.P. Licks are we giving up to pay for our textbooks?
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
With a high of 35 degrees and a 30 percent chance of snow, today’s weather looks like winter as usual. Guess that groundhog was right. Here’s to another six weeks of winter at the least.

You’ve hit the dreaded “submit” button on the Common App, but as you very well know, your work is far from complete. Before you can sit back, relax, and spend a few months in suspense, you’ve got to make it through the college interview. Not all schools hold interviews, but many do—so here’s how to prepare yourself if you do find that email in your inbox from an alumnus looking to get to know you better.
Know the school.
This is your chance to show how much you know about the school you’re interviewing for, so make sure you take advantage of it. Spend time researching it beforehand, so you know plenty about the programs you’re interested in, living arrangements, student life, and extracurriculars. Your interviewer will be impressed if you ask him or her specific questions on these topics, because it shows you were interested enough in the college to learn as much as possible about it before applying. One of the biggest reasons why colleges hold interviews is to gauge your interest, so make sure you’re an informed and curious applicant!
Dress accordingly.
In the vast majority of interview settings, you are not expected to wear a full suit and tie, but you are expected to look neat, presentable, and professional. Dress as if you were giving a presentation at school; there’s no need to be over-the-top formal, but make sure you make a good first impression. Avoid anything too flashy, bright, or distracting; you want the interviewer to focus on you, not your outfit. Your attire is an important way to show how much you care about your interview and the school; looking sloppy or shabby can be a huge deterrent.
Ask questions.
Thoughtful questions about the school’s specifics will really impress your interviewer, so be sure to come prepared with a few. Often they’ll invite you to ask them whatever you want; this will be beneficial for you, too, because you’ve got the chance to talk to someone who actually attended the school. Take advantage of it! Make sure these questions have substance; by asking something too general that you could have easily researched yourself online, you’ll give your interviewer reason to doubt your interest. Avoid questions like “How big is your school?” or “Do you have a major in Economics?” because these are things you should already know going into the interview. Instead, try asking questions about the specifics behind the school’s career services for undergraduates, the process for designing your own plan of study if it isn’t on the school’s list of majors, or what the student body is truly like.  There are so many questions to ask that alumni are better equipped to answer than anyone else, so if you take the time to prepare some beforehand, you’ll be set when the time comes to ask them.
“Why do you want to attend this school?”
Know your answer to this question, because without a doubt you will not leave your interview without facing it. Whatever you do, steer clear from an answer having to do with prestige or ranking; they want you to be excited about what the school itself has to offer, not just it’s name brand. Bring up things that make this school unique; maybe they’ve got spectacular study abroad opportunities that you’re looking forward to taking advantage of. Maybe they’ve got a program of study perfectly tailored to your interests that you can’t find anywhere else. Maybe its location is very important to you; perhaps it’s near a big city that provide you with tons of internship opportunities, or maybe it’s in the middle of a picturesque countryside perfect for a nature-lover like you. Maybe when you visited campus you just got that “it” feeling, a feeling of comfort that no other campus gave you. Be sincere, passionate, and truthful, and your answer to this question could go a long way when it comes to success in your interview.
Be yourself.
It sounds cliché, but most of these interviewers have been doing this for a long time; they can tell who’s a phony and who’s not. Be yourself; don’t try to change your persona to fit what you think a student of this school should be like, or what you think your interviewer is looking to see. Talk honestly about your interests and goals, and allow your own personality to shine through. Don’t prepare word-for-word answers as if this interview were scripted; it’s supposed to be a conversation more than anything. Your interviewer is there to get to know you, so be comfortable and confident in your own skin!
Follow up.
A simple thank-you email following your interview could go a long way. Let your interviewer know you’re grateful for his time, and you enjoyed the discussion; a little something like this can make you a bit more memorable when it comes time for the interviewer to write up your recommendation. They’ll appreciate your efforts!
