After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in less than a year, investigators have recently uncovered shocking footage of animal cruelty at a number of Butterball turkey facilities. Similar abuses exposed in December 2011 were so severe that they led to several criminal charges—a particularly telling detail considering that farm animals, excluded even from the paltry Animal Welfare Act, are extended virtually no legal protections.
Consumers have responded to both incidents, rightly, with outrage. Even a cursory glance at Butterball’s Facebook page will reveal what an absolute public relations disaster the scandal has been for the corporation. Among countless expressions of anger and disgust are calls for a boycott of Butterball and its abuses. It is tempting, both intellectually and emotionally, to hold a single party accountable for a crime that is deeply entrenched and dishearteningly widespread.
Yet this may not be the most prudent course of action for consumers to take. Certainly, those who have denounced Butterball are well intentioned. But the overwhelming majority of alternatives to the brand routinely engage in the same kinds of abuses: 99 percent of meat in the United States comes from factory farms like those operated by Butterball. Activists have chosen to expose Butterball not because it is unique in its treatment of animals, but because it is the world’s largest purveyor of turkey products and has the greatest potential to attract consumer attention to what is, tragically, an industry standard.
The question that we should instead be asking—and that Mercy For Animals activists undoubtedly hoped to provoke—is: Why do we continue to tolerate a food system that depends on the routine, unavailing abuse of animals? More precisely, why do we continue to take part in a food system that is required neither by our bodies nor our palates and that calls for the slaughter of beings with no less ability to experience pain than our own?
There is perhaps no better time than Thanksgiving to consider the far-reaching consequences of our choices. The first Thanksgiving was described by Captain John Woodlief as a “day of thanksgiving to Almighty God” for the arrival of the English settlers in the New World. Thanksgiving should be an occasion for us to express awe and gratitude for the beauty and abundance that the Earth offers us, as intended the New World’s first English settlers four centuries ago. Yet we are often loath to admit that many of our contemporary practices are in stark opposition to this aim. Modern animal agriculture represents perhaps the most gratuitous and tragic misuse of resources known to humankind: We presently use many times more resources than we can afford in order to produce animal-based foods and, each year, billions of voiceless farm animals endure the hideous consequences. It is all the more unfortunate that one embodiment of this system has become the centerpiece of Thanksgiving Day in the form of the Thanksgiving turkey.
This, then, is one of the unfortunate contradictions of Thanksgiving. A holiday whose purpose is to celebrate the world’s richness is used by corporations like Butterball to abuse the beings with whom we share the Earth and encourage irresponsible consumption that makes a mockery of the holiday’s true significance. It can be awfully taxing to come to grips with this reality, and even more so to acknowledge responsibility for the role that we play in sustaining it. Yet in acknowledging that it is fundamentally we, not Butterball or any other abusive corporation, who drive demand for and enable such glaring injustices, we also acknowledge that each of us has the power and obligation to end them. Too many of us have called for a boycott of particular culprits rather than the systemic injustice itself, lamenting that we have little alternative to such pervasive cruelty, yet this does a tremendous disservice to the power we have to choose how we wish to live our values. Rather than searching for the lesser of many evils, we should be choosing to forgo them altogether.
This Thursday, I encourage members of the Harvard community to make compassionate choices and leave turkey off of their Thanksgiving plates. Doing so is the only way we can ensure that our Thanksgiving celebrations do not come at the woeful expense of another. Such a break from tradition may feel startling, but let us not forget the occasion that spurred the first Thanksgiving in New England: a courageous break from the past. And fortunately for us, choosing compassion has never been easier. Americans are quickly recognizing how effortless and rewarding is plant-based eating. We have the enviable privilege of making choices that are consistent with our values, which is something to be truly thankful for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, in news that surprised few observers, Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, announced that he would seek re-election next year. With approval ratings well over 50 percent, the charismatic, controversial figure—you may remember him as the president who gave refuge to Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, earlier this year—seems likely to be successful in his bid. If Correa does win reelection, he will merely help to cement the dominant role that leftist political forces have played in Latin America for much of the current century.
Since 1998, when Hugo Chavez was elected in Venezuela, democratic processes have brought leftist parties to power over as much as two-thirds of Latin America’s population. This would be remarkable in any region, but it’s especially so in one whose political history is riddled with oligarchical tendencies and right-wing military dictatorships. As recently as the 1980s, with Pinochet and other anti-Communist strongmen firmly in power, a leftist Latin America was unthinkable. For all intents and purposes, the region was Washington’s sandbox. Not anymore.
Often, commentators break down the leftist governments in Latin America into two types—a “good” left and a “bad” left, or, in the more savory terms of Alejandro Vargas Llosa, a “vegetarian” left and a “carnivorous” one. The first to coin this distinction was the Mexican politician and academic Jorge G. Castañeda in 2006, and it has dominated media representations of the region ever since. The recent scuffle over Assange serves as a perfect illustration of this, with news pieces darkly suggesting that ties between Chavez, Castro, and Correa motivated Ecuador’s actions.
On the one hand, the theory goes, we have anti-American, decidedly socialist regimes in countries such as Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador. On the other, we have more moderate, pragmatic, and friendly governments such as those of Brazil and Chile. This simplistic dichotomy carries dangerous implications, ignoring the vast differences between governments and conditions in ostensibly “similar” countries and conjuring enemies where none exist. The truth often proves to be far more nuanced. Just look to Ecuador, which uses as its currency the U.S. dollar.
Last week, I had the opportunity to sit down with Steven Levitsky, a government professor here at Harvard (you might know him from Government 20) and one of the world’s leading experts on Latin American politics. Levitsky has written extensively on the emergence of leftist governments in Latin America. His latest book “The Resurgence of the Latin American Left” presents a thoughtful categorization of governments in the region far closer to reality than Castañeda’s stark, black-and-white system.
During our conversation, Levitsky suggested that the concept of a homogenous socialist bloc in the Americas is much more smoke than substance. He referred to Bolivarianism, Chavez’s pan-American political doctrine. “At a time when Chavez was beginning to try to export Bolivarianism…what everybody, at least in the Beltway, overestimated was the capacity to do that. It’s really hard to influence political outcomes in other countries,” Levitsky reflected. “Chavez is not the main reason Evo Morales got elected in Bolivia. Chavez is not the main reason Correa got elected in Ecuador. For the most part, Chavez has failed…His impact has been very limited.”
During a conversation with Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo, a lecturer in government, I received a slightly more pessimistic outlook on the Latin American left. Diaz agrees that the region’s governments fall into a spectrum rather than a dichotomy, but, he says, “there is a lot of merit to [the dichotomy].” In Diaz’s view, “Chavez has been able to successfully export his revolution in places like Bolivia, Ecuador, [and] Nicaragua, but not anywhere else…people in other Latin American countries don’t want to see another Chavez.” Diaz likens this situation to a “draw,” with Chavez gaining influence in some places and suffering a backlash in others.
When I asked him about where he viewed the region in a few generations’ time, Diaz asserted, quite sensibly, that “politics goes in such waves, it’s such a pendulum…all over the world you see governments come in, try to implement a series of reforms, then there’s a reaction against them and they go the other way.” According to this view, it’s difficult at best and impossible at worst to make political predictions in the long term.
While I would have to agree, as a Latin American I hope Levitsky’s forecast wins the day. The professor predicts that the true, lasting impact of the left in Latin America will be felt in places like Brazil or Uruguay, where governments with solid institutional foundations have put in place, for the first time in history, the building blocks of welfare states. These policies may be redistributive, but in giving millions access to health care and education, they are “almost unambiguously positive.”
The wave of leftist governments that has rocked Latin America over the past 15 years or so, therefore, is not something to fear. If anything, we should welcome the enhanced democratic processes they’ve ushered in. Bearing in mind that distinctions are often more important than similarities, we should not see this wave, or even part of it, as an anti-American bloc. Rather, it’s an inspiring diversity of exercises in governance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few days before the presidential election, I was talking to a friend from North Carolina. He told me that, when Obama was first elected in 2008, a number of his peers showed up wearing black the next day, mourning the “death of America.” I wasn’t surprised. As a Texas-born, Tennessee-raised liberal, I’d seen similar things. While I have never felt personally attacked by people’s political comments, I grew up hearing enough uncontested comments to make me want to hightail it across the Mason-Dixon Line as soon as possible. Election season or not, it is both frustrating and alienating to live in a culture where it is simply assumed that everyone agrees—and you do not.
But, at Harvard, I have found the same problem, I am just on the other side of it. I’ve met plenty of professors, teaching fellows, tutors, and classmates who assumed that any truly educated and conscious American would vote Democrat in this election. These outspoken liberals are not wrong in thinking that most other people agree. A recent Crimson survey found that 77 percent of Harvard students supported Obama. Only 17 percent backed Romney, meaning that almost four out of every five students would be happily nodding along with pretty much any anti-Romney attack.
Still, four out of five students isn’t everyone. Unfortunately, liberals here often seem to assume they can speak disparagingly about candidates, platforms, and voters and not risk quashing any opposing views. I have heard many people at Harvard comfortably criticizing conservatism without first considering their audience.  It seems that the idea of a kind and intelligent conservative just doesn’t fit into their view of the Harvard community. 
When you start off with that viewpoint, you’re pretty much guaranteed to have an unproductive discussion—and, for that matter, an unproductive democracy. Our system works best when there’s open communication about ideas, when we take the time to listen to each other and move toward a more complete understanding. But there’s little room for discussion when one person has been cast as wrong, or misguided, or offensive before he’s even gotten a chance to speak. Faced with this, many will simply choose not to speak up; those that do will often be either the very brash or the very dogmatic. And, while that conversation may be interesting, many other opportunities for more moderate discussions will have been lost.
Perhaps the issues at stake in this election felt more personal. Many saw a vote for the Republican Party as a direct attack on their way of life or the lives of others, concluding that anyone who voted for Romney must personally hate gays, minorities, immigrants, and women. That might be true for some Romney supporters. Yet social issues are complicated, and there are many paths to the same conclusions. Just because there are bigots who oppose the DREAM Act does not mean that everyone who opposes the DREAM Act is a bigot. Also, of course, due to our two-party system, many Republicans didn’t agree with all of Romney’s social positions—almost all voters have to make some sacrifices when choosing how to cast their ballots. A mere party affiliation can only reveal so much about a person’s beliefs on each specific issue.
More discussion will not necessarily make us all agree. But Harvard’s Democrats must be aware that assuming everyone agrees with them can come off as disrespectful and shut down conversations—whether it’s an election year or not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After outcry erupted across campus over Harvard University Dining Services’ new effort to restrict the use of Harvard Hillel’s dining hall to the Jewish community, Hillel has now posted a new sign modifying the former statement. The new sign welcomes students from across the Harvard community to use the Hillel dining hall as long as they bear in mind the needs of students who have dietary restrictions due to their religious beliefs. We support the effort of HUDS to clarify the previous misunderstanding and reemphasize the importance of acceptance at Hillel. Discrimination based on racial and religious distinction is inherently harmful and unacceptable whatever the justification. HUDS and Hillel should continue to work together to create a solution in which the special dietary needs of observant students are met while the community spirit of Hillel is upheld.
 On Friday, November 9, the original sign was posted at Hillel limiting entrance to the dining hall to only those who are “a member or an invited guest of Harvard’s diverse Jewish community.” This restriction was implemented by HUDS to decrease the operating deficit of the kosher dining hall, where food is twice as costly to produce as the food in House dining halls.
Although the concern over Hillel’s expenses is necessary to preserve Hillel’s primary ability fulfill the dietary needs of students who keep kosher, the decision to restrict admission to the dining hall was not the appropriate response. As Jonah C. Steinberg, the Executive Director of Harvard Hillel stated, “[The restriction] creates conflict with our inclusive and welcoming environment.” Students should be able to have access to food that meets their dietary restrictions without being restricted to a limiting dining environment. From the opposite vantage point, all students should be able to partake in the Hillel community no matter their religious beliefs. Only by maintaining this environment of tolerance can Hillel continue to serve as a home for open discussion and acceptance of the Jewish faith and tradition on campus.
Thus, HUDS and Hillel’s response to reverse the movement to restrict the entrance to the dining hall this weekend should be viewed as a step in the right direction for preserving a culture of openness at Hillel and on campus as a whole. It is crucial not only that students who are observant have access to the proper food, but also equally important to uphold religious tolerance. Harvard should continue to foster institutions that promote tolerance of the religious diversity on campus. Thus, as long as Hillel welcomes all Harvard students of all faiths, HUDS should provide Hillel the funding it needs to continue serving food to all students interested in participating in this community.

UPDATED: Nov. 19 at 9:07 p.m.
While most college seniors are concerned about keeping in touch with their roommates after graduation, Quincy House roommates Julian B. Gewirtz ’13 and Benjamin B. Wilcox ’13 will spend the next year together studying at Oxford.
Both Gewirtz and Wilcox won the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship. They were among six Harvard seniors—including Aidan C. de Burgh Daly ’13, Allan J. Hsiao ’13, Nina M. Yancy ’13, and Phillip Z. Yao ’13 as well—on the list of 32 recipients nationwide selected from 838 applicants from 302 colleges and universities. The scholars were selected based on their academic performance, leadership potential, philanthropic spirit, and athletic achievements.
The Rhodes Scholarship is "the oldest and best known award for international study, and arguably the most famous academic award available to American college graduates," wrote Elliot F. Gerson, American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust, in a press release.
The winners were announced on Saturday afternoon in front of a group of students who had traveled to complete two days of interviews.
"The judge in charge of my committee called it the ‘Miss America’ moment," said Yancy, who will study comparative social policy and global health at Oxford.
"I was stunned,” said Gewirtz, who plans to continue his study of Chinese history next year.  “I immediately felt beyond fortunate."
Hsiao wrote in an email that his studies have been inspired by his parents’ migration from China to the United States and that he hopes to continue to focus his studies on modern Chinese and migration.
"It’s been most meaningful listening to people’s stories of both struggle and success in coming to the cities," he said of his academic work so far.
Though Daly said he felt most Rhodes Scholars focus on the humanities, he and one of Harvard’s other winners come from a science background.
"I’m looking forward to exploring different research opportunities in science and applications of computer science in biology and chemistry before I want to decide what I want to do for my doctorate," said Daly, a computer science concentrator at Harvard.
Yao, a physics concentrator, plans to study the intersection of education and technology in Oxford’s Department of Education.
"Education has long been a passion of mine, and I’m really excited to have this opportunity," Yao wrote in an email.

After many years of negotiations, Harvard School of Public Health administrators and student government representatives are finally close to reaching an agreement on standardizing teaching assistant salaries across the nine departments of the school.
At the moment, teaching assistants in the lowest-paid department may make as little as a quarter of what their counterparts in the highest-paid department do, according to former student government president Guy D. Harling. In a given quarter, one HSPH teaching assistant can be paid $500 while another earns $2,000 in a different department, he said.
Harling, a fifth-year doctoral student at HSPH, has spearheaded the student government’s push for standardized teaching assistant pay for three years, since one department angered students by cutting pay by 25 percent about two weeks before the beginning of a semester. Now, the school is at last putting the finishing touches on a policy that it expects to adopt by the end of the month.
Harling attributes the drawn-out process largely to the fact that the policy requires the agreement of 11 different groups: the school’s central administration, student body representatives, and the nine departments.
"[The departments] are very different sizes, shapes, and much like the schools of Harvard, they have different levels of financial security—a lot of very different agendas about what is reasonable and what is affordable," Harling said.
Nancy Turnbull, associate dean for educational programs at HSPH, agreed, "Figuring out how we want to change things and what the financial implications would be and how we move towards a more standardized process with so much variability at the moment has been complicated."
According to Harling, the change requires setting standards about what to expect from professors and what to expect from students in classes of any kind.
The variability in salaries at present may result from the disparity in teaching assistants’ work: different class sizes, different work hours, and different tasks—like teaching sections versus grading papers.
"The credits are the same regardless of what class you are in, so it should be the same amount of money per student for each course for each department to pay TA’s, and a lot of the process has been try to figure out how that works," Harling said.
That required looking closely at the many departments’ curricula. "We’ve had to get a very detailed understanding for each course at the school that needs a teaching assistant," Turnbull said. "We have hundreds of courses in the school, so in order to understand what the implications of various changes would be, we’ve had to do very detailed analysis."
After a year of talking to each department about its payment policies, Harling found that some chose to pay depending on the number of students in the class and others based on the number of hours put in by the teaching assistants.
But even a standardized salary may not be enough to satisfy students. "The first goal is just to bring everybody up to something reasonable," Harling said. "I still think on average we’re being underpaid for what we are doing, but maybe others are being underpaid for what they do too."
Harling said that the student government has initiated discussions with the administration about the salaries of teaching assistants in other Harvard University schools. While teaching assistants in the Graduate School of Education, the Kennedy School, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are paid considerably more than those at HSPH, Harling noted that the hours and work load can also be more demanding elsewhere.
"You don’t come to HSPH to TA for money...you come because you care about the course," Harling said.
With the policy in the works but not yet sealed, students are optimistic but not yet triumphant.
"“Until we see something on paper, I remain cautious that things may keep rolling," Harling said. "The administration is definitely available and generally quite responsive. It’s just not necessarily easy to put together something."
Douglas W. Dockery, chair of the Department of Environmental Health at HSPH, said, "I agree with the students that we do need equitable pay across the different departments and am hoping we come to a resolution on this.... I think we all agree that it’s a big issue and want to resolve it. It’s just a question of money and finding the resources to make this work."
Natalie K. Meyers, the current HSPH student government president, said, "If we could see that closed this year, that’d be a huge success... institutional change takes more than just one term or...one year. I’m encouraging the rest of the student government to have these small wins all throughout."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the Civil War, Harvard College students’ curriculum included more than general education courses—the men engaged in military training to prepare them for combat.
Michael David Cohen, a history professor at University of Tennessee, Knoxville and the author of the recently published book "Reconstructing the Campus: Higher Education and the American Civil War," used Harvard as a case study to illustrate the Civil War’s indelible impact on higher education in a talk on Friday at the Harvard Book Store.
In response to student demand for military drills, "the faculty and the Harvard Corporation...obliged. They replaced gymnastic exercises with the Faculty College Drill Club," Cohen read from his book.
War fever spread quickly on college campuses, Cohen said. As an example of the way fierce loyalties appeared not only on the battlefields but in the Yard, he noted that the editor of Harvard Magazine once published the names of the six Harvard students who joined the Union army but left out 15 who had joined the Confederate forces at that point.
Cohen said that the long-term effect of the war on higher education was a dramatic change in the demographics of college students, with universities opening their gates to the middle class, women, and African-Americans. This shift was particularly noticeable in the South, where universities offered training in certain trades to encourage young men from the middle class to enroll, Cohen said.
"It was very hard [for Southern colleges] to attract students because there was a depression in the South," Cohen said. "Colleges wanted to show that attending was practical—that you could learn a trade like nursing or mining."
After the Civil War, Harvard graduated its first African-American student. Several state-funded universities in the South also briefly accepted African-American students during the Reconstruction era, when the liberal-minded Radical Republicans held power in the South.
Though brief, the period marked a drastic educational shift. “[Before the Civil War], it was forbidden in some states to teach a black person to read,” Cohen pointed out.
Cohen, who earned his Ph.D. at Harvard, said he has maintained a long-standing interest in education and history, and he hopes to research the education of Civil-War-era politicians next.
"When I was in middle school, I wanted to be a middle school history teacher; when I was in high school, I wanted to be a high school history teacher; when I was in college, I decided to be a college history professor," he said.

While many of their classmates trekked to Harvard Stadium to watch the Crimson beat Yale on Saturday, some undergraduates did not attend The Game due to other commitments or lack of interest.
All College students had the opportunity to pick up a free ticket to The Game, which drew a sold-out crowd of 31,123.
Some students who did not go to The Game had their own athletic contests to attend.
Blake T. Lee ’16 and the rest of the men’s varsity water polo team skipped the football game to compete at the Collegiate Water Polo Association Eastern Division Championships in Princeton, N.J., over the weekend.
“As a water polo player, that was more important to me,” Lee said. “I was proud to be representing the Harvard Crimson in my own way on Saturday.”
Other undergraduates said that they did not attend The Game or the accompanying festivities because they had too many assignments and assessments in the days prior to Thanksgiving.
On Friday, Caitlin S. Pendleton ’15 said that she was not planning to take in The Game—or any of the weekend’s revelries—because she had to write a paper and study for a test.
“I know that if I go to The Game, it won’t just be that—my friends and I will go out after too,” Pendleton said. “I know I’ll hate myself on Sunday afternoon if I go.”
Other students said they chose not to attend because they believe the event promotes rowdiness and disrespect.
Lauren M. Chaleff ’15 wrote in an email that she did not attend The Game because she had plans on Saturday, but probably would not have gone even if she had been free.
“[Harvard-Yale] weekend makes me really conscious of certain issues I have with being a college student here,” Chaleff wrote. She cited litter, noise, and other disruptions caused by drunken partiers as unnecessary burdens for police officers, security guards, and campus maintenance staff.
“I think [Harvard-Yale] weekend really brings forward the role that Harvard and its students play in Cambridge, and it’s not one that I’m totally comfortable with,” Chaleff added.
Yale students, facing the additional disincentive of having to travel to Harvard to support a Bulldogs team that was not expected to win, also did not come out in full ranks.
The Yale Daily News reported on Thursday that 250 of the 3,100 tickets allotted for Yale students were not purchased by the time sales concluded on Wednesday.

According to a new sign placed at the entrance of the dining hall at Harvard Hillel on Friday, Harvard University Dining Services has officially reopened the kosher kitchen’s doors to all.
The new policy welcomes “students of all backgrounds and faiths” to dine at Hillel, while still emphasizing the kosher dining hall’s mission “to foster and share Jewish life, ideas, and culture at Harvard.”
This announcement retracts HUDS’ earlier decision to implement dining restrictions at Harvard Hillel due to budget concerns. The former policy, explained on a sign outside Hillel dining hall last Friday, said admittance was limited to “a member or an invited guest of Harvard’s diverse Jewish community.”
The earlier sign prompted consternation among Jews and non-Jews alike. But a joint statement released by Associate Dean of Student Life Kimberly A. Pacelli, David P. Davidson from Harvard University Dining Services, and Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg from Harvard Hillel said that the previous statement had been misunderstood.
"In an effort to continue fulfilling the kitchen’s primary mission, a sign was posted that many mistakenly interpreted as restricting the facility solely to members of Harvard’s Jewish community. This was never our intention, the sign was inartfully worded, and we regret the confusion it apparently engendered,” the three wrote.
The joint statement also clarified the reasoning behind the policy, explaining that the kosher dining hall, intended to serve approximately 90 to 100 people per night, has seen recent spikes in attendance. On average, more than 200 students per night have dined at Hillel since the beginning of this year, often making it difficult for the small kitchen to accommodate students both with and without dietary restrictions.
Although the statement explains all are welcome at Harvard Hillel, it also asks that students be respectful of Hillel’s purpose as a kosher dining hall.
Most students who dine at Hillel said they were against the changes implemented by HUDS and supported the return to Hillel’s former inclusiveness.
Peter N. Hadar ’13, the vice president for education at Hillel, said that HUDS’ restrictions were widely opposed. “I think it’s good that Hillel is living up to its mission of being inclusive to people of all ethnicities and religions,” said Hadar, who does not keep kosher.
Sara Kantor ’14, the president of Hillel, said that everyone involved in Hillel was “taken aback” by the restrictions placed upon the kosher dining hall.
Kantor, who is also a Crimson arts editor, said that the executive staff of Hillel had discussed the matter with HUDS this week to reach a compromise that could satisfy both parties.
“It is unfortunate that under any circumstances we would have to limit access to the dining hall,” Kantor said. “However, if [HUDS] is going to insist on having something, I like that they’ve phrased this new [sign] as more of a recommendation than a policy.”

In its first match of the season, the Harvard men’s squash team (1-0) defeated Boston College, 9-0, on Friday at the MIT Round Robin Tournament. Although the team did not play any of its top nine players against the No. 33 Eagles, the Crimson dropped only one of 28 games on the day.
The Crimson features two returning first-team All-Americans in juniors Brandon McLaughlin and Ali Farag, who is both the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year and singles national champion. But neither played on Friday against Boston College as the team elected to sit starters from last year’s team, using five sophomores and two freshmen in their stead.
“I was happy with how I played,” freshman Jake Matthews said. “I was nervous because it was my first time playing, but I think I played well. It’s incredibly exciting to play in the college game. It’s more competitive than the high school game but it’s also a lot more fun.”
Matthews, who played at the No. 5 position, defeated Boston College’s Max Ortwein, 11-3, 11-5, 11-6, as part of a Harvard lineup that won 21 games without losing more than five points.
In the closest match of the nine, sophomore James Watkins, playing at no. 3, won the first two games against Sam Henderson before dropping the third, 11-8, and rebounding to take the fourth, 11-4.
The match was the first of the regular season for the Crimson, which last week won the preseason Ivy League Scrimmages for the second straight year. In the tournament, the team defeated Yale in the finals with a 5-4 win, anchored by a clinching victory by sophomore Tyler Olson, who is also a Crimson editor.
The victory marked the second in a row for Harvard at Ivy Scrimmages. The Crimson finished third in the Collegiate Squash Association team championships last year, and was ranked third in the preseason by the CSA—behind last year’s national champion, Princeton, and runner-up, Trinity.
“We’re going to be in contention for the Ivy title, and therefore we’ll be in contention for the national title this year,” coach Mike Way said. “The team finished third last year and the goal has to be to do better than that this year. There are a couple of very strong teams out there this year, and we’ll see what happens.”
Harvard has not won the CSA national championship in fourteen years and will likely have to best preseason No. 1 Princeton if it is going to change that.
The Tigers snapped a thirty-year long title drought last year with a 5-4 victory in the title game against CSA preseason No. 2 Trinity, which had won the previous 13 national championships.
The Crimson returns five seniors this year and eight of nine players from last year’s squad that took third place.
“We are basically the same team as last year,” Way said. “If our team played the team of last year right now, I think that we’d beat them nine-zip. Even right now, the coaches think that there has been a shift for the better and that we have a much more resilient group. We’re going to be fitter this year but overall we’ve seen the improvements they’ve made to take our team to the next level.”
With a young team—none of the squad’s five seniors are among the top four—Way said confidence will be key against higher-ranked teams like the Bantams and Tigers.
“A key for this season will be the level of belief they have in their ability,” Way said. “They’re as good as the other guys out there across the board, and it’s important to go in there with that level of confidence. When they come in with that, young athletes learn how to step up and believe that they can win. They have a good game and they have good fitness, now the key will just be bringing it all together.”
Friday’s victory marked the 35th win in a row for Harvard in its season opener.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering Friday’s matchup with Columbia, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team had never lost a meet against the Lions since the two schools first faced off in 1985.
This time was no different. The Crimson topped the Lions 187-113, taking first place in 12 of the 16 events.
Not only did Harvard have a strong meet against Columbia, but two school records were broken.
Freshman Kendall Crawford set the record at 54.99 for the 100 backstroke, and classmate Danielle Lee became the first woman at Harvard to swim the 50 backstroke in fewer than 26 seconds, finishing in 25.92.
“We are speedy right now, especially considering our point in the season,” junior co-captain Sara Li said. “We have had tremendous success each day at practice, so we know we’re this good, but it’s awesome to actually see it happen in a meet setting.”
Harvard started the meet out strongly, beating out Columbia by .42 seconds in the 200 medley relay. The relay team of Crawford, senior Mackenzie Luick, sophomore Ana Anaya, and Li finished the race in 1:42.52.
“I think going into this meet, everyone was really pumped,” Crawford said. “Last year, Columbia gave us a good run for our money, and going into this meet everyone was really excited. When we came out on our first relay with a win, I think it just carried the momentum through the rest of the meet.”
The Crimson racked up three consecutive one-two finishes in the 1000 freestyle, the 200 freestyle, and the 100 backstroke. Freshmen Sherry Liu and Marlee Ehrlich dominated the 1000, and Lee and sophomore Courtney Otto touched the wall .39 seconds apart to take the 200 free. In addition to Crawford’s school record in the 100 backstroke, senior Caroline Weaver also posted a solid time of 56.59 to take second place points.
The Lions broke up Harvard’s streak with a first-place finish in the 100 breaststroke, but Luick, sophomore Stephanie Ferrell, and co-captain Clare Foster were right behind to take second, third and fourth, with times of 1:03.99, 1:05.27, and 1:05.85, respectively.
The Crimson went on another streak, taking first in the 200 butterfly, the 50 freestyle, and the 3-meter dive. Anaya led the butterfly, finishing in 2:00.57, just ahead of freshman Connie Hsu, who touched the wall at 2:02.08, to earn Harvard another one-two finish. Li stopped the clock in 23.21 in the 50 freestyle, a full 1.09 seconds before second place to put Harvard up another nine points.
“I’m really proud with how our team handled [the meet] mentally,” Li said. “We knew Columbia was going to be ready for us. Instead of succumbing to our nervous instincts, we just rocked it    from start to finish. I think confidence was a really big thing  going into it.”
Junior Alex Stanton and sophomore Amanda Largent claimed the one-two finish in the 3-meter dive for the Crimson, finishing the event with scores of 274.50 and 273.46, respectively, nearly 15 points better than the third-place finisher from Columbia.
Harvard took the top three spots in the 200 backstroke and the 200 breaststroke followed by a one-two finish in the 500 freestyle, earning the Crimson 45 points for the three events. Lee, Crawford, and Weaver finished within 2.5 seconds of one another in the 200 backstroke, stopping the clock in 1:59.35, 2:00.78, and 2:01.78, respectively.
“I think the 200 back was pretty good,” Crawford said. “There’s some great competition with three other girls on the team—there are so many fast backstrokers.”
Luick, Foster, and Ferrell topped the Lions in the 200 backstroke with a four-second gap between third and fourth place.
In the 500 freestyle, Liu and Margaret Ramsey led the Crimson to victory. Liu finished the event strongly with a time of 4:54.24, followed closely by Ramsey at 4:45.83. Although the Lions took first in the next three events, the 100 butterfly, the 1-meter dive, and the 200 IM, Harvard finished the meet as it had started it—with a win. The team of sophomore Sarah Sumner, junior Deirdre Clute, Lee, and Li finished a full four seconds ahead of the Lions in 3:26.41.
“The most important result of this meet was how well this team worked together,” Li said. “Everyone found support within each other and our teammates, who kept each other moving forward and kept the positive energy up the whole way. I think that goes to show the support we have for each other and the confidence that we have will continue more through the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like the Harvard football team’s season, the 129th Game didn’t turn out as predicted.
The Crimson entered Saturday’s contest as the heavy favorite. After all, this Yale team had somehow lost to Columbia, the punching bag of the Ivy League, the Greek economy of the Ancient Eight. And the Lions had been slaughtered by Harvard, 69-0, in the largest blowout since the league’s formation over a half century ago.
More than that, the Bulldogs boasted an abysmal 2-7 record and sat at or near the bottom of the Ivy League in most notable conference statistics. No surprise, then, that Harvard emerged as the 30-point favorite.
Yet The Game wasn’t a blowout at all. What was billed as a laugher soon turned into a brawl, a down-to-the-wire finish. What was supposed to be a quick knockout was a win by decision.
After one half of play, the teams were knotted at three. With 7:07 on the clock in the fourth, Yale held a 24-20 lead. Led by a quarterback listed as a wide receiver, the Bulldogs seemed poised to pull off the stunner.
And then, finally, Harvard clicked.
Rattling off 14 unanswered points in the timeliest of fashions, the Crimson pulled away to grab the 34-24 win in the year’s most important game.
And who led that charge? Two of the great senior workhorses of the Harvard offense: quarterback Colton Chapple and running back Treavor Scales.
But with 7:07 left to play, it looked like Chapple might have cost his team the game. Up by three and with the ball, Chapple made a rare mental lapse. As he was being sacked, Chapple decided to toss up the ball, which was intercepted by defensive tackle Nick Daffin well inside Harvard territory. That set up an easy Yale score, and suddenly the Bulldogs had regained the lead, 24-20.
And that’s when Chapple, the likely pick for Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year, made his move.
On the next play from scrimmage, Chapple bolted for a 61-yard run—the longest of his career—to help set up a Crimson score that gave the home team the lead, 27-24.
Yale punted, and on Harvard’s next series, Scales sealed the Bulldogs’ fate. Following the lead of last year’s captain Alex Gedeon ’12, who ended his Crimson career with a pick six at Yale, Scales finished his with a dramatic finale: in his last play from scrimmage, Scales dashed 63 yards for the score, sealing the Bulldogs’ fate and extending the Crimson’s dominance of the game.
Yet despite all that, despite the victory and the ending, Harvard was unable to grab a share of the league title, as Penn held on to beat Cornell, 35-28. And so, this will be a season remembered as one of unfulfilled promise.
The Crimson entered the year heavily favored and poised to achieve that sought-after, perfect 10-0 season. And in Weeks 1 through 5, Harvard was well on its way to doing just that, bulldozing opponents left and right. In Weeks 3 through 5, the combined score was Harvard 142, Opponents 47.
Then, the trajectory of the whole season changed in one quarter when Princeton mounted an astonishing fourth-quarter comeback to knock off the Crimson. Three weeks later, in the de facto Ivy League title game, down went the Crimson again, but this time, it was the Penn Quakers who delivered the knockout blow.
Yes, this team was, in certain ways, more talented than last year’s Ivy champion squad. Yes, Harvard set the modern-era Ivy League points record. And yes, it was second best in the conference in points per game allowed. Despite boasting the best offense by a whopping 12.8 points per game and the second-rated defense, Harvard still lost two of seven conference games and, in the process, the Ivy League title.
Following the loss to Penn, the Ivy title that seemed like such a lock just a few weeks ago was no longer in the Crimson’s control.
“We had a task at hand today,” Scales said after the game. “We were locked in on that. And we completed our task, and that’s all we were really concerned about.”
But despite the lack of hardware, Harvard coach Tim Murphy was satisfied with the performance on Saturday.
“I’m really proud of these kids,” Murphy said. “We’re one play away in the Princeton game about 10 different times…from being back-to-back Ivy champions. But you know what? I wouldn’t be any happier. I wouldn’t be any prouder of our kids.”

The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team cruised to another dominant victory against Columbia in its home opener on Friday night.
With former team members in the stands of Blodgett Pool for Alumni Weekend, the Crimson (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) swept 10 of 16 events, beating the Lions (2-1, 2-1), 192-108.
“We did a great job of cheering for each other,” said sophomore Chuck Katis, who won the 100 breaststroke in 55.25 seconds and the 400 IM in 3:58.34. “For the most part, everyone had faster times this weekend, and I think part of that is the excitement of being at home for the first time.”
In its first career meet at home, the freshman class impressed. Freshman Christian Carbone took home victories in the 200 breaststroke and 200 fly, and he also raced in the 400 IM to cap off the night with a second place finish.
Carbone was not the only freshman to complete a difficult triple. After taking second place in the mile, freshman Steven Kekacks beat out sophomore teammate Mike Gaudiani by three seconds to win the 500 free. He also swam the 400 IM.
“[Carbone’s and Kekacks’ triples] are two incredible feats of endurance, and they had great races,” Katis said.
The Crimson’s strongest performance came in the penultimate event of the night, when Katis, Carbone, and freshman Christian Yeager took the first three spots in the 400 IM, beating out Columbia’s fourth place finisher, Stephen Raynes, by 4.5 seconds.
The freshman class was ranked sixth in the nation coming into the season by CollegeSwimming.com and features five swimmers who competed in Olympic trials this summer.
For the second week in a row, sophomore Mike Mosca swept both diving events, beating out his competition in the 1- and 3-meter events by 32 and 25 points, respectively.
Harvard senior Michael Stanton came in second in the 3-meter and third in the 1-meter. The Lions’ best divers of the night were senior Jason Collazo and sophomore Micah Rembrant. Both turned in quality dives but suffered from inconsistency.
The Crimson began and ended the night with relay victories. In the first event, sophomores Katis and Griffin Schumacher combined with juniors Jack Pretto and Oliver Lee to take the 200 medley relay by three seconds.
The last event of the night brought a tighter finish, but Schumacher, Lee, and senior co-captain Greg Roop pulled off a come-from-behind win anchored by junior Chris Satterthwaite to solidify Havard’s victory.
“It was a great stepping-stone from last weekend,” Katis said. “It did a great job showing our progression.”
Satterthwaite shone individually as well, taking home a win in the 200 free when he edged Roop by .12 seconds. In the 100 free, he swam another close race and topped teammate Schumacher by .11 seconds.
“I think more people swam their best events today,” assistant coach Alex Meyer ’10  said. “It was a good chance for some people to get engaged early in the season.”
Harvard came out strong at the beginning of the meet, winning the first three events. The Lions’ best swims of the night were back-to-back victories in the ninth and tenth events. Junior Daniel Tan took the 100 free in 47.42, edging Crimson junior Will Brophy. In the 200 back, sophomore Kevin Quinn and freshman Ben Xu went one-two for the Lions.
In Columbia’s second one-two finish of the night, sophomore David Jakl edged Quinn by .16 in the 100-yard fly.
The Harvard team said that it built on momentum from last weekend in its third straight double-digit victory.
“We put in a lot of work, and a lot of that has shown up this week,” Katis said. “Despite all of the tough practices, we are still able to race pretty well, and that’s exciting.”
The Crimson saw success from a variety of swimmers throughout the night. Gaudiani came out strong in the mile, taking an early lead and not letting up in his seven-second victory. After demonstrating endurance, Harvard later showed its sprint when Schumacher won the 50 free in 20.61.
The closest race of the night was the 100 backstroke, in which Lions sophomore Omar Afara beat out Pretto by .03 seconds.
With the win, the Crimson is 63-5 in the all-time matchup against the Lions, and the team remains undefeated this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s crew capped off its fall season with a strong showing at the Foot of the Charles, with the Crimson heavyweights winning the regatta and the lightweights putting up consistent performances.
The regatta—hosted by crosstown rival Boston University—featured boats from MIT, Northeastern, Boston College, and Brown. The races took place on Saturday and were marked by sunny skies and light winds, as well as alumni who gathered for the weekend to support their alma mater.
“We’ve got a really good measuring stick for where we’re at,” said senior James O’Connor, who competed in the varsity four race. “After a solid winter training session, we are probably going to be in a pretty good place come springtime.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The heavyweights finished first in the varsity four and freshman eight races, notching their third and sixth straight victories, respectively.
“It’s a good culmination to the fall season because we have been putting in some hard work, and it’s good to see where we are at in this stage of the year,” O’Connor said.
The varsity four was a close race, but the Crimson finished on top with a time of 13:11.1. The next three boats finished within a second of one another, with Northeastern edging BU and Harvard’s B boat for second place.
“We learned that Northeastern, BU, Brown and the rest of out local opposition are very strong,” O’Connor said.
Despite a competitive showing from its crosstown rivals, the Crimson was the only team to finish with five boats in the top 20 after its other boats placed seventh, 13th, and 16th. Three other Harvard heavyweight fours came in 23rd, 34th, and 35th.
In the freshman eight race, Harvard came in first with a time of 12:18.3, beating out second-place Northeastern by four seconds.
The Crimson B boat came in fourth, 42 seconds off Brown’s time, but placed ahead of the Harvard lightweights by four seconds. The B boat also beat out BC’s top heavyweight team.
Sixteen boats participated in the freshman eight race, in which Harvard also took 10th and 15th place.
The team will return to competition in March for the dual season.
“We’ve got quite a while until our next proper race, so now we are going to just start putting in the hard yards,” O’Connor said.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Harvard lightweight crew raced in the varsity four and freshman eight races, with the top boats in each category finishing fifth and 11th, respectively.
The Crimson’s top varsity four boat beat out 29 other boats, including 10 heavyweight squads. The Crimson was neck-and-neck with Northeastern throughout the course, but the Huskies edged ahead towards the end of the race and came in .3 seconds ahead.
Harvard’s lightweight B boat came in 22 seconds behind and placed 14th overall, and a third varsity four boat finished 29th.
Four boats raced in the freshmen eight category, with the top lightweights placing fifth, coming in four seconds behind the Crimson’s heavyweight B boat. Harvard topped every other lightweight team in that category.
“It was probably our strongest race of the fall season,” said freshman Sam Frum, who rowed in Harvard’s freshman eight A boat. “It sets a nice trajectory heading into the spring, and we are going into winter training on a high note.”
With the help of freshman walk-ons, the Crimson also notched seventh, 11th, and 13th place finishes.
“[The Crimson novices] beat every other walk-on boat,” Frum said. “They are coming along quickly, and they weren’t that far behind the recruits.”
With the fall season over, the team will look to the championship regatta in the spring. According to Frum, the fall season provided valuable preparation and training for the rookies.
“We all got to campus rowing really differently, so the fall was a development for us,” Frum said. “The championship regatta in the spring is our goal, and the fall is preparation for that because the races aren’t that high pressure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a four-game winning streak into Sunday’s contest, the No. 6/5 Harvard women’s hockey team (4-1-0, 2-0-0 ECAC) hoped to keep its perfect season intact when it traveled to play crosstown rival Boston University (9-3-1, 4-2-1 WHEA).
Down two goals heading into the third frame, the Crimson was able to cut the deficit down to one with a deflected goal off of freshman Mary Parker. But Harvard was unable to net an equalizer and suffered its first loss of the season, 2-1, to the Terriers.
“We had a lot of time off [since our last game],” said co-captain and goaltender Laura Bellamy, whose team last competed on Nov. 3. “We were really excited to play BU. It was a great opportunity not only to play a really great team, but [it’s] kind of a battle of Boston here. We’re not happy with the loss, obviously, but we’re just going to try to bounce back.”
The Crimson went down a player early, when a checking infraction sent sophomore defender Sarah Edney off the ice less than four minutes into the first period. Towards the end of the power play, BU senior defender Kathryn Miller got a shot off, but Bellamy blocked the puck as it flew towards the upper-right-hand corner of the net. Miller’s shot was the only one Harvard allowed in the power play.
But the Terriers were able to capitalize later on in the period. Despite being down a man due to a hooking penalty, BU found the back of the net with less than a minute to go in the first frame. Junior forward Marie-Philip Poulin cut off a Crimson pass and dropped the puck back onto the stick of senior forward Jenelle Kohanchuk, who fired a shot to the back of the net. The short-handed goal was the first shot that Bellamy let through the pipes all season, leaving the Terriers with a 1-0 lead.
“That was a tough one to give up, right at the end there,” co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey said. “We went back into the locker room [knowing] the effort was there, some of our execution wasn’t. After the first period, we were ready to bounce back.”
In the second period, a checking penalty put Harvard down a player 4:38 into the frame. Kohanchuk got a good look at the goal but could not convert for BU. The puck drifted in front of the net, but Bellamy was quick to get it out of the way and prevent another score.
The Crimson spent the rest of the power play on the opposite side of the ice, using strong offensive pressure to help kill the Terriers’ advantage. Dempsey and Parker both got shots off, but Terrier goaltender Kerrin Sperry blocked BU attempts.
Harvard was unable to convert on any of its scoring opportunities in the period. The team found itself down 2-0 halfway through the second period, following a goal from junior forward Louise Warren.
But the Crimson came out firing in the third period, finally registering a goal less than three minutes into the period. Dempsey’s shot bounced off the right leg of Sperry, and the puck ricocheted off Parker and across the red line.
The officials reviewed the play to see whether or not the puck had been kicked, but eventually ruled that the goal stood, and Harvard was only one goal down with 17:42 to go.
“We had a bit of a slow start [to the game],” Dempsey said. “We really didn’t start playing the game we play, Harvard hockey, until a bit into the third. At the end, all that energy, all those chances towards the net were more like [normal]. It’s just a shame we ran out of time. “
The Crimson did not register another goal, despite increasing its offensive pressure.
Harvard registered 10 shots on the goal over the course of the third period, compared to just two in the first frame.
“Coming away from today, we feel like we can do a better job putting in 60 minutes,” Bellamy said. “We feel like we had a good finish, but in the middle there we didn’t play as well.”
For the first time all season, the Crimson walked away from a game without a win, albeit against a formidable opponent. Boston University’s victory marked the third time the Terriers had defeated a top-five opponent this season.
“These are the kinds of games we want to challenge and test ourselves,” Dempsey said. “If you don’t go against the best, you’ll never know what you can be.”

The Harvard women’s squash team has a lot to live up to this season. The Crimson is coming off both an Ivy and national championship and is ranked No. 1 in the CSA preseason polls. But Harvard did not disappoint in its season opener, winning 9-0 against Boston College on Friday at the MIT Round Robin Tournament.
The Crimson is now 38-0 all time in season openers and extended its winning streak—dating back to a win over Stanford on Nov. 18, 2011—to 18 games. Harvard swept each of its nine matches against the Eagles, 3-0.
“The match we played against BC was a good way for all of us to work through some of the aspects of our games that we have been focusing on in practice,” senior Eliza Calihan wrote in an email. “It is helpful to get match experience in before the season starts, especially for the freshmen. It was also exciting for us to play against BC, as they are and up-and-coming team. ”
The Eagles are coming off a season ranked as the No. 1 club team in the country and are beginning to compete with more established varsity programs in the Northeast. But as a club team, BC had its hands full against Harvard, which is considered one of the best women’s squash programs in the country.
The Crimson rested many of its top players over the weekend, and as a result, many of the freshmen on the team were able to make their collegiate debuts. Saumya Karki—playing at No. 1 position for Harvard—played Boston College’s Lilly Havens, winning, 11-5, 11-5, 11-7.
Isabelle Dowling debuted at No. 3 spot, besting the Eagles’ Madeline Bette, 11-5, 11-7, 11-6.
Karki will most likely play somewhere in the middle of the Crimson ladder this year when the regular season starts, while Dowling is currently fighting for a spot in the varsity nine. Both players garnered valuable match experience against BC, which Harvard players say will prove useful in more important matches later in the season.
“We played really well, everyone came out strong, [and] almost all of our freshmen got to play which was really exciting,” junior Natasha Anzik said. “I think that this weekend, along with the Ivy scrimmages last weekend really tested us and got us fired up for the rest of the season. We’ve been training since day one back at school, so everyone’s really excited to keep going. “
Freshman Alexandra Sperry, playing at the No. 9 spot, defeated Kristy Barnes, 11-2, 11-0, 11-2, in one of the more lopsided matches of the day. Sperry joined the team as a walk-on only a few short weeks ago but is already contributing to the team’s efforts, beating her opponent while only dropping four points.
“The freshmen have been playing really, really well,” Anzik said. “This is more of a setting where you can really get the nerves out with no pressure, and they all came out playing amazing and at their best.”
Sophomore Megan Murray—playing at No. 2 position—defeated Cassandre Burke, 11-7, 11-9, 11-7, in the closest match of the day. Calihan, playing No. 4, defeated BC’s Mary Hanraha, 11-6, 11-5, 11-1.
Anzik bested BC’s Caroline Kulig in three sets, 11-5, 11-3, 11-5. No. 6 Yuleissy Ramirez defeated the Eagles’ Allie Goguen, 11-7, 11-6, 11-4.
Georgiana Brinkley, playing at the No. 7 spot, defeated the Eagles’ Abigail Regan, 11-2, 11-2, 11-6, and Julie Monrad—playing at No. 8—defeated her opponent, 11-2, 11-3, 11-2. Neither player allowed her respective opponent to score more than 10 points over the course of three sets.
“As a team, we are excited for another season, and we hope to defend our national title,” Calihan wrote. “That said, we are definitely not taking anything for granted and are working even harder to improve our games. Our coaches emphasize that, if we work hard every day and focus on our individual and team performance goals, the results will take care of themselves.”

The No. 23 Harvard wrestling team traveled to Philadelphia, Penn., to compete Sunday in the Keystone Classic, a tournament that featured 14 of the InterMats top-20 wrestlers in the country.
Harvard finished in 11th place in a field of 15 schools, amassing 46.5 points on the day. Northwestern took home the team title with 156 points.
“It’s so early in the season,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “I’m disappointed [in] how we wrestled, but I also know it also gives us stuff to work on in practice to come back and really figure out where we are as a team.”
Crimson standouts at the tournament included junior Cameron Croy and co-captain Steven Keith, who placed second and third in their respective weight classes.
Harvard competed against EIWA rivals such as American, Brown, Penn, and Princeton. The Crimson also faced opponents from schools across the nation, including N.C. State, Cal Poly, Duke, Virginia Military Institute, and No. 13 Northwestern.
Despite dropping his semifinal matchup to Penn’s Charles Cobb, 4-0, Keith had a strong finish, clinching third place in his weight class.
“[Keith] wrestled a tough bout in the semifinals against [Cobb],” Weiss said. “It was a good battle. He lost that one, but he came back strong and placed third.”
The senior co-captain, seeded No. 1 in the 141-pound weight class, beat out wrestlers from Princeton, Northwestern, and BU to advance to the semifinals.
“As far as my season is going, I’m off to a pretty good start,” Keith said. “There’s definitely some stuff that I need to work on and improve, but it’s still early on in the season.”
Croy snagged a second-place finish in his weight class after defeating Cal Poly’s Sean Dougherty and then falling to Penn’s Canaan Bethea.
Ranked No. 4 in the tournament seedings, Croy had the strongest finish on the Harvard team.
“[Croy] wrestled a very good tournament and lost in a tough overtime bout,” Weiss said. “He just lost a heartbreaker, and I feel sometimes you have to go through those pains to get stronger, so I think that will help him down the road.”
Coming off of a strong second-place finish in his first collegiate tournament last weekend, freshman Jeffrey Ott had another good showing, securing a sixth-place finish in his weight class of 125 pounds. Seeded No. 2 in the tournament, Ott had a first round bye and went on to advance to the semifinals.
In his first match of the Keystone Classic, Ott knocked out Princeton’s Max Rogers, whom the Harvard freshman also defeated in the Binghamton Open.
Ott went on to snag one more victory against Brown’s Vincent Moita.
“[Ott] is definitely going to have a huge impact on the team,” Keith said. “He’s a great wrestler, [but] he’s got some stuff to work on. He has performed really well at tournaments thus far…. He will be a good force.”
The freshman entered the semifinal match against Northwestern’s Dominic Malone, who was seeded No. 6 in the 125-pound weight class. Ott fell to Malone, and failed to enter into the championship match.
“[Ott] wrestled well,” Weiss said. “I feel he’s just making a couple mistakes—basic freshmen mistakes—and the more he wrestles the better he’s going to get.”
The Crimson has now competed in two tournaments. In both, Harvard has struggled with injuries.
“We have a lot of our better guys at home a little banged up, so I can’t really be too frustrated,” Weiss said. “We’ve got some work to do, but we have a little break coming up which is good because we need it.”
The Crimson’s next tournament appearance will be in Las Vegas for the Cliff Keen Collegiate Wrestling Invitation on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.
“We’ll be off for Thanksgiving and be back on Saturday, so this little break will actually help us,” Weiss said. “We did a lot of our work this past week, so hopefully we’ll be fresh going into the next tournament. This will be a big tournament for us in Las Vegas because there are a lot of nationally ranked teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nearly 30 years of missing the NCAA championships, the Harvard women’s cross country team raced with the fastest in the nation on Saturday in Louisville, Ky., to finish its competitive season.
Although the Crimson finished last in a field of 31 teams, Harvard coach Jason Saretsky pointed to the experience his runners gained at the competition.
“I think the weekend was a great experience for our team, with the women making nationals for the first time in 29 years,” Saretsky said. “It’s a historic event. They got a great experience, and so many of them are back next year, so I think there’s a real result to learn from today’s race and be back here next year to improve and get an even better result.”
The men’s team also sent juniors Maksim Korolev and James Leakos to the NCAAs after the pair turned in stellar performances at regionals to qualify for the championships. Leakos struggled during the race and did not finish, while Korolev had a strong start that he could not maintain, leading to disappointing results for both.
“[Korolev] battled through and went for it,” Saretsky said. “He was right with the front pack for about 5k or so, and then it just got pretty tough from there.”
The rest of the men’s team traveled to New York to face off against 13 other teams in the IC4A/ECAC Championships in its final meet of the season. Despite a fifth-place finish, captain Sean Pohorence saw the race as an opportunity to prepare for the spring track season.
“[The IC4A] is definitely not the most important meet on our schedule by any means, but it’s a really nice opportunity to have another race if you’re not running at nationals, and end your season on a strong note,” Pohorence said. “We were pretty disappointed with the result in the end, overall, but you just have to look forward, look towards training for indoor track.”
NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS
After receiving an at-large bid following a fourth-place finish at the Northeast Regionals, the Harvard women’s cross country team qualified for the NCAA Championships for the first time since 1983.
“For our women’s team to [make it to NCAAs] after such a long, long drought, it’s a really important step for us as a program,” Saretsky said. “To see these young ladies competing at the national level gives inspiration for our entire team, and hopefully that will really propel us to be competing at the highest level that we can.”
The Crimson tallied 676 points at the meet from its seven runners, placing the squad at the bottom of the pack—a disappointing result even in the talented field.
“We were really set on not just being there and enjoying being there but also doing well and showing that we deserved being there,” sophomore Viviana Hanley said. “I feel like, as a team, we don’t feel like we adequately did that.”
The team took freshmen Jen Guidera and Paige Kouba to the meet.
“It’s important just having the experience of being here and having a taste of competing at the national level,” Hanley said. ”I think it’s good that we had some freshmen here with us, and I think that experience will definitely help us compete at that level and carry it with us throughout track and upcoming years. We’re definitely looking to be back [at nationals next year].”
Hanley led the way for the Harvard runners, pacing the 6k course in 20:53.7, good enough to take 118th out of 253 competitors. Junior Morgan Kelly came in just behind Hanley, placing 146th with her time of 21:04.5.
Oregon had a decisive victory in the meet following second and third-place individual finishes in the race, tallying only 114 points.
On the men’s side, Korolev, the sole Crimson runner to complete the 10k race, finished his race in 31:43.8. The junior kept up with the lead group for the first half of the race, but fell off the pace as fatigue set in, leading to a disappointing finish of 201st of 245 runners.
IC4A/ECAC CHAMPIONSHIPS
Three top-25 finishes in the five-mile race propelled the Harvard men’s cross-country team to a fifth-place finish at the IC4A/ECAC Championships.
“It was a good day with solid showings,” Pohorence said. “No one ran fantastic, but even if you’re not feeling great, to just get it done is really important.”
Junior Kurt Ruegg posted the best showing of the Crimson runners, taking 18th in the field of 124 with a time of 25:44.7, while freshman Tom Purnell continued his impressive rookie season by finishing the race in 25:46.1 to place 20th.
“It was a tougher course that we’re used to running on—much more hill—and it was definitely a tougher race because of that, but [Purnell] still ended up doing pretty well,” Pohorence said.
Led by Bobby Peavey, who crossed the finish line three seconds before any other runner, Georgetown took first.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard football team got the ball for the first time in the fourth quarter of The Game, it trailed Yale, 17-13. Five plays later, the Crimson was back on top thanks to a 32-yard pass from senior quarterback Colton Chapple to junior Andrew Berg.
While Chapple will get credit for that pass, his 61-yard scamper, and a four-yard touchdown pass that all came in the fourth quarter, senior Treavor Scales played as large of  a role in the come-from-behind victory, even before his game-clinching 63-yard touchdown run.
For instance, Scales had runs of 15, five, and five yards before Chapple’s bomb to Berg. Besides moving the ball from the Harvard 43 to the Bulldogs’ 32, those plays forced the Yale defense to respect the run on the ensuing snap. So when Chapple faked a handoff, the Bulldog secondary froze just long enough for Berg to get by his man and find an opening in the end a zone.
Later, when the Crimson had a lead and a desire to burn the clock with three minutes to play, Scales was there again. After a holding penalty set up a first-and-20, it seemed as if Harvard was going to have trouble gaining a first down on the ground.
But Scales and the Crimson O-line made it look easy with gains of 12 and nine yards on the next two plays. A fumble on first down forced them to repeat the feat, this time starting with second and 16.
At that point, Scales made sure the team wouldn’t have to worry about being set back again, finding a hole in the offensive line and breaking the run to the outside before out-sprinting the Yale team for a 63-yard score.
“I’ve never seen Treavor run that fast,” Chapple said. “I guarantee you that. He was moving down the sideline. At that moment I knew all our hard work had come to fruition.”
The score put Harvard up, 34-24, effectively clinching the Crimson’s sixth straight win over the Bulldogs and its first come-from-behind win since week one of the season. In total, Harvard faced four fourth-quarter deficits this year, with each result reflecting Scales’ performance.
In wins over San Diego and Yale, he rushed for 117 and 125 yards, respectively, carrying the rock eight times in both cases. In losses to Princeton and Penn, Scales gained just 28 yards on seven carries and 15 yards on five runs, respectively.
When Scales was able to set the stage for comebacks and later burn the clock on the ground, the Crimson came out victorious. When he couldn’t, they didn’t.
That was the story of Saturday’s game. It was the story of the 2012 season.
WHAT THE YALE?
Coming into Saturday’s contest, Yale ranked near the bottom of the Ancient Eight in total offense and defense. But that hardly showed at Harvard Stadium. On defense, the Bulldogs limited the highest-scoring Harvard team in school history to just three first-half points.
“[Yale] did a good job,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “I thought those guys did a great job coaching; they gave us all we could handle. They were very creative, very tough.”
In the game, Chapple tied a season high with two turnovers while Yale surrendered the ball just once.
“If you could have told me we would have won this game being on the minus side of the turnover margin…I would have said that would have been tough to do,” Murphy said.
Eventually the Crimson offense broke out in the second half, but when it did, the Bulldogs hung with it. The two teams traded score for score, as quarterback Hank Furman threw for 135 yards and a touchdown in the second half. Yale also ran the ball for 77 yards in the final two periods on the second-stingiest rush defense in the FCS after accumulating 43 yards in the first half.
“[Yale] running back [Tyler Varga] is a great player, we will see him for a couple more years,” freshman linebacker Jacob Lindsey said. “And then the play action fakes—they threw the ball down the field a few times, and that’s what got us.”
ALL YOU NEED IS YALE
Penn wrapped up sole possession of the Ivy title with a 35-28 victory over Cornell while Harvard was sealing its victory, but that didn’t spoil the Crimson’s postgame mood.
“We are going to enjoy this,” Murphy said. “This game really validates what I think of our football players and our senior class."
At the outset of the season, the Crimson was predicted to win a second-straight Ivy title. Halfway through the year, the team appeared well on its way with five double-digit victories under its belt. But it slipped twice down the stretch, going 3-2 over the back half of the season. But a sixth-straight win over Yale to end the careers of team leaders Chapple, Scales, and others was enough to redeem the year.
“As soon as you commit to Harvard, you know at the end of the day it’s about beating your rival,” Scales said. “If it so happens that it works out that we are Ivy champions, then that’s a beautiful thing—it’s wonderful—but what we can control, we will control, and that’s how we went out—with that mindset.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Running back Treavor Scale’s impressive showing in The Game may have earned him The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week honors this week, but a medley of other athletes turned in excellent performances as well, earning them acknowledgment on the runners-up list.
Laurent Rivard, Men's Basketball
Junior wing Laurent Rivard had his best game of the young season Friday against Manhattan, leading the men's basketball team in scoring with 17 points. Rivard made five three-pointers on the day and is shooting nearly 45 percent on the season from behind the arc. Rivard connected on 5 of 10 three-pointers and added three steals, three rebounds, and one assist.
Victoria Lippert, Women's Basketball
Senior Victoria Lippert led the Harvard women’s basketball team to a 71-65 victory over BYU on Friday, registering a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds, both season highs. It was only the third double-double of Lippert’s career. The senior was named Ivy League Player of the Week and ranks fifth in the conference in both scoring and rebounding.
Kendall Crawford, Women's Swimming
In just her first year on the Crimson swimming and diving team, freshman Kendall Crawford has already begun to set school records. For the second time in as many weeks, Crawford set the record in the 100-meter backstroke, besting the time she set at Cornell last weekend by posting a time of 54.99 against Columbia. The Greenville, S.C. native helped Harvard capture 12-of-16 events against the Lions and win their 10th straight Ivy League contest.
Colton Chapple, Football
In his final game wearing crimson, Chapple was instrumental in leading the football team to a 34-24 victory over Yale. With the Crimson leading, 6-3, in the third quarter, Chapple scampered past two Yale defenders and sprinted 18 yards into the end zone to give Harvard a 10-point lead.
Chapple’s four-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Brate in the fourth quarter gave the Crimson a 27-24 lead it never relinquished. The senior threw for 209 yards for the day and ran for 128 more on 18 carries, finishing the season with over 3,000 total yards of offense and 33 touchdowns.

It may feel rather lonesome staying on campus while your roommates go home and revel in hedonistic feasting, but there's a silver lining to every isolated, stranded cloud. If you'd like to be reminded why a break from your family could be advantageous, we at Flyby think you should give these films a shot on Thursday night.
The Shining
The worst part about family trips is not the possibility that you'll all have to sleep in the same room. The worst part is that the fire-axe is within one of your kin’s reach, and that family member was alive when "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" was popular. The worst part is also that you all probably drove each other to insanity. Bet your empty dorm room feels pretty good now.
There Will Be Blood
More like There Will Be Really Disturbing Daddy Issues, am I right? Daniel Day-Lewis' very convincing performance as a self-made, money-hungry oil magnate is a reminder that you might have never been the most important thing in your parents' lives. I've abandoned my boy! I've abandoned my boy!
 
We Need To Talk About Kevin
It may be unlikely that you have a teenage son waiting for you at home, but if you do, do not under any circumstances hint at your deeply-rooted resentment towards him. "We Need To Talk About Kevin" suggests that doing so may help mold your spawn into a murderous (but stunningly handsome) psychopath.
American Beauty
There's nothing quite like the suburban household and all the repressed feelings that come with it, but you get to forego those dinners with plates coated in silent resentment and blame. You also don't have to worry about one of your parents being attracted to the friend you bring home. 
 
Breaking Dawn Pt. 1
Really, this is the dysfunctional family at its most absurd and beautiful. Unless all the children in your family are adopted, your brother literally tore open his wife's uterus with his teeth, the resulting baby is destined to be with an overly muscled family friend (who made out with said baby's mother on multiple occasions!), and everyone around you keeps talking about the smell of blood, you have no right to complain about family issues. Still, it's a reminder that family get-togethers can result in blood and guts and Robert Pattinson flashing his weird nipples at you.

Flying home for Turkey Day? Don't want to schlep bags through South Station or splurge on a cab? This year, thanks to an initiative funded by the Undergraduate Council, students have one more option for getting to the airport.
The UC has planned regularly scheduled charter buses between Harvard and Boston Logan Airport. Shuttles run on Tuesday, Nov. 20 every other hour between 4:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Coach buses will leave from in front of Lowell House and all tickets cost $6.   They can be bought online here.
Still, we at Flyby are a bit confused. Unless the UC is encouraging students to skip class, shouldn't it also be offering buses on Wednesday?

Thanksgiving dinner isn't always the easiest meal.
Even if Cousin Cindy forgets to bring her mothball collection and Uncle Earl remembers not to talk about Barack Obama's birth certificate, there will be awkward moments. String beans will burn, glasses will break, and insults will fly.
When the dinner table talk needs to be revitalized, use this Harvard-themed cheat sheet to get the conversation flowing without having to resort to Aunt Betsy's toilet humor.
The Harvard-Yale Game
The Lowdown: On Saturday, Harvard beat Yale 34-24 in the 129th annual game of the historic college rivalry.
What to say to...
Your ESPN-obsessed uncle: After an intense back and forth, running back Treavor S. Scales '13 rushed 63 yards to score with just over a minute to go, solidifying the Crimson's victory.
Your fashion-conscious cousin: A pair of Harvard students running a game-day apparel company created a small controversy when they marketed and sold a tank top featuring Nicki Minaj with the words "Yale You a Stupid Hoe."
Your Yale-alum father: Harvard has won 11 of the past 12 games. Don't get your hopes up anytime soon.
Election 2012
The Lowdown: Massachusetts voters helped reelect Obama, a Harvard Law School graduate, and punched Law School professor Elizabeth Warren a ticket to the U.S. Senate.
What to say to...
Your Republican grandpa: If Obama appoints U.S. senator John Kerry of Massachusetts as the new Secretary of State, defeated incumbent Scott Brown could take Kerry's vacant Senate seat by winning a special election.
Your Bob Marley-obsessed brother: Massachusetts voters also passed a referendum to legalize medical marijuana. Guess who's planning on getting unexplainable "muscle pain" in February?
Your conspiracy-theory-loving aunt: The New York Times and the Huffington Post both show that Plymouth County, Massachusetts, still only has 99 percent of its votes reported. Where is that final one percent of votes? Is this another Florida, circa 2000?
The Cheating Scandal
The Lowdown: Last spring's Government 1310: "Introduction to Congress" class is at the center of an academic dishonesty investigation involving about 125 students, who could be forced to temporarily withdraw from school if they're found guilty.
What to say to…
Your cynical cousin: It's awfully ironic that a cheating scandal occurred in a class on Congress.
Your NCAA-obsessed uncle: Sports Illustrated reported that highly touted men's basketball captain Kyle D. Casey '13 withdrew from the College in September because he was involved in the scandal.
Your mother: I didn't cheat. I swear. I don't even take government classes. I'm studying Folklore and Mythology.
Celebrity Sightings
The Lowdown: Harvard draws some pretty cool visitors.
What to say to…
Your math-nerd uncle: Just weeks before he correctly predicted the outcomes of all 50 states in the presidential election, statistician Nate Silver took a break to chat politics and baseball with Harvard students at Kirkland House.
Your struggling actor nephew: Harvard students got to see Tommy Lee Jones '69 relaxing at a Harvard-Yale tailgate, according to reports on Twitter.
Your sister's Argentinian boyfriend: Harvard students questioned Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner about her wealth and her relationship with the press when she spoke at the Institute of Politics in September.

As the Crimson and the Bulldogs faced off on the football field on Saturday, other Harvardians and Yalies were battling in the boardroom.
After two days of intensive interviews, six students from Harvard and seven from Yale were named among this year's Rhodes Scholars on Saturday afternoon. Together, the 13 scholarship winners from Harvard and Yale made up over one-third of the 32 winners chosen nationwide.
The six scholarship recipients from Harvard—Aidan C. de Burgh Daly '13, Julian B. Gewirtz '13, Allan J. Hsiao '13, Benjamin B. Wilcox '13, Nina M. Yancy '13, and Phillip Z. Yao '13—will study at Oxford next year with full funding.
And although Yale edged us 7-6 in Rhodes Scholars, we dominated them 34-24 in The Game, so Saturday was a net win for Harvard (40-31, if you're keeping count).
Sorry, Yale. Better luck next time.

We all knew that Harvard was going to win on Saturday. We also knew that would happen last year, and the year before that, and the year before that. In fact, Yale's football team is so objectively bad that we at Flyby aren't quite sure why we have a game at all if the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Still, without competition on the field, Harvard-Yale weekend is nothing but revelry and schadenfreude, and where's the fun in that? Anticipating yet another (inevitable) Crimson victory is the best part of the tradition, so let's not cancel next year's game just yet.
But before we get too carried away, let us take a moment to sympathize with our battered Bulldog friends, who must at this very moment be licking their collective wounds. Let us help them begin to memorialize what generations of Yalies will surely see as a sacred and solemn day for years to come. Let us remember that once upon a time, it was Nov. 18, 2006, a day that would go down in history as The Last Day Yale Won The Game.
At that time, so very long ago, gas cost an average of $2.23 per gallon and Jay-Z's "Show Me What You Got" was debuting at the top of the charts.
Back then, Harvard cost just $43,655 per year (compare that to this year's $54,496 price tag), and students were gearing up for a twelve-day winter break and a January reading period.
The first model of the Nintendo Wii was just hitting the North American market, and Britney Spears had just publicly dumped Kevin Federline from her MySpace buddies list.
Barack Obama was the junior senator from Illinois, and Sarah Palin had not yet been sworn in as governor of Alaska.
And on that day, so many years ago, it was okay that Harvard had a Bad Day because it could use the year's most popular song to get over its loss.
Perhaps the Bulldogs should consider finding their own conciliatory song that better stands the test of time. Yale's going to need it.

Dean Hammond's emails haven't exactly gotten brighter since the last one updating us all on Harvard's alcohol policy. Her most recent email, sent to the entire student body, announced that there have been several confirmed cases of Pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, among Harvard undergraduate students.
According to the email, "Pertussis usually begins with cold-like symptoms like nasal congestion, sneezing, and dry cough. The cough becomes increasingly severe over one or two weeks, and can last for four to six weeks." The email also reminded students to take basic preventative measures, like hand washing and "dispos[ing] of used tissues and similar items appropriately."
For many anxious students, these old adages just don't cut it.
"I definitely think that the HUHS should send out more advice," said Emily T. M. Trang '16. "I'm sick and I don't know if I have whooping cough."
Other students reported feeling completely ignorant on the disease, having only previously encountered in the context of 19th century tenement houses.
"I thought it had been eradicated to be honest," said Ethan I. Simon '16. "I thought it was like polio."
While Pertussis can be fatal for young children, for college students the remedy is rather simple. After a round of antibiotics, you should be good as new—that is, in four to six weeks.
