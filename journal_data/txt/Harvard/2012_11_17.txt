After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robert S. Samuels '14 will lead the newly elected 140th Guard of The Harvard Crimson, the paper's President announced on Friday.
Samuels, an Applied Mathemathics concentrator from Pasadena, Calif., and a Leverett House resident, currently serves as Sports Chair and covers Harvard football. He will assume the President's post in the beginning of January.
The paper's outgoing editors elected their successors early Friday morning. The President of the 139th Guard and Robert's older brother, E. Benjamin Samuels '13, announced the results to The Crimson's staff soon after.
"The 140th Guard is a fantastic group, and I'm tremendously excited by what they bring to the table," said Ben Samuels, who recused himself from deliberating in The Crimson's presidential election. "I'm confident they will lead The Crimson to new heights."
Robert's election marks the first time that two siblings have been elected President of The Crimson since before World War II.
The Crimson's next Managing Editor will be Rebecca D. Robbins '14, a Crimson news writer who led The Crimson's reporting in the Government 1310 cheating scandal. Andrew F. Creamer '14, a current Crimson Advertising Manager, will head the organization's finances and operations as The Crimson's next Business Manager.
The Crimson, founded in 1873, is the only daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., and the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper.
The Crimson chooses its leaders through an election process known as the Turkey Shoot, in which all outgoing executives are invited to participate. A successful candidate must receive at least 75 percent of the vote.
Joining Samuels, Robbins, and Creamer on the masthead are:
Associate Managing Editors: Hana N. Rouse '14 and Justin C. Worland '14
Associate Business Manager: Frances M. Pak '14
Arts Chairs: Petey E. Menz '15 and Austin Siegemund-Broka '14
Design Chairs: Shane R. Bouchard '14 and Nicole M. Iacopetti '14
Editorial Chairs: Marina N. Bolotnikova '14 and Michael F. Cotter '14

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 20, 2012, at 12:23 a.m.
Tara Raghuveer ’14 and running mate Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 won this year’s Undergraduate Council presidential election with a decisive majority.
Raghuveer and Zhu received 1,587 first-place votes, 533 more than second-place finisher Michael C. George ’14 and his running mate Nicole E. Granath ’15. Akshay M. Sharma '14 and Akanksha Sharma ’14 placed third, ahead of Spenser R. Goodman ’14 and running mate Darren C. McLeod ’14.
“I feel amazing. I’m so honored to have the support of my amazing staff and friends,” Raghuveer said after learning of her victory at her election results party just after midnight on Saturday morning. “I’m so excited for the next year.”
Undergraduates cast more than 3,600 ballots in the three days of the election, significantly surpassing last year’s 2,730 votes.
In addition to clicking in their choice for the presidential ticket, students also voted on three student-initiated referenda—all of which passed by large margins. The referendum proposals—which advocated divestment of University funds from the fossil fuel industry, the establishment of a social choice endowment fund, and reconsideration of the College's sexual assault policies—earned 72 percent, 80.5 percent, and 85 percent of the vote, respectively.
Though George, who is also a Crimson news editor, secured a number of coveted endorsements—including those of the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, and The Crimson—Raghuveer and Zhu capitalized on social media and online campaigning with the help of a staff numbering more than 150.
“My staff was absolutely incredible—some of the most talented people I’ve worked with at Harvard,” Raghuveer said after wrapping up her campaign on Friday afternoon. “It was awesome to see everyone rally behind a common goal. The competition with the other candidates was civil, and it was fun to have some good competition.”
Raghuveer began outlining her vision for the UC and recruiting her team over the summer. Throughout her campaign, she emphasized the importance of increasing the UC’s “relevance.” Her proposals for reform include establishing an online portal for UC grants, collecting student opinion through electronic surveys, and creating a public forum where all members of the Harvard community can gather to discuss University-wide issues.
After the results came in, Zhu promised that she and Raghuveer would strive to deliver on their campaign goals.
“I can’t ever express how grateful I am to the student body for believing in us,” Zhu said. “From academics to representation, we will not let them down.”
Students who spent weeks collecting signatures so their causes could appear on the ballot as referenda also celebrated the results of the election.
Alli J. Welton ’15, a board member of Harvard’s chapter of Students for a Just and Stable Future, the group that sponsored the fossil fuel referendum, acclaimed its wide margin of victory.
“I think that 72 percent in a year of extremely high voter turnout is an overwhelming vote of student support for fossil fuel divestment at Harvard,” she said. “Hopefully the referendum results will prompt President Faust to finally agree to meet with us.”
According to Welton, Harvard is the first school in the nation to pass a student referendum calling for divestment from publicly traded fossil fuel corporations.
With more than 50 percent of the student body casting ballots in the election, all three referenda easily met the threshold of support necessary to become the UC’s official positions. The UC is bound to throw its support behind student-initiated referenda that gain a majority of the votes whenever at least 25 percent of students participate in the election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clutch shooting was the key for the Harvard women’s basketball team in Friday’s matchup between the Crimson and Brigham Young University, as Harvard relied on two late shots to earn the victory, 71-65.
With one minute remaining and the score tied, 63-63, Crimson senior forward Victoria Lippert brought the ball up the court, stepped to the arc, and sank a three-pointer to catapult the Crimson (2-1, 0-0 Ivy) past the the Cougars (2-2, 1-0 WCC).
“That’s what [Lippert’s] done all four years,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “It never surprised me. I just love that she does that, year in, year out, game in, game out.”
Two free throws from Cougar guard Lexi Eaton brought BYU within one, but co-captain Emma Golen forced a turnover from guard Ashley Garfield and then netted a three-pointer with 22 seconds remaining to seal the win for Harvard at Lavietes Pavilion.
Golen has now sunk nine of her 10 three-point attempts this season, and it was her precision from behind the arc that prompted Delaney-Smith to call the game-clinching play for the senior.
“[Golen’s three-point] stats are off the charts,” Delaney-Smith said. “We run a play for her—we run a play for Vic too, but Vic is ice, everyone knows Vic is a go-to. No one knows Emma is a go-to, so that’s why we called the play for Emma.”
Coming into the second half trailing by five, the Crimson reclaimed the lead with a 7-0 run. BYU took back the edge, but Harvard’s focus on transition defense and ability to force turnovers prevented the Cougars from jumping out to a large lead.
“I just felt like we had such a drive to win that game,” Lippert said. “Just the effort down [the stretch] and just executing at the end got us the win.”
The Crimson displayed its bevy of offensive weapons as three different players—sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, Lippert, and Clark—recorded double figures in the game. Clark scored the team high with 18 points on 50 percent shooting, while Lippert recorded her first double-double of the season with 15 points and 10 rebounds.
“We have so many offensive weapons, and I think that’s such a great thing about our team,” Lippert said. “We have a lot of really great scorers who can score in different ways.”
On defense, Harvard held the visitors to under 50 percent shooting and record with nine steals, six coming in the second half.
“Defense was key in winning this game,” Delaney-Smith said.
The Cougars kept the contest close throughout, and the six points that Harvard won by was the largest spread of the game for either team. The lead changed a total of eleven times on the night.
BYU jumped out to an early 8-4 lead following two treys from guard Kim Beeston, but the Crimson quickly fought back, tying the game at eight off a pair of Clark’s free throws. Beeston led the Cougars’ offense, shooting 5-of-7 from behind the arc to net 19 points.
Early in the game, Harvard struggled rebounding and stopping BYU in transition, which Delaney-Smith deemed as uncharacteristic compared to the team’s previous practices and games.
“It was inexplicable to me,” Delaney-Smith said. “That first half couldn’t have been uglier, couldn’t have been more different from what we had done all week in practice.”
The story of the Crimson’s first half on offense was missed opportunities as it went one-of-five on three-point shots. An 11-4 run fueled by back-to-back jumpers from Eaton gave the Cougars a 34-29 lead going into the half,  their largest lead of the game.
“If we have a weakness, it’s that we’re not patient,” Delaney-Smith said. “We want to score quickly. We do have a lot of scorers, but we can get better shots if we balance out some patience.”
Ten different players scored for the Crimson, and Harvard’s depth is something that Delaney-Smith touts as one of the team’s best qualities.
“There’s not a big difference in the top nine, 10, 11 players, so someone’s got to get the starting call and not everyone gets in as much as they’d like to,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s got to happen when you’re as deep as we are, and that’s going to make us a championship team, if we can understand that the team comes first.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Game wasn’t the only big win for a Harvard sports team in a major rivalry game this weekend.
The No. 17 men’s hockey team knocked off No. 10 Cornell, 4-1, in its first road contest of the season on Friday night in Ithaca, N.Y.
Just as he did in the ECAC semifinals in Atlantic City eight months ago, junior goaltender Raphael Girard shut down the Big Red attack, making 34 saves.
At the other end of the ice, all four of Harvard’s lines scored against Cornell’s Andy Iles, who had entered the contest with a .927 save percentage.
In a one-minute span in the opening period, the teams combined for three goals, and Harvard (4-3-0, 3-3-0 ECAC) entered the first intermission with a 2-1 lead. Freshman Kyle Criscuolo tallied his third score of the season with 2:17 left in the second period to put the Crimson up two, and sophomore Peter Placek later added an empty netter to help hand the Big Red (3-3-2, 1-3-2) its first home loss of the year.
“I think we definitely found a way to win through our defense, even though we scored four goals,” sophomore forward Mike Seward said. “We just kept everyone away from our net, and that helped a lot in preventing grade-A scoring opportunities for Cornell.”
At the other end of the ice, Harvard was able to maintain an early offensive attack amidst a loud sellout crowd at Lynah Rink. Senior forward Alex Fallstrom got the Crimson on the board at the 14:32 mark of the opening period when he put a back-door shot past Iles for the game’s first score to put Harvard up, 1-0. McNally earned the assist after intercepting a Cornell attempt to clear before feeding Fallstrom.
Cornell responded 26 seconds later, as John Knisley fired a shot past Girard to tie things up.
But just 32 seconds after Knisley’s goal, the Crimson answered right back, as Seward scored for the second time in his career to give Harvard back the lead. The sophomore took a behind-the-net pass from classmate Tommy O’Regan and fired a shot past Iles.
“The puck wrapped around the boards, and I got into the zone,” Seward said. “[O’Regan] gave me a great pass into the slot right above the net, and I just shot it through a screen and went low-blocker side. I give a lot of credit to my linemates for getting the puck to me.”
Cornell had a number of chances to tie things up in the second period, totaling 12 shots on goal to Harvard’s five, but Girard denied every attempt.
“We didn’t [allow] that many scoring chances from in tight,” Girard said. “I didn’t feel [too] threatened. The fact that the crowd is always chirping at the goalie over there kind of gives you a little boost.”
Meanwhile, 17:43 into the middle period, Criscuolo capitalized on a Big Red turnover in its own end. A clearing attempt from Cornell was intercepted by freshman Jimmy Vesey, who attacked the net and found Criscuolo. The freshman then knocked a one-timer past Iles to put Harvard up, 3-1.
The Big Red had two power-play opportunities to get back in the game within the first 10 minutes of the third, but Girard denied each one and again made 12 saves during the period to keep Cornell off the board.
“It was obviously a tough place to focus for a goalie with everything going on there,” Seward said. “There’s fish guts everywhere on the ice, Swedish Fish on the ice, they dump newspapers everywhere—it’s just a wild atmosphere. They’re constantly yelling things at Raph [Girard], chanting, trying to get him off his game, but he did a good job blocking shots and keeping us in the game when we needed him.”
With 14 seconds to go, Placek added the exclamation point with an empty-netter, giving Harvard a 4-1 victory on a night it was outshot 35-17 by the Big Red.
“That was definitely a big win,” Girard said. “We played as a team.... We all played with the same identity and pulled in the same direction. That’s why we won the game.”

From start to finish, there was no stopping the Harvard men’s basketball team.
Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson posted its largest win over a Division I opponent in the Tommy Amaker era, crushing Manhattan, 79-45. Five players scored in double figures for Harvard, which bounced back after blowing a five-point lead in the final 1:12 against UMass Tuesday.
“We knew we didn’t finish right [against the Minutemen], so we turned the page,” junior co-captain Laurent Rivard said. “We were ready to bounce back [and] play as a team. Everybody contributed today.... It was really a great win, a great team effort.”
The Crimson began the game on an 11-2 run that was capped by back-to-back threes by Rivard, both of which were assisted by freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. The junior finished with a game-high 17 points, while Chambers continued his solid play to open the season, collecting 14 points, seven assists, and three steals in 35 minutes despite facing a tight Jaspers press.
“I’m impressed, but I’m not surprised,” Amaker said of Chambers. “That’s why we recruited the heck out of him.... He brings a presence to the floor, commands the team, and I love that he understands [the game] at a very high level.”
Harvard went on a 7-0 run later in the half to extend its lead to 23-7. Chambers had a steal leading to two free throws, sophomore Wesley Saunders found co-captain Christian Webster for a short jumper from the left elbow, Rivard hit another three off a pass from sophomore Jonah Travis from the low block, and Chambers capped things off by collecting another steal and throwing in a layup at the other end.
After two Manhattan baskets, Rivard knocked down a three from the right corner, which led to a 12-0 Crimson run.
“When [Rivard is] open, it’s the responsibility of our players to find him and put the ball in his hands,” Amaker said.
Freshman Agunwa Okolie capped the stretch with a short floater off a pass from Chambers to put the Crimson up, 35-11, with just over two minutes to go in the half. The rookie point guard later knocked down a three from the left wing to give Harvard a 39-15 lead going into the break.
“They played a zone, and we have a good zone offense,” Rivard said. “[Chambers has] given our team such a great boost in breaking the press, finding guys, and knocking down shots when he’s open.”
The Crimson started the second half on an 18-5 run to extend its lead to 57-20. Sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi opened the half with a layup, and then Rivard hit a wide-open three, Chambers found Saunders in transition for a dunk, Webster had a driving layup, and Okolie capped the run with a two-handed slam off a pass from Rivard.
“I was really, really pleased with [Okolie’s] minutes off the bench,” Amaker said. “He was being aggressive, finishing at the rim, finishing on the break.”
Meanwhile, Manhattan—which was playing without its best player, guard George Beamon—was sloppy at the other end and faced a stringent Harvard defense. The Jaspers collected their 21st turnover before they got their 21st point.
The Harvard lead got as large as 39, at 63-24, on a Chambers three with 9:32 to go. Later in the half, sophomore Kenyatta Smith threw an outlet pass to Okolie, who put down a two-handed jam, and Okolie returned the favor next time down by finding Smith for a slam to give the Crimson a 67-30 lead. On the next Crimson possession, Smith found Saunders for another easy Harvard dunk.
Amaker was able to empty his bench in the final minutes of the game, and freshmen Mike Hall and Evan Cummins scored their first career baskets, as the Crimson cruised to the easy win.
Webster finished with 12 points, while Okolie had 11, and Saunders added 10.
“It’s fun [that] everybody was really part of [the win],” Rivard said. “That doesn’t happen very often.”
Harvard’s margin of victory over the Jaspers was six points larger than No. 2 Louisville’s, who beat Manhattan, 79-51, on Sunday.
“We’re pleased to be able to turn around and have a 40-minute performance,” Amaker said. “We used the words ‘regroup’ and ‘respond,’ and I thought we had a great team performance defensively. It’s nice to see our kids dig in and give that type of effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final game of their collegiate careers, Colton Chapple and Treavor Scales went out with a bang.
Chapple threw for two touchdowns and ran for one more—while rushing for 128 yards—and Scales collected 177 yards of his own on the ground to help lead Harvard to a 34-24 comeback win over Yale in the 129th edition of The Game. The victory was the Crimson’s 11th in 12 years against the Bulldogs and its sixth in a row—the longest winning streak for Harvard in the history of the matchup.
"Just a great college football game," Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. "We had nothing left. We gave it everything we had, and I'm just so proud of my kids."
The rivals went back and forth in a dramatic fourth quarter. But on third and 13 with 1:08 to go, and Harvard (8-2, 5-2 Ivy) needing a first down to clinch the win, Scales got the first and much more, breaking loose down the right sideline for a 63-yard score that emphatically capped his collegiate career and sent the Harvard portion of a soldout crowd of 31,123 at Harvard Stadium into sheer pandemonium.
"The only phrase that crossed my mind was, 'Momma, I made it,'" Scales said. "I can't express enough how much of a blessing this opportunity was. I feel so honored to be able to call myself a Harvard football player."
The touchdown came just three minutes after Harvard retook the lead at 27-24. Five plays after starting the drive with a 61-yard scamper on a designed quarterback draw,  Chapple connected with junior Cam Brate on a four-yard touchdown that the tight end caught at the apex of his leap over a Yale defender in the back of the end zone.
"Before we broke the huddle, Cam said, 'if I'm cutting, get me a high ball,'" Chapple said. "You can't draw it up any better than that. He made an unbelievable play."
Yale (2-8, 1-6) went three-and-out on its ensuing drive, and after the Scales score, junior Reynaldo Kirton intercepted Yale quarterback Hank Furman to seal the win.
"The emotion is really second to none," Scales said. "It doesn't really hit you. I don't think it's hit me yet."
The first meeting between Murphy and Tony Reno—the former Harvard assistant who left to take the Yale head coaching job in January—was dead even at three through the first half, as the Bulldogs defense successfully contained a high-powered Crimson offense that came in averaging 40.0 points per game.
In the opening two quarters, Harvard was also plagued by a number of mistakes that allowed Yale to keep the contest tied.
On its second drive of the game, the Crimson went for it on fourth and nine, and Chapple hit classmate Kyle Juszczyk for a 32-yard touchdown pass. But the score was negated on an offensive pass interference call, and Harvard was forced to punt.
On the next Crimson drive, Chapple was stripped by Yale’s Davis Frank, and Will McHale recovered for the Bulldogs at the Harvard 34. On Yale's ensuing series, the Crimson sacked Bulldogs quarterback Derek Russell on third and two, but freshman linebacker Jacob Lindsey was called for a deadball personal foul, giving the visitors 15 yards and a first down at the Harvard 12. Yale’s Philippe Panico hit a 29-yard field goal later in the possession to put the Bulldogs on the board first.
Harvard answered on its next drive and got down to the Yale five, but Chapple overthrew junior wide receiver Ricky Zorn in the left corner of the end zone on third and goal. The Crimson was forced to settle for a 23-yard field goal from junior David Mothander that tied the game at three just over two minutes into the second quarter.
Both teams struggled to move the ball for the remainder of the half and went into the break tied.
"[Yale] came out and didn't play the defense they had all year," Murphy said. "[It was] very different than what we had seen on film, so it took us a while to adjust."
Harvard did adjust in the second half, as Mothander kicked a 37-yard field goal to cap a 12-play drive and give the Crimson the lead 6:07 into the third quarter. On the next Crimson possession, Chapple put Harvard up, 13-3, by scampering for an 18-yard touchdown down the right sideline.
Yale responded with a Tyler Varga three-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 46-yard completion from Furman to Cameron Sandquist, who badly beat junior safety Chris Splinter deep over the middle. The Bulldogs took the lead 1:30 into the final quarter, when Grant Wallace caught a third-down 12-yard touchdown pass from Furman in heavy traffic.
But the Crimson answered right back. A seven-yard completion to Brate, three Scales runs totaling 25 yards, and a 32-yard touchdown pass in the right corner of the end zone to junior wideout Andrew Berg put Harvard up, 20-17.
"[It] was one of the best catches I've seen all year," Chapple said. "It got us really going offensively. I felt like we were kind of stuck in the mud a little bit [until then], but having that touchdown pass and getting the crowd back into the game, I felt like it was a really big momentum shifter in our favor."
On Harvard’s ensuing possession, Chapple tried to throw a screen under heavy pressure but was intercepted by Yale lineman Nick Daffin. On third-and-goal from the two, Varga scored for the second time to put Yale back up, 24-20, with 7:07 remaining.
But the Crimson scored 14 unanswered to deny Yale its upset bid, and the Harvard student section stormed the field in excitement at the end of the contest.
"We had to make really big plays to win this game," Murphy said. "It was just a great heavyweight fight, and we landed the last punch."
The Crimson's 34 points gave it 394 on the season, breaking the modern-era Ivy League record.
Harvard entered the day with the chance to earn a share of the Ivy championship. Though Penn beat Cornell, 35-28, in Ithaca to win the title outright, that outcome did nothing to quell the Crimson's excitement at ending the season with a victory.
"The emotion out there—it's just a bunch of brothers, it's one big family that has come together after 364 days of work," Scales said. "[That win was] a culmination of all the blood, sweat, and—I'm not afraid to say it—the tears that have gone into being a Harvard football player. That's what comes out on the field. It's almost indescribable."

Massachusetts may still be hung over from the exhausting U.S. Senate race that concluded last week, but pundits have already shifted attention to the next election, and in the Bay State, it could be sooner than you think.
With Secretary of State Hillary Clinton set to retire early next year, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry has emerged as one of President Barack Obama's top picks to become the nation's next top diplomat. If Kerry is named Secretary of State, or alternatively Secretary of Defense, Massachusetts will have to hold a special election to fill his seat.
That special election could come as early as next summer, and would be the second such election in three years in Massachusetts. U.S. Senator Scott Brown won the first special election in January 2010 to fill the seat of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56. And though Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren defeated the Republican Senator last week, he would enter a second special election contest the clear frontrunner and likely victor.
With millions in leftover cash, high favorability ratings, and widespread bi-partisan support across the state, Brown would be hard to beat. Possible Democratic opponents include Attorney general Martha M. Coakley, who lost to Brown in 2010, Congressman Edward J. Markey, Congressman Michael E. Capuano, former Congressman and UMass Lowell President Martin T. Meehan and Governor Deval L. Patrick '78.
Given Brown's advantage and apparent readiness for a race, Democratic leaders including the president have been increasingly wary of Kerry's appointment, which could mean the loss of a Democratic seat in the Senate.
Rumors have also suggested Patrick, who is a close friend of Obama's and played a large role in the president's re-election campaign, may be in the running for attorney general. Patrick has said he would not leave his current post, even if offered the job in Washington. What he would do in the case of a special election is less certain.
