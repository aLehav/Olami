After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When customers start to come into Video Hut, Jeremy Heldt’s place of occupation, Jeremy does not know what to expect. Small-town Nevada, Iowa in the 1970s or ‘80s is mundane. So when customers come in with complaints that there is something on the VHS tapes that interrupts the movies, he does not think much of it. But, when Jeremy watches the movies “Targets” and “She’s All That,” he realizes he may have stumbled upon something sinister. The movies cut at some point to homemade video recordings of hooded figures, a barn, and unclear actions. As Jeremy and Stephanie, a customer at Video Hut, work together to uncover the truth behind the videos, we learn it may be much more complicated than initially thought. “Universal Harvester” brilliantly weaves a path through time and characters. Author John Darnielle successfully creates suspense through his use of syntax and multiple narrators, revealing little until the very end.
The setting of the novel moves through time by splitting the story into four parts. Darnielle offers clues about the time periods through technology. The first part takes place in the mid-seventies or early eighties, which is communicated through the VHS tapes that are circulated at Video Hut (and later confirmed by Abby, a character in the fourth part, as she watches the tapes from the future). The second part takes place even further into the past, when Barbies and color TV were expensive novelties. The third part returns to the ‘70s or ‘80s. The final part takes place roughly in the present, the age of cellphones, laptops, and the Internet, when a missing person could be found more easily today than they could in the ‘70s or ‘80s.
“Universal Harvester” is written primarily in the third person, allowing the narration to follow many characters throughout the novel. Jeremy serves as the protagonist for most of the story, yet there are parts from the perspectives of his father, Video Hut’s owner Sarah Jane, and a customer named Stephanie. Throughout almost the entire second part, the new protagonist Irene Sample reveals her story without explaining outright her reasons for leaving her family. Irene’s husband Peter’s thoughts also trickle into the storyline. The multiple perspectives, none of which are fully illuminating, allow Darnielle to keep up the suspense until the very end. The story moves in and out of the characters’ arcs to allow for a mystery in motive and knowledge. Sarah Jane does not make obvious what she does and does not know.
The varied syntax adds to the creepiness of the storyline: “The one thing you can never plan for, Mom used to say. Unexpected guests.” Many examples of disjointed ideas or sentences emphasize words or hints that seem ominous or curious. This further allows Darnielle to successfully keep the main points of the novel discreet. Another example of this—“It was the outbuilding. The door was open. When the camera jumped, Jeremy saw, clearly, because he was looking for it, the worktable”—displays the exact timing of when Jeremy notices a certain aspect of the video. The description scene, therefore, creates a tension that the character himself is feeling.
Furthermore, by emphasizing the role technology plays in “Universal Harvester,” Darnielle makes a broader criticism about globalization: The world has gotten so much smaller and more connected through technology. “In most lives, in most places, people go missing. This isn’t true as it was in a less connected age; people see more of their high school classmates on Facebook every day than they previously would have in their entire lives after graduation. Lonely husbands or wives form secondary accounts to keep track of lost lives and secret prospects; short of catastrophe, these points of contact never wholly erode.”
Although the book is suspenseful and eerie, to call it a horror novel would be misleading. The mystery behind the videos offers a thriller aura without the initial idea of what a horror novel should be—scary scenes, murders, and masked figures. But someone does go missing. Though Darnielle does not horrify in an expected way, he does leave you questioning the reality he presents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: February 26, 2017 at 3:57 p.m.
You couldn’t have written it better for the Harvard men’s basketball team’s four seniors. Playing in their last game at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson’s four seniors wrote themselves a storybook ending against Brown on Saturday night, beating the Bears, 77-58.
It started with co-captain Corbin Miller. Off a pump fake the senior drained a long two to put the Crimson on the board. On the ensuing possession co-captain Siyani Chambers found classmate Zena Edosomwan for the emphatic dunk. Just over three minutes later, Chambers found senior Matt Fraschilla—making his second career start—in the corner for the three.
Starting its four seniors for the first time this season, Harvard (18-7, 10-2 Ivy League) jumped out to an 11-2 lead just over four minutes into Saturday’s game.
“That’s the way, if you want to write up a script you want it to flow like that,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was really excited to see that happen but I thought they did it within the flow. It wasn’t like they were looking to do it, and when it happens like that, that’s why it usually will happen.”
Chambers was the last of the four seniors to get on the scoreboard. The manner in which he did, however, was nothing short of spectacular. It began with a jumper from the elbow with just over six minutes left on the clock in the first half. Before three minutes had elapsed, though, the senior had scored 10 points on 4-of-4 shooting and assisted on the only other bucket scored over that span.

He would go on to finish the game with a season-high 19 points and five assists.
For the Crimson, the early lead from its upperclassmen would only be the beginning of what became a runaway win against the visiting Brown Bears (12-16, 3-9).
Led by Edosomwan, Chambers, and freshman Seth Towns, Harvard jumped out to a 48-30 lead in the first half—tied for its highest first-half point total of the season. The trio combined for 29 of the Crimson’s 48 first period points. Edosomwan scored all of his eight in the frame and did so on a perfect 4-of-4 shooting from the field while adding seven rebounds.
Edosomwan wasn’t the only one who shot the ball well as Harvard shot 65.5 percent through the first frame—it’s best shooting performance this season before heading to the locker room. Through the period, the Crimson also shot 67 percent from deep while assisting on 14 plays.
“We want to play that way all the time no matter what defense or who we’re playing,” Amaker said. “We had 18 assists last night and we had 14 at the half tonight....We shared it, we found the open guy.”
While the first half was headlined by Harvard’s seniors, the game as a whole was perhaps one of the Crimson’s best all-around efforts of the season. In total, 13 Harvard players saw the floor with 10 finding their way onto the scoreboard. No Crimson player scored more than 20, but six scored six or more.

Though the Harvard offense slowed in the second half, the Crimson’s defense grounded Brown’s to a halt. In the second half the Brown Bears were held to 28 points on 9-of-27 shooting from the field and 0-of-11 from deep. Coming into the game, Brown’s was averaging 75 points per game—the best mark overall on the season within the conference.
“Were very deep on the bench, when we sub guys in we don’t drop, we don’t lose anything,” Chambers said. “That really allows us to keep our pace up on offense and defense and it gives us that advantage to, in our opinion, wear teams down on the defensive end. We grind and then we can sub in five or six new guys.”
Edosomwan finished the game with eight points and 11 rebounds while Towns added 16 and eight boards.
“It was a great team win,” Chambers said. “We did what we wanted to do. What I would say is it was very enjoyable to be able to be out there with those guys. We’ve been here a long time, we’ve seen a lot of things, done a lot of things, and to be able to spend that time on the floor together it was great. But that wouldn’t have meant anything to us if we didn’t do what we were supposed to do so I think it means a lot more to us that we were able to play how we played no matter of who was on the floor and that we were able to come out with a victory against a tough team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 26, 2017, at 2:05 a.m.
“They tied!”
The announcement emerged from somewhere in the stands. The seniors of the Harvard men’s hockey team were occupied, posing for the cameras alongside their families as part of the Crimson’s Senior Night festivities. Meanwhile, Harvard’s younger skaters remained fixated on a feed that lagged too far behind to render a valid out-of-town result.
“They tied at 3-3!”
This spectator now had the Crimson’s attention. Eyeing its first ECAC regular-season championship in 23 seasons, No. 3 Harvard had entered Saturday seeking a favor from its oldest rival. Playing host to No. 7 Union, the No. 9 Cornell Big Red needed to take at least a point from the conference frontrunners at Lynah Rink to give the Crimson a chance at a crown. And for once, the Cornell icemen proved willing to lend Harvard a helping hand.
Trailing 3-2 with just 5:01 remaining in regulation, Cornell’s Mitch Vanderlaan netted the kind of equalizer that would make Gabas Maldunas proud—one that forced overtime, produced a tie, and in accordance with a Maldunas mission, saved the day for the Crimson.
“We kind of saw the guys come exploding back onto the ice after they had gotten off,” said co-captain Devin Tringale about the non-seniors who were about to head to the locker room. “It was special with all of our families around the ice out there when we heard the news, so that was pretty cool. It made for a special Senior Night.”
Of course, Harvard also needed to win a hockey game of its own Saturday evening. But that proved to be the simplest part of the equation. Using its speed to counter the physicality of visiting St. Lawrence (16-11-7, 12-6-4 ECAC), the Crimson (22-5-2, 16-4-2) dominated the first half of its regular season finale, opening up a lofty 5-0 lead in its eventual 6-3 victory at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. With the win—Harvard’s 10th in a row—the Crimson finishes the regular season unbeaten at home for the first time since 1994 when it last topped the ECAC.
With both requirements—a Harvard win and a Union tie—being satisfied, the Crimson now stands atop the ECAC once more. Having earned 34 points in conference play, Harvard will share the Cleary Cup with Union; but by virtue of a tiebreaker, the Crimson will receive the top seed in the ECAC tournament, which begins next weekend.
“It’s something our guys really had a focus on,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 about the regular-season title. “Oddly enough, I think that the group [at preseason] meetings actually put 34 points on the board and said that’s what it’s going to take to win the league. They hit the nail right on the head.”
According to Tringale, the team arrived at its 34-point benchmark after examining exactly how many points previous league champions have needed over the last 15 to 20 seasons. Once the determination was made, “34 points” was written in plain sight within the Harvard locker room, where it’s remained for the length of the current campaign.
As Donato suggested, the Crimson would need every last one of those points to win a piece of its third major trophy this season. But Harvard left no doubt about its ability to acquire points 33 and 34. The Crimson asserted its dominance right from the start on Saturday, outshooting the No. 20 Saints, 18-4, in the opening frame and opening up a 3-0 lead in a matter of three minutes and change.
Harvard first put the scorekeepers to work at 8:21, when senior Phil Zielonka sent a feed from behind the net to Kyle Hayton’s right post, where freshman Nathan Krusko knocked in his ninth goal of the season. Soon afterwards, Alexander Kerfoot and Jake Horton lit the lamp just 19 seconds apart to blow the contest open.
Sophomore Ryan Donato set up the Kerfoot goal, delivering a pass towards freshman defenseman Adam Fox—again by Hayton’s right post. But before the feed reached the rookie, the puck shot off the stick of St. Lawrence freshman Carson Gicewicz over to the opposite pipe. There, Kerfoot tapped in the Crimson’s second goal of the game, becoming the lone Harvard fourth-year to score on Senior Night. Moments later, Horton unleashed a wrister from just outside the slot that knuckled past the glove of Hayton at 11:35 to make it 3-0.
“I thought we came out firing out of the gate,” Ted Donato said. “We were skating, we put a lot of pressure on them, and all four lines were playing a fast game. We got out to the start we were looking for.”
Typically a stud between the pipes, Hayton didn’t last much longer. After Ryan Donato backhanded a loose puck into the cage from the power play just 2:01 into the second period, the junior received the hook from St. Lawrence coach Mark Morris. Despite entering the game with the sixth-best save percentage in the country, Hayton stopped only 16 of the 20 shots on goal he received from the nation’s leading scoring offense.
With sophomore replacement Arthur Brey in net, Ryan Donato struck again for a team-leading 18th time of the season. Twelve minutes following his first goal, the sophomore faked a slapshot from the top of the right circle, moved towards the slot and ripped a wrister past the new netminder. 5-0.
The Saints did match their underwhelming 12-shot output across the opening two periods with a dozen more in the third. In turn, St. Lawrence produced just enough goals to make things interesting in the final minutes after the attention of most Harvard spectators had shifted towards Ithaca, New York.
Junior top-liners Joe Sullivan and Mike Marnell scored the first two goals of the final frame, from the power play and the penalty kill, respectively, getting the Saints back within three with 5:11 to go.
Then just as Cornell came up with its all-important equalizer at Lynah, St. Lawrence gave the Crimson a brief scare when a crashing Gicewicz punched a third puck past Madsen with 3:28 remaining—more than enough time for the Saints to score two more.
But with 2:37 to go, the officials caught St. Lawrence with too many men on the ice, leaving the visitors unable to create enough man-down offense to continue their comeback. Sophomore Lewis Zerter-Gossage iced the game with an empty-netter from the right faceoff circle with nine ticks left on the clock.
Now Harvard will take a week off before kicking off the postseason at the Bright on March 10. As the number one seed, the Crimson will host the lowest seeded team remaining in a best-of-three series with a trip to the ECAC semifinals in Lake Placid on the line.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball seniors ended their careers at Lavietes Pavilion in style Saturday night as the Crimson (18-7, 10-2 Ivy League) earned its most dominant conference win against Brown (12-16, 3-9), 77-58.
Harvard honored its senior class in a pre-game ceremony as this was the team’s final regular season game at Lavietes Pavilion. The four veterans—co-captains Siyani Chambers and Corbin Miller, along with forward Zena Edosomwan and guard Matt Fraschilla—took the floor at tip-off and gave Harvard a lead it would never relinquish.
While Harvard coach Tommy Amaker inserted all four into the starting lineup—whereas typically Chambers is the only senior who starts—the group made significant contributions in the early minutes, setting the tone for the beat down that ensued. Before substituting the class of 2017 for the typical core rotation, the starting five got the home team off to an 11-2 start, with three of the four seniors recording a bucket.
“I was really excited to see that happen, but I thought they did it within the flow,” Amaker said. “[L]ike Siyani didn’t look to try and get any shots he was just playing the right way, finding the open guy, setting other guys up. All of them just took the shots that were there.”
Many of the shots that were there belonged to Edosomwan, as his teammates found him for easy buckets in the paint. After Miller hit an opening jumper to put the Crimson up 2-0, Edosomwan tripled Harvard’s total with a pair of dunks assisted by Chambers and Fraschilla. Edosomwan finished the night just shy of a double-double, notching eight points and 11 rebounds.

While Chambers was the last of the four to get a bucket, he would leave Lavietes the loudest. The co-captain finished with a season-high and game-high 19 points off of seven-for-nine shooting from the floor. Late in the first half, Chambers put the offense on his back as he scored 10 of the team’s 12 points over a three-minute spurt. The one bucket he didn’t score—an Edosomwan dunk—he assisted.
“I just thought that he was due for this kind of offensive game,” Amaker said. “He was just dialed in...He played the right way. I thought his spirit was great. I just thought that he approached it the right way and did a tremendous job all night for us.”
Chambers had the best statistical night of the bunch, but Fraschilla elicited the loudest cheer from the crowd and his team’s bench as he hit a corner three in front of the Brown bench early in the first half. The senior had not played any meaningful minutes in Ivy play during his career, with his junior season cut short by an ACL injury.

Fraschilla has plans to remain on the bench of a basketball team in the future, but as a coach rather than a player. During the pre-game ceremony, he was described as “an extension of the coaching staff”. With his experience, he was able to jump right into the offense seeing just six total minutes of play this season before Saturday night.
“[It helped] having four seniors out there that have been in the system for four years, five years for Siyani, six years for Corbin, that know what coach wants as far as the offensive end goes, know what kind of shots were looking for,” Fraschilla said. “I think that’s what you saw out there, lots of good ball movement, no rushed shots, guys were looking for each other and I think that’s why we got off to a good start.”

To call this group veterans would be somewhat of an understatement as only Edosomwan and Fraschilla joined the team initially as members of the class of 2017. Chambers was originally a member of the class of 2016, but was forced to withdraw from the university last season after suffering an ACL injury during a summer workout. Miller enrolled with the class of 2015, but took two years off from basketball to complete an LDS mission in Mexico.
Though their families littered the stands and the student section cheered loudest at their successes, the four seniors wouldn’t dwell long on the nostalgia and emotions of playing their final game at Lavietes Pavilion as the team still has at least three more games to play (next weekend at Penn and Princeton, followed by the Ivy Tournament).
“It was a great team win,” Chambers said. “We’ve been here a long time, we’ve seen a lot of things, done a lot of things, and to be able to spend that time on the floor together it was great. But that wouldn’t have meant anything to us if we didn’t do what we were supposed to do so I think it means a lot more to us that we were able to play how we played no matter who was on the floor and that we were able to come out with a victory against a tough team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Make it 10. With a decisive 6-3 victory over visiting St. Lawrence on Saturday night, the No. 3 Harvard men’s hockey team ends its regular season schedule on a 10-game win streak and a 12-game unbeaten stretch.
The Crimson (22-5-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) will enter the ECAC tournament as the top seed, and the team has earned a first-round bye for its efforts during the regular season. After rattling off three unanswered goals in the final frame Saturday, the No. 20 Saints (16-11-7, 12-6-4) made things a bit more interesting, but it was a story of too little too late for the St. Lawrence team, which will also enjoy a bye week as the four-seed.
“[St. Lawrence] plays with a lot of pride,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They’ve got a lot of guys who are warriors…. There’s a lot of competition built up with that team.”
MORE HARVARD HARDWARE
The Harvard icemen, already owners of a 2017 Beanpot championship and an Ivy League title, may need a new shelf on their trophy case after this regular season. With a win to conclude its schedule—and a bit of help from Ivy League rival Cornell—the Crimson nabbed a share of its first Cleary Cup, given to the regular-season ECAC champion. Harvard last topped the ECAC in 1994, but the trophy had not been named after Bill Cleary ’56 until 2001.
“For this group, it’s been a long, long time—much like the Beanpot—since we were able to get the regular season title,” Donato noted, “and finish the regular season without a loss at home. I think that was important to this group.”
While the Crimson was mounting a blowout at the Saints’ expense on Saturday night, a game just as important was taking place in Ithaca, New York. Harvard found itself in an unusual position: cheering for the Big Red as Cornell faced off against Union in a match with ECAC implications.
The Crimson entered its season finale trailing the Dutchmen by one conference point. While it took care of business on its own end Saturday night, Harvard needed a Union loss or tie to move into first.
Cornell, often an obstacle in the Crimson’s quest for conference dominance, did Harvard a favor by tying Union, 3-3, and clinching half of the Cleary Cup for its Cambridge-dwelling adversaries. While the Crimson will share the Cleary with the Dutchmen, it owns the ECAC tournament’s top seed on account of a tiebreaker over Union: Harvard finished 5-1-0 against teams in the ECAC’s top four, whereas the Dutchmen were 1-3-2.
The Crimson has now won the ECAC regular season a conference-best 14 times, with 10 of these successful campaigns occurring in a span of 13 seasons in the ’80s and early ’90s. This season marks Donato’s first Cleary Cup as a coach, but he won two as a skater for Harvard in 1988 and 1989.
“I think [the Cleary Cup] is significant…in relation to the accomplishment of our seniors,” Donato said. “This group of seniors now will be able to say they won a Beanpot, they won a regular season title, they won a tournament title…they’ve been in the NCAA tournament—it’ll be three times.”
SENIOR SEND-OFF
Saturday night’s win was followed by a ceremony honoring the eight seniors on the 2016-2017 team.
The Class of 2017 has helped Harvard to 72 victories so far in its four-year stint in the crimson and white, the most for a senior class since 2008’s seniors amassed 73. In the past two decades, the class of 2006 is responsible for the most program victories with 82.
“Tonight, with everybody’s friends and family in the house, in front of a great crowd, I thought our seniors once again had us emotionally charged and focused for the start of the game,” Donato said.
While Saturday night may have been dedicated to the Crimson seniors, it was a rookie who started the scoring for Harvard. This year’s Beanpot MVP, Nathan Krusko, made no mistake of burying senior Phil Zielonka’s feed from behind the net and registered his ninth tally of the season.
Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot made his presence felt shortly after the Krusko strike, notching a goal of his own just three minutes later, becoming the only member of his class to bulge the twine on Senior Night.
This season, the Crimson’s soon-to-be graduates outpaced all Division I senior classes in combined point scoring with 157. Luke Esposito, Sean Malone, Tyler Moy, and Kerfoot account for 84 percent of this total. Along with co-captain Devin Tringale and Clay Anderson, the only blue-liner from the Class of 2017 to start a game this season, Harvard’s seniors have registered 14 game-winning goals this year.
Kerfoot, who leads the Crimson with 37 points, appeared on the score sheet in 22 of Harvard’s 29 regular season games this year. A 12-game point streak from Nov. 4 to Jan. 7 accented his consistent scoring season. The New Jersey Devils property owns Harvard’s longest individual scoring stretch this season, having surpassed fellow senior Moy’s eight-gamer that started the season.
Perhaps Harvard’s most productive trio this season, the all-senior second line of Esposito, Malone, and Moy has combined for 95 points to date, good for a team-best among all of Donato’s pairings.
“The senior line with Esposito, Moy, and Malone was a threat all night,” Donato remarked. “Our depth at scoring is what makes us dangerous.”
Among Harvard skaters, seniors own either the outright or shared lead in points, power-play tallies, game-winning strikes, and plus/minus.
Despite their on-ice accomplishments, the seniors provide the Crimson with more than just production. While Kerfoot and Tringale wear the C, all of the four-year veterans contribute invaluable leadership to the locker room.
This season alone, the seniors have led the team to its first Beanpot victory in 24 years, an Ivy League title, and a share of the Cleary Cup.
“It’s a culmination of a lot of hard work from a lot of guys. Our leadership group is unbelievable,” Tringale said. “There’s a lot of experience on this team; there’s a lot of character…. We don’t have this kind of success unless we have that leadership that we’ve been able to build.”
The Crimson Class of 2017 is set to make its third straight NCAA tournament appearance—Harvard’s 24th all-time. When this year’s eight seniors arrived in Cambridge, the team hadn’t seen a tournament berth since 2006.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Men’s Lacrosse Team (3-0, 0-0 Ivy) rode a hot start in its home-opener to overcome the late-charging Massachusetts Minutemen (0-3, 0-0 Colonial) by a score of 11-7. The Crimson has now won three consecutive games against Massachusetts, its longest streak since 1984.
Junior attackman Morgan Cheek tied a career-high with 5 assists Saturday afternoon at Jordan Field, a mark which he set nearly a year ago against the same opponent. Cheek’s fifth assist on that day last season set up recent graduate Devin Dwyer’s game-winner en route to a 10-9 Harvard victory in OT.
“I tried to take advantage early,” said Cheek. “Coming out strong is one of the biggest things we can do, and we were helped out a lot by our defense playing equally well. It’s much harder to play from behind than with a lead, so once we got them behind we knew we were in the driver’s seat, and we just had to close it out from there.”
The Wellesley native spearheaded an early onslaught of Harvard offense that pushed Harvard four goals in front with 2:56 remaining in the first quarter. The Crimson led UMass 5-1 heading into the half time break, while Cheek was responsible for all five scores in the first 30 minutes of play, registering two goals and three assists.
“I thought we came out with a lot of good energy,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik. “And we matched that energy being able to execute, and hit our shots, and that was ultimately the difference in the game…On the offensive end, Morgan Cheek had an absolutely stellar game. He had his hand in almost all of our goals, and I thought he did a great job of making his teammates better. He was a huge boost.”
Cheek also potted four goals of his own, lifting his season point total to 21. The Minutemen looked more like “Hourmen” when it came to helping on Cheek, and the nation’s leading point scorer gracefully took advantage of their tardy slides.
“We played two defenses the previous two games that slid quickly,” Cheek said. “UMass Lowell played a zone, and Holy Cross almost pre-slid, and I think the strength of our team is that we’re really athletic, and we try to run by people, so I was really excited to finally have the opportunity to dodge.”
For the Crimson, junior goalie Robert Shaw stopped 21 shots, good for a career high. After the game, Coach Wojcik lauded Shaw’s performance as one of the best he’d seen in his seven years at the helm.
“Rob Shaw had an outstanding game,” said Wojcik. “He was great from the opening whistle all the way throughout. It’s as good as a goalie’s played in all my seven years here, and I thought he was a huge difference maker in this game.”
Through three appearances in the fledgling 2017 campaign, Shaw has posted a 64.9 save percentage and 8.00 goals against average.
“It feels good,” said Shaw, “but it was a good effort from the whole team. I saw a lot of shots that were easy to save because our defense forced some outside ones. It got a little close at the end there, and we let them back in a little bit, but we’ve been working really hard conditioning-wise, so we had the energy to pull it out.”
UMass’ Grant Consoletti’s man-up goal left the Minutemen trailing 8-7 with 5:06 left in the 4th, but the late push would go no further. After an extended scrum at midfield following a mishandled pass, junior middie Joe Lang picked up a ground ball with 4:11 to play. The Crimson delivered 36 seconds later, as Cheek threaded a pass across the face of the goal to freshman attackman Ryan Graff who converted on the doorstep.
“The way we fought for ground balls in the second half, particularly the fourth quarter, was a big part of winning some key possessions that allowed us to create scoring chances, which we finished late,” Wojcik said.
New faces continue to bolster Harvard’s cohesive play. The Crimson’s young defense, which features two freshmen in the regular rotation (Beau Botkiss and David Strupp) has yet to allow opponents into double figures. Meanwhile, freshman midfielder Nigel Andrews punched home his third goal in as many games, while his classmate Dalton Follows upped his season goal total to five after burying two against the Minutemen.
