After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Films like “The Nice Guys” never win much critical acclaim, because quite frankly, they’re not “good” in the traditional, high-brow sense of the word. Shane Black’s newest buddy cop comedy is as formulaic as they come, steaming its way through a forgettable and by-the-book conspiracy story without much regard for artistic nuance. If you’re expecting a daring and paradigm-shifting maverick of a film, this is not the movie for you. At the same time, the world needs films that simply make audiences laugh, and “The Nice Guys”—superbly executed and blissful to the point that it refuses to take even itself seriously—is just that.
The film begins sometime during the 1970s in the City of Angels. We are introduced to Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe), a no-nonsense, off-the-books enforcer—the guy you go to when you have a problem that the police can’t or won’t solve. Divorced, alone, and terribly cynical, he spits out grim one-liners like “Marriage is buying a house for someone you hate.” How sweet. Next, we meet private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling), Healy’s childish, sarcastic, and occasionally incompetent foil. The duo’s paths cross when their respective jobs lead them to the same target, and eventually they team up to investigate a series of related deaths and disappearances all seemingly stemming from a single pornographic film.
As alluded to previously, there’s little reason to pay much attention to the derivative plot of “The Nice Guys”—plainly speaking, it’s dull and uninteresting. In a way, though, such mediocrity is almost welcome, as it allows audience members to power down their brains and simply delight in Crowe and Gosling’s superlative odd-couple chemistry (which, coincidentally, was first on showcase at this year’s Academy Awards). Gosling in particular turns in an exceptionally hilarious performance replete with physical comedy, reminding us of his often unheralded comedic chops.
“The Nice Guys” also benefits from a playful, quippy, and altogether excellent screenplay courtesy of writer-director Shane Black. Buddy cop comedies are often made or broken on the merits of their dialogue—clunky and corny banter can undermine even the best acting efforts.
Luckily, Black is established and well-versed in the genre, having brought us a bona fide classic in 1987’s “Lethal Weapon.”
Shane Black’s latest film after “Iron Man 3” is neither stylistically nor narratively exceptional. Viewers should rest assured, however, that even though there are no puzzles to ponder or symbols to analyze, the film promises a great time. Look for “The Nice Guys” when you’re in need of a pick-me-up—it’s pure escapist fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many young people today with little knowledge of constitutional law might be surprised—even dumbfounded—to learn that fewer than 50 years ago, interracial marriage was illegal in large tracts of the United States. Such is a testament to the transformational nature of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark Supreme Court case that declared anti-miscegenation laws to be in violation of the U.S. Constitution and thereby embedded a right to marriage regardless of race in the national consciousness. As a defining moment in judicial history, the “Loving” decision and its courtroom—the site of one of the most important moral and intellectual battles of recent history—simply demand to be addressed on the big screen.
Director Jeff Nichols’s “Loving,” however, is emphatically not the answer to such a call. The director’s newest film—his second this year after “Midnight Special,” which debuted at the Berlin International Film Festival in February—is not so much about the Supreme Court case as it is about the love story behind it. What results is among Nichols’ best work, beautifully acted and eloquently reticent.
The film begins with the budding romance between Richard Loving and Mildred Jeter, a young couple living in Caroline County, Virginia. Despite being of different races—Richard is white, and Mildred is of African-American and Native American descent—the two marry in Washington, D.C., and are expecting a child. It turns out, however, that the locals in Caroline County are not nearly as amenable to the idea of a mixed-race couple as the folks in the nation’s capital are. The Lovings are arrested and given an ultimatum: Go to jail, or leave the state of Virginia. Fortunately, the plight of the Loving family catches the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union, which decides that the couple are well-suited for a precedent-setting challenge in the nation’s highest Court—what would become the now-famous landmark decision.
Although probing into the case’s legal proceedings would have made for excellent dramatic fodder, the film resists the urge to take an arguably more Hollywood-friendly route into courtroom drama territory. We see the Lovings interact briefly with their lawyer, Bernard Cohen (an unexpected dramatic turn by Nick Kroll), and get a glimpse into the actual hearing itself, but we are largely shut out of the legal process. This conscious decision by Nichols may not have been the most commercially sound choice, but it was certainly the right one artistically and holistically. In eschewing courtroom heroics and moral hyperbole for a more personal love story, “Loving” became a stronger and more impactful film.
Faced with the unenviable task of casting a truly iconic star-crossed couple, “Loving” also manages to hit the jackpot. Joel Edgerton, an actor who has seen his star rise dramatically in recent years, departs from his usually bombastic persona to masterfully embody the tacit and understated Richard Loving. And not to be outdone, up-and-coming Ethiopian-Irish actress Ruth Negga holds her own against her more established co-star in what may well be an Oscar-nominated performance as Mildred Loving. Collectively, the two are a stirring combination—one of the most astoundingly well-cast duos of the year. Their efforts, along with that of Nichols, cement “Loving” as a film of record for this tumultuous chapter in American history.

To the Editor,
Last week’s story regarding the size of the undergraduate student body at Harvard used my words to imply that we had not just considered the question, but that we were actively pursuing a plan of expansion. I want to emphasize that Harvard is not actively pursuing any such plan at this moment. To expand the size of the undergraduate student body, we would have to build more classrooms, add additional faculty members, expand our academic and health support services, and—because we are a residential college—construct new undergraduate housing. We would not embark on such an effort without significant engagement with our neighboring Allston, Boston, and Cambridge communities. Our focus today, in the capital budget of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is on completing the important process of renewing our existing undergraduate Houses in Cambridge and on the development of the new home for the Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences along Western Avenue.
Sincerely,Michael D. SmithMichael D. Smith is Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

To the editor:
In the debate over the right of Harvard College students to participate in sororities, fraternities and single-sex final clubs it should be noted that those societies both meet a valid need and achieve worthy goals.
Should Harvard inquire, I believe the evidence will show that the members of those societies participate to the same extent in the co-ed life of the campus as do other undergraduates. Oddly, while trumpeting the primacy of co-ed College life, Harvard will impose sanctions that limit society members’ involvement in that life. As it is now, the members derive the full benefit of meshing their talents and energies with the opposite sex in the classrooms, at Phillips Brooks House, at the Loeb Theater, and in a multitude of other College activities. And they socialize together in the dining halls, on dates, and at parties.
But to further enrich their Harvard experience members have found a need for space and time unto themselves as women and unto themselves as men. They have recognized that the social experience of men with men is different from the social experience of women with women. And they have also recognized that both are different from the social experience of young men with young women. The benefits of the former are as valid as the benefits of the latter. And thus Harvard’s men and women have turned in growing numbers to the single-sex social societies.
What those societies provide is a circle of good friends from across the College and across the classes. It is a fact that the single-sex societies are especially effective at bringing about deep and lasting friendships between their members (much as do the single-sex varsity sports teams). And as the student body has diversified in its racial, ethnic, economic status, and national origin composition, so have the societies’ memberships, contrary to the complaints of Harvard. And ironically, of course the friendships between those members precisely serve Harvard’s ends.
Friendships formed as undergraduates are important to the happy experience of Harvard College life. And happy College years will likely mean loyalty to Harvard in the many years to follow. Harvard will ill-serve itself and its hard-working scholars when it penalizes them for enjoying a vibrant dimension of Harvard life.
Sincerely,Zechariah Chafee ’73

UPDATED: May 21, 2016, at 9:50 p.m.
Rejoicing with smiles, shouts, and hurried text messages to parents, 95 members of the Class of 2016 found out they had been elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society in an email on Wednesday.
Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest arts and sciences honor society in the United States, selects around 10 percent of seniors from the 284 institutions that have active chapters. Prospective members must demonstrate academic excellence in a variety of courses to be considered for election.
The 95 seniors who were informed of their election on Wednesday join an additional 48 members of their class who were elected in the fall of 2015 and 24 who were elected in the spring of their junior years.
This spring’s cohort of honorees comes from all 12 of Harvard’s upperclassman Houses. The strongest showing came from Leverett House, with 15 newly-elected members, followed by Adams House with 14. The 95 students who were selected concentrate in nearly 30 subjects, with Applied Mathematics and Economics tied for the greatest number of inductees at eight each.
Upon receiving the notification of their election, students said they felt a range of emotions, from excitement to surprise to satisfaction. Brianna J. Suslovic ’16—an Anthropology concentrator from Winthrop House—said her award felt like a validation of her hard work while at the College.
“I think that I’m a person who has always really tried to take academics pretty seriously,” Suslovic said. “I’ve put in a lot of effort in all of my classes at Harvard, and it's really exciting that this is almost proof that all of the effort was worth it.”
For Linguistics concentrator Dylan W. Hardenbergh ’16, a resident of Leverett House, the email informing him he had been chosen was almost completely unexpected.
“It was a nice surprise to receive,” Hardenbergh said. “For me it wasn’t something that was really on my radar that much.”
The newly-elected seniors will be officially inducted into Phi Beta Kappa in a ceremony next Tuesday morning, Jeffrey Berg, assistant director at the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, wrote in an email to the elected students.
“I’m really looking forward to kicking off Commencement week with the induction,” Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, a Philosophy and Classics joint concentrator from Adams House, said. “It’s a really exciting way to finish off my four years at Harvard.”
