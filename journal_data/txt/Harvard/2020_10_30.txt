After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The War on Cancer is not new. It began in 1971, after President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act. A couple decades later, President Clinton claimed that the Human Genome Project was set to “revolutionize the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of most, if not all, human diseases,” including the likes of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and cancer. In 2003, National Cancer Institute director Andrew von Eschenbach assured Congress that given a $600 million budget each year, the NCI could “eliminate suffering and death” from cancer by 2010.
Billions, if not trillions, of dollars, hundreds of targets, and several multinational campaigns later, the cancer mortality rate has barely changed — and certainly not to the extent promised. But the overpromises keep coming: The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative announced their goal to mitigate all disease by the end of the century, and President Barack Obama claimed in his 2016 State of the Union that this time’s ”Cancer Moonshot” would get us to a cure.
I understand that cancer research takes massive amounts of data and optimism, but the overwhelming effort can be communicated without misleading headlines. Such overpromises, and to a degree overconfidence, from the scientific community fuel increasing anti-science sentiment: if cancer was supposed to be cured back then and wasn’t, why should I believe in the process now?
Are scientists wholly responsible for anti-science sentiment? No. While scientists have engaged in some degree of self-sabotage, much of the responsibility for distrust falls on the public.
Choosing to ignore or forgo science means choosing to lose our commitment to each other. We go to a dentist or mechanic or teacher with the expectation that they’ll help us achieve greater ends. Trusting science has historically led us to improved standards of living and expanded democratic processes following progressive Enlightenments. Without that trust, our species regresses.
How we move forward, then, is especially relevant during this pandemic, when trust in science is directly correlated with concern for COVID-19 safety measures such as social distancing.
Consider the thrice-amended perspective of one expert and how that transformation was largely obscured. On March 6, Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine, health policy, and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University and an adviser to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, claimed that while masks worn by those infected offer a good barrier to prevent viral spread, masks aren’t particularly effective for protecting healthy wearers because they don’t fit perfectly. He argued that the public shouldn’t wear masks not only because they were in limited supply but also because “they really don’t do much work.” On April 3, his directive changed: masks offered a “modest” benefit to wearers. And by June 29, he said, “masks protect ourselves and everyone around us.”
The problem is not that Schaffner changed his stances; it’s that he did so with the same confident tone and no explanation or acknowledgment of past mistakes. In fact, that March 6 video has been made private by Vanderbilt Health, and I have not found a written acknowledgement or rationale. The same skepticism towards the War on Cancer can be applied here: due to the dissonant advice and lack of transparency of experts like Schaffner, many now point at such early no-mask guidelines as reasons not to wear a mask.
I understand that the World Health Organization and CDC downplayed mask-wearing benefits at least in part as a strategy to partition medical-grade personal protective equipment for hospitals, but that decision ultimately hurt the health sector by muddying the facts and, in hindsight, appearing condescending. Rather than be upfront and honest, they chose to withhold certain facts and were forced to make an about-face afterwards. A lack of transparency pitted institutions of science against the public, rather than bringing them into alliance.
For scientists, especially those on TV like Dr. Schaffner, it’s time to court humility and acknowledge uncertainties. Communicate that uncertain truth to the general public — represent your data and suggestions transparently, even if they’re incomplete or confounding, and acknowledge the social and political stakes. It is vital to not only inform the public of what they should be doing but also the reason why they’re doing it and why that guidance might change over time.
And for the rest of us, we must continue respecting science: recognizing well-proven facts (the Earth, after all, is not flat) and guiding intents and principles, as well as following recommended guidelines. This also means voting out the people who don’t respect science, and keeping accountable those with the power to undermine its goals of progress.
Because without the two-way street of scientific facts and reasoning, society regresses. Yes, scientists owe the public the truth — and honesty, when they lack it. But we also owe scientists respect for that honest truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, when we think about expressing how we feel about someone, we think about hearts – a red or pink or purple emoji sent over text, a predictive-text abbreviation for “love,” even a Facebook like. Online, a heart-shaped response can span the gulf between vague interest and genuine commitment, between acknowledging comments on Instagram posts and celebrating something you think might be love. It’s really easy, too, to send a heart when you don’t actually know what to say; when you want to show someone you care, but you just don’t know how best to label your relationship on the spectrum of human connection. They’re ubiquitous symbols, for better or for worse.
But those aren’t the only symbols. Take a poignant scene from Anton Chekhov’s “The Seagull.” Gloomy playwright Treplev shoots the titular bird and presents it solemnly at the feet of ingenue Nina, the object of his unrequited love. “What do you mean by this?” asks Nina in response, confused at both the dead bird and the ceremony with which Treplev has laid it at her feet. “Is this a symbol or something?” she seems really to be asking. She’s not just exposing the futility of Treplev’s love for her, she’s also calling attention to the outsized role that symbols play in how we connect with and show our love to each other.
When we saw each other daily, connection was both easier and harder. We got to spend all our time immersed in a bubble with the people we cared about, reminding us each day why they brought us so much joy. But with face-to-face contact came an expectation of transparency — if you were unable to put your finger on the nature of a relationship, you couldn’t just throw up a heart and turn your phone off, you had to stop and think and try your best to say the right thing. You’d know in an instant, too, if you’d erred, since you’d be waiting and watching for the person’s honest reactions. Relationships were, quite literally, a dialogue.
Now, it’s all online. We see most of our college compatriots not through brief hellos on crossed paths but instead on Instagram posts — a smiling pair of roommates hiking a mountain or the sunset over a picturesque locale. We like the posts with a heart, or put one in the comments, tossing it at their feet. Maybe we text a friend something exciting to let them know how much we miss them, and before we know it, the text chain has devolved into hearts back and forth. We’re alone together (to use the oft-quoted phrase), sending our hearts to a screen and waiting to get one back, like symbolic ping-pong. Instead of seeing each other’s faces, we’re stuck with heart-shaped paraphernalia; instead of experiencing each other’s emotions, we’re left with symbols.
For what it’s worth, the heart is about as representative a symbol for love as a seagull is. The heart is a muscular, hardworking organ on the center-left side of your sternum, about the size of your fist. On average, about 72 times per minute, a little electric current travels through your heart to make it tense up (contract) and then relax; each one of these cycles is a heartbeat. Every time your heart contracts and relaxes, it pushes deoxygenated blood through various chambers into your lungs, taking the newly oxygenated blood back and squeezing it out to the rest of your body. It’s a really beautiful orchestration. But, in and of itself, it doesn’t have much to do with love, connection, or anything in between.
Our perception of love, despite what Instagram and “I heart NY” and Valentine’s Day manufacturers seem to think, is a product of the stirring and pulsing of chemicals in the brain. When you see someone cute, or you spend time laughing with a best friend, your brain releases little hormones that shoot through your bloodstream and tell your senses and organs how to respond. Oxytocin and vasopressin, for example, encourage social bonding, so you never want to end the FaceTime call. Dopamine, the main player in the reward pathway, makes you feel like you’ve just won the soulmate lottery.
Epinephrine (or adrenaline), the so-called “fight-or-flight” hormone, links our brains’ chemical perception of love and connection with its physical feeling. It stimulates that electric current in your heart to pulse faster, squeezing blood from place to place at a quicker rate and giving you that pitter-patter, beating-heart rush we know as love, as friendship, as human connection.
So, though the heart has nothing to do with generating our perception of love, it’s a medium through which we feel it. In that way, it’s a lot like Instagram, Snapchat, all forms of social media. It’s not just a symbol, whose two-dimensionality reminds us constantly of how much we’d rather be in person; it’s also the medium through which we send and feel our emotions.
“Is this a symbol or something?” asks Nina in “The Seagull.” Maybe. But what she doesn’t understand is that to Treplev, the pallid anguish of the dead seagull is more than a symbol; it’s the medium through which Treplev feels his love for her.
Unlike Nina and Treplev, social media is all we have. Sure, hearts, texts, and seagulls are just symbols – unable to replicate the real thing. But we can’t let that disappointment cloud us from remembering that they’re the media through which we let others know how much we care about them. Now, especially, that’s invaluable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A couple of weeks before the semester started, the undergraduate student population received an email from Dean Khurana regarding the college’s newest initiative: “Harvard Everywhere,” which seeks to “reinvent the full range of Harvard co-curricular activities and resources — house-based activities, public service, athletics, arts, interest clubs, health and wellness — in ways that will reach [students], wherever [they] are this fall.”
Being the enthusiastic pre-frosh that I was, 10,000 miles from campus because of visa restrictions, I was initially intrigued, and waited in curious anticipation of the project’s launch.
“What do you think Harvard Everywhere is going to look like?” I commented blithely whilst in conversation with a fellow Singaporean.
“Harvard what?”
“Harvard Everywhere?”
“Ah... whoops… I think I must have archived that email too quickly.”
As classes began, one of my professors, Joseph K. Blitzstein, cheekily joked, “Inspired by the creation of Harvard Everywhere, I am launching Stat 110 Everywhere. ”
It didn’t take me much longer to realize that Harvard Everywhere was becoming one of those initiatives which persistently remain in phases of inception, struggling to garner traction amid an over-committed, perpetually-busy student population.
A quick browse of its website reveals that the initiative is organized into eight “squads,” each led by one or two faculty or administrators: Academic Engagement; Arts; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; House Life; Public Service, Civic Engagement, and Social Justice; Recreation and Fitness; Student Organizations; and Wellness and Health Promotion.
Each squad has its own subpage, which has a brief expository prologue on their area of interest. The Recreation and Fitness squad, for example, has developed a “Grow, Play, and Achieve” program – titled the GPA program. But beyond the blurb, links are scarce on each subpage, making it a bit of challenge to find out how each program is functioning, or access any existing resources related to the initiative.
From my perspective, Harvard Everywhere has yet to have a delible impact on many students (particularly the international community), and if it is functioning to a much greater extent in places that I am unaware of, there is a lack of equitable distribution of information and resources regarding the program. Furthermore, though a skeleton of its structure exists, the program lacks concrete goals for continued engagement. I do not doubt that the College has sincere intentions for Harvard Everywhere, but its execution thus far has shown a lack of commitment.
One promised offering of Harvard Everywhere that would greatly benefit students is the Classroom to Table program, adapted for the virtual setting. While it cannot completely replicate sitting in Harvard Square, face-to-face with one’s friends and professors, the prospect of enjoying a meal over Zoom is an amusing substitute, and would provide a similar avenue for relaxed and informal conversation outside of a classroom setting.
In like manner, the organizing team could reimagine other events already familiar to the student body, such as Yardfest, or yearly student productions, scaling it appropriately for the virtual environment.
Of course, it goes without saying that there are certain traditions which would be much more infeasible to adapt — the annual Harvard-Yale game, for instance. Indeed, the greater challenge for Harvard Everywhere is to incorporate opportunities for interaction that do not take place over Zoom, and preferably decrease screen time. I personally hope to see the Undergraduate Council collaborate with the administration on this matter, and remain accountable for the use of funds specially reserved for investment in student engagement.
That said, for all that the UC and the administration can do, making Harvard Everywhere happen is no mean feat, and it can only be accomplished through the collective effort of the student population to stay consciously engaged and intentionally involved.
Harvard Everywhere as a concept has untapped potential. We should not simply wait with bated breath until the Harvard diaspora is reunited on campus. Indeed, in past weeks, I have received several “condolences” on being a freshman in the current situation, particularly from upperclassmen. I appreciate the sentiment, but must admit that I do not feel the magnitude of loss that others imply, having never experienced Harvard in-person. Even though it is unlikely that 2020 will be our best year at Harvard, I firmly believe that it can still be meaningful. We may mourn the loss of an in-person academic year, but this ‘mourning’ should not last — the College and its students should not give up on improving the virtual College experience for all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences will not hold spring break in 2021, reallocating the five days of break as planned “wellness days” throughout the spring semester, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced in an email to faculty and staff Thursday.
FAS courses will not meet during the wellness days, which Harvard will schedule roughly every other week. The spring semester start and end dates will remain in line with those in previous years.
Gay wrote that the schedule will help minimize travel for FAS affiliates in residence while also providing downtime.
“As was the case this fall, we anticipate that public health considerations will require us to minimize travel for our community in residence in order to manage the transmission of the virus on campus and protect our academic enterprise from disruption,” Gay wrote. “This schedule supports that approach, while still recognizing the need for downtime (and time away from a screen) during the term. Following our regular academic calendar also avoids the introduction of schedule conflicts across Harvard Schools, which is a particular concern for graduate programs.”
This decision regarding the spring academic calendar is independent of the decision regarding when undergraduates would return to campus, which the FAS still intends to announce in early December, Gay wrote.
“While the academic calendar is now set for spring, the question of when undergraduate students who will be learning in residence would arrive on campus is related but independent of the academic timeline,” she wrote. “While there is much more work ahead of us, we are on track to share the outcome of that planning early in December.”
FAS will invite students facing challenging home environments to campus, while also planning to prioritize bringing seniors back to campus if possible, Harvard administrators announced in a July email.
While the FAS originally planned to bring up to 40 percent of students — the entire freshman class and students who face challenges learning at home — back in residence this fall, only 25 percent of students decided to return to campus. Students on campus must follow strict safety protocols to prevent COVID-19 infections, including frequent testing and limited social interaction.
Gay said in an October interview with The Crimson that circumstances “bode well” for welcoming “potentially even more” students to campus in the spring. While she called the conditions on campus “encouraging” in her Thursday email, she wrote that public health conditions are “deteriorating.”
“Communities across the nation are seeing spikes in positive cases, and, on Monday of this week, thirteen Massachusetts cities and towns took a step back in their reopening because of a rise in coronavirus cases,” Gay wrote. “Though current data on the incidence of the virus on our campus are encouraging, we must prepare for the possibility that the course of the pandemic will continue its current trajectory.”
The University reported seven new cases of coronavirus over the past seven days, out of 16,265 tests. None of the seven people who tested positive were undergraduates.
Gay ended her message by thanking faculty and staff for their work amid the pandemic.
“Some days it feels like we have been on one long Zoom call that started in March,” Gay wrote. “Thank you for all of your hard work, care, and commitment to our teaching and research mission over that time, and for all to come in the months ahead.

Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will reduce the number of students it admits for the 2021-22 school year as it continues to grapple with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators wrote in a letter to faculty Thursday afternoon.
Graduate programs across the nation — including Harvard’s Graduate School of Education doctoral program — have paused admissions in response to pressures on faculty time and university finances wrought by the pandemic. GSAS plans to take what the administrators termed a “more balanced approach to admissions” than peer institutions that chose to pause admissions entirely.
“In recent months, GSAS, SEAS, and FAS leadership have heard from many faculty members who are deeply concerned that Harvard’s research mission and the intellectual life of individual departments would be compromised if a similar decision was announced for GSAS graduate programs,” the FAS deans wrote.
They wrote, however, that they would not accept a full cohort of new students, citing the pandemic’s toll on the University’s finances, reduced access to campus resources, and the forbidding academic job market. New admissions targets will be “conservative,” allowing for currently enrolled students to access additional advising resources.
“Early on, it was clear that this would be a tough admissions season,” the deans wrote. “In addition to our concerns about current students and Harvard’s academic mission, we cannot ignore the toll that the pandemic and its financial ramifications have taken on the University.”
“In numerous fields, too—particularly those heavily dependent on the academic job market—employment outcomes that were already challenging before the COVID-19 crisis are now severely affected,” they added. “We consider it our ethical responsibility not to exacerbate these problems by taking a full cohort of new students: In a few cases, cohorts will be heavily reduced or even paused.”
Thursday’s letter — signed by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, GSAS Dean Emma Dench, Social Sciences Dean Lawrence D. Bobo, Arts and Humanities Dean Robin E. Kelsey, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III, and Sciences Dean Christopher W. Stubbs — argued that the changes could “turn a crisis into an opportunity” by addressing “existing and fundamental concerns about PhD curricula, the well-being of students, and their employment outcomes” at the school.
The administrators wrote that reduced numbers of new students would allow GSAS to “reset” its approach towards admissions. Admissions targets for departments in the long term will be determined based on diversity, advising strength, and student career outcomes in those programs.
“In the past, graduate admissions targets have been grounded in the belief that more is better: that increasing cohort size is the goal,” they wrote. “This has created a less than optimal environment for some of our students, increasing time to degree, decreasing advising effectiveness, and narrowing the evaluation of prospective students’ excellence and potential.”
Dench launched a two-year effort last December to gather data on and reform advising for GSAS students following survey results that she said demonstrated a “troubling” number of students were not satisfied with the advising they received.
GSAS will work with programs over the course of the next year to begin an “extended conversation” regarding curricula, training, and professional development in doctoral programs, the administrators wrote.
“As stated above, this is an opportunity to reset our graduate admissions process, evaluate how we are serving our graduate students, and ensure that we are setting them up for success as students and as alumni, regardless of program or stage in program,” the deans wrote. “By taking these steps, we will work together to preserve Harvard’s excellence and continue fostering the intellectual talent that drives it.”

The Harvard College Democrats have adapted their campaign strategies to pandemic conditions, replacing door-to-door canvassing with phone banking competitions and virtual events as they seek to reach voters before the upcoming election.
According to College Democrats Vice President Oswaldo A. Ambrosio ’22, a principal goal for the organization is to promote political participation during this election cycle. Ambrosio emphasized the importance of encouraging eligible voters to vote.
“These changes are going to affect us, and if we don’t have our voices heard, then the people that are in power are not going to do the things that we actually think are necessary to make progress in this country, and to have a real inclusive vision of what America can be,” Ambrosio said.
This year, the group has sponsored the Harvard for Biden subgroup of the organization and campaigned for Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.
In past election cycles, the club has held canvassing trips, during which volunteers participated in door-to-door campaigning and spoke with voters. Now, the College Democrats have focused most of their canvassing efforts on phone banking.
During each phone banking event, around 10 to 30 volunteers call voters to relay details about candidates and advocate for legislative issues. In the past week, volunteers have called voters about ballot questions in various states, including voting "yes" for ranked choice voting in Massachusetts.
According to College Democrats President Menatallah N. Bahnasy ’22, the club has made roughly 3500 calls this past semester. The group hopes to make another 1500 calls between Friday and Election Day on Tuesday.
The Democrats have also partnered with other universities to host phone banking competitions. Most recently, all eight Ivy League universities participated in a phone banking competition for candidates in Florida.
“It’s not just Harvard students that will be affected by the things that these candidates will pursue. In the future, everybody is affected,” Ambrosio said. “Being able to see other people phone bank alongside with you, or at different schools, just reminds you that we’re really all in this together.”
Bahnasy noted the importance of participation during elections that could be determined by a few hundred votes. She added that it is every individual’s “civic duty” to vote, especially given historical fights for that right.
“Your voice matters no matter how small you might think it is. I think there’s a great sentiment that one vote won’t make a difference, or ‘I don’t have to vote because it’s not going to matter in the long run,’” Bahnasy said. “But that’s far from the truth. Every vote matters.”
According to Ambrosio, political involvement encompasses much more than just voting for the Democrats.
The group’s broader efforts have included writing letters to state legislatures advocating for sexual assault justice system reform and phone banking for issues like immigration and climate change. Over the summer, the group held a phone bank for Black Lives Matter.
“Everybody’s vote matters, but also I think voting is just the start of anything. Voting is not the only thing that is necessary to build political power and make sure that our elected officials actually hear what we’re saying,” Ambrosio said. “We have to contest every part of the political arena.”
The Harvard Republican Club, which endorsed incumbent President Donald J. Trump last month, declined to comment on their pre-election effort.

The mayor of Cambridge, Boston and Massachusetts elections officials, and a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School discussed the importance of civic engagement and the pandemic’s effects on the 2020 elections in a webinar Thursday.
Titled “Voting, Participation, and Why it Matters,” the event featured Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, Director of Massachusetts Elections Michelle K. Tassinari, Boston Elections Commissioner Eneida D. Tavares, and Ash Center fellow Tova A. Wang. Government professor Danielle Allen moderated the discussion.
Panelists focused on the changes to elections this year due to the pandemic, rising youth activism, and the necessity of constant civic engagement.
“I hope they’ll take away the inspiration to vote, or if they’re not yet of voting age, a sturdy commitment to register at the earliest point and take up their role as a voter as soon as they can,” Allen said in an interview before the event.
Allen opened the event by posing a question about voter apathy, asking how to respond when a voter says, “Look, we know how Massachusetts is gonna vote. Why should I bother?”
Tavares pointed out that there are other races on the ballot aside from the presidential contest, including state and municipal offices. Tassinari added that contests between individual candidates are not the only matters on the ballot: Ballot propositions, like ranked choice voting, are also important questions for citizens to decide.
Tavares and Tassinari both pointed to the 2019 Boston City Council race, which was decided by a single vote.
“That was just one example of why every single voice matters,” Tavares said.
In conversations with skeptical voters, Siddiqui said she focuses on what’s at stake in elections, especially given how hard Americans fought — and continue to fight — for the right to vote.
“This act of voting, to me it’s this act of survival. I talk about the fact that our elections have consequences,” Siddiqui said. “Our vote is our power.”
The panelists moved on to discuss the pandemic’s ramifications for the election and the modifications local and state officials have put in place to ensure voters’ safety.
“We worked really closely with our election officials for both figuring out what their early voting locations were going to be, their polling places, having them set them up to be six feet apart, to have signage, to have plexiglass, to have sanitation stations, to have PPE for all of the poll workers,” Tassinari said.
While the social distancing modifications are only temporary, Wang said she hopes the public’s respect for election officials will be permanent, calling them “the heroes of democracy.”
Wang also said she was encouraged by youth participation around the election.
“They are connecting the dots between what they are trying to get on the streets and what they need to do at the ballot box,” she said. “A lot of these young people have hit upon what is so really important when you're talking about civic participation, which is having relationships and feeling like you are in solidarity with other people.”
Ultimately, remaining civically engaged is important no matter the outcome of the election, Tavares said. Tassarini added that even if their preferred candidates lose, citizens should still work to influence the political conversation and hold elected officials accountable.
“Civic engagement is not a one-off, one day thing,” Allen said. “Civic engagement is a way of life.”

Prison reform activists argued in favor of high-quality education in prisons at a webinar Thursday held by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies.
Panelists included Max Kenner, the founder of the Bard Prison Initiative, and Dyjuan Tatro, a government affairs associate at the initiative. Zelda Roland, founding director of the Yale Prison Education Initiative and Craig S. Wilder, history professor at MIT, also spoke at the webinar, which was opened by co-founder and director of the Prison Studies Project Kaia Stern and moderated by Harvard Graduate School of Education lecturer Lynette C. Tannis.
Speakers highlighted their work in educational justice and emphasized the importance of quality teaching in prisons.
“My real job and my real priority is to bring legislators to prioritize people over prisons,” Tatro, who lobbies government officials to adopt prison education reform, said.
Tannis, whose research focuses on incarcerated youth, said insufficient education in prisons sends a message that society does not value incarcerated people.
“If there’s no training, support, professional development, what you’re actually demonstrating to the youth is that we don’t value you,” Tannis said in an interview after the event. “If we valued your life, we would actually be here preparing you for the transition, hopefully, the transformation for when you return.”
Roland, who is a graduate of Yale College, said teaching in prisons made her think critically about who “Harvard and Yale imagined to be students, or leaders, or citizens.”
Wilder similarly noted that teaching incarcerated people encouraged him to expand his understanding of activism through education.
“All these people are simply students and what they needed was a teacher,” Wilder said. “And to the extent that I see myself as a teacher, I had as much an obligation to them as I do to anyone else who passes through my class.”
Wilder added that colleges and universities have an “academic obligation” to bring higher education to prisons.
“College in prison is just one step toward a more democratic society,” Wilder said.
Elite institutions, however, do not sufficiently invest in bringing high-quality education to prisons, according to Kenner.
“Education in prison should be done well,” he said. “It should be done with care — that it is a place that we should go and actually invest in people and not visit in some voyeuristic or symbolic kind of way.”
Speakers also commented on the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on prison education, during the Q&A portion of the event.
Kenner said while the pandemic encourages prisons to improve digital learning opportunities, an over-reliance on technology could erode “real human relationships” among incarcerated individuals.

Despite many students learning remotely this semester, College administrators and student organizations have planned a variety of Halloween festivities for those on and off campus.
Students will celebrate the holiday by listening to ghost stories, painting pumpkins, and solving escape room puzzles. Those living on campus have also been greeted with festive decorations, including a large inflatable Jabba The Hutt in Annenberg Hall.
Freshmen on campus can join a pumpkin painting contest planned by the First-Year Social Committee. Event organizers will give out pumpkins and painting supplies at Harvard Yard on Friday; students will have until Sunday to send in a photo of their painted pumpkins for the contest.
“The pumpkin painting event is an opportunity for people on campus to come together and celebrate fall — and of course Halloween — with one of the most classic traditions in a socially distanced way," FYSC member Talya W. K. Li ’24 said.
Li added that students living off campus can still participate in the contest by sending in a photo.
The College Events Board invited students to listen to “thrilling and comedic” ghost stories from the Ghost Brothers — professional ghost hunters — Thursday evening. The group organized the event to be accessible to students living on and off campus, according to CEB campus life director Nicole T. Rozelman ’23.
“CEB was looking for a way to engage students who were living off-campus and on-campus in our traditional Halloween celebration,” Rozelman said. “We figured that talking to the Ghost Brothers would be a great way to pay homage to a spooky Halloween.”
Several student organizations also plan to host their own events for Halloween.
The Hyperion Shakespeare Company will perform “Macbeth” over Zoom.
“We have fake blood, we have some murder scenes, we have witches – I’m playing a witch,” member Vivienne N. Germain ’24 said. “So I think it's definitely wonderful for the season.”
Germain said while it is difficult to perform a play with each actor joining through Zoom, she also sees the unique medium as an opportunity.
“I think that it pushes us to think really innovatively about how we’re going to translate theatre to Zoom,” Germain said.
The Harvard Foundation for the International Medical Relief of Children hosted a dare challenge to raise money for underserved communities around the globe.
“This dare challenge is a Halloween-themed fundraiser that is designed to engage the Harvard community in a virtual setting by enabling people to dare others and at the same time donate for a great cause,” FIMRC board member Nesreen J. Shukr ’23 said.
Halloween spirit is growing in several upperclassman Houses as well.
Adams House Social Chair Tiffany L. Gonzalez ’22 organized a 360-degree haunted theater virtual escape room for Adams residents.
“The premise is that you’re on set at some sort of theater production, and an hour before showtime, there is some ghost, and you have to exorcise the ghosts from the theater before showtime or you're stuck in the theater forever,” Gonzalez said.
“It’s trying to create that space where people can come together as a community,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Writer and activist Nikil Saval discussed the role of architecture in reimagining cities in the context of the 1964 Harlem Race Riot at a virtual webinar hosted by the Harvard Graduate School of Design Thursday night.
Moderated by Design School Dean Sarah M. Whiting and titled “A Rage In Harlem,” the lecture was the latest installment in the school’s Open House lecture series.
Thursday’s lecture focused mainly on June Jordan, a Black feminist writer who worked with architect R. Buckminster Fuller to reimagine Harlem’s housing plan in the wake of protests over the killing of James Powell, a Black teenager shot in 1964 by a white off-duty police officer, Thomas Gilligan.
Their plan appeared in Esquire in April 1965 and featured high-rise cylindrical towers with hollow middles filled with highways and green space, with apartments contained in the towers’ walls. The towers would hold shops, supermarkets, and other community spaces for residents.
Esquire changed Jordan and Fuller’s original name for the plan, “Skyrise for Harlem,” to “Instant Slum Clearance.” The decision was one of many ways the final publication diminished Jordan’s contributions, Saval said.
“Though she was by then divorced, June Jordan was referred to by her married name, June Meyer, and any contribution she had made in the project was edited out,” Saval said. “The design was referred to as exclusively belonging to Fuller. These series of erasures of individuals, communities, neighborhoods, and titles, were both the opposite of what Jordan intended and partly of a piece with the article.”
Near the end of the lecture, Saval also discussed the murder of Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old Black man, by police in West Philadelphia Monday afternoon, connecting police brutality in 1960s Harlem to current events. The location of the murder holds historical significance, according to Saval.
“This took place only a few blocks from the place where in 1985, Philadelphia Police had dropped a bomb on a Pan-African house belonging to the group MOVE, killing an entire family, burning several blocks of West Philadelphia, and leaving hundreds homeless,” Saval said.
Saval also said Wallace’s murder has personal significance for him: Saval is currently running as a Democrat for Pennsylvania State Senate in the district containing Philadelphia. He said he ran for office in part to serve as a mediator between the federal government and the state, and he has a special interest in the problem of zoning and affordable housing.
“The large-scale idea is...a lot of what we get done at a federal level can get done at the states in an easier way or in kind of a more advanced way,” Saval said. “They're the kind of vanguard, at least in some ways, of planning and ideas around housing. And so I hope to do that in Pennsylvania.”
Ultimately, Saval argued that rather than using architecture to reduce crime or perpetuate systemic inequality, policymakers and architects should focus on innovating solutions to problems like access to affordable and sustainable high-density housing.
“There are few reflections I can offer here that are adequate to this moment, except that a history which has moved away from housing toward prisons, away from utopia toward police, and away from the claiming of Black space toward gentrification displacement and expulsion is in need of exorcism, transformation, and reparations. What new forms that will take may be up to all of us,” Saval said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts voters will weigh in on two statewide ballot measures — regarding the adoption of a ranked-choice voting law and a new “right-to-repair” law — as part of the Nov. 3 elections.
The right-to-repair measure — question one on the ballot — proposes a law that would allow motor vehicle owners and independent repair facilities expanded access to mechanical data. Manufacturers would be required to install open-access data platforms on motor vehicles that are sold in Massachusetts and use telematics systems.
The Commonwealth’s existing right-to-repair law, signed into law in 2013, does not set regulations for telematics systems, which allow remote access to mechanical data.
Proponents of the new right-to-repair proposal argue that, if adopted, it will ensure drivers are able to choose where they get their cars repaired, even as technology advances.
Thomas J. Hickey, director of the Massachusetts Right to Repair Coalition, said his group is advocating for “a level playing field in the repair market.”
“New technology is everywhere rapidly, and your car is no different. Your car is now a computer on wheels,” he said. “Wireless communication systems ... are now in 90 percent of new vehicles, and we’re closing that loophole to make sure there is a level playing field for car repair.”
“More importantly, consumers will be able to get their car fixed where they want,” he added.
Opponents of the proposal, however, have raised concerns about cybersecurity risks they say could arise with the creation of an open-access platform.
Conor Yunits, spokesperson for the Coalition for Safe and Secure Data, a group formed in opposition to the ballot question, said the proposal poses safety risks to consumers and does not allow automakers regulation of their vehicle systems.
“Notably, the question specifically excludes automakers from being involved in that app or in the access to the open access platforms,” Yunits said.
Question two on the ballot — the ranked-choice voting referendum — has also spurred debate. The proposed law would implement a system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference for primary and general elections for all statewide offices, state legislative offices, and federal congressional offices beginning in 2022.
Government professor Danielle S. Allen, an honorary co-chair for the “Yes On 2” campaign, said the proposed law could improve government responsiveness and empower voters.
“We all recognize that there is a lot of frustration with our political institutions — the fact that they're not responsive to ordinary voters, the fact that they can leave people feeling disempowered and alienated,” she said. “I think there are a number of reforms that would make a difference and ranked-choice voting is one of them.”
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers, another honorary co-chair for “Yes On 2,” said the implementation of ranked-choice voting would result in more moderate outcomes while allowing the participation of candidates with a wider range of views.
“It just makes sense that getting more information from voters about their preferences, rather than less, will lead to more rational decision-making,” he added.
The proposal has won widespread support from Massachusetts politicians, including the state’s entire Congressional delegation and the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito, both Republicans, expressed their opposition to the proposed law in a joint statement Tuesday.
“At a time when we need to be promoting turnout and making it easier for voters to cast their ballots, we worry that question two will add an additional layer of complication for both voters and election officials,” they wrote.
Voters in the Bay State have until Tuesday evening to cast their ballots, though many already have; two million early ballots had already been submitted statewide as of Thursday evening.

Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 praised epidemiologists at the affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital for quickly extinguishing a late September COVID-19 outbreak in an interview Friday.
In total, the hospital identified 42 employees and 15 patients with COVID-19 cases potentially linked to the cluster, though no new connected cases had been detected since Oct. 3, according to an Oct. 16 press release.
An infection control team used whole genome sequencing to confirm that the 57 cases were related, according to the release. The hospital performed more than 10,000 tests of employees between Sep. 25 and Oct. 16 in addition to testing inpatients every three days and new patients upon arrival.
“Because of an extraordinary amount of testing and contact tracing control, they were able to squelch it very, very quickly,” Daley said.
He specifically cited Medical School professor Michael Klompas, who serves as a hospital epidemiologist for Brigham and Women’s, for his “extraordinary” response to the outbreak.
In an interview Thursday, Klompas said that when the hospital identified the outbreak, the Brigham's infection control team immediately tried to establish the cluster’s scope while beginning containment efforts such as contact tracing.
“What that meant was identifying the people who’d already tested positive and finding all their contacts and alerting those contacts, and arranging for testing for them,” Klompas said. “Those who tested positive, we asked to stay home.”
The infection control team members also closely monitored all patients in the hospital who were potentially associated with the cluster. Once they pinpointed the outbreak’s source to a specific set of wards and healthcare teams, they implemented additional measures for those patients and employees, according to Klompas.
“All the employees who work in those areas and had been identified through contact tracing were asked to test and to continue testing on an every-few-days basis, just in case there was ongoing transmission, or if their infections were still incubating,” Klompas said.
In the aftermath of the outbreak, Klompas said the team is analyzing the cluster to identify the hospital’s weak points where additional precautionary measures may be needed, such as additional testing for patients getting high-risk procedures.
At the same time, as infection rates have risen in recent weeks in the United States and many other countries across the globe, the team is preparing to implement measures that grew out of months of planning for the pandemic’s potential second wave.
Coronavirus infections in Massachusetts in the last 14 days are 79 percent higher than the previous two-week period, and coincide with a rising number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals, according to the New York Times.
Klompas’s team is monitoring a variety of surveillance parameters, including daily case counts in Massachusetts and at Brigham, he said.
“We have a modeling group that’s trying to put those variables and others into systems to try and anticipate what’s the likely inpatient volume going to be over the next two weeks,” Klompas said. “They are using that to know when we have to pull the various triggers for the different scenarios, of small, medium, large amounts of COVID.”
“They’ve tried to think for each of those scenarios, what would we do in terms of bed availability, critical care services, staffing models, canceling of elective procedures,” he added.
Klompas said the overlap between the flu season and a potential second wave presents a new set of challenges.
“There is a lot of flu that leads a lot of people to present with respiratory illness, and you won’t know whether it’s flu or COVID until you test them,” Klompas said. “There could be extra demand upon hospital admissions and critical care support services, which is a worry point around which we’re having to make sure we have adequate capacity and planning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow reflected on the successes of the fall semester at Harvard and discussed uncertainty surrounding pending decisions regarding the spring in an interview Wednesday.
Bacow said the University has “learned a lot” since it made the choice in July to relegate all course instruction at the College to a virtual format and house no more than 40 percent of undergraduates on campus.
“We've learned that our high-cadence testing system is working well,” he said. “We've learned that we're capable of isolating students and tending to their needs when necessary, so that's worked well.”
“Our students are complying with social distancing and mask wearing and other sort of behavioral norms in ways that are very, very encouraging,” he added.
The College has not announced specific plans for housing students in the spring semester. Bacow declined to comment on when students can expect it to do so — though he said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the future, given the success in the fall.
Still, Bacow emphasized that the upcoming months are “clouded in enormous uncertainty.”
One factor in future decision making is the virus itself. The “accelerating” prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts in recent weeks has presented a challenge for administrators, Bacow said.
“We've gone from 200 cases a week in Massachusetts to north of 1,000 cases a week,” he said. “If that should go to 2,000 cases a week, things are going to look very differently than if it goes back down. We're just going to have to wait and see.”
He also cited the weather. The second semester of the academic year overlaps with Cambridge's coldest months, and Bacow raised concerns about how winter weather will alter students’ behavior.
So far, the University has advised against meeting in enclosed spaces, barring students from entering houses and dorms where they are not residing. Instead, they’ve spent time outdoors.
“We've been blessed with a fall that's been very, very mild. People have been able to be outside, enjoy the weather,” Bacow said. “I think everybody's concerned about what happens as things get colder, and people have to stay indoors more.”
As of Friday, eight of the University’s schools have announced their plans for the spring semester.
Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Law School, Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Divinity School, and the Radcliffe Institute will remain online-only. Harvard Kennedy School will offer a hybrid of in-person and remote classes. Harvard Medical School will invite all of its students back to campus.
“I think each school is in a different situation,” Bacow said. “Each one is trying to do the very best that they can. Each one is trying to provide the best possible educational experience.”
He cautioned that “every decision that we make is subject to change.”
“Another way of looking at it is all of our decisions are etched in sand,” Bacow said. “Our highest priority is to keep everybody safe and healthy.”
Bacow said that he believes Harvard's “efforts to date have gone well” — better than other colleges and universities that have racked up high case counts.
“We've been conservative in how we’ve responded to the virus and I think that those decisions that we made early on have stood us well,” he said. “Institutions that tried to be more aggressive have had to roll back their plans. We have not.”
