After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Friday, five students met with members of the Harvard Corporation to take the next steps in actualizing a social choice fund. This rare meeting between the Corporation and students arose after Harvard announced that it would create a social choice fund in December. Resulting from the successful campaign for a social choice fund organized by the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, this announcement is a positive affirmation that the University is willing to support the student body’s voiced desire to move towards more socially responsible investment practices. The Crimson has consistently expressed strong support for the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition and likewise welcomes the University’s commitment to creating a social choice fund.  We urge the University to ensure that the new social choice fund is sustainable and to work towards expanding the fund in the future.
Although the University only announced the formation of the social choice fund this past December, the move toward responsible investing at Harvard has been long in the making. In 1972, Harvard President Derek C. Bok created the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility in response to widespread campaigns to divest from Apartheid South Africa.  These two committees work in tandem to evaluate shareholder resolutions on the social responsibility of Harvard’s investments.  Yet it was only this past year under the tutelage of the Responsible Investment at Harvard campaign that students were able to convince these committees to support the creation of a separate social choice fund.  This decision came about largely because of the strong show of student support for the fund, demonstrated through more than $11,000 of donations made to the Fair Harvard Fund, organized by the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, and the student body’s overwhelming support for the social choice fund in this past fall’s Undergraduate Council election.
All parties involved are enthusiastic about the University’s decision to establish a social choice fund that will begin accepting contributions in July. However, the wariness of some of the Coalition’s members to fully uphold the University’s approach to the social choice fund may be warranted. The University has stipulated that 20 percent of the fund’s initial value will be allocated to fund student financial aid. Although this is a certainly an admirable gesture, the removal of such a large percentage of the fund annually might stymie its growth. Furthermore, the Harvard Management Company intends to have a separate mutual fund manage the money in the fund, preventing the HMC from gaining valuable experience operating the normal endowment and the social choice fund side by side. Furthermore, Responsible Investment at Harvard has voiced concerns over the transparency of the investments.
To address these concerns, students should remain actively involved in the social choice fund and urge the University to administer the fund responsibly and publicize the fund to alumni and the greater Harvard community in order to ensure its future growth. The students who rallied for divestment from Apartheid decades ago and from oil companies in Darfur in 2005 would be proud to be a part of this historical moment. Now it is our job to continue to provide the necessary support and oversight for the fledgling fund in the coming years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a long, cold December bus ride to Logan airport, I thought about home. I thought about Harvard. And I thought about what the difference was.
It was the beginning of winter break, and I was heading back through the rainy Boston air to the place I grew up in, near Los Angeles, where the only regular precipitation comes from child actors who cry over the absence of FIJI water in their trailers (these are called “El Spoiled Niño” storms or “Temperature Tantrums”). In Southern California, winter is summer, fall is summer, spring is summer, and Summer is the name of every bikini-clad girl tanning along the shoreline. After a semester of being introduced to new concepts like “snow,” “sweaters,” and “visible breath,” I couldn’t wait to get back.
I flew in late, drove for a while, and slept on my old bed. Once I awoke, I rushed to the window in hopes that a beautiful floating ball of hot plasma would greet me with its warmth once again. I closed my eyes, threw open the shades, and looked out. Darkness. Clouds. Rain. Misery.
The sight warmed my heart.
There’s something different about Southern California rain—it’s comforting. In my suburban hometown of Thousand Oaks, it trickles over the hills and valleys. They are covered in light shadows, and the streets become paved in the gritty shine of wetness. The air grows cool and smells fresh and sweet as people fill it with ridiculous complaints about how they have to rewash their SUVs because of the rain. On the other hand, rain at Harvard is an annoying normality. It just makes the elegance of the Yard and Square seem kind of dirty.
Small things about a community, like the rain, are different at Harvard than at other places. And first-year students like myself, many traveling home for the first time this past month since leaving for college, reflect on those differences and on whether Harvard can be considered a second home.  There are many comparisons, but the most important aspect of a community (or home) is the people. I feel at home with Southern Californians. For the most part, they are all warm, friendly and, like I said before, named Summer, which is a very pretty name for both genders. But the people at Harvard, each coming from such different backgrounds geographically, ethnically, academically, racially or otherwise, are harder to characterize. And as if that wasn’t tricky enough, each has also stood out as students and citizens from their backgrounds; there aren’t any “stock characters” defined by their community. In that sense, Cambridge becomes a place to go for people who don’t quite fit in—a home for the homeless—which is kind of what it already was.
So, Harvard students go into freshman year sharing just a few qualities—intellectual curiosity, a motivation to succeed, and what seems like a fetish-level fascination for boat shoes. But they don’t share much else.  Unlike the homes they come from, not everyone has grown up together in similar circumstances. Student groups are often at odds with one another. Conversations can get awkward fast. Regional words like “hella” and “wicked” quickly become weird and then faux pas. Some freshman rooming groups fit together like peas in a missile pod, choosing never to talk to one another. Overall, not much meshes together very well.
The result can sometimes feel like Harvard is a collection rather than a community—an active museum where the students, rare finds in themselves, all share the same space (most of which does look like museum space) while doing their own activities and following their own pursuits. It often seems like everyone is too busy being talented or achieving something to go for a day trip to Boston or play a game of touch football. And that disjointedness doesn’t always feel too homey.
But that disjointedness is actually what can make it homey. The fact that not everyone fits together nicely defines Harvard as a community. One reason the admissions office tries to create a diverse class is because research shows students learn better in diverse communities. And that’s because we learn from the ways in which we don’t fit together, and those awkward connections can lead to unlikely, deep, and funny interactions between friends who, against all odds, were brought together by the College. Everyone and every day is different. Just like the rain in Southern California, it’s a nice surprise—a homey one.
As I moved back into the dorm this past week for the coming semester, I looked out the window. Darkness. Clouds. Snow. Misery. Students were plopping back on campus as the snow accumulated at their feet. I turned back inside. Some of my entryway-mates—one a New York dancer and rower, one a flautist, one a pundit, one an aspiring science writer, and the list goes on—were having a long, tantalizing conversation about nothing. I looked back through the window at the freezing rain with a confused look on my face. My friend said, “That’s called a ‘flurry,’ Dash.” Another new word. I smiled.
Harvard is many things. For some it’s a prestigious, multicultural, intellectual, and self-absorbed institution for new and old elites. For others it’s just another liberal arts college. But for me, and I’m sure for many other freshman and upperclassmen coming back for another semester, it’s a second, rainy home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a world that has witnessed the rise of digital interfaces, online avatars, and one-click transactions, a basically conservative reaction has become fashionable in circles both left and right: A creeping depersonalization is killing everything we hold dear. As a fundamental optimist about the future, it’s my tendency not to put much stock in such arguments. Albeit some changes in platform, the social content of our lives would still be eminently familiar to our great-grandparents: We build friendships, go to work, pair off, and make homes. Same as it ever was.
This said, a few days ago, my faith in online platforms as seamless extensions of humanity was faced with a crisis of tangled wires and mislabeled files. Recoil if you must, but like many of my peers, I’m in the midst of the career recruiting season and engaged in the online dating world. Both pursuits of a better life require abstraction into profiles, reduction to essential tidbits, and careful curation of flattering perspectives.
The overlap is surprisingly non-trivial. Both company applications and OKCupid ask you to put your qualifications in terms of drop-down categories; CVs and selfies (whose form, we’re told, says as much as their content) need to be uploaded, lest no one care how eager you are to get onboard. Contra tech messianism, we’re still miles away from pure representation in the digital space.
And when the back-to-school maelstrom of internship deadlines and evenings yet to be planned takes to portals and profiles, accidents happen and the seams come into stark relief. I wish I had a story to tell about an unlucky Wellesley woman who opened her inbox only to find a cover letter addressed to some dynamic, problem-solving would-be lover named Oliver Wyman. Mine is in fact worse.
I turned on my phone to an anxious message: so-and-so from the On-Campus Interview program, saying that there had been a problem with my transcript, to call back immediately. Remembering that in a spell of digital haste, I had uploaded an image file of my transcript rather than the prescribed scan, I called back without trepidation, acknowledging at first breath that I knew what the problem was, and was ready to fix it.
“So it was an accident?” the career services guru led me.
“No. I was in a hurry, and the image file was all I had,” I answered, worried that I’d crossed some inviolable law of transcript-sharing.
“Are you sure? Because it was a picture of a girl…on a runway.”
Unwilling to explain to a stranger that I’d pulled a photo of an online date prospect to show to my roommates, I feigned confusion and promised to get to a computer immediately. Though my company-portal applications appeared unharmed, she explained that I had saved the very unsuitable image as “Current Transcript” on my Harvard careers page. Damage control was underway, but two firms had already downloaded the shapely runway girl, whose knowing pout gave no evidence of my coursework in Arabic or my above-average GPA.
I do not mean to blame the mishap entirely on an overwired world: I elected to enroll with both OCI and OKC, I should have double-checked my document uploads, and I probably could have gone without downloading the glamour shot of a woman I’ve never met. In any case, it is hard to imagine such indiscretion in a world before profiles: No one in his right mind would attach an 8 by 11½ of a prospective mate to a physical resume, blurt out his scores and qualifications on a first date, or anything of a similarly catastrophic sort. We would—speaking generously—call such a type antisocial.
Moral considerations set completely aside, situations like these are to be expected when communication is unmoored from its human producers and abstracted by machines much better suited to huge numbers than to simple decency. The OCI portal has no good way of tailoring searches to personality; high scores on OKC’s numerical matching system prove to be of no avail in the absence of good biochemistry. Limited though our scope may be, evolution’s brain-and-behavior legacy rarely fails us in distinguishing right from not-quite in determining what to share with would-be employers versus would-be mates.
The solution, however, is not to abandon our tools. Career portals and dating sites flourish precisely because they work—not by replacing human intuition and pattern recognition, but by broadening our horizons and suggesting opportunities that might have been lost in the welter of our modern minds. We must push the limits of our nature anew: Just as the first Sumerian reed scribes learned to proofread, digital multitaskers will have to become organized to a fault and adept at sensing when something is “off” about their digital interactions.
And if the story of my very comely transcript is any indicator, failure to evolve will not be without consequence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
I write in response to the letter of complaint from Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 about the University’s handling of the recent cheating scandal.
Stemberg’s letter begins with the blunt statement that many of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors are “not qualified to teach undergraduates.” Though I lack specific knowledge of the workings of Harvard appointments, I am not convinced by a statement that fails to articulate in what respect these professors are unqualified.
Stemberg then calls the phrasing of the collaboration policy into question: “One was told that on this particular take home exam, one could not collaborate with professors, teaching fellows ‘and others.’ One would suppose this meant students. If the message was so clearly expressed, why did some of the teaching fellows go over the exam in open session, a per se violation of the professor’s seeming intent? If they did not get the message, could one expect the students to understand it?”
The exact phrasing of the policy read: “students may not discuss the exam with others – this includes resident tutors, writing centers, etc.” Yes, “others” includes students as well. The suggestion that what a teaching fellow cannot understand must be difficult for students to understand is offensive to those of us enjoying the benefits of literacy.
It is unfortunate that a teaching fellow would violate the policy, yet it does not license further academically dishonest behavior.
As the letter progresses, Stemberg distinguishes between students who were “literally cutting and pasting their answers” and students who were punished for using notes “derived in the collaborative atmosphere the class encouraged.” Whereas Stemberg seems only to find it appropriate to punish the former group, the appropriateness of punishing the second group depends on when the collaborative atmosphere existed, that is, whether it existed during the take-home exam.
The letter ends with the outrageous claim that, in Stemberg’s words, the administration “let off only those students who lied and said others had copied from them.” The claim is understandable given that the letter is grounded in a few personal accounts. From knowing students involved in the cheating scandal, I would want to assert that there were students found innocent without lying. Yet I cannot credibly assert that relying only on my partial understanding of the situation. Similarly, Stemberg’s letter loses credibility for its lack of proper access to crucial information, making his blanket statements about right and wrong forms of cheating all the more inappropriate.
While only admitting the wrongfulness of academic dishonesty in passing, Stemberg calls the FAS faculty’s competence into question without grounding and makes an effort to undermine the clarity of the collaboration policy. It is an unfair move to attempt to shift the responsibility away from those who were found, through what Stemberg himself calls “a seemingly endless judicial process,” to have engaged in academically dishonest behavior, to University staff who were offered no such arbitration.

This is the first installment in a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from the Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinion on thought-provoking issues. 
If you would like to submit an opinion for this week's Roundtable topic "Should women serve in combat roles in the military?", please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday 6th February at 6pm.
 Before It’s Too Late
It is unfortunate that the question of whether to negotiate with designated terrorists often comes up at moments of crisis, when governments are at their lowest point of leverage. This is to say, governments are much worse-poised to negotiate with elements they consider to be terrorists when the threat of violence is immediate than during times of relative calm, when state power and intelligence far outstrips the means of small terror cells and networks.
Although the wanton slaughters at the Tigantourine gas facility, Dubrovka Theater, and Lod Airport should not be minimized, it was clear in utilitarian terms to the Algerian, Russian, and Israeli governments during these moments of crisis that capitulating to terrorist demands would have been harmful to state interests and encouraged would-be terrorists lying in the woodwork. In 2011, contrary to this principle, Binyamin Netanyahu approved the release of 1,027 prisoners (responsible for the deaths of 569 Israeli civilians) to meet the demands of Hamas in order to secure the release of the kidnapped Corporal Gilad Shalit. As a consequence of the terrorists’ remarkable achievement, Palestinian moderates with less of a flair for drama and violent threats have come to seem impotent, given their inability to extract concessions without resorting to terror. Remarkably, the Israeli government continues to profess that it refuses to negotiate with terrorists—a line that only seems to hold when nothing is acutely wrong. This approach is the complete inverse of what reason would dictate. Operating on the assumption that terrorists are interest-driven creatures, governments ought to keep lines of communication open with anti-state extremists during quiet times—when the state can shape the terms of engagement—and respond to outbursts and standoffs with targeted force. This would deliver the message that acts of violence against civilians do not pay.

Dramatic Act, Quiet Coda
As a rule, governments should not negotiate with terrorists. That is the consensus of the global community because it is understood that declaring this policy may deter acts of terror. The logic is simple: If aspiring terrorists expect that their demands will not be considered, they will not waste their resources taking hostages. But proving its efficacy requires knowing a counterfactual.  Non-negotiation with terrorists is the most reasonable declarative stance on an issue in which no stance can be definitely validated. Nothing about the events in Algeria should call this into question.
Nevertheless, the events in Algeria raise troubling questions on which, unlike negotiation with terrorists, there is no settled, reasoned consensus.
Consider, for example, that the situation in Mali escalated because the Tuareg revolt was coopted by an AQIM splinter group, Ansar Dine. An ethnic independence movement became an ideological terrorist campaign. That is what happened here, but it just as often appears elsewhere as a false narrative employed by repressive regimes to justify their refusal to grant rights and autonomy to minority groups.  Examine how China brands the Uighurs—a Muslim community seeking greater autonomy—as it rejects their aspirations: It identifies them with Islamic terrorism. When nations do not want to negotiate with minorities, they simply claim that they are refusing to negotiate with terrorists.
Above all, though, I suspect that the legacy of this crisis will be that it spurred the US to cement and expand its drone program, furthering its disturbing unilateral redefinition of norms about when, where, and why people can be killed. Ironically, the terrorists responsible for the Algeria crisis should not expect that they have won a voice through their vocal acts. Instead, they should expect to hear a haunting whir far overhead, and then, if only for a moment, a terrible crash: a sentence, issued from a bench unseen and unexplained, to the eternal silence of death.

One Size Does Not Fit All
In his address to the Global Economic Forum in Davos last week, Algerian Foreign Minister, Mourad Medelci, admitted Algeria “made mistakes” in handling the hostage crisis at the BP gas plant but defended his government’s decision to launch a military operation rather than negotiate with the terrorists. The statement was issued no doubt in response to the criticism from the international community of Algeria’s decision to use military force rather than negotiation, which compromised the lives of dozens of foreign nationals.
Although it is clear that the Algerian government should have kept other stakeholders up to speed on its decided course of action, it is ridiculous and rather paternalistic to think that Western governments can teach the Algerian government how to deal with a terrorist situation. Medelci’s government has been combating terrorism and fundamentalist pan-Islamist groups for years, and has likely developed a substantially more comprehensive grasp of the risks of giving into terrorism than officials sitting in Tokyo, Oslo, or Bucharest have. Just as these foreign governments are right to prioritize the lives of their nationals, Algeria was right to look at the big picture and consider the long-term implications of negotiations in the cost benefit analysis of the situation. From a purely strategic point of view, negotiating publicly with terrorists is suicide. In the psychological game of poker that exists between terrorists and governments, negotiating is equivalent to revealing your hand in the middle of a bluff: It demonstrates susceptibility to pressure and sends out a message that, for the terrorists, staying in the game might just pay off. Additionally, it undercuts moderate forms of protest, empowers violence and invites a recurrence of actions. For Algeria, this could mean an ensuing blitz of attacks that would cost many more lives, drive away business and deal the already struggling country a devastating blow.
Now, can we deduce a general policy of non-negotiation with terrorists from this incident? I tend to think the answer is probably not. Despite grand declarations, in practice, most democratic governments—even the U.S. and Israel, both known for their uncompromising stance on the matter—negotiate with terrorists. An argument could be made for Israel, a country which has perhaps more experience than any other with terrorism, negotiating with Hamas. Sometimes a government might make a judgment call that the benefits of negotiating with terrorists surpass the costs. Israel’s decision to exchange 1,000 Palestinian prisoners with blood on their hands for the 1 abducted soldier Gilad Shalit was heavily criticized by Jewish communities worldwide as offering a reward to terrorism. Yet, Israel made a choice to go through with the deal so that every Israeli mother who sends her son or daughter into battle will know that in the event something terrible happens—a child falling captive, for example, the government will do all in its power to amend the situation.
What becomes clear is that the question of negotiating with terrorists is not a matter of principal but rather a matter of strategy. Despite a natural inclination for rules and generalizations, governments would be wise to acknowledge the fact that in these complex situations one size simply does not fit all.

Negotiating with Terrorists: Neither Rare Nor Bad Idea
Recent events in Algeria indicate that such crises (as also exemplified by the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis) should be handled with more prudence, both in the negotiation and, if necessary, military responses. I do believe governments should be open to negotiations with terrorist groups. This is not an atypical suggestion, however: governments already negotiate with terrorist organizations. The Guardian reports that, since 2008, Western governments have paid ransoms totaling between $40 and $65 million to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other factions for the release of nationals kept hostage. Furthermore, the French government attempted (unsuccessfully) to negotiate the release of intelligence agent Denis Allex from Al-Shabab for several years before attempting to rescue him (unsuccessfully) by force. An additional example can be seen by Israel’s occasional collaboration with Hamas—which both Tel Aviv and Washington define as a terrorist group—both in enforcing truces in Gaza and in an important prisoner exchange. Even the United States negotiated with the Taliban over a possible settlement of the Afghan situation, and the British and Spanish governments engaged the Irish Republican Army and Basque movements to resolve their own conflicts. This practice should not necessarily be undertaken in every occasion, nor is it always guaranteed success. However, automatically excluding the opportunity of a peaceful settlement to hostage or conflict situations leaves force—with the dangers it entails—as the only viable alternative. Governments should be scrupulous in examining every policy option before making a decision; this is a responsibility they owe both to affected citizens as well as to the soldiers who may be asked to intervene. One may be surprised to discover that there often is sufficient ground for an agreement, and establishing some sort of working relationship today may enable building some degree of reciprocal trust and help defuse worse situations tomorrow.

Politics is the Art of the Possible
On December 24 1999, a group of terrorists allegedly belonging to the Kashmir-based Harkat-ul-Mujahideen hijacked an Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Delhi. They flew the plane via Lahore and Dubai to Kandahar, where the Taliban, not quite yet international pariahs, offered to negotiate between the hijackers and the Indian government. Nearly 200 lives—passengers and crew—were at stake. India’s foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, secured the passengers’ release, but only by agreeing to the hijackers’ demands. Three prominent HUM allies, imprisoned by India for terrorism, were released.
Those three men were among the world’s most dangerous terrorists—including Ahmed Sheikh, who would go on to murder Daniel Pearl. India freed her citizens, but only at the cost of more terrorism. This incident is often seen in India as a pathetic capitulation, and as support for the popular maxim that one should never negotiate with terrorists. It can be contrasted with Operation Entebbe, the 1975 raid in which Israeli special forces stormed a Ugandan airport and rescued 102 out of 106 hostages being held by Palestinian hijackers.
But these two cases do not show that the right approach is to kill or capture terrorists, rather than negotiate with them. They prove, rather, Bismarck’s famous assertion that politics is the art of the possible. The Indian government could not have allowed 192 hostages to be killed. Alternatives to negotiation were considered and rejected as impractical. Operation Entebbe shows that, where possible, counterterrorism should come first, but “never negotiate with terrorists” is simply unsustainable as an inflexible rule of policy. Negotiating with terrorists must, at times, be resorted to where all other policies to prevent the loss of innocent life have failed or cannot be employed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 4, 2013, at 4:37 a.m.
The Harvard Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility conducted two meetings with student groups on Friday to discuss socially responsible investing.
One meeting focused on the details of a social choice fund, whose creation was announced in December.
The second centered on student demands for the University to divest from fossil fuel companies. Last week, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email that, while Harvard leaders are listening to student concerns, “the University operates with a strong presumption against divestment.”
The CCSR consists of four members from the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and helps to determine the University’s stance on matters related to social responsibility.
Three members of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition met with CCSR members Robert D. Reischauer ’63 and Laurence S. Bacow to push for more details about Harvard’s social choice fund, which is scheduled to be established July 1. An officer from the Harvard Management Company and an administrator from the Office of Alumni Affairs and Development were also in attendance.
Sam F. Wohns ’14, who attended the social choice fund meeting as the Coalition’s alumni coordinator, said he was pleased that the meeting, which went over its allotted 45 minutes, was a “very productive” conversation. According to Wohns, the CCSR members said that the Corporation will disclose which mutual funds will be used for the social choice fund. The CCSR will also seek input from groups, such as the Coalition and the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, which includes four students, four faculty members, and four alumni who advises the CCSR.
“We were very happy with the agreements that we reached on those two issues,” Wohns said.
Still, Wohns said that he and other student activists are concerned about the sustainability of the fund and hopes that Harvard will avoid pitfalls that have doomed similar funds at other schools.
“We’ve learned from other schools that unless the University plays an active role...the social choice fund tends to disappear over time,” he said. “We are determined for that not to happen here.”
Wohns cited the University’s announcement that 20 percent of the fund’s initial value will be paid out annually for student financial aid as a danger to the fund’s potential for growth. According to Wohns, the Coalition has suggested supporting the fund with money from the University’s endowment and stressed that robust advertisement of the fund to donors will be crucial for its success.
“We’ll need to hear a stronger commitment to the fund launch and particularly the fund’s advertisement to alumni donors,” Wohns said. The Coalition is still deciding whether or not to transfer the Fair Harvard Fund—approximately $11,000 that the group has collected to show support for socially responsible investing—to the social choice fund.
Regardless of the fund’s details, Wohns said it is still merely a “first step,” and that he and other socially responsible investment supporters want to see Harvard’s entire $30 billion endowment invested responsibly.
“We see the social fund as a way for the University to experiment with investment policies that it can ultimately apply to the rest of Harvard’s endowment,” he said.
According to Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14, who attended both CCSR meetings with UC Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14, the members of the Corporation will meet on Monday to discuss the process of selecting mutual funds to use for the social choice fund.
“I think we made a huge amount of progress,” Raghuveer said.
Before the social choice fund meeting, three members of Divest Harvard, an organization that is asking Harvard to divest its $30 billion endowment from the top 200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies, gave a presentation outlining the importance of divestment to the CCSR’s Reischauer and committee chair Nannerl O. Keohane.
“We were really excited to see the members recognizing how absolutely dire it is that we start addressing climate change,” said Hannah M. Borowsky ’15, a co-coordinator for Divest Harvard. “They weren’t convinced that divestment was the best option, but they were open for discussion.”
According to Borowsky, who is also a Crimson editorial editor, the students told the CCSR members that fossil fuel investment is “morally impermissible” because of its contribution to climate change.“
Overall the atmosphere was very good and productive,” said Ben Franta, a graduate student and co-coordinator for Divest Harvard.
However, Franta continued, many questions remain, such as determining exactly how the University will  approach divestment if administrators agree to the students’ demands.
Borowsky said Divest Harvard expects to hear back from the Corporation in the next two weeks after Reischauer and Keohane discuss divestment with the rest of the committee.
Galvin wrote in an email on Sunday that the CCSR viewed both meetings as productive and that “there will be further communication around these issues over the course of the semester.”

There has been a deviation in Harvard’s most popular course.
This spring, 642 students have enrolled in Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics,” making it Harvard’s biggest course for the first time in recent memory, according to course enrollment data on the website of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office.
Stat 104 narrowly beat Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” a perennial contender for the title of top-enrolled course of the semester. Ec 10, economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s introductory economics course, drew an enrollment of 627.
This is the first time that Stat 104 has trumped Ec 10, which was formerly titled Social Analysis 10, since the first semester of course enrollment data available online dating back to the fall of 1999. That fall, 817 students took Ec 10, while only 34 took Stat 104.
Statistics lecturer Michael I. Parzen, instructor of Stat 104, attributed the course’s growth to quality teaching and a popular subject matter.
“I think the enrollments reflect the hard work of our teaching staff, our attempt to make the course as organized as possible, and the increasing visibility of statistics in the private sector,” Parzen wrote in an email. He added that the course’s teaching staff is considering greater use of technology in class to handle the increased enrollment numbers.
Pre-Term Planning predictions significantly underestimated the turnout for Stat 104. An additional 238 students signed up for the course than projected by Pre-Term Planning. The course enrollment planning tool was relatively accurate for Ec 10, overestimating actual enrollment by just 18 students.
Sociology 190: “Life and Death in the US: Medicine and Disease in Social Context” also saw a significant increase in enrollment this spring. The 408 students who signed up for the course surpass both the Pre-Term Planning prediction of 172 and last spring’s enrollment of 265.
In an email, the course’s instructor, sociology professor Nicholas A. Christakis, noted that Sociology 190 has experienced a trend of growing enrollment since he first began teaching it seven years ago.
But he attributed this year’s dramatic jump in enrollment to the fact that this is the last year he is offering the course at Harvard. Christakis, who is also the Co-House Master of Pforzheimer, will leave Harvard for Yale this summer.
To accommodate the increased number of students, Christakis wrote that he is looking for a new location for the class, which last week was held in Science Center C.
Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II” and Engineering Sciences 50: “Introduction to Electrical Engineering” also registered unusually high enrollment. Engineering Sciences 50 went from 71 students last spring to 173 this semester, a 144 percent increase, while Computer Science 51 jumped from an enrollment of 192 last spring to 240 this semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s endowment returns beat the national average for American colleges and universities during the 2012 fiscal year, according to a study released Friday by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and the Commonfund Institute.
Harvard’s returns dropped .05 percent during the last fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 2012, but were still higher than the nationwide average. The endowments of 831 colleges and universities, including Harvard, experienced average returns of -.3 percent in the 2012 fiscal year, according to the study.
That figure represents a significant decrease from the 2011 fiscal year when educational endowments saw returns of 19.2 percent. That year, Harvard’s endowment grew by 21.4 percent.
“While investment performance over the last twelve months was well below long-term averages, we nevertheless found good investment opportunities through both internal and external management that we believe will sow the seeds for future growth,” Harvard Management Company President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said in a press release when Harvard released its 2012 endowment figures.
Although Harvard’s losses in 2012 beat the national average, they were less consistent with the average returns on larger endowments. According to the study, schools with endowments valuing $1 billion or more experienced average returns of .8 percent.
In terms of total market value, which takes into account investment returns along with deposits and withdrawals, Harvard’s endowment dropped 4.1 percent but still remained by far the largest in the world at $30.7 billion. Yale University’s endowment, which at $19.3 billion is the second largest in the country, held steady in the 2012 fiscal year with a market value loss of only .1 percent.
Harvard’s below-average returns last year can be explained in part by the particularly poor performance of international equities, in which Harvard heavily invests. Foreign investments experienced an 11.8 percent loss, according to the NACUBO-Commonfund study, which also broke down endowment returns by asset class.
NACUBO and the Commonfund Institute both conduct research on higher education and release a joint report on university endowments annually.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though professors may spend their weeks lecturing, meeting with students, and mentoring advisees, much of their work outside of the classroom remains a mystery to most students.
This is the issue Svetlana I. Dotsenko ’11 was seeking to solve when she created the online platfrom Project Lever soon after graduating from the College. The startup, which aims to facilitate student searches for thesis advisers and research opportunities, joins the growing movement to digitize Harvard’s archives and resources.
Although Dotsenko, who concentrated in government, said that while she had a “great” advising experience, she wanted to improve the unwieldy task of identifying a faculty adviser for students in large departments.
“We needed some kind of tool to connect undergraduates to thesis advisers,” Dotsenko said. “It’s about helping those relationships within the University.”
Dotsenko began working with Karen Kaletka, coordinator of undergraduate studies in government, after gaining support from the government department to compile a list of theses, advisers, and courses that would guide juniors through the writing process.
Ian H. Clark ’12, Project Lever’s partnerships director, said it has been a challenge to search for past thesis topics and advisors because many of Harvard’s records are physical manuscripts rather than digital archives.
“Writing a thesis is not an easy task,” Clark said. “You need an easy-to-use system to manage the start of your thesis.”
MIT became Project Lever’s first client outside of the University this January. Clark and the Project Lever team are currently reaching out to other research institutitons to expand the scope of their services. They have also been working with current undergraduate students, such as Jackson F. Cashion ’13, to determine how best to meet students’ needs in the research process.
“There are a lot things that students have to balance throughout the thesis writing process—finding grants, an adviser, and library resources to connect them with primary sources. Project Lever streamlines that process into one unified tool,” Cashion said.
The founders hope to grow Project Lever into a tool to facilitate a wide range of research.
“Eventually we hope Project Lever can be used for research in general, not just for connecting students to thesis advisers,” Clark said.Given increasing access to academic records online, Dotsenko said that perhaps Project Lever may also be used to discourage plagiarism.
“We hope to make an open platform where people can see everything else before them and be inspired to create something great,” she said.

UPDATED: February 4, 2013, at 5:37 p.m.
Venture capitalist James W. Breyer was elected to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, Harvard announced Monday. He will become the organization’s thirteenth member on July 1.
The Corporation, which is the oldest corporate body in the western hemisphere, elected Breyer to the position on Sunday with approval from the Board of Overseers—Harvard’s other governing board.
The addition of Breyer, a managing partner at Accel Partners who graduated from Harvard Business School in 1987, will mark the completion of the Harvard Corporation’s expansion from 7 to 13 members—a piece of the governance reforms that were adopted in 2010 in an effort to increase the transparency and accountability of the group, while also making it more similar in structure to the governance bodies of other universities. In addition to expanding the size of the Corporation for the first time in its more than 300-year history, the reforms imposed six-year term limits on members and created several new subcommittees.
“I’m honored by this opportunity to serve a university that blends tradition in such meaningful, powerful ways,” Breyer said in a press release. “I’m excited at the prospect of working with [University President Drew G. Faust] and my future Corporation colleagues to help cultivate the spirit of curiosity and aspiration that, for me, defines Harvard.”
Breyer was formerly the chairman of the National Venture Capital Association and is currently a director at Dell, Inc. He has served on the boards of News Corporation, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Marvel Entertainment, and several other companies.
Breyer is a trustee of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and owns a minority share of the Boston Celtics. Forbes magazine estimates his net worth at $1.1 billion as of March 2012.
Breyer is also active at Harvard, serving as a member of Harvard’s Global Advisory Council and as chair of the Business School’s California Research Center. According to the press release, he “informally advised” the University on edX, a virtual learning initiative launched by Harvard and MIT last year.
Faust and the Corporation’s senior fellow Robert D. Reischauer ’63 praised Breyer for his innovative and entrepreneurial skills in the press release.
“Jim Breyer is one of his generation’s most creative and admired venture capitalists,” they said. “Beyond his professional pursuits, he has a deep commitment to the liberal arts, an imaginative perspective on the potential of technology to enhance education, and strong interests in modern and contemporary art, music, film, and photography. We very much look forward to welcoming him to the Corporation.”

CORRECTION: Feb. 4, 2013
An ealier version of this article incorrectly stated the size of the Harvard Corporation prior to its expansion in the 2010 governance reforms. In fact, the Corporation had previously consisted of seven members, not nine.

UPDATED: February 5, 2013, at 1:36 a.m.
Emmy Award-winning actor Kiefer Sutherland has been named the recipient of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2013 Man of the Year Award.
Sutherland has won numerous awards for his portrayal of Jack Bauer in the Fox television series “24,” including the Golden Globe for Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2002 and the Emmy Award in 2006 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.
“Kiefer is a gifted performer, who has made meaningful contributions to television, film, and theater,” said Hasty Pudding Theatricals’s press and publicity manager Tyler B. Faux ’13.
The president of the the Hasty Pudding Theatricals could not be reached for comment.
Sutherland, born in London, was raised in Canada. Although best known for his role on the action drama “24”—which became the longest-running spy thriller after airing from 2001 to 2010—he has also appeared in the films “A Few Good Men” and “Phone Booth.” He is currently starring in the Fox drama “Touch,” whose second season premiere falls on the same evening as the Man of the Year celebrations later this week.
Sutherland will be honored Friday, Feb. 8 in Farkas Hall by being roasted by Pudding producers Tyler R. Lewis ’14 and Peter M. Riley ’14. He will also be presented with the traditional gold Pudding Pot.
“We’re so excited to roast him and present him with his pudding pot,” Lewis wrote in an email. “I’m counting down the hours.”
After the roast, the Pudding will premiere their 165th production, “There’s Something About Maui.”
Sutherland joins a host of actors who have been named Man of the Year since the award was first presented in 1967, including Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake, James Franco, Robert Downey Jr., Robert Redford, and Bob Hope.
French actress Marion Cotillard was honored as 2013 Woman of the Year on Jan. 31 with a parade through Harvard Square and a roast of her own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team sure didn’t look like it belonged in the hall of fame in its first game on Friday against Loyola. But after two consecutive losses—one against the Ramblers and another the week before against No. 6 Penn State—the Crimson bounced back to finish its weekend victorious.
The team traveled across the state to Springfield, Mass. to take on Loyola (6-5) and Juniata (4-2) in the Hall of Fame Morgan Classic, hosted by Springfield College. Harvard (5-2, 1-1 EIVA) split its matches on the weekend, as the Crimson downed the Eagles in the consolation match, 3-1, after the Ramblers bested Harvard in the same number of sets.
“I thought that we played pretty well this weekend, but we definitely could have played a lot better,” said freshman outside hitter Branden Clemens. “We didn’t have our best game against Loyola. We could have served better and played better overall defense. I just thought that we were playing kind of sloppy compared to how we played last week up against Penn State.”
In the loss against the Nittany Lions last week, the Crimson suffered another setback—the loss of DJ White, the team’s leader in points per set, to an injury that will bench the sophomore outside hitter for a couple of weeks. White’s injury is something that Clemens acknowledges as a gap that the team is attempting to fill.
“It’s been very different and challenging because DJ’s a leader on the court and he’s a really great player,” Clemens said. “It’s been a transitioning period because we’re trying to get used to not having him on the court. I switched over to L1 and [junior outside hitter] Mike [Owen] stepped in as L2. Mike’s been playing really great, and I think overall we’ve been trying to keep ourselves pumped and stay focused, and I think everyone’s stepped up to try to be more of a leader and pull more weight because of losing DJ.”
HARVARD 3, JUNIATA 1
After losing three straight sets to Loyola the night before, the Crimson wavered in the consolation game before ultimately coming out victorious.
Harvard capitalized on errors by the Eagles and only trailed once in the first set, winning it 25-16. But it looked as though the Crimson had faltered as Juniata built a seven-point lead in the second, 20-13, and never looked back, taking the set, 25-22.
“I think at that point it was all mental,” said junior outside hitter Nick Madden. “It was us on our side of the net, making mistakes and errors, and we knew that if we cleaned up our serving and cleaned up our hitting errors, we’d roll over them, and that’s what we did.”
Harvard led for the majority of the final two sets before winning them in decisive fashion, 25-17 and 25-13.
Clemens tallied 19 kills on the night, a career-high for the rookie, while Madden registered a team-high 20. The team showed off its defense as well, as junior libero Chris Gibbons recorded 13 digs en route to holding Juniata to a 0.075 hitting percentage.
LOYOLA 3, HARVARD 1
The Crimson began its trip west with a turn down south as the team lost three sets after winning the first one.
“I think overall, we didn’t play as well as we played during the first set,” Clemens said. “Our passing wasn’t as good, and in our attacking, we were making more errors. Their playing beefed up a lot, too, so it was kind of switched—they weren’t playing as well in the first set when we were playing well, and then after the first set, we weren’t playing as well and they stepped it up.”
Harvard never trailed in the first set and looked dominant as it won, 25-16. But the tables turned on the Crimson in the next three sets as the team never managed to take a lead in the second half of any of the final sets, losing them, 18-25, 21-25, and 18-25.
After losing a tough-fought match to a top-ranked team the week before, 3-2, Madden noted the disappointment of falling to a team that he thought Harvard was capable of beating.
“Juniata for sure was not as good as Penn State, and I would also say that Loyola wasn’t as good as Penn State,” Madden said. “I feel like we played Penn State a lot harder—if we had played at the level that we had played with against Penn State, we would have won both games this weekend.”
Clemens led the team in offense with 15 kills while Gibbons spearheaded the defensive effort with six digs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team swept its opening matches Saturday, defeating three visitors at Blodgett Pool. The Crimson defeated Iona, 15-13, and Villanova, 18-6, before closing out the day with a 10-7 win over CAMO.
Nine different Harvard players scored over the course of the day. Freshmen Yoshi Andersen and Charlotte Hendrix each had multiple hat tricks in their collegiate debuts.
“I was very excited with the way we’ve started off,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I think we did a lot of good things. Defensively, we really moved today; we locked it down when we needed to.”
HARVARD 12, CAMO 8
The Crimson took a commanding early lead and held on for its third win in eight hours as Harvard defeated CAMO, a Montreal-based junior national team, 12-8. Andersen and co-captain Aisha Price both recorded hat tricks.
The Crimson jumped out to a 6-0 lead less than three minutes into the second quarter as Andersen and co-captain Elise Molnar found the net multiple times. Junior Shayna Price and freshman Rachel Lobato also contributed to the early run.
But a scrappy CAMO team challenged Harvard in spurts. The club closed out the second quarter with a 4-1 run.
“[CAMO is] an international team, and it’s a different style,” Minnis said. “They’re a very physical team, and that’s not something you see all the time. They make you work for everything.”
The Crimson controlled the opening of the third period as Andersen completed the hat trick and Aisha Price contributed two close-range floaters to put Harvard up, 10-4. But CAMO responded with another strong back-half, ending the quarter on a 3-0 run to cut the Crimson’s lead to three.
Harvard’s final goal with just over a minute left in the final frame put the game out of reach. Aisha Price zipped a close shot from the right wing for her fourth goal of the evening.
“I thought it was pretty inspiring that we were able to pull it together for three games,” Andersen said. “It just shows how dedicated everybody was to preseason.”
HARVARD 18, VILLANOVA 6
Harvard surged to an 11-0 lead in its best start of the day as the Crimson cruised to beat the Wildcats, 18-6. Aisha Price led all scorers with five strikes while Hendrix and sophomore Kalina Grabb were close behind with four and three goals, respectively.
Andersen struck first for the Crimson just over two minutes into the first quarter. Harvard added another five markers in the opening frame, including two from Grabb.
The Crimson tallied five more unanswered goals in the second period before Villanova found its first. In the third, Villanova outscored Harvard, 2-1, but the Crimson controlled the last quarter, 6-3, to ride to a 12-goal win. Minnis felt that Harvard’s next meeting with Villanova in two weeks will not be as comfortable.
“We only have one last opportunity to play at home, so I think we’re playing with a lot more energy because this was one of the last opportunities we’d be able to play here in Blodgett,” Minnis said. “I don’t think that we can determine anything from what happened in the Villanova game because of the way we were jacked up to play, and we really came out and jumped on them early.”
The Crimson will have to beat the Wildcats at Villanova on Feb. 24. Harvard’s only remaining home game is an April 3 contest against Brown.
HARVARD 15, IONA 13
Harvard led from start to finish in a tight home opener to defeat the Gaels, 15-13. Junior Shayna Price recorded a day-high six goals while Andersen and Hendrix earned their first career hat tricks.
“[Iona and Harvard] always go back-and-forth, so we’ve always had a good rivalry,” Aisha Price said. “We just wanted to buckle down and play good defense.”
The Crimson started sharp, taking a 3-0 lead just over two minutes into the game. But Iona quickly battled back on the next possession with a 6-on-5 strike. The Gaels converted on a 5-meter penalty shot less than 30 seconds later to draw within one.
“They were definitely really strong,” Andersen said. “At first, that kind of threw me off, but then everybody focused on their fundamentals and everything that we’ve been talking about in practice, and you could really see it in that game.”
Iona would remain on Harvard’s heels for the remainder of the match. Shayna Price scored all three of the Crimson’s goals in the second quarter, and Hendrix provided the Crimson’s final two tallies of the game to stave off a Gael comeback.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty years ago, Harvard captain Ted Drury ’93 accepted a 26-pound, 14-inch trophy at center ice of the old Boston Garden after a 4-2 triumph over Boston University. Few players on that 1992-93 Crimson squad may have guessed back then just how unusual such an accomplishment would become for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
The Crimson has not collected the two wins needed for a Beanpot title since 1993. In 2013, Harvard (5-14-1, 3-12 ECAC) will be lucky to escape with one. As the puck drops on the 61st Annual Beanpot today, the Crimson will attempt to halt a seven-game losing skid against defending NCAA champion Boston College (15-7-2, 9-4-1 HE).
The Harvard men’s hockey team has lost 11 of its last 12 and has not won in regulation since Nov. 16. The Crimson’s last victory came early last month in a come-from-behind, overtime thriller against No. 9/11 Boston University, which will face Northeastern in the Beanpot’s other first-round match-up.
Tonight will be Harvard’s first meeting with No. 5 Boston College since the first round of the 2010 Beanpot, in which the Eagles defeated the Crimson, 6-0. Boston College has won three straight Beanpots and four of the last five.
“They’ve got a lot of speed, a good offensive attack and a good goalie,” senior forward Luke Greiner said of Boston College.
That pretty good goalie is senior Parker Milner. Last season, Milner picked up NCAA tournament MVP honors as the backstop during a 19-game winning streak for the Eagles that spanned from the 2012 Beanpot to the NCAA final.
“He’s really calm in the net and steady back there,” senior forward Connor Morrison said of Milner. “He’s got a lot of experience.”
Boston College will also arrive at TD Garden today with plenty of firepower on the other end of the rink. Sophomore forward Johnny Gaudreau leads the Hockey East in scoring with 33 points in 21 games. Senior forwards Pat Mullane and Steven Whitney also ranking among the top-20 Division I scorers.
“[Mullane] is going to make smart decisions with the puck; he’s a great playmaker, good scorer, too, so he’s a dangerous guy,” Morrison said. “Gaudreau is a smaller guy, but he’s quick. He’s really good on his edges.”
Harvard enters Monday last in the ECAC, four points shy of second-worst Cornell. The Crimson’s record has not been much better against Hockey East teams. Before Harvard won at Boston University last month, Northeastern and UMass-Lowell had dealt the Crimson blowout losses.
Harvard will have to elevate its play on special teams tonight as the Crimson confronts some statistical mismatches. Boston College enters Monday ranked 15th and 10th in Division I on the power play and penalty kill, respectively. Harvard currently ranks 58th and 52nd in those departments. Only Maine has had less success with the man advantage.
“The good thing about [Monday] is that it’s just one game,” Morrison said. “Numbers tell a lot, but you never know how things are going to go.
“Obviously, they have a good power play; they’ve got some dangerous guys out there, and we’re going to have to pressure them. We can’t give those guys a whole lot of time. And as far as the power play, we’re going to have to simplify things and get pucks to the net and see if we can’t bang home a few lucky ones,” Morrison added.
Despite Harvard’s recent struggles, Greiner remains optimistic as he prepares to suit up for his fourth and final Beanpot. After all, it’s just two games.
“We’re excited going into it,” Greiner said. “We believe we have a shot to win it all.”
The Crimson last advanced to the Beanpot final in 2008, where Harvard faced the Eagles. Boston College led, 5-3, with ten minutes left in regulation before goals from Jon Pelle ‘08 and Mike Taylor ‘08 forced overtime. But a game-winner from Nick Petreck in the extra fram gave the Eagles the final edge.
Now, with an entirely new generation of players at the helm, the Crimson will have to push hard to compete for the gilded bean pot. Just one game stands between Harvard and the grandest stage in New England intercollegiate hockey.
“I think we need to lay it all on the line,” Greiner said. “I don’t think it’s about one key thing or technical aspect. I think it’s just about playing for the guys to the right and left of you and going out there and using what we’ve got.”

Going into this weekend’s dual meet, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had never beaten Princeton at DeNunzio Pool. In fact, no Ivy League team had ever beaten out the four-time reigning Ivy League champions at home. But the Crimson was not about to let history repeat itself.
With wins in 14 of the meet’s 19 events, Harvard became the first Ivy opponent to take down the Tigers in its home pool at this weekend’s annual HYP meet with a 106-80 win. The Crimson also handled Yale, 153-33, to stay perfect against league foes.
“For me as a senior, and for the rest of the seniors, it was a really special thing to go into their home pool and be the first team in the Ivy League to ever beat them [there],” co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “It’s something we’ve really been going for, ever since I was a freshman, but [it] eluded us.”
Harvard (8-0, 6-0 Ivy), Yale (7-2, 4-2), and Princeton (5-1, 5-1) all entered the meet with perfect league records on the line. With the win, the Crimson clinched at least a share of the conference dual-meet title.
“It’s just a really great way to finish a career,” Wurzbacher said. “But most importantly, it’s a huge step forward for this team. Where we’ve come from when I was a freshman to where we are now is just incredible. I’m fortunate and proud to be a part of Harvard men’s swimming and diving right now.”
Harvard got off the blocks fast this weekend, taking gold in eight of Saturday’s 10 events. Sophomore Chuck Katis started day one with wins in the 100 breast and 200 IM.
“I think the team energy was the best it’s ever been,” Katis said. “The collective team energy just really helped everyone accomplish what they wanted to get out of the weekend, and I think we came out a better team.”
In the final day of competition Sunday, Harvard took home the title in six more events to secure the victory.
Leading the charge for the Crimson was the standout performance of Oliver Lee. The junior teamed with classmate Jack Pretto, Katis, and sophomore Griffin Schumacher to set a school record and take home gold in the 200 medley relay with a NCAA ‘B’ standard time of 1:27.18.
Lee also picked up a win in the 100 free with a new personal best time of 43.29, the 10th best time in the country this season and the second best time in Harvard history.
Earlier in the meet, Lee broke another school record in the 50 free with a time of 19.76, picking up another NCAA ‘B’ standard time.
“Oliver was incredible,” Wurzbacher said. “He helped set the tone for the entire meet. He was aggressive and raced in an incredibly poised, powerful fashion. He was just on top of his game right from the get-go. And he set an example for the rest of the team to follow.”
The Crimson’s freshman class stepped up to the challenge in their biggest dual meet of the season. First-year Christian Carbone took home first in the 400 IM with a time of 3:49.58, the fifth fastest time in program history. Classmate Steven Kekacs set a new personal best en route to a victory in the 500 free with a time of 4:26.33.
“What was impressive was the way our underclassmen stepped up,” Wurzbacher said. “I think that speaks to the way our upperclassmen were able to set the tone. We had some amazing swims from some younger guys.”
The Crimson hopes to ride the momentum of this weekend’s success into its final dual meet of the season next weekend against Penn and into the ECAC and Ivy League championships.
“We see this as a very important step forward,” Wurzbacher said. “We have much bigger things to accomplish. Ultimately, the Ivy League championships are our goal. We are really excited about the possibilities ahead and how fast we’re going to be able to swim.”
“I think everyone’s going to come back [to practice] with some fire in their eyes,” Katis said. “The next couple of weeks are very important for us, training-wise. We have a lot of great spirit going into the next few weeks, and it sets us up well to win Ivies.”
The women’s swimming and diving team  also took care of business, downing Yale 209-89, and Princeton, 199-99.
With the win, the Crimson improved to 9-0 in dual meets and 7-0 in the Ivy League, securing a conference championship of its own. Freshman Kendall Crawford set two program-records in the 100 backstroke and 100 butterfly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a three-match win streak, the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team took on two conference opponents this weekend in No. 11 Columbia and No. 5 Cornell at the Murr Center.
The Crimson (13-1, 4-1 Ivy) handily defeated the Lions, 8-1, on Saturday afternoon. Harvard did not suffer a letdown the next day, going on to dispatch the Big Red on Sunday, 6-3.
The Crimson’s last conference game came against Princeton on Jan. 13, where Harvard fell in a tight, 5-4 decision.
“Today everyone played well, because we could have easily lost had we played the same way as we did [in our earlier loss] against Princeton,” sophomore Tyler Olson said. “I think it shows character that we came back and everyone played well and put it together.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 3
In its second conference showdown in as many days, Harvard edged out a 6-3 victory over Cornell (12-3, 3-2).
The Big Red, which had won seven of its last eight matches with the sole loss coming to No. 2 Trinity, made things tough on the Crimson. Only two matches were decided in straight sets, and they both went down as Harvard victories.
“Cornell today, especially the men, were bloody good,” said Crimson coach Mike Way, who also coaches the women’s side. “And for us to win, 6-3, it might have been 7-2 but could easily have been 5-4. Either way, some of the matches were that close.”
Junior defending national champion Ali Farag was responsible for one of those three-set victories, once again dispatching his opponent in convincing fashion. Farag has never lost in his Harvard career.
The other sweep came at the No. 8 position. Senior Jason Michas secured a convincing win, but each set was decided by three points or fewer.
None of the other Crimson wins came easily, as three of the victories came in four sets and one went the full five-set distance.
“I thought that a couple of our guys might reflect and wish they had done things a little bit differently, but overall we should be well pleased with how they played,” Way said. “They played terrific squash.”
Junior Tommy Mullaney demonstrated his resilience at the No. 6 position. After dropping the first two games, Mullaney came back to win the final three sets, each by just two points.
Fellow juniors Brandon McLaughlin and Gary Power, along with freshman Matt Roberts, all achieved comeback victories against the Big Red. Each player dropped the first set but stormed back to win the next three games.
McLaughlin especially turned the tide, as the junior stormed back to take the final two sets by scores of 11-2 and 11-4.
HARVARD 8, COLUMBIA 1
Harvard’s first match of the weekend came against Columbia (6-5, 1-2). The Crimson dropped only one match and four total sets en route to an 8-1 victory over the Lions.
Seven of the nine Harvard players to take the court won their matches without surrendering a single game.
“The match against Columbia wasn’t that hard of a match,” Olson said. “We were expecting to win, and only number one was going to be a really tough match. Ali played really well, beat him, and the rest of the matches were kind of a wash.”
Farag uncharacteristically dropped the first set playing at the No. 1 position against Ramit Tandon, whom Farag defeated last year to capture the CSA Individual National Championship.
But Farag stormed right back, taking the next three sets to secure the victory over his rival.
McLaughlin put forth a dominant performance at No. 2, winning in straight sets and taking the final two by eight-point margins.
Junior Nigel Koh suffered the sole Crimson loss on the day, falling by a score of 3-1 to Mohamed Abdel Maksoud of the Lions.
Each of the next six Harvard players dispatched their opponents in straight sets. The Crimson remained cool under pressure, as nearly half of the set wins came by three points or fewer.
Two of those closer three-game wins came at the No. 4 and No. 5 positions. In the final spot, Power defeated his opponent in straight sets, although the largest margin of victory was only four points.
Mullaney also finished his match in three games, taking down Danial Saleem of the Lions by a score of 12-10, 11-8, 11-8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its last match against Ancient Eight competition ended in its first loss since the end of the 2011 season, other Ivy League opponents could have smelled blood in the water facing the No. 2 Harvard women’s squash team. But the Crimson responded to its competition by putting on two inspired performances this weekend, rolling both Empire State rivals Columbia and No. 6 Cornell, 9-0.
Harvard (9-1, 4-1 Ivy) was expected to have little trouble with the Lions Saturday afternoon, as Columbia is in its second season as a varsity program. On the other hand, the Big Red came to Cambridge with plans of snagging an upset against the 2012 CSA national champions. But after a sweep of the first round of matches, led by co-captain Natasha Kingshott, the win never looked in doubt for the hosts.
“Cornell is one of the strongest teams in the Ivy League, and…we knew this would be a tough match and a test to see how far we’ve come since J-Term and the tough loss to Princeton,” Kingshott said. “[With] a 9-0 sweep, I think the match score speaks for itself.”
HARVARD 9, CORNELL 0
The Crimson entered Sunday afternoon hoping to continue the strong team performance it displayed against the Lions. After Cornell’s close loss to Trinity last weekend, Harvard knew its opponents were capable of notching an upset.
“We love the challenge,” Kingshott said. “We’d rather be tested than play matches which are less competitive, so it makes us stronger if we know people are gunning for us and want to take us down. We’ll rise to that occasion.”
Kingshott got her team off to a fast start, with a victory in straight sets at the No. 6 position that extended the senior’s unbeaten season. Elsewhere in the round, No. 9 freshman Isabelle Dowling recovered after dropping the first game by taking over the rest of the match, winning the fourth and final game, 11-2.
Sophomore Haley Mendez took the first two games of her match at No. 3, but a series of contentious let calls and mishit shots gave Big Red senior Jaime Laird a lifeline in the third game. But Mendez was able to flush the distractions and take the final game, 11-4.
With the 3-0 lead, the Crimson’s comfort in the match grew, and Harvard took all three of the second round matches in straight games. Freshman Saumya Karki continued her strong rookie season, picking up her seventh collegiate win, while sophomore Julianne Chu won three close games to close out her match. Senior Laura Gemmell, despite being visibly in pain from a leg injury and stretching at every break, fended off junior Jesse Pacheco, 11-7, 13-11, 11-8.
With the match already in hand, the third round of matches went quickly. Co-captain Sarah Mumanachit only played one game, winning 11-3, before her Cornell senior Maggie Remsen retired due to injury. Freshman Michelle Gemmell matched her sister’s result, registering a 3-0 win for her sixth victory of the season. At the No. 1 position, sophomore and defending individual national champion Amanda Sobhy had to recover from early deficits in each of her first two games to take a 2-0 lead. In the third game, Sobhy was down 10-7 and in a position to lose the first game of her collegiate career. She survived three game balls to take the game and a match, 12-10.
“[The result] is a good confidence boost for us going to [No. 4] Trinity,” Kingshott said. “They are another step above. Every match now is building on each other.”
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 0
Harvard easily dispatched of Columbia, 9-0, Saturday afternoon, as no Crimson player dropped a game in the first Ivy League match since the Jan. 13 loss to the Tigers.
At the No. 1 spot, Laura Gemmell deposed of Lions’ No. 1 Catherine Jenkins by only allowing four total points against. Her dominance typified the Crimson performance, as no Columbia player scored more than eight points in any game.
Sobhy and Mumanchit sat out for the Columbia match, meaning sophomore Megan Murray and senior Eliza Calihan entered the top nine and took 3-0 victories at the No. 8 and No. 9 spots, respectively.
“It’s always good having more teams to play varsity,” Laura Gemmell said, referring to the Lions’ recent transition to a varsity program. “Since they are a bit weaker, I think people use it as a warm-up to work on things in their game and try different game styles.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second consecutive weekend, the No. 3/4 Harvard women’s hockey team went up against a formidable conference opponent on the road. And for the second consecutive weekend, it played its foe to a disappointing result. Just a week after falling to No. 6 Clarkson, the Crimson failed to earn a win as the squad played Dartmouth to a 2-2 draw in Hanover.
“It’s probably the best we played as a group in a couple of weeks,” junior forward Lindsey Fry said. “We were bummed to get the tie, but we weren’t disappointed in our performance necessarily.”
The third-ranked team in the nation traded goals with a Big Green side that hasn’t dropped a game at home since Nov. 23 when No. 5 Cornell paid Hanover a visit.
“That was fun,” co-captain Laura Bellamy said. “We want games like that. We want a good back-and-forth team.”
Both goalies took a few minutes to settle in as three of the first four goals were scored within the first 10 minutes of play. Bellamy surrendered an early goal to Lindsey Allen off of a faceoff but soon found her rhythm to stop all but one of Dartmouth’s next 25 shots.
Bellamy has been splitting time with freshman Emerance Maschemeyer this season.  The tandem ranks first and second, respectively, in save percentage in the ECAC.
The fruitless overtime period was closely contested as both teams had opportunities to find the back of the net.
The Big Green’s chance came first as Laura Stacey put the puck on net. The rebound bounced its way straight to Sasha Nanji who fired the puck right into Bellamy’s midsection for the easy cover-up.
Harvard came close but failed to punch it in during the closing seconds. Dartmouth’s goaltender Lindsay Holdcroft had to fall down and reach behind her in order to keep it out and make her  last of 41 saves on the night.
“It can be kind of discouraging,” said Fry of the team’s difficulty finishing. “But at the same time it is so encouraging because you see how many opportunities you are getting and think one of them is bound to go in.”
That was the case early as a Big Green turnover led to the game’s first scoring opportunity two minutes into the first. After being played into the corner and worked along the boards, the puck skidded to junior forward Kalley Armstrong who stickhandled her way past two defenders before abruptly directing the puck at an unsuspecting goaltender.
The cushion created by the backhander did not last long as Allen’s quick strike allowed Dartmouth to draw even thereafter.
The puck slid under Bellamy’s pads to find its way into the back of the net and erase the early lead.
The squad’s top line, spearheaded by co-captain Jillian Dempsey, displayed its offensive prowess, accounting for both of the night’s goals. The three players who comprise the unit have combined for 36 goals thus far this season.
“That line...has been great for us all year. They know where each other are at all times and that was a great play,” Bellamy said of the precision passing that allowed the Crimson to go up for the remainder of the first period.
The progression involved a no-look pass from junior forward Lindsey Fry to find Dempsey with an unobstructed path to the net.
In the first three minutes of extra session though, the Big Green kept the puck on Harvard’s side of the ice, peppering Bellamy.
The Crimson power play went zero for four on the night. Yet this line in the box score was not due to a lack of opportunity.
Harvard might have been able to put the game away early, hitting a post and a crossbar on the power play preceding Dartmouth’s first goal.
The squad kept up the offensive at the close of the second, firing multiple pucks on net before Holdcroft could dive on the puck and clear it to safety.
“Their goalie made some good saves, and we just couldn’t put one away,” Fry said.
Fry led all skaters for the Crimson with eight shots on net.
The tie compresses the top of the standings, as Cornell beat Union and Rensselaer to inch within a point of Harvard entering the season’s final stretch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After cutting an early 11-point deficit to two at the half, the Harvard women’s basketball team rolled over Brown (7-11, 1-3 Ivy), 68-58, to sweep its first Ivy League road trip on Saturday at the Pizzitola Sports Center. The Crimson hadn’t beaten both Yale and Brown on the road in three years.
Harvard (12-6, 3-1 Ivy) was bolstered by a combined 33 points from backcourt pair Christine Clark and Victoria Lippert and a near double-double from sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who chipped in 14 points and nine rebounds of her own, in addition to collecting a team-high four steals.
Fagbenle led the effort on the glass throughout the game, as no players from the Bears were able to grab more than four boards of their own.
“We can always count on [Fagbenle] to go out and give us the best game,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “It’s great playing with her. I love it.”
The first five minutes saw the two teams knot the score at 11 before a layup from Brown junior guard Lauren Clarke gave the Bears a lead they would hold until the 1:52 mark in the first half.
Clarke was the leading scorer for the night, netting 20 points, including 12 from behind the arc on 50 percent three-point shooting.  Clarke was followed by guard Sophie Bikofsky as the only member of the team to break double digits in points scored, with 13 on the night.
Brown co-captain Sheila Dixon, the team’s second leading scorer at 11.9 points per contest, was held to just two points on 1-for-9 shooting. Overall, the Bears shot 19-for-53 from the floor, a 36 percent clip.
After Brown forward Jordin Juker sunk two from the charity strip and put her team up 28-17 with 8:08 to go in the first frame, Harvard junior Elise Gordon took a handoff from Clark and drove to the bucket for a layup that spurred a scoring effort, as senior Elle Hagedorn drilled a three to tie the score at 33.
The Crimson entered the locker room down by two, 35-33, after a quick layup from Bikofsky put the Bears back on top.
Returning to the floor in the second stanza, Lippert sunk an early three to give Harvard its first lead since the first minute of the game. Two jumpers from Curtis put the Crimson on top, 40-37, with over 17 minutes to play. From there, Harvard would never trail again.
“I think people who were in the final minutes did a really good job defensively,” Curtis said. “We got good offense off of our defensive pressure. We picked up the pressure and put Brown back on their heels. I think that we just had the mentality of ‘we have to win this game, we’re not going to lose,’ and I think that those people coming into and out of the game were doing a great job of that.”
Fagbenle notched 10 of her points and six rebounds in the second half. The forward, who put up a career-high 20 points against Yale on Friday night, has been the team’s leading rebounder in eight of the last nine games.
The Crimson squad hit 12 free throws in a half where its lead was as large as 14 with under a minute remaining.
The team’s final 11 points were entirely off of foul shots. Harvard shot 14-for-21 from the charity stripe in the contest.
“Brown was down and they knew they had to foul,” Curtis said. “I think our team did a good job of taking care of the ball, being strong, allowing it to foul and knocking down the free throws. It comes down to the very end of the game. We practice free throws in practice, and that’s our job. We have to do that.”
It was another strong night for Harvard’s bench players. The four women who hit the floor off the bench combined for 15 points. The night before, at Yale, five non-starters pitched in 24 combined.
“In practice we don’t really have the first string-second string,” Gordon said. “It’s the starters, and then everybody else is working just as hard too. As hard as you work, you’re making your teammates better too. We all make each other better in practice, and it only helps us to make us better in the games and on the court.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle led the Crimson (11-6, 2-1 Ivy) to a 67-54 win over Yale (6-11, 1-2 Ivy), registering a career-high 20 points in New Haven on Friday. The game was Harvard’s first conference road trip of the season.
After Harvard took an early lead, the Bulldogs looked to lessen the deficit heading into the second half, but the Crimson caught another quick wind and ended the game with a 43.8 shooting percentage. The Yale offense consistently failed to find the basket throughout the match, going 20 for 72. By the end of the first frame, the Bulldogs had put up a low 19.4 shooting percentage.
“We’ve been working really hard,” junior center Elise Gordon said. “We’ve been working on our different defenses, so the fact that we have such a variety of defenses that we can use makes [our opponents] have to counteract, which is definitely to our advantage.”
Fagbenle and Gordon pressured Yale early on in the first frame, scoring several  points in the paint after the opening tipoff. Harvard held a double-digit lead for the majority of the period and led the Bulldogs at halftime, 32-20.
“Temi is a great player,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “She’s awesome to play with and I think [at] Yale having 20 points as her career high is a great building block for her, and I think that’s going to motivate her during the rest of the Ivy League games.”
The second period brought tighter competition, with Yale closing the gap to three points in the final 14 minutes. The Crimson defense buckled down and finished the game with a season-high 50 rebounds.
“We had a couple of games where we haven’t been able to overcome adversity, and what we really wanted to focus on was  [playing] possession by possession and basically just converting on offense,” Gordon said. “We would make goals for ourselves and just be one play ahead.
Fagbenle chipped in nine rebounds and a steal of her own, while co-captain forward Miriam Rutzen and junior guard Christine Clark had a combined rebound total of 14, registering seven apiece.
“I think Yale especially was a really good team effort,” Curtis said. “I thought during Yale we did a good job of defending the following side against the post. They were playing pretty tough on our guards.”
The Harvard bench showed out with a total of 24 points, while Yale’s bench only registered eight. Rutzen, Curtis, and junior forward Missy Mullens tallied two assists each for the Crimson.
“Our team has so many weapons,” Gordon said. “We’ve got a really deep bench.”
Despite a Bulldogs rally in the second half, exceeding their first-period point total by 14, the Crimson headed to the locker room with a comfortable lead. Harvard held off the Yale second-period run that defeated the Crimson during the 2011-12 season.
“We kept padding it inside, getting inside-out looks, and I think Elise executed really well on a lot of those, as well as a lot of other players that came off the bench and really contributed to the team effort,” Curtis said.
After Fagbenle, Gordon registered the highest number of points at 10, while Curtis and senior guard Elle Hagedorn chipped in nine and eight points, respectively.
Fagbenle recently received her sixth Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor this week. The sophomore has racked in a total of eight Ancient Eight awards on the season. The forward also registered nine rebounds, one assist, one block, and one steal in under 22 minutes.
Yale’s final 27.8 shooting percentage marked the lowest of a Harvard opponent since the Crimson played against TCU in early January. The bulldogs never led Harvard by more than three points during the matchup.

Even if you're not planning an evening at the theater any time soon, word on the street is that you might spot Quinto out and about in Cambridge. Keep your eyes peeled and don't miss your chance to a) scream "Sylar!" and run away or b) ask him what kind of tweezers he uses.
"The Glass Menagerie," which opened on Saturday, ends its Cambridge run on March 17, so don't miss your chance to see Quinto and his brows up close and personal onstage while you still have a chance. The play is directed by John Tiffany (of Broadway's acclaimed Once) and also stars Cherry Jones, Celia Keenan-Bolger, and Brian J. Smith.
