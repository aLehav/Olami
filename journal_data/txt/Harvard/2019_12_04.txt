“Parasite.” “Hustlers.” “Us.” “Joker.” “Knives Out.” “Ready or Not.”
What do these 2019 films all have in common? At first glance the answer might be “nothing at all.” Strippers, clowns, and board game tycoons don’t really have a lot of overlap. Some of these films bring laughs. Some get your heart pumping. Many succeed with both. But, look past the vast array of stories and genres on display here, and you will find that these movies intersect at their most crucial point. Many of 2019’s movies revolve around the same core theme: Inequality.
These films have garnered much attention from students on campus. But at the same time, we have seen a stark declining interest in the humanities on campus. Students, perhaps facing economic pressures, have begun to shy away from art as a mode of learning. But art has academic value worth studying, and this year’s films demonstrate this fact exquisitely.
Films are always the product of the era they were made. And though no one film can fully represent an era, a collection can clarify the central anxieties permeating that period’s society. In the 1970s, the rise of political thrillers involving government conspiracies reflected the growing distrust of political institutions. And in 2019, films are making bold statements about the world.
This year, income inequality in America reached its highest level since the Census Bureau started measuring it in 1967. And in the past decade, economic inequality has developed into a major force in American politics, which might be partly thanks to Bernie Sanders’s tirades against the millionaires and billionaires. Now, many top presidential candidates have hopped on the bandwagon and expressed their own plans to address the country’s rising wealth gap.
Mirroring this concern, each of these 2019 films in its own way grapples with the massive disconnect between the rich and the rest. In each film, those on top are utterly oblivious to the plight of those below (quite literally in the case of “Us” and “Parasite”), and fail to recognize their humanity. In “Parasite” and “Us,” it’s not that the rich are actively malicious, but that they exist in their own bubble — establishing an emotional disconnect that breeds resentment. This is especially relevant to many Harvard students, literally gated into the bubble of Harvard Yard, passing homeless people in Harvard Square every day.
The ways that many of these films blend often conflicting genres underlines this message even further. “Ready or Not,” a violent thriller comedy, is about a lower-middle class woman who marries into an uber-rich family and as a result has to survive their deadly game of hide-and-seek. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but the film highlights this detachment in its absurdity. The scenes with the rich family are mostly comedic and lighthearted, while the scenes with the bride are tense and serious. This difference in tone effectively illustrates how much your wealth affects the tone of your life. Limited consequences allows the wealthy to approach life with a degree of levity that is not afforded to others.
But why does any of this matter? You might be thinking, “Okay, so people care about inequality and it shows up in movies. What’s the big deal? I don’t even like movies that much.”
Most campus discussions on inequality can be found in Government and Economics courses. They employ data and graphs to create a picture of inequality that focuses primarily on its economic and political consequences. And while essential, these frameworks fail to highlight the empathy gap that is established between the rich and the poor.
In addition, many of us study inequality, and many hope to fight it beyond graduation. But, change requires mobilization, which requires emotional investment. If we want to fight inequality, or any other social ill, we need to understand its human impact and feel it.
2019’s films clearly illustrate the perils of the empathy gap better than any other medium possibly could. Sometimes words simply can’t do an idea justice. A New York Times think piece can only do so much to affect your perception of inequality. When one needs to elicit a feeling, dull prose always pales in comparison to vibrant poetry. Films are exercises in empathy, slipping you directly in the shoes of a character, then tying the laces tight until the screen cuts to black.
As students, we seek our education in the classroom, in our readings, and through our problem sets, but we would do well to augment our search for knowledge in less than traditional mediums. “Parasite”’s Song Kang-Ho’s restrained facial expressions — the pain, the desire for any shred of respect — articulates the empathy gap’s impact far better than any string of words or collection of graphs ever could. Film can move — it’s powerful — and at its best, it can change how one sees the world long after the credits roll. 2019 films are teeming with academic quality and motivational potential, and it’s time to start paying attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many Harvard students today, the idea of student protests probably sparks images of The Game and divestment. But for Harvard students who may have hoped to take part in the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies’ January program, the massive student-led protests in Chile have had a far more concrete impact this semester. The program, which has run since 2003, sends Harvard students to work alongside students at Universidad Mayor in rural communities outside the capital. But as Chilean President Sebastian Pinera declared a state of emergency and sent the military into the streets, this year’s iteration of the program was canceled due to safety concerns.
We stand in solidarity with our Chilean peers who are putting their lives on the line to create a more just future for themselves and their community. We stand to learn from their efforts.
Of course, we believe student safety, whether on campus or around the world, should always be of utmost concern. And as the injury count in Chile climbs above 2,000, alongside more than 20 deaths, we understand the reasons for canceling the program. The nature of the protests in Chile, however, compel us to reflect on the ways in which activism and protest is sparking important discussions around the world.
To some extent, we regret the necessity of canceling the program. Study abroad programs are immensely important, in so far as they broaden our horizons and share different perspectives with us. For Harvard students, the unrest stirred up by our peers in Chile is of deep educational value. And we’d like to believe that this educational value is at its greatest when individuals on the ground are speaking out about the state of the society they inhabit. We encourage Harvard and other universities to weigh this pedagogic angle alongside safety as they plan and consider future travel programs.
At the same time, however, we recognize that often in moments of social conflict and change, our educational programs cannot and should not be made the priority of local institutions and people. Universidad Mayor ultimately made the choice to cancel the program this year. Canceling the program is not merely important in terms of Harvard student safety, but in terms of respecting the intensity of life right now for the institutions and individuals that would be expected to host Harvard students.
Even from the distance of Cambridge, however, students should remain informed about and engaged with the Chilean student protests and the broader sweep of youth-led protests around the world. Chile, where high school students kicked off unrest in the wake of subway fare increases by organizing mass evasion, is not unique. Take climate change: last Friday, activists assembled around the world to contest the damaging effects of Black-Friday-style consumerism and demand action from the United Nations climate negotiations, which began Tuesday.
Harvard students should remain informed not only for their own educational benefit, but also because many of our peers come from or have deep personal ties to regions of the world where protest and unrest are the only serious avenue for challenging regimes of inequality and violence. What may seem far away for some is, for many of our peers, very close to home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back home, family is everything.
The value of family is evident in every aspect of life in American Samoa, as well as in many other Pacific islands and cultures. It is evident in the way that our people are able to trace our histories through family lineages. It is evident in the way that the concept of orphanages and retirement homes seem incredulous to so many back home, because of the idea that every child and elder must have a family and a home. And it is evident in our dedication to serving and supporting our families, when we gather together at family functions.
But not only is family everything — it is everywhere. For me, having grown up surrounded by aunties, uncles, grandparents, and tons of cousins, family was at every turn. But family is not only restricted to your bloodline. In fact, most of my aunties, uncles, and cousins are not even directly related to me. “Aunty” and “uncle” are your parents’ friends or really any other adult that you interact with at the store, at church, etc. “Brother,” “sister,” or “cousin” are your peers, classmates, and friends that you’ve learned and grown with.
Having been raised with this strong dedication to family and a kind of familial love that stretches across lands and bloodlines, my transition to life at Harvard was a difficult one. I didn’t understand why, when I struggled to understand course material or complete a p-set, my peers and classmates were hesitant to help me, and would often times leave me behind because I had nothing to contribute. I didn’t understand why people walked so fast and stared at me strangely when I smiled at them as I walked past. But perhaps most of all, I didn’t understand why I felt so lonely on a campus that preached community and inclusivity as some of its core values.
Harvard breeds a community of individuals and a culture of exclusivity. From its intense classes and extracurriculars (which literally demand and reward students for lack of sleep and self-care) to its emphasis on social networking and transactional relationships, it is no wonder why many here feel socially isolated and have no sense of community.  Harvard has implemented programs and campus organizations to mitigate these problems and promote inclusivity within its community. And while many of them are amazing resources and have helped many people to feel more included, these things will only ever be a reactive treatment to a well-established culture of exclusivity, and will never be able to eradicate the need for inclusion.
As far as community building goes, I think that Harvard could learn a lot from Pasefika communities and their dedication to the value of family. Because so many Pasefika communities have a family-based model, where everyone is entitled to a type of love and respect that transcends boundaries, the concept of “promoting inclusivity” is so foreign because no one is ever excluded in the first place. With this valuing of family, which in many Pasefika cultures translates to a valuing of all members within their community, we pride ourselves on uplifting one another — not competing against each other. Because in a family, each family member benefits from the success and well-being of their brothers, sisters, cousins, aunties, and uncles.
Harvard has so much to gain from incorporating this same value of family, and the transcendent love and respect that comes with it. A shifting of campus culture in this way could result in a community that rewards its members for uplifting one another rather than the fostering of a culture of unhealthy competition. It could result in a stronger sense of belonging — or even a complete absence of one’s questioning of belonging here in the first place. It could result in the decrease of mental health issues related to stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation and loneliness, because such a cultural shift opens up the possibility for a beautiful, expansive love for each of its community members. All in all, the incorporation of this Pasefika value of family opens up endless possibilities that could lead to the kind of community that Harvard has been preaching that it wants to be.

Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Emma Dench announced the launch of a school-wide Advising Project in a Nov. 26 email to GSAS students.
The Advising Project, a two-year effort to gather data on and reform advising for GSAS students, will focus on collecting feedback from individuals involved in the advising process, including students, faculty, alumni, and administrators.
“I want to gather feedback from everyone whose experience touches advising,” Dench wrote in the email.
After soliciting responses over the course of the next year, GSAS administrators will begin using the collected data to determine how to “disseminate the lessons learned” and better allocate advising resources.
Dench's announcement comes months after the January release of the most recent GSAS advising-related survey, first distributed in fall 2018. In that survey, 92 percent of GSAS students reported that they were satisfied with their overall advising experience.
The survey also asked students more specific questions about their advising experiences. Ninety percent of students reported that their advisors help them achieve a “satisfying work-life balance"; 76 percent of students said they have had either “excellent” or “good” professional development opportunities.
Dench called the results "troubling" in last Tuesday’s announcement.
“While a majority of students seem satisfied with their advising, a troubling — and consistent — number do not,” she wrote.
After reviewing the data and researching other institutions’ advising practices, Dench said she decided that she would “need to investigate more deeply” and “engage with individuals beyond those in traditional advisee-advisor roles.”
“What does effective advising look like? What gets in the way of effective advising and how can we make it the norm?” she wrote. “Is advising more expansive than is traditionally understood?”
Dench said she believes “effective” advising helps students build meaningful professional and personal relationships. She added that “negative” advising can lead to a “lack of productivity,” hinder students' ability to earn their degree, and adversely impact their mental health.
Dench concluded her email by distributing a link where GSAS students can anonymously share stories with the Advising Project’s leaders. Submitted stories and additional feedback opportunities will inform the project’s direction in the coming months, she wrote.
“Advising is a complicated and individual process,” she wrote. “But it is one that should be effective regardless of discipline or year of study.”

Northeastern University professor David Lazer discussed the impact of the internet on misinformation and the spread of political ideas at a lecture at the Harvard Kennedy School Tuesday.
Lazer serves as a co-director for the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks, which sponsored the event along with the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center. His research focuses on how knowledge travels through networks like the internet and social media.
Pointing to the circulation of online discount codes throughout Norway, Lazer noted the recent change in the rate at which information spreads. He said that individuals’ ability to search for discount codes online — as opposed to waiting to receive them from others — altered the rate at which the coupon codes spread throughout the population.
“What this meant was that the information that would not have spread, say, before Google will spread if there is a latent demand that is being fulfilled through search,” he said. “As algorithms embed more natural language processing, more sophistication, an increasing amount of human information will be governed by this kind of spreading process as compared to the more traditional models of, let's say, broadcasting.”
In addition to the new search-driven method of circulation, Lazer highlighted the difference in the structure of media systems in the 21st century. He explained that while individuals in the 20th century relied on advertising and local newspapers, those in the 21st century embraced a global network in which more people rely on fewer news sources.
“I would argue that the creation of a national global market for information will naturally create that concentration of attention,” he said.
Lazer added that while Twitter is one of the most prominent sources of news today, it is particularly vulnerable to the spread of misinformation.
“0.1 percent of the people accounted for roughly 80 percent of all fake news,” he said, citing a study of Twitter data following the 2016 election.
Lazer also criticized the idea that the internet has furthered political polarization. He said that many people incorrectly believe that the internet has a “filter bubble,” so people can only find information that agrees with their beliefs.
“If two people put in the same search, strong Republican, strong Democrat, they're pretty much going to get the same stuff,” he said. “And also, it turns out that exposure to dissonant information will actually sometimes increase political polarization.”
Lazer noted a key element of studying information networks is understanding that people obtain different knowledge in different ways.
“Democracy is, in some sense, what happens in the spaces between us,” Lazer said. “In democracy, we somehow have to accommodate not just differences in opinion, but even differences in our understandings of basic facts about the world.”

An individual protesting Harvard’s decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña stood silently inside the Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting Tuesday while dozens of students demonstrated outside.
The protester held a sign which reiterated demands students first raised in a letter to administrators and a sit-in at University Hall yesterday. The sign called on Harvard to reverse García Peña’s tenure decision; publicly release correspondence about that decision between Bacow, Gay, and department chair Mariano Siskind; and open an investigation into García Peña’s case for “procedural errors, prejudice, and discrimination.”
“You have 24 hours,” the sign read.
The University informed García Peña — who specializes in Latinx studies — of the tenure decision Nov. 27. Since then, graduate and undergraduate students have organized against the verdict, penning letters to top Harvard administrators protesting the decision. More than 240 Harvard affiliates and 45 student organizations signed onto the first letter. The second letter, sent by a “coalition of graduate students and concerned scholars” from within and outside Harvard, has garnered more than 2,700 signatures.
The letters highlight García Peña’s accomplishments during her nearly seven-year tenure at the University, including helping establish an ethnic studies track in History and Literature, publishing a book on Dominican racial and national identity to critical acclaim, and receiving multiple awards from the University for her teaching.
García Peña did not respond to a request for comment on her tenure case.
The individual protesting inside of Tuesday’s meeting stood near the middle of the large lecture hall in Emerson Hall and immediately drew the ire of University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who chaired the meeting. Faculty meetings are closed to the public and most students.
Bacow asked the protester to move to the side of the room, saying that the sign was blocking the view of faculty members sitting at the back. He also asked the individual to provide their name, but the protester remained silent.
After the protester did not respond to his request, Bacow called the faculty to a vote, asking if he had their support to compel the protester to move. Multiple faculty members dissented, and the protester remained in place.
“I think this is a poor precedent for us as a faculty to have our meeting disrupted in this fashion,” Bacow said.
History professor Kirsten A. Weld asked Bacow to hold a discussion of the “substance” of the protester’s demands, but Bacow demurred, saying it was not “appropriate.” Later in the meeting, Weld told the protester she supports them and criticized the University’s tenure decision.
“I share your heartbreak and your outrage,” she said.
FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on the decision regarding García Peña, reiterating the University’s unwillingness to discuss individual tenure cases.
Standing outside the meeting, protesters linked the controversy over the tenure decision to broader calls for the University to establish a formalized ethnic studies program — a demand that has a more than four decade-long history. They conversed with faculty members entering the meeting and passed out flyers.
Multiple protesters declined to comment, including the one who disrupted the faculty meeting.
History of Science lecturer Soha Bayoumi said in an interview after the meeting that she supports the students’ demands for an ethnic studies program.
“This is a demand students have made for over 40 years now, to teach the different histories in an interdisciplinary program that will provide tools to understand the composition of this country, and the histories and communities that constitute this country,” Bayoumi said.
“And so, if we're really serious about diversity, I think it is important for us to also think about ethnic studies,” she added.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay has embarked on a nationwide search to hire three to four faculty members who specialize in Asian American, Muslim American, and Latinx studies. Gay said in a November interview that the search committee has compiled a long list of candidates and will invite some to campus to give public lectures and meet with faculty and students.
Since late 2018, at least three tenure-track professors who specialize in race and religion have left the University because they did not receive tenure or took a job elsewhere. In November 2018, the University declined to tenure Harvard Graduate School of Education associate professor Natasha K. Warikoo; History assistant professor Genevieve A. Clutario accepted a position at Wellesley College soon after; and the Divinity School denied tenure last spring to Science and Religion associate professor Ahmed Ragab.

University Professor Danielle S. Allen and Adam D. Serwer, a staff writer for The Atlantic, discussed the future of political divisions in American society at the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum Tuesday night.
The event, titled “American Reconciliation and its Alternatives,” built off of segments of The Atlantic’s December Issue, “How to Stop a Civil War.” Joined in conversation by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffery Goldberg, who moderated the panel, Allen began the event by emphasizing the importance of unity in democracy.
“The biggest danger to maintaining democracy over time is fragmentation, and disunion, and breakup,” she said.
Allen said that she believes unity is the foundation of human empowerment. In the face of conflict, she stressed the importance of a democracy based on cooperative decision-making. She added that she thinks demagogues who seek to take advantage of factionalism for personal gain threaten this form of democracy.
“In seeking his own power, [a demagogue] has mainly the motivation of stripping public liberty away, taking away the chance for ordinary people to rule themselves through collective decision-making,” she said.
While Allen warned about the danger of demagogues, she said that reconciliation between divided populations is possible if individuals support larger societal goals.
“So reconciliation, from my point of view, is about demonstrating consistently, in whatever mode one has of interacting, that one is committed to the whole of society,” she said. “If you can perform that commitment and connection over and over again, that starts to make space for people to actually do things together.”
Serwer said he thinks that reconciliation should not be prioritized above the survival of liberal democracy.
“The terms on which [polarization] ends are far more important than the fact that it ends,” he said. “If it does not end in a way that recognizes the full citizenship of all Americans regardless of background, then it’s not going to be a real or true reconciliation.”
He continued by discussing what he termed a prevalent mindset within the Republican Party today that hinders the process of depolarization.
“I think the big obstacle to this, honestly, is that you have a faction of people in the United States who really feel like they are fighting an existential battle against annihilation,” Serwer said. “So they don’t feel like they can lose because if they lose, then it’s over for them.”
Serwer added that he thinks this “existential insanity” enables President Donald Trump's supporters to back his policies.
Attendee Jay T. Gleason disagreed with Serwer and said he believes people suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome."
“I don’t mind if they go down the record one issue or one question at a time and just critique it in a rational way instead of in an emotive way,” he said. “It makes me feel that they are oftentimes doing these jumps simply for partisan-electoral purposes and they want to get rid of [Trump].”
Audience member Abraham “Abe” S. Atwood ’23 said he agrees with the panelists' concerns regarding polarization.
“I was interested in hearing a talk partially about polarization in American politics, because I think it’s something I see as being one of the biggest threats to American democracy.”

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences mulled a proposal to call on Harvard to divest from its holdings in the fossil fuel industry at its monthly meeting Tuesday.
The meeting, the last of the semester, marked the third time this fall that faculty members have discussed climate change and the University’s response to it. In October, faculty outlined the scientific and historical underpinnings of the issue; in November, they delved into a debate on the merits of divestment.
The proposal calls on the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — to instruct the Harvard Management Company to “withdraw from, and henceforth not pursue” investments in companies that explore and develop further fossil fuel reserves or support such development. It also asks the Corporation to eventually extend that policy to advisers of the endowment’s investment vehicles, and to replace HMC investment advisers “unwilling or unable to comply” with others who are willing to do so.
The five professors who spoke in favor of divestment at Tuesday’s meeting are part of a group of hundreds of faculty members who have indicated their support for the effort via an online petition.
Senior Corporation Fellow William F. Lee ’72 attended the meeting. Lee noted that Tuesday's discussion of divestment marked the first time in his 44-year stint at the University that he has attended a faculty meeting.
Lee said he will convey the faculty’s remarks to the entire Corporation, which has the final say on divestment. He thanked them for their passion about the issue and the “good faith” with which they presented their views, adding that, even if the Corporation reaches a decision faculty members disagree with, its members “want to hear you and listen to you.”
“It’s not because we’re worried about ceding control to the faculty,” he said. “We really are trying to do the thing that we think is the right thing to do.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has repeatedly refused to support divestment. He has contended, among other arguments, that it would be “hypocritical” to divest from the fossil fuel industry while the University continues to depend on fossil fuels to power its campus.
Romance Languages and Literature Professor Virginie Greene countered that argument at the Tuesday meeting.
“It would be no less hypocritical to question, debate or engage with the fossil fuel industry as long as we not only use cars, central heating and artificial lighting, but also wear any piece of clothing,” she said. “To avoid hypocrisy, apparently, no one should dare to advocate for green energy and energetic conversion except outdoors and in the nude.”
Economics professor John Y. Campbell spoke against the divestment proposal, calling for the University to instead use a “carbon footprint control” formula that he argues encompasses more than just the divestment campaign’s focus on fossil fuel producers. He pointed to European institutional investors as a model for how to implement such a formula, which takes into account all possible sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
Earlier in Tuesday's meeting, the faculty voted to approve summer school course offerings for 2020.
They also approved tweaks to the College’s new schedule intended to better spread classes across the week.
German professor Peter J. Burgard offered an amendment to the legislation, reiterating his concerns last month that the new schedule constricts faculty members’ ability to hold seminars at convenient times. After the faculty’s initial, verbal vote on the amendment was split, the body decided in a roll call vote not to accept the amendment and subsequently passed the original proposal.

Despite what he characterized as healthy financial results in fiscal year 2019, University Chief Financial Officer and Vice President for Finance Thomas J. Hollister said in an interview Monday that Harvard has been preparing for a potential recession that could affect some of its fastest-growing revenue streams.
Harvard’s continuing and executive education programs have formed a steadily growing revenue stream in recent years, but demand for such programs may be vulnerable to a recession, Hollister said.
“I think I would say that Harvard is in a healthy condition but wary, for a number of reasons, about the economic outlook, the trends in the pressures in higher education, as well as other burdens, like the endowment tax, so there are reasons to be pretty cautious,” Hollister said.
The University relies heavily on both public and private research funding, though federal funding has stagnated, leading to a shift toward non-federal funding. Both have historically declined in recessionary periods, according to Hollister.
“A lot of the executive education programs are paid for by sponsoring organizations,” Hollister said. “It might be a company, might be a foreign government, might be a local school district.”
“And if they have less money, which they usually do, the economy will affect matriculation of those programs also,” he added.
Hollister said that each of Harvard’s schools engage in “scenario planning” for a possible recession, a lesson taken from the 2008 recession that erased $11 billion from Harvard’s endowment, which is currently valued at $40.9 billion.
If a recession hits, each individual school decides what to cut first, though Hollister said it “usually” involves slowing down investments.
“The philosophy of scenario planning is to make sure you have your principles in place. And I think we've heard from most of the schools, it's about teaching and research, which translates quickly to students and to faculty,” Hollister said. “So it's those things that support students and faculty that are central. And so anything else is generally fair game for, you know, when necessary, when reductions have to occur.”
In addition to the threat of a recession, Harvard has also taken on an additional financial responsibility in the past fiscal year — a Republican-passed tax on its endowment returns.
The endowment tax, effective for the first time in fiscal year 2019 despite extensive lobbying on Harvard’s part, has also contributed to a bleaker economic outlook. Though officially a 1.4 percent investment income tax, the levy may amount to even more, depending on the final rule from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Hollister said.
Harvard has already paid close to $30 million under the endowment tax, with more to be sent in the coming months, but the University is still hoping for a repeal or revision of the tax, Hollister said.
“We for lots of reasons think it's misguided that at a public goods place like Harvard, which is hopefully creating new knowledge and educating good leaders and providing financial aid, that's the last thing we should be taxing,” Hollister said.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow previously said that financial aid would be the “last thing” he would cut to pay for the endowment tax. Financial aid at Harvard, however, is not fully endowed and a recession could increase financial need, according to Hollister.
“If people lose jobs or get paid less, those families will need more financial aid,” Hollister said. “So that's the trick: It’s to be ready to help and that's the aim to make sure we have enough to help our students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As members of Harvard’s graduate student union hit the picket lines on the first day of their strike Tuesday, University negotiators posted a position statement online arguing that the union’s proposed procedure for adjudicating sexual harassment and discrimination complaints may be in conflict with Title IX.
This procedure — along with proposals on compensation and healthcare — lies at the root of the deadlock between the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. After 28 bargaining sessions since October 2018 have failed to resolve these issues, union members launched their long-threatened, indefinite strike Tuesday.
The union has proposed that student workers be given an option to raise sexual harassment and discrimination complaints through a union grievance procedure — a dispute resolution mechanism outside of current internal Harvard channels, and one that could eventually lead to third-party arbitration in some cases. The University, on the other hand, has insisted that these complaints be handled through Title IX complaints and its Office for Dispute Resolution, and through internal discrimination procedures.
Title IX is a federal anti-discrimination law that underpins Harvard’s approach to handling complaints of sexual and gender-based misconduct.
University negotiators believe that the union’s proposals violate Title IX regulations that require that procedures adjudicating these types of complaints must guarantee involved parties an “equitable resolution,” according to the University’s position statement posted to a website devoted to negotiations.
The University said that according to a U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights Q&A from 2017, an “equitable investigation” is one in which the “rights or opportunities” of one party must be available to the other on “equal terms.”
“Under the HGSU-UAW proposal, the student worker through union representation, would have access to an arbitration process, but other non-HGSU-UAW members of the Harvard community would not,” the statement reads.
Arbitration would also not meet the requirements of an investigation because an arbitrator is not a trained investigator, according to the statement.
HGSU did not respond to a request for comment on the University’s position statement.
The University also argued that the possibility of cross-examination could have a “chilling effect” on reporting, according to the statement. It rejected the union’s argument that arbitration would only occur if the University chooses to pursue it, instead arguing that it would be the prerogative of the union to request arbitration.
In addition to procedural concerns, Harvard’s statement also addresses what it sees as issues with the potential outcome of arbitration processes.
The University argued that an arbitrator would not be able to sanction perpetrators of harassment.
“Under the HGSU-UAW proposal, an arbitrator would have no authority to issue sanctions or punishment on an individual if a violation of the University's Title IX Policy were determined in the outcome of an arbitration hearing,” the statement reads.
William A. Herbert, executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College at the City University of New York, said that recent non-discrimination procedures reached at other universities demonstrate that “creative” compromises can be found with regard to discrimination procedures between unions and universities.
One possible compromise is to split up different categories of discrimination and make some of them subject to the grievance procedure, and others not, he said. At American University, for example, only categories of discrimination not covered by federal, state, or local law can be put through the union contract procedure. For cases covered by law, complainants can pursue resolution through government agencies.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Herbert’s remarks. HGSU representatives did not respond to a request for comment.
Another example of a compromise — currently in place at Brandeis and Tufts — is that discrimination complaints would be investigated by the University according to its own procedures. If the union is dissatisfied with the result, it can choose to take the case to arbitration under its contractual procedure, as opposed to the grievant making the decision of whether the case should go to arbitration.
“These contracts show the creativity that was applied that allows for resolution of the issues,” Herbert said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Department administrators and course heads have had to reduce review sessions and relocate classes as hundreds of graduate student union members gave up their teaching duties to join the strike.
Striking members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers – which represents roughly 5,000 graduate and undergraduate teaching staff, and graduate research assistants across Harvard – withheld their work starting Tuesday, the last day of classes at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Hundreds gave up teaching responsibilities including holding review sessions, grading assignments, and hosting office hours to join picket lines in Harvard Yard.
The strike comes as FAS enters reading period, a week set aside for students to write papers and study for final exams, which begin Dec. 10.
HGSU has not announced an end date for the strike. The union and Harvard have been negotiating for more than a year and produced 12 tentative agreements over the course of 28 bargaining sessions. The parties, however, remain at an impasse over key provisions on compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
HGSU’s strike can potentially impact grading of final exams if it becomes extended. The longest strike by a graduate student union in the past seven years was held by graduate workers at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and lasted for 11 days.
The strike has already affected several popular undergraduate courses including General Education 1058: “Tech Ethics: AI, Biotech, and the Future of Human Nature,” Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics (Microeconomics),” and General Education 1074: “The Ancient Greek Hero.”
HGSU has instructed its striking members to turn over all their work materials to supervisors prior to the strike, according to the union’s strike guidelines. The union also recommended striking members notify faculty members and students that they will be withholding their labor for the duration of the strike and provided an example letter for doing so.
“I am disappointed that it has come to this: students workers, including myself, work hard for this university to ensure you get the best education possible, but Harvard refuses to agree to protections and provisions that other student workers at other universities enjoy and that enable them to do their best work,” the example letter read.
Graduate teaching fellows in at least nine classes — together affecting hundreds of students — announced to students in emails that they will halt all their teaching responsibilities for the duration of the strike, according to emails obtained by The Crimson.
All teaching fellows for Tech Ethics, a course with 620 students, will stop holding review sessions and office hours, according to an email obtained by The Crimson.
Professors teaching Ec10A, a popular introduction to economics course with 612 enrollees, plan to hold extra review sessions and office hours, in addition to the ones scheduled by the course’s non-striking teaching staff, according to a course announcement.
Some instructors said they changed the location of their classes Tuesday because of the strike.
Yiddish preceptor Sara Feldman said that she relocated her classes, as she was uncertain whether protesters would establish a picket line that she and her students did not want to cross.
Feldman added that students in her class had elected to incorporate the strike into a research project.
“They researched the cultural history of labor and use some of the material that we have learned in class, like how to create the command form of a verb, in order to write in Yiddish some slogans... about what's going on with the Harvard Graduate Student Union,” Feldman said.
Committees including Social Studies and History and Literature also relocated some academic meetings — like classes and advising sessions — off-campus or to undergraduate residential houses to prevent faculty and staff from having to cross the picket line.
“There may be picket lines around William James Hall and other Harvard classroom buildings, and we understand that many of our faculty, students, and staff will not want to cross those picket lines.” wrote Anya B. Bassett, director of the committee on degrees in Social Studies, in an email to concentrators.
The picket line is porous so as to allow student workers to fulfill their academic duties, according to the union’s strike guidelines.

Harvard’s graduate student union officially began their strike on Tuesday at midnight after more than a year of contract negotiations with the University. Thus far they have agreed on 12 provisions but have failed to concur on key contract provisions. During a bargaining session the day before the strike’s start, both sides offered new proposals, but no new agreements were reached.
HGSU announced their Dec. 3 strike deadline last month after voting union members overwhelmingly approved strike authorization in vote in late October. Since bargaining began in October 2018, HGSU and the University have held 28 sessions. Among the issues still on the table are compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedures for sexual harassment and discrimination.
There are currently no additional bargaining sessions scheduled.
Union members – teaching fellows, course assistants, and graduate research assistants – can choose whether to participate in the strike. Striking HGSU members will halt paid instructional work, including holding sections and office hours and grading assignments and exams, according to strike guidelines distributed by the union in late November. Graduate research assistants on strike will withhold 20 hours of their paid research work not related to their academic program.
The strike is expected to continue indefinitely, with pickets in Cambridge running from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. Pickets on Harvard’s Longwood campus in Boston will run from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. each day.
For the duration of the strike, The Crimson will update this article with a brief summary of what went down each and every day.

Harvard’s graduate student union updated its members in an email Friday about the union’s plans to engage federal mediators in negotiations — a step University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 first proposed in an email to Harvard affiliates the day before.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers accepted Harvard’s proposal to engage the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in contract negotiations, according to the email the bargaining committee signed and sent out to union members Friday afternoon.
The union also provided a brief timeline for forthcoming strike and negotiation activity in its email.
“We have agreed with the administration to begin mediation on January 7 and are still discussing the details of the process to ensure that it keeps negotiations moving,” the bargaining committee wrote. “We will continue to update you as the details are finalized.”
HGSU-UAW also argued in their email that Garber’s statement demonstrated “the power of our strike.” In particular, the union highlighted Garber’s statement that the University hopes to resolve the strike “in the month ahead” as the possibility of the strike continuing into the spring semester looms.
The email to union members encouraged striking members to put pressure on the University remotely if they are off campus during the fourth week of the strike, which coincides with the holidays.
The email advised strikers “to participate in our virtual picket line.” Forms of participation include calling, emailing, or writing a postcard to an administrator.
“Dear Dean.......Happy Holidays. This year I celebrate our first strike as student workers. In my time here I have suffered/seen my friends suffer,” the postcard template for remote strikers begins.
Fulfilling just one of these remote picketing acts satisfies striking members’ “strike duty,” according to the email. Striking union members must normally perform an average of four hours of strike duties per week to receive benefits from the United Automobile Workers’s strike fund.

University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in an email Thursday afternoon — the final day of the semester — that Harvard would propose engaging the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in an attempt to resolve the three previously intractable issues at the heart of the strike: compensation, health care, and grievance procedures to adjudicate sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. FMCS would only step in at the request of both parties; Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers has yet to comment on whether it will support the move.
Earlier Thursday, HGSU-UAW announced that its strike will continue through winter break in an email to union members. The email came a day after the union’s bargaining committee and Harvard administrators met to negotiate for the first time since the strike began on Dec. 3. The two parties reached six tentative agreements during Wednesday’s meeting and have already signed three related to housing, titles and classifications, and an emergency grant. The remaining expected agreements are related to discipline and discharge, grievance and arbitration, and strikes.
FMCS mediates disputes between unions and management free of charge, according to its website. Garber wrote that he believes mediation will help resolve the three outstanding issues and end the strike — now the longest of its kind.
“It is common to have a mediator help the parties move forward after exhaustive efforts at the table have fallen short,” he wrote.
HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Lee Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in an email to union members Thursday morning that the union and University expect to sign the three remaining proposals — related to discipline, strikes, grievance, and arbitration — over email.
The article on discipline and discharge prohibits the University from disciplining or dismissing student workers without “just cause.” The provision also guarantees student workers access to union representation or a “fair process” if Harvard disciplines them.
“These articles, taken together, advance our rights and establish clear protections,” Kennedy-Shaffer wrote.
The provision related to grievance and arbitration creates a procedure through which union members can appeal violations of contractual rights to a neutral, third-party arbitrator for resolution. This is separate from an article that would address the grievability of harassment and discrimination — one of the key provisions at the center of the strike.
In the agreed upon strike provision, the union promises not to sanction a strike once a full contract is in effect in exchange for the University administration not “locking” union members out of their workplace.
Though the University did propose several new proposals regarding compensation anf healthcare, two of the three key disputed provisions, Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in his email that these new proposals are insufficient to settle a contract.
In his email, Kennedy-Shaffer wrote that the University’s administration demonstrated more willingness to “seriously bargain” than in previous negotiations. He added the Harvard administrators said — for the first and only time since bargaining began — that both parties had a “mutual interest” in reaching an agreement.
“We are hopeful that the administration will confirm further dates for an accelerated pace of bargaining prior to the start of the next semester,” Kennedy-Shaffer wrote.
“It is clear the administration is feeling the pressure of our strike,” he added.
With the close of finals period Thursday, the union announced that it intends to continue its strike into winter break. In lieu of picketing in Harvard Yard and at Harvard’s Longwood campus, union members on strike will create a “virtual picket line” by calling the administration each day.

At noon on Wednesday, representatives from the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers met to negotiate for the first time since the strike began on Dec. 3. When the three-hour-long bargaining session concluded, the two parties had reached five tentative agreements in the contract and one “side letter,” which is separate from the final contract. None of Wednesday’s agreements included the three key provisions at the center of the strike: compensation, health care, and grievance procedures for sexual harrassment and discrimination.
The University and the union reached tentative agreements related to discipline and discharge, strikes, grievance and arbitration, titles and classifications, an emergency grant, and housing, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email.
Under one of these provisions, student workers living in University housing who decide to pay rent on a monthly basis — rather than up front — will not pay an additional fee.
The union also agreed to the University’s proposal to put $25,000 annually toward an "emergency grant," which would be distributed to student workers at the union’s discretion, subject to University approval. The union’s proposal asked that the University contribute $100,000.
When ratified, the contract will group student workers based on their work to determine their wages, though the union and University remain deadlocked over the amounts Harvard will ultimately pay.
The proposals related to the other three provisions that the University and the union tentatively agreed upon — discipline, strikes, grievance, and arbitration — have not yet been released.
The University also presented new proposals at Wednesday’s negotiation session related to compensation and health care.
Harvard offered to put $325,000 annually in a pool fund to help finance union members’ child care, an increase from its original offer of $275,000. The increase falls short of the union’s proposal, which demands the University put $950,000 annually toward costs related to supporting union members’ children — not restricted to merely the cost of child care.
The University also increased proposed compensation for student workers. The new proposals would give research assistants an 8.2 percent salary raise over a three year period and a 7.2 percent raise for teaching fellows over the same period. Harvard also offered to raise the minimum hourly rate for research work to $16 per hour.
It remains unclear whether the union put forth any new proposals. Representatives for HGSU-UAW could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday evening.

Snowfall greeted the 15th day of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers strike. Throughout the day, the striking members of the graduate student union continued picketing outside of Johnston Gate, an entrance to Harvard Yard. A group of picketers also distributed flyers explaining their strike outside of the Smith Campus Center.
With the strike in its third week, HGSU-UAW announced that it would designate Dec. 16 through Dec. 20 as a week specifically dedicated to calling Harvard administrators’ offices, expressing solidarity with the graduate student union, and pressing them with questions about negotiations.
The union is circulating a Google Form with instructions, on Twitter. It includes a call script and the phone numbers of different administrative offices such as the Office of the President and the Office of the Provost.
The google form encourages supporters to call three phone numbers from a list every day. The list includes phone numbers for the Office of the President, the Office of the Provost, the Office of the Executive Vice President, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Office of the Dean of Graduate Students of Arts and Sciences, the Office of General Counsel, Labor and Employee Relations, and the Office of Public Affairs and Communications.
The form instructs participants to ask why the University is not meeting daily with the strikers and why it has not agreed to the union's contract proposals on health care, compensation, and protections against discrimination and sexual harassment. Harvard and HGSU will meet at the bargaining table Wednesday — the first negotiation session since the strike began.
“By calling administrative offices every day this week, we can send a clear message to the administration that we stand with student workers and their demands for decent pay, health care, and protections from harassment and discrimination. These student workers are fighting to make Harvard a better and more just institution - let’s help them do this,” the form reads.
Union organizers took to Twitter to encourage Harvard alumni to participate in the action. Graduate student unions across the country also disseminated the call script among their members.

The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers strike hit its ten-day milestone Monday. Union members and students gathered for a midday rally at the John Harvard statue with religious leaders from across Harvard’s campus. Guest speakers included Jewish Labor Committee executive director Ari L. Ferdig, Divinity School Professor and Humanist Chaplain Gregory M. Epstein, Divinity School Professor and Interim Pusey Minister Stephanie A. Paulsell, and Rabbi Toba E. Spitzer ’85. Three Battery Wharf Hotel strikers, who went on a 79-day-long strike in September, also joined the crowd at Harvard.
During the rally, representatives from Harvard’s faith groups and Boston residents invoked religious themes in their speeches to support the striking student workers.
Paulsell called Advent — a Christian season leading up to Christmas — a holiday process where the prophets call on people to “turn around and change.”
In his speech, Ferdig quoted the Torah in order to speak about workers' rights. “You shall not abuse a needy and destitute laborer, whether of your own people or a stranger," he said.
The strikers who attended the rally walked to University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s office around noon, chanting and singing. Three representatives from the crowd, including Spitzer, delivered a letter penned by the New English Jewish Labor Committee to Bacow.
“What we believe is that the Jewish community has a particular obligation to support the rights of working people, support their rights for economic justice,” Ferdig said in a speech to the crowd.
Ferdig said in an interview with The Crimson that he was pleased the rally had “a fantastic turnout.”
“It’s so great to hear people singing and being in community with one another,” Ferdig said. “You know, I talked there about opening our hearts to the words of the Torah, and I hope that that’s what President Bacow does, is he opens his heart to the words that he’s hearing from the community.”

Members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers continued picketing around Harvard Yard and Harvard’s Longwood campus Friday, attempting to halt deliveries and gain support ahead of next week’s bargaining session with University administrators. In lieu of a midday rally, organizers put on a production, entitled “Bargaining Session: A Play in Three Acts.”
For the play, over 50 picketers walked from University Hall to 124 Mount Auburn Street, the University-owned building where bargaining sessions are typically held. Once inside, they began the production. Ege Yumusak ’16, Justin Bloesch, Lee Kennedy-Shaffer and Cory W. McCartan — all Ph.D. students and members of the HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee — played themselves, while Matthew R. Volpe, another Ph.D. student, played the role of “Harvard’s Outside Counsel.”
In the first act, Volpe and the Bargaining Committee argued over the number of times they have met to bargain. In the second act, Volpe sat under the bargaining table and hid from the committee for the entire session. In the third act, committee members read all of their proposals to Volpe. In response, he simply said “no.”
McCartan spoke about the first issue that the University and the union have yet to agree upon: compensation. “The question we’ve had for you — and we’ve had since the beginning — is are you willing to let us live off food stamps or will you bargain a fair contract and move on fair and equitable pay?” he said.
Kennedy-Shaffer explained the union’s proposal for healthcare. Yumusak then discussed third-party grievance procedures for complaints of sexual harrasment and discrimination.
After the play, picketers returned to their posts blocking deliveries around campus and marching through the Yard. Beforehand, Bloesch addressed the crowd, thanking them for their two weeks on strike.
“The University’s feeling the pressure,” he said. “This has been a disruptive strike for them, they do not want to keep doing this, and we’re going to meet them at the bargaining meeting so keep it up, because we don’t win the contract in the bargaining room, we win it out there.”
Meanwhile, other graduate students and supporters continued their pickets at Harvard’s Longwood campus. Following a noontime rally, more than 30 members of the union marched through buildings at the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, culminating in a picket through Gordon Hall, which houses most of the administrative offices at the Medical School.

Thursday marked the eighth day of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers strike. Union members and supporters continued carolling and picketing around campus. Throughout the day, strikers greeted students heading into final exams with flyers resembling multiple choice forms. The flyers urged students to “Tell Bacow to Bargain Now!” They also included a phone number for students to call and urge University President Lawrence S. Bacow to “bargain a fair contract.”
Thursday’s Cambridge carolling destinations included the Office of General Counsel and the Office of the Provost. Songs included versions of “12 Days of Christmas,” “I Have a Little Dreidel,” “All I Want for Christmas is You,” “Winter Wonderland,” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”
The union adapted the traditional lyrics of “Silent Night” to “Strike our contract is born. Strike our union is strong,”
They also changed “Oh Holy Night,” singing “Oh holy strike, the finals are ungraded. Long lay the workers in exploitation.”
Following a short midday rally at Harvard’s Longwood Campus, picketers marched and chanted through the Kresge Building at the School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School’s New Research Building.

An early morning snowfall welcomed picketers as they continued delivery disruptions around campus on the seventh day of the strike. Cambridge’s midday rally featured several faculty members from across the University who spoke in support of the union. At several points throughout the day, strikers greeted students heading into exams with flyers designed to look like scantrons, urging students to “Tell Bacow to Bargain Now!”
The Wednesday morning Cambridge rally featured speeches from faculty members, including professors standing in solidarity with the union from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, and Harvard Law School.
FAS Professor Sarah S. Richardson said she supports a fair contract for HGSU. She told the strikers that they have shown themselves to be “true educators” and that their “actions will create a better world” for themselves and generations to follow.
Kennedy School Lecturer Richard Parker said the union will be called on in the future for institutional shifts: “You are a part of the generation in which the challenge is not just with Harvard, but a larger shift in the institutional power of this country and this world. You are going to be called upon once you are successful in this to do it again and again and again.”
Kennedy School Professor Marshall L. Ganz gave HGSU the flag flown over the funeral of labor rights activist Cesar Chavez. He said, “I want to entrust it to you to keep it until you win.”
At Harvard’s Longwood Campus, picketers stopped to listen to a noontime rally featuring speeches from HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee Member Hector Medina, HGSU-UAW union member Emily Unger, American Federation of Teachers' Union Organizer Liliana Gutmann-McKenzie, and Boston Teachers Union Internal Organizer Natalia Cuadra-Saez.
Emily Unger introduced a new song deviating from this week’s union carolling, “We’re gonna rise up, rise up till its won. When the people rise up, the power comes down. They try to stop us so we keep coming back.”
Liliana Gutmann-McKenzie said she recognizes the difficulty of striking. “I know a lot of faces here, and I just had to say how proud I am to come back and see all of you here on strike.”
Natalia Cuadra-Saez said degrees are made possible by graduate student workers and that she recognizes their work in grading and overseeing courses. “We know who is mentoring us and guiding us all the way and so we owe you,” she said.
Harvard is scheduled to meet with the union next week to discuss their proposals and new counter proposals from both sides, University Provost Alan M. Garber '76 wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates Wednesday afternoon.
“The University has not wavered from its commitment to address concerns raised during these negotiations, and we will continue to meet with HGSU-UAW in the hopes of reaching a reasonable resolution,” Garber wrote.

Tuesday — the first day of final exams — marked the one week anniversary of the HGSU-UAW strike. As undergraduates filed into lecture halls for their exams, student workers continued to picket and disrupt deliveries. At one point, strikers rallied in the Office of Labor and Employee Relations after congregating with the Steel Workers Union in Harvard Square. In the afternoon, striking workers sang labor-themed carols as they marched around Harvard Yard in a circle.
Around noon, picketers in Cambridge moved the picket line into Harvard Square. Roughly 50 marched out Johnson Gate up Mass. Ave. and eventually congregated in the Charles Hotel courtyard where they were joined by Steel Workers Union members. Soon after, they held a rally in the lobby of the Office of Labor and Employee Relations at 124 Mt. Auburn St, attracting onlookers from office windows above.
“We have spent so many hours in this building with them, going back and forth, and finally it has come to this,” HGSU bargaining committee member Justin Bloesch said in a speech at the rally.
“I believe that working people need strong unions. I know Harvard is an incredibly rich employer,” Dave Slaney, a member of the Steel Workers Union, said in an interview. “I felt bad for the graduate students. I'm glad to see them striking to try to get a good contract.”
The mid-day rally at Longwood featured speeches from Ashley Gripper, a School of Public Health student and former bargaining committee member; Mary T. Bassett, director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University and former New York City Health Commissioner; and Priscilla MacKenzie “Kenzie” Bok ’11, Boston City Councilor-Elect for District 8.
“Today's International Human Rights Day, so I thought that it was a good opportunity to remind ourselves of Article 23 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which pertains to the rights that people have,” Bassett said in an interview. “It has lots of modern language though, the idea of equal pay for equal work, the idea that all people should have the right to a healthful working environment. And it, of course includes the right of workers to form unions to protect their interests.”
Despite the rain, student workers continued to picket around Harvard, some singing strike-themed Christmas carols with lyrics like “The weather outside is frightful, but the picket is so delightful” to the tune of “Let It Snow.” Picketers said they have appreciated the support they’ve received from students, faculty, and those outside the University.
“The weather and the administration have both been a bummer. It’s really disappointing to see what's going on with the Harvard administration,” Religion Ph.D. candidate Eric Stephen said in an interview. “But the amount of support that we've been getting from students, from faculty, from people outside of the Harvard community, from our Congresspeople, from our city councilors has just been such a show of support that it really does feel like we're making a difference. It's a really great thing.”

Local and national politicians joined union members on strike Monday. Students picketed for their fifth consecutive weekday on Monday in Harvard Yard and at Harvard’s Longwood campus, despite rain throughout the day. The union also held a concert in Memorial Church featuring a number of speakers and musical performances.
The Monday morning rally — attended by roughly 150 picketers — featured speeches from Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Cambridge City Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui and Alanna M. Mallon, and Cambridge Mayor Mark C. McGovern. After addressing the students, they spent time on the picket line.
“You are building a future for this country and for the globe,” Clark told the students. “And we need to make sure that you are paid fairly, that your work is respected, and that you are safe at work.”
“What we are demanding — because power concedes nothing without a demand — is nothing charitable, is nothing benevolent. It’s simply what you have earned,” Pressley said. “I cannot believe that at an institution as revered, as agust as this one, that we would even have to make the case. So I’m going to tell you the truth: I’m outraged. I’m outraged because this is outrageous.”
HGSU Bargaining Committee Member Cherrie Bucknor — who is a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology — also provided an update on bargaining. Bucknor said that Harvard has not been actively negotiating with them in the past week. “Our last bargaining session ended at 11:30am last Monday, a week ago. So far, crickets. We have heard nothing from the administration,” she said. “Shame. I am ashamed of this administration. I am ashamed of this university.”
Half an hour after the rally, picketers moved to Memorial Church for a solidarity concert featuring speakers and performers, including Music Professor Esperanza Spalding, who sang a song about love. “It’s a force that might not end up named on your contract, and might not named on a sign. But I know it’s the force driving as you do this labor,” Spalding said.
At the concert, a member of Boston’s Local 26 — a union representing over 12,000 hospitality workers in Massachusetts and Rhode Island — announced that the Executive Board of Local 26 voted to donate $5,000 to HGSU-UAW’s Hardship Fund, which financially supports union members during the strike.
Anai A. Morales ’23 and Xochitl Morales ’22 — sisters who are from Delano, Calif., where Cesar Chavez launched the labor rights movement — sang two songs in Spanish. “We’re here in solidarity with the union, coming from a union town, Delano, knowing that the fight for workers rights and fight for a fair life is one that everyone should be fighting for,” Xochitl said.
“I hope that this moment is a moment to refuel,” another performer, Mercedes F. Ferreira-Dias ’23, said.
Other student performers included Ganavya Doraiswamy and Rajna Swaminathan — both of whom are acclaimed artists and Ph.D. candidates in Creative Practice and Critical Inquiry — and the band Extra Extra.
Picketers continued to disrupt deliveries across the University on Monday. Groups of three to five students were stationed at high-traffic locations like Johnston Gate, a loading dock at the Science Center, and Divinity Avenue throughout the day to ask drivers to turn around out of respect for the strike.
Leah P. Rumsey, a Ph.D. candidate in the Committee on the Study of Religion, said that it was “wonderful” to see the number of individuals who turned their vehicles around when asked. “We’ve had a lot of people who were really supportive, both private people and people who were here for part of their work,” she said. “The goal of delivery picketing is to disrupt labor and disrupt the work of the institution that’s not bargaining with you, but it’s also to gain support for your cause.”
A driver for the United Parcel Service, Jose L. Barrientos, said that when he saw the picketers, turning his truck around was “instinctive.”
“I’m a Teamsters Local 25 out of Charlestown, and we’re a brotherhood of solidarity. We stay together against corporate America,” he said. Barrientos said that though UPS will question why he did not deliver his packages, the company understands that its workers are not allowed to cross picket lines.
Picketers said they appreciated the show of support from politicians like Clark and Pressley. Some said they are “confident” about the future of the strike as it heads into its second week, while others are unsure.
“I think it's just really incredible to have the support of essentially the entire Massachusetts political establishment,” Andrew S. Ross, a Ph.D student in Computer Science, said. “I feel confident. I feel exhilarated. I feel like we have momentum.”
Danube N. Johnson — a Ph.D candidate in Religion — said that “it really helps us see that we're not alone in this fight, and we're not isolated.” Danube said that she didn’t think “any” members of HGSU-UAW expected a solution in the first week. But as for the future, she said it’s “unclear.” “It's pretty opaque from what's happening. It's pretty opaque, what's going on inside the administration,” she said. “We're just doing what we can to sort of hold our side of the line.

Striking members of the Harvard Graduate Student Union picketed for their fourth consecutive day on Friday in Harvard Yard and at Harvard’s Longwood campus. HGSU programming in the Yard included a strike registration — which will enable strikers to become eligible to receive strike benefits — as well as a rally for labor and climate, which brought together activists across the University in solidarity. A snowfall that began in the afternoon bid picketers farewell for the weekend. After taking a brief respite on Saturday and Sunday, they plan to resume picketing on Monday.
HGSU held a strike registration in the basement of Memorial Church. The Harvard union, which is affiliated with the United Auto Workers union, encouraged striking members to register in order to become eligible to receive strike benefits, courtesy of the UAW’s strike fund. HGSU strikers will have access to the fund if their strike goes on for at least eight days and the University withholds strikers’ pay.
Friday’s midday rally focused on the intersection of climate and labor. Representatives from HGSU, Harvard Divest, the Ethnic Studies Coalition, and Harvard Prison Divestment made appearances, and speakers stood behind a large sign that read “Nobody Wins When Harvard Invests in Climate Injustice, Prisons, Stolen Land, PR Debt.”
Speaking on behalf of Divest Harvard, Maya H. Levine ’21 commenced the hour-long rally by relating the strike for graduate student worker’s rights to divestment from fossil fuels. “We are striking for climate justice and fair pay. We are striking for transparent power structures that don’t exploit people or the planet,” she said.
Anna Camila Gonzalez Valdes, an Earth and Planetary Sciences Ph.D. candidate, connected movements supporting unions to movements against climate change through the experiences of her mother. Gonzalas said that her mother, who worked at Walmart for six years, was fired for showing up late to work. Without a union to protect her, she had no recourse. One year subsequent, she lost her home to foreclosure after it was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. “I do not need a Ph.D. to know that the labor movement and the climate movement are related,” she told the crowd.
Enthusiasm levels among graduate students proved disparate in Harvard Yard compared to Longwood. Combined, the two picket lines at Longwood consisted of fewer than 20 people. In Harvard Yard, despite snowfall in the afternoon, roughly 50 picketers persisted.
“The energy has been pretty good. It’s also really contagious when you get out here with your friends,” Jeffrey D. Williams, a Music Ph.D. student who was picketing in the Yard Friday afternoon, said. “It's much easier to do it when you're in a group with people that you know, and that you care about, and you care about their rights.”
In small numbers, HGSU members and union supporters continued picketing outside of Houses and next to loading docks, continuing to disrupt mail delivery by preventing trucks from successfully dropping off their packages.
In the Yard, picketers engaged passersby. HGSU members and supporters directed chants towards tourists and distributed fliers that summarized HGSU’s reason for the strike and outlined union members’ grievances with the University.
Bevan T. Wilson, an Australian tourist who was walking around the Yard with his family, found the flier a union member handed him compelling. “They've got reason to demonstrate,” he said. “The administration [is] not listening to them and they don't feel they're being heard. So why not make some noise and demonstrate and let people know about it.”
“We are the Harvard Graduate Student Union and we are on strike for a fair contract,” picketers circling the Yard repeatedly shouted as they approached the John Harvard Statue, which was teeming with tourists.
After four days of continual picketing, strikers will take a break over the weekend. They plan to resume on Monday given that the University and the union do not reach an agreement before then.

Pickets continued in Harvard Yard and in the Longwood Medical Area Thursday as the Graduate Student Union entered the third day of its strike. Picketers continued to block deliveries at sites around campus, delaying packages sent to the freshman mail center and upperclassman houses. Both groups of strikers held mid-morning rallies featuring student leadership, and Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Zondervan made and appearance. Later in the day, demonstrators in Harvard Yard merged with an ethnic studies protest as they marched.
Several HGSU members continued to picket at gates and loading docks beginning in the early hours of the morning, according to union Instagram posts. Director of Mail and Distribution Services Betsy Shortell wrote in an email to house building managers that UPS would not cross the picket line to deliver mail to students. Harvard University Mail Services planned to scan Thursday’s packages and deliver them to House mail centers Friday, but will not continue to process packages if UPS continues to withhold delivery, according to Shortell’s email.
Longwood strikers established two separate picket lines, one outside administrative building Gordon Hall and the other outside of the Harvard School of Public Health. The two pickets merged for a noontime rally featuring Harvard affiliates and Boston-area labor leaders.
Caroline Keroak, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Biological Sciences and Public Health program, talked about her experience forgoing dental care because she could not afford insurance.
“It should not require teaching, extra jobs, and selling your soul to be able to survive your undergraduate experience. The cycle of abuse can and will end with us,” Keroak said.
Harvard Dining Services employee Rona Ines Rivera urged strikers to “keep up the fight,” saying that she would provide “coffee as much as I can to you guys.”
Representatives of Our Harvard Can Do Better, the Palestinian Solidarity Committee, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, and the People’s Parity Project all spoke at an 11:30 a.m. rally in Cambridge with the theme #TIME’SUP in honor of the grievance procedure proposal. Cambridge city councilor Quinton Zondervan and Massachusetts Nurses’ Association President Donna Kelly-Williams also spoke.
“You're fighting not just for your rights, but for generations of students and workers to come,” said Zondervan, who reiterated the Cambridge City Council’s support for the strike.
At 3:15 p.m., demonstrators in Harvard Yard stopped in front of the University Hall for an additional rally. Speakers included Laura Correa Ochoa, Ph.D. Candidate in Latin American and Caribbean History in the History Department; HGSU bargaining committee member Justin Bloesch; and Gilliam Mason, Co-Director of Massachusetts Jobs with Justice.
“I want to say I'm proud of all of you who are standing up from the intimidation tactics that Harvard trying to do. They are trying to scare you. Don't give in, and keep up... keep up the strength with your other department members,” Bloesch told strikers.
After the rally concluded, the picket line proceeded to the steps of Widener Library, where protesters were demonstrating in support of ethnic studies at Harvard. The groups merged for a 30-minute rally to close a day of demonstrations.
Throughout the day, union leaders debuted new chants and songs.
One song, set to the tune of “This Little Light of Mine,” included the lyrics “this little picket line, we’re gonna let it shine.”

Pickets began in three locations on Harvard’s Longwood campus Wednesday on the second day of the strike, with striking workers employing chants specific to the Medical School campus, including “Put pipettes down! We need a contract now!” and “Whose mice? Our mice!” Some HGSU members in Cambridge held picket lines at gates and loading docks throughout the morning, asking drivers not to complete their deliveries. Both the Cambridge and Longwood pickets featured mid-day rallies with local labor leaders and politicians. Meanwhile, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University is evaluating the union’s most recent compensation and benefits proposal, but no new bargaining sessions have been scheduled.
Beginning at 5 a.m., striking workers picketed at loading docks and gates on the Cambridge campus, according to union Instagram posts. Throughout the morning, they asked delivery drivers to respect the union’s picket lines, and at least two drivers turned around after speaking to the picketers.
Eighteen construction workers in Longwood walked off the job in solidarity with HGSU, union organizer Gabriel L. Schwartz said during HGSU’s rally in Longwood.
While the picket lines in Cambridge have been porous, HGSU held a “firm” line around Longwood’s Gordon Hall — an administrative building — and asked those entering not to cross the picket line, according to striker Emily S. Unger ’13, an M.D./Ph.D. candidate at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health.
“We understand that students still need to attend class, but we're asking administrators to give us a fair contract and these are the people with the power,” Unger said, referring to those who work inside Gordon Hall.
The Longwood picket wrapped up with a noon rally. Roughly 80 people gathered on the steps of Gordon Hall to hear from local activists, elected officials, bargaining committee members, and non-Harvard union organizers, including President of the Massachusetts Nurses Association Donna Kelly-Williams, Massachusetts State Representative Nika C. Elugardo, and Somerville City Councilor Ben S. Ewen-Campen.
The union also held a mid-day rally in Harvard Yard for the second day in a row. On Wednesday, leaders from local unions spoke in support of the strikers. Jessica J. Tang ’04 and Erik A. Berg ’89, president and co-president of Boston Teachers Union, respectively, led off the rally. They were followed by Massachusetts Teachers Association President Merrie Najimy, Secretary Treasurer-Elect of Greater Boston Labor Council Darlene Lombos, and President of Massachusetts AFL-CIO Steven A. Tolman. Cambridge City Councilor-Elect Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler also led the crowd in chants of “Cambridge is a union town.”
Tang and Berg highlighted in an interview after the rally that they were introduced to the labor movement as undergraduates at Harvard.
“It's important to show solidarity to all these workers that are fighting for just basic rights and dignity on the workplace,” Lombos said in an interview. “That's what the labor movement does — support people who are standing up and fighting — and we come out to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.”
No new bargaining sessions have been scheduled as University negotiators continue to evaluate the union’s latest proposals on compensation and benefits, which were presented at Monday’s bargaining session, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Associate Provost Doreen Koretz and University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an email to faculty Wednesday that the University will not negotiate over the union’s demand to lift a 40-visit limit on mental health visits in the Student Health Insurance Plan because it is “a term of the health plan.”

Union members braved heavy snow and freezing temperatures to kick off the first day of the strike. Hundreds of strikers marched throughout the Yard, chanting “What do we want? Contract! When do we want it? Now!” and “Hey hey Bacow, looks like you’ll be grading now.” Tuesday also marked the last day of classes, and hundreds of students saw their classes relocated or cancelled. At the opening rally, strikers heard from leaders of other unions and local politicians. Online, Democratic Presidential candidates took to Twitter to throw their support behind the union.
As the first union members filtered out of Phillip Brooks House, which is serving as strike headquarters, the University posted a position statement online with arguments against the union’s proposed procedure for adjudicating discrimination and sexual harassment.
Students and faculty walked out of their classes at 10:30 a.m. to join the picket lines. Other faculty supporting the strike relocated their classes off-campus or to upperclassman houses to avoid crossing the picket line.
Massachusetts State Representative Marjorie C. Decker spoke at a rally Tuesday morning. She was also joined by United Automobile Workers regional director Beverley Brakeman. UAW is HGSU’s parent union.
United States Senator and Harvard Law School professor emerita Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julían Castro, Mayor Pete P. M. Buttigieg ’04, and former Vice President Joe Biden all backed the strikers on Twitter.
Late in the day, picketers joined up with student protesters who were demonstrating at a faculty meeting to support Ethnic Studies and to criticize administrators for denying associate professor Lorgia García Peña tenure earlier this semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, Harvard had a lot to be thankful for. En route to a pair of victories that bookended Thanksgiving, the Crimson (6-2) shot its best shooting performances of the season and extended its winning streak to three games. In its most recent game on Saturday, the squad knocked down over half of its shots from all over the court and exclusively from three point range.
HARVARD 77, QUINNIPIAC 68
Harvard and Quinnipiac (1-4) met on Saturday coming off of diametrically opposed performances in each of their prior games. The Crimson stepped onto the court with strong morale, carrying energy from its dominant shooting victory against Boston University that players surely basked in over the holiday.
In contrast, on Saturday the Bobcats were still licking their wounds from a 55-point loss against No. 9/10 Maryland, which scored a remarkable 107 points against Quinnipiac.
Though the Crimson fell short of Quinnipiac’s triple digit scoring performance, the squad did record its most prolific scoring performance to date this season in the game, notching 77 points.
Largely responsible for this achievement were four Crimson players who scored in the double digits. Freshman guard Lola Mullaney led both teams in scoring with 24 points, the second time the first year has scored more than 20 points in a game. Senior guard and co-captain Mackenzie Barta notched 13 points, including three threes. Junior forward and co-captain Rachel Levy scored 11 points and pulled in 5 rebounds, while sophomore forward Tess Sussman scored 10 points and also tallied six assists.
By shooting 54.9 percent from the field, and 55 percent from three, Harvard put on its most efficient offensive performance of the season.
HARVARD 66, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 39
Distributed scoring across Harvard’s roster highlighted the team’s victory over Boston University on Tuesday.
While Harvard’s offense was blunted at the start of the season by a dearth of scoring from its bench, the team’s depth was unquestionable against the Terriers. 10 Crimson players scored a bucket to help the team achieve victory.
Passing facilitated this contagious scoring. For a team that averages 13.9 assists per game, Harvard was especially selfless on Tuesday, tallying 18 assists. Senior forward Jeannie Boehm dished a career-high seven assists. She also pulled in 13 rebounds and contributed eight points.
The Crimson put concerted effort into its passing after first struggling against the Terriers’ man to man defense, which double teamed Harvard players in possession of the ball. After a series of early turnovers, the Crimson found offensive success by passing the ball quickly into the paint and then back outside. This in and out offense forced BU’s defenders to initially collapse, thereby putting Harvard’s guards in scoring situations to knock down shots around the arc off of a pass. Sharp shooting enabled the Crimson to get out to a double-digit lead to start the second half.
At the same time, Harvard’s eagerness to pass the ball gave rise to a slew of turnovers. The team, which averages 19 turnovers per game, coughed up the ball 21 times against Boston.
From beyond the perimeter, Mullaney shot her most efficient ever, hitting threes at a 60 percent success rate. This high percentage was more than a fluke; she knocked down six threes to finish the game with 18 points.
Mullaney’s hot shooting both fed off of and reinforced the team’s overall proficient scoring performance. The Crimson shot 47.1 percent from the field and 43.5 percent from three point range.
In contrast, Boston University did not hit an outside shot until a few minutes into the third quarter of the ball game. Though Boston had not scored below 60 points in its first four games of the season, in its fifth against the Crimson, Harvard held the team to just 39 points.
The Crimson will host Northeastern on Wednesday, November 4 at 11 a.m. for Education Day, an annual event that invites elementary school students from the greater Boston area to Lavietes Pavilion.

Tucked away off of Plympton St. lies Randolph Courtyard, a favorite spot among Adams residents and all members of the Harvard community both for its prime Carpe-hosting capabilities and sweet scenery. If you hang around the courtyard long enough, you might just be lucky enough to see the normally peaceful space disrupted by a certain boisterous German Shepard named Beam. Flyby sat down with Beam’s human, Adams House resident tutor William Burke, to get the details on the dog that brings the courtyard to life.
Beam hails from Scranton, Pa., where she lived with her nine other brothers and sisters before joining Burke in Cambridge. When Burke first encountered Beam, he found what one might expect from a litter of puppies meeting a stranger: lots of playing, tumbling, barking, and general excitedness from the bunch — except for Beam, who was snoozing happily in a corner. Also unlike her siblings, Beam was the only pup with long hair, despite both her parents being shorthaired dogs.
“I guess there’s always a non-zero chance,” Burke says of Beam’s unique hair, laughing. “She was, like, the weirdo of the litter.”
Still, Burke thought that this sweet little “weirdo” would be a perfect fit for life on campus, and took her home.
From there, they faced perhaps the biggest dilemma of any pet owner: what to name their new companion. Of course, there were some basic criteria to guide their choice. Burke wanted to choose a name related to architecture. It also had to be a single syllable “so that it would be easy to shout,” Burke notes. In the end, Beam won out over their other top choices, “Roof” and “Eave.” However, don’t be fooled. The German Shepard’s full registered name isn’t just beam, but rather “Simply Supported Honeymoon Beam.”.
In her two years at Harvard, Beam has become a staple of the Adams House community. “Every hour is puppy office hours!” Burke laughs, looking over at Beam, who is deep in a game of chase with her pal and fellow Randolph canine, Opie. Beam is also a big fan of outdoor yoga, which is one of the programs Burke runs for students as a Wellness Tutor. Beam’s presence, however, may not exactly be conducive to tapping into a zen state, as she loves to lick students’ faces as they stretch. Energetic yoga interruptions aside, Burke maintains that Beam is an extremely good-natured dog.
“She grew up around 470 college students since she got here, she’s never known anything else. You could set off fireworks, or thunder, nothing fazes her. She just lies on the couch. She might, like, lift an eyebrow,” Burke said.
Beam certainly is not a small dog, but she genuinely enjoys living in a dorm. Burke chalks it up to the fact that dogs “like having a den,” and says that she actually got into the routine of living at Adams so quickly that they stopped crate training her a few months early. Despite her love of her cozy home with the Burkes, there’s rarely a day when you can’t spot Beam outside, rain or shine. So, keep your eyes peeled if you’re anywhere near Adams, and maybe even consider rerouting your walk to cut through the Randolph courtyard — you might just see Adams House’s very own German Shepherd!

If you’ve ever visited the Leverett Towers and witnessed a lovable brown dog racing across the courtyard, you’ve probably seen Bailey, a sweet Belgian Malinois owned by a resident tutor in Leverett G Tower, Victoria M. Martin.
Originally from a breeder in Atlanta, Bailey was given to Martin as a birthday present 10 years ago. Since then, Bailey has grown from a small puppy to the fully grown dog she is today, and has also grown to be a part of the Martin family. When Martin moved to Cambridge three years ago, she brought Bailey with her. According to Martin, Belgian Malinois like Bailey are a unique breed possessing both high intelligence and remarkable emotional flexibility, meaning they can switch between work and play modes easily. In fact, Martin says that Belgian Malinois are commonly used in police forces, airports, and even the military.
While Bailey may not be working a nine-to-five job like some Belgian Malinois, she certainly keeps herself busy between chasing bunnies in the courtyard, interacting with students, and watching out for the newest addition to the Martin family. Martin and her husband, also a resident tutor in Leverett G Tower, recently had a baby. Martin said that lately, Bailey, “will come and get us if the baby is crying. If she doesn’t think we’re responding quick enough, she’ll run in and look at us.” This is Bailey’s way of demonstrating how much she loves her new sibling. Though Martin said she was initially worried Bailey would have trouble “figuring out what to make of the baby,” it seems the two are on their way to being great friends. While Bailey is well-trained and can do all the standard tricks, like fetch and ball play, Martin said Bailey’s attention to the new baby is “her best new trick.” It certainly speaks to how strong of an emotional bond dogs are able to form.
Outside her duties as a baby watcher, Bailey loves to swim. One of Martin’s favorite memories with Bailey on family trips are the visits to her parents at their home on Cape Cod.
“She loves to swim. She’s perpetually launching herself into the ocean after a ball, and then swimming back until she’s so tired she could drown, but would still never stop. It’s her happy place.”
Though her favorite place might be the salty waters, Bailey loves being part of the Leverett House community. As a friendly, people-oriented dog, she adjusted well to the transition from living in a suburban neighborhood to living in a dorm with students. The only minor hiccup was that before coming to Harvard, Bailey became accustomed to barking when someone came to the door.
At the time, Martin said this “was not very annoying, but actually a desirable skill to have.” Moving to Leverett changed that for the Martins. “Now, where we live, students will knock at our door more frequently, or 30 students will come for a study break. We’re trying to teach her that she doesn’t need to bark when every student enters our room,” said Martin, “That’s probably the hardest thing, we haven’t quite mastered it yet.”

For most of her life, Pforzheimer House Faculty Dean Professor Anne Harrington had only had rescue dogs in her household. So when her then-10-year-old son Ben insisted that “the only thing he wanted in the world was a dog,'' Harrington's first reaction was to Google rescue centers. “She came from Tennessee with a whole bunch of other dogs in an 18-wheeler, and we ended up picking her up in a parking lot in Connecticut,” Harrington recalls. “It was around Christmas time, and so the guy who was bringing up all the dogs had put on a Santa Claus hat.” Though the other dogs were on leashes, he had to carry Piper in his arms and give her over directly to Harrington and her son because the puppy was so small.
In addition to being a happy moment for the family, Piper’s arrival was also celebrated by students and tutors. “I had sent a notice out to the Pfoho students that we were arriving with a puppy, and there was a whole crowd of students waiting,” Harrington remembers. “She was this adorable little puppy and her first introduction to life here was being surrounded by a big crowd of students who really missed their pets.”
Piper, who is half-Labrador and half a mystery breed, made her debut on the silver screen just three months after she was adopted as the star of the 2015 Quad-wide Housing Day Quadweiser video. Inspired by the popular Budweiser Lost Dog Super Bowl advertisement, Young Piper accidentally boards the Quad shuttle and gets stranded along the River where she is rescued from the menacing Mather lion by all the Quad mascots. Professor Harrington described the experience as fun. “You have a 3-4 month old puppy and you're trying to get them to listen to stage commands,” she laughed. “That year, she was kind of a celebrity. We brought her down to the Yard for Housing Day and people said, oh, that's the puppy!”
Though Piper is “primarily a family dog,” Harrington stressed that Piper has an important place in the Pfoho community. Indeed, many students have dog therapy time with her, some even taking Piper up to their dorms for company while studying. Piper also has her own page on the House website. “I know when I've gone into the weight room there's a sign somebody put up with Piper looking straight at you saying, ‘Piper says put your weights back on the shelves where they belong’,” Harrington recalls. One of Harrington’s favorite aspects about Piper is that “she's not exclusive; she has room in her heart to care about students.”
Unfortunately, Piper is currently recovering from a slight injury she got from chasing a rabbit on the Quad lawn, and thus cannot swim, race the other Quad dogs, or take early morning walks in Raymond Park as she usually does. However, Piper’s naughty side includes begging for food. “She has unfortunately developed the habit of looking incredibly adorably wistful and insisting that she's starving to death,” Harrington laments. “She won't steal, but she will pretend to look pathetic.”
Piper is currently five years old, and is very much a New England dog despite being born in Tennessee. She loves the snow, and Harrington adds that “she's also a real water dog. One of her favorite things to do is to go over to Fresh Pond, which is about 3/4 of a mile from here, and that’s a pond dogs are allowed to swim in. She'd spend hours there if we'd let her.”
Harrington can’t pinpoint a favorite memory she has of Piper, but instead smiles at her dog for a moment as Piper wrestles with her favorite toy, a stuffed log with hidden chipmunks, before picking, “Seeing her in the water. She adores it and she's so happy. She actually really smiles, and you can tell when she's happy. Those are happy memories.”
