After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lists are great. They help you remember your groceries, keep your priorities straight, and organize your tasks. But as evinced by a 1963 Crimson review of “Lawrence of Arabia” by Anthony Hiss ’63, a list might not be the best way to lambast one of the most critically acclaimed films of the last century. Hiss relentlessly blasts the 1962 masterpiece— which was digitally restored and re-released in theaters Thursday to mark its 50th anniversary—but his condemnation is not quite convincing, mostly because he just unwinds a list of things he does not like about the film rather than arguing a single point.
First of all, a little dose of straightforward diction never hurt anyone. Maybe this is just how they talked in the ’60s, but Hiss drops words like “pentateuchal” and “gallimaufry” without batting an eyelash, and the phrase “unvarying facade of quivering neurasthenia-cum-whimsy” is almost breathtaking in its impenetrability.
Hiss’ neatly ordered, six-item list would not necessarily be an issue—there is no reason a numbered list cannot evaluate the excellence of a work of art. But here, neither does Hiss present a broad case against the film outside its being dull and long, nor do the individual critiques themselves stand up to much scrutiny.
For instance, in item two, Hiss attempts to criticize Lawrence’s characterization but supports his argument with evidence that contradicts his claim. He writes, “[Lawrence] begins as a simple pacifist pan-Arab fanatic, and through a hilarious concatenation of Grade B events (he is forced to shoot two intimate friends and watch a third sink smoothly into quicksand)”—wait. Isn’t that scene pretty tragic? At least, isn’t it a bit cynical to describe the deaths of Lawrence’s friends as “a hilarious concatenation of Grade B events”?
And his final point as to why the movie is bad is simply, “David Lean, who will win an Oscar for this movie, was its director.” Never mind that British director Lean had already shot a small film called “The Bridge on the River Kwai” and would go on to direct “Doctor Zhivago.” If you’re going to bash “Lawrence,” it seems counterproductive to mention that it will definitely win an Oscar.

To say that Robert Glasper is simply a jazz pianist would be misleading. The young Blue Note Records signee is equally invested in the worlds of hip-hop and R&B, and has been turning heads all over the musical spectrum with his lush, expansive sound. In February, he released the ambitious, genre-hopping album “Black Radio,” which featured Yasiin Bey (another stage name of Mos Def), Lupe Fiasco, and Erykah Badu, among others. The widely acclaimed record landed him on the Billboard charts and the late-night TV circuit and firmly established him as a leading figure of jazz experimentation today.
Glasper came to Harvard Wednesday for a talk presented by the Hiphop Archive and the Office for the Arts at Harvard’s Learning From Performers program. He discussed musical processes and influences with hip-hop producer and Hiphop Archive fellow 9th Wonder, gave a master class to a Harvard jazz trio, and then took over the piano himself.
The Harvard Crimson: You have talked about how important church was in your early childhood. How did church shape your sound?
Robert Glasper: Church was my first performance. I pretty much played in front of an audience every Sunday. I would be playing behind the preacher and playing stuff to keep the preacher revved up. So you play from the heart, you play for the feeling. I think that’s where I get that part of my sound from.
THC: In a 2012 interview with Downbeat, you said, “I’ve gotten bored with jazz to the point where I wouldn’t mind something bad happening.” Do you think jazz has a shelf life?
RG: Yes. People tend to look at jazz like it’s dead. Even in schools, when they teach jazz, it’s “jazz history.” The way to stay current is to play songs that have something to do with you and your life story. I’m not doing anything futuristic. A lot of people say, “You’re the future!” But jazz is so far behind that the present seems like the future. I’m just playing the present. I’m not ignoring what actually inspires me.
THC: How did the concept for your collaborative “Black Radio” album come about?
RG: When I first got signed to Blue Note Records in 2005, I was already playing with Mos Def and doing stuff with Common and Q-Tip. I knew I wanted to do a project like this, but I wanted to get the respect of a jazz pianist first. When you’re young and African-American and play piano, many people are very quick to overlook actual skills and put you in the hip-hop category.
So it was very important to me to put out three records that are actual jazz albums. From those records, you can’t deny my skill on the piano. The jazz community is very snobby, but they can only be so snobby to me. They can just check out the early records. The tradition is there.
THC: What was the recording process of “Black Radio” like?
RG: Originally, “Black Radio” was only going to have five guests. As I kept going, some of my friends would call and be like, “You’re doing a record? I want to be on it!” I was like, let’s just go all in, do 11 guests. It kind of snowballed.
Some of the songs were sketched out. On others, we had literally no idea what the artist was going to do. Everything was last minute because of the scheduling. Lupe Fiasco came into the studio, and I had no idea what he was going to do, and he didn’t either. People just came, and we just felt it out, talked about ideas. It was very organic, very off the cuff.
THC: Of all of your collaborations with hip-hop and jazz artists, is there a memorable moment that stands out?
RG: Last year Kanye [West] and Mos Def showed up when I was playing with Lupe at the Blue Note [jazz club]. Mos called me that night while we were at the club. He was like, “I’m gonna come through, and I got [Kanye] with me.” I met Kanye, and we went back down for the second set. It was mayhem after that. I think that was historic.­
THC: You have received enormous acclaim, and R. Kelly came to one of your shows and talked about how unique your sound was. How do you stay humble and motivated?
RG: Oh, that’s easy. It’s a gift and can be taken away from you any time. It’s just music, and life doesn’t get old. My mom passed away pretty dramatically out of nowhere recently, so I have a different outlook on life. I know it’s not something you take for granted.

"Live by Night" by Dennis Lehane
Hey you.... yes you, you in the fedora, I’m trying to talk to you. Ah, the cold shoulder. Well, fine, have it your way. After all, you’re sitting on the cover of a Dennis Lehane novel; you’ve probably got it all figured out. To me, life at night usually conjures up images of a city’s dimly lit underworld, or at least a kid reading under the covers with a flashlight long after lights out has been called. Yet, here we have a fedora-clad man who sits with his back to us, ostensibly staring out at the un-ironically blurred sepia landscape. As we all could do exactly that by day, I see no reason in tampering with an established circadian rhythm.
"Huddleston Road" by John Toomey
“Look, Ma, I drew you a picture.” “Very good dear, now why don’t you finish coloring it in?” This is the exchange I imagine when I look at the cover of John Toomey’s new book, whose front displays a pen rendering of what appears to be a brownstone. A cloudy blue sky above and a touch of red in the top-right corner of the building are the only spots of color, a sort of flag, French or American—have it as you will. Although my OCD tendencies are a little peeved that the house is not completely colored in, I still feel like I would read this book—judging from its cover, of course.
"The Beach at Galle Road" by Joanna Luloff
A beach at sunset. An expanse of sand and palm trees black against the setting sun. A solitary figure promenades along the water, parasol in hand. Not a Jimmy Buffett song, unfortunately. Instead, you’re looking at the cover of Joanna Luloff’s new collection of Sri Lankan stories, “The Beach at Galle Road.” Although the front blurb proclaims Luloff’s book as a “wise and profoundly moving debut,” the inherently clichéd cover hardly merits the same praise. But, I will say, the more I stare at it, the more I wish I were walking along the beautiful Sri Lankan coast rather than sitting at my desk in rainy Cambridge.

“Ancient Light,” the 18th novel by the Irish writer and critic John Banville, is strikingly representative of his oeuvre. Many hallmarks of Banville’s earlier work—including the persistence and unreliability of memory, nostalgia as a means of coping with trauma, prose that ranges from the hauntingly beautiful to the excessive, and the absence of plot—are present to their fullest effect. The novel is the final component of a unnamed trilogy, all narrated by the fictional stage actor Alexander Cleave. Banville concludes his trilogy with observant though sometimes overdone action.
The first two parts of this trilogy, 2000’s “Eclipse” and 2002’s “Shroud,” described Cleave’s decline as a stage actor, his subsequent mental breakdown, and his relationship with his daughter Cass, a tempestuous and headstrong literary scholar. “Shroud” detailed Cass’s association with Axel Vander, a character closely based on the late, controversial Yale professor Paul de Man. “Ancient Light” picks up some time after Cass’s suicide, the event with which “Eclipse” ended. At the outset of the novel, Cleave and his wife Lydia continue to grieve for their dead daughter.
The rest of the narrative runs down two tracks. One is a nostalgic confession where Cleave recounts his first romance. As a 15-year old boy in an Irish small town, he had an affair with Celia Gray, the 36-year-old mother of a friend. In the present, Cleave, now in his mid-60s, makes an unexpected return to the acting profession. Many years after an on-stage breakdown ended his career, he is approached by an independent Hollywood studio with an intriguing offer—a role in “The Invention of the Past,” a biopic on the life of Axel Vander, the same literary critic in whose company Cass took her life.
Cleave is ignorant of Vander’s connection to Cass. He accepts the role despite never acting in a film before, and once on set he meets the film’s leading lady Dawn Devonport, a young woman fresh from a failed suicide attempt of her own. Throughout the novel, Banville shifts focus from Cleave’s childhood romance to his time with Devonport—a technique more stylistically common in film, but one familiar to readers of his other works.
Banville has always been a passionate stylist and is committed to a writing style that often mimics poetry in its weight and meaning. At its best, his writing in “Ancient Light” is luminous. On virtually every page, there are moments of exquisitely fine narration, such as his description of waking up in a house without central heating: “Our houses on spring mornings such as this one had a special chill that gave a sharp, lacquered edge to everything, as if the air had turned to waterglass overnight.” Best of all are the scenes of Cleave and Celia Gray’s romance. Here, the prose captures fully the strange and awkward tenderness of a 15-year old who is as bemused as he is enraptured, and his love for a woman as old as his mother “but otherwise as unlike her as could be.”
Cleave is acutely self-conscious both about his need to remember the past as well as about the unreliability of his memory. Yet his memory of Celia Gray, whether accurate or imagined, is clearly as real and important to him as the present. Even more than in the earlier novels in the trilogy, Banville’s writing is blackly comedic; indeed, this may be his most humorous novel. It is full of deliciously apt ruminations: “Her name was Celia. Celia Gray. It does not sound quite right, does it, that combination? Women’s married names never sound right, in my opinion. Is it that they all marry the wrong men, or at any rate men with the wrong surnames?” Cleave’s discursive, slightly rambling narrative tone is moving and enjoyable.
As with all of Banville’s work, however, his writing flourishes are often taken to excess. For every few phrases that are suitably beautiful, there are some that do not work. “Time and Memory are a fussy firm of interior decorators, though, always shifting the furniture about and redesigning and even reassigning rooms,” he writes. At moments like this, Banville’s intellectual ambition over-reaches itself. He has moderated his love for 10-dollar words—what the critic Jessica Winter once described as his “famously torrid affair with his thesaurus”—but every so often, they creep into the first-person narration, such as when Cleave describes himself as “maculate,” hardly a word that most writers, let alone an actor, would know or use.
Banville over-reaches as well with some of his post-modern novelistic games. To name a priest Father Priest is an unfunny joke; to insert a version of the author himself as the unauthorized biographer of Axel Vander is a hackneyed gesture. Worst of all is the passage in which Cleave lists a number of literary theorists he has “vaguely heard of, with striking and difficult names,” and pauses to admire in particular the name “Paul de Man,” on whom Banville modeled Vander. This sort of knowing wink to the reader is wearying and even silly. It demeans a writer of Banville’s gifts.
The major weakness of “Ancient Light,” however, lies is not in its moments of gimmickry but in its vagueness. Why would a Hollywood studio take a chance on a relatively obscure 60-something stage actor with no screen experience? Why does Celia Gray embark on an affair with a boy too young to shave? By not even attempting to consider such basic questions, the novel risks rendering its own plot unintentionally absurd. This evasion prevents “Ancient Light” from being a classic Banville novel like “The Book of Evidence” or “The Sea,” but it is still a rich and involving minor work. Like Bernhard Schlink’s “The Reader,” a novel whose central love affair features protagonists identical in age to this one, “Ancient Light” beautifully describes a bizarre romance. Ultimately, though, the book is worse off for circumventing the practical question of why such a romance could occur.

From the tumblr phenomenon “Disney Hipster” to the TV show “Grimm,” fairy tales seem to be everywhere these days. “Star Ash”—a new play by Cassandra L. Rasmussen ’13 running at the Loeb Ex from October 5-7 and October 11-13—explores how these stories have the potential to both bind people together and set them free. The play, which shuttles backwards and forwards in time, traces three generations of women in a single family, all linked by the story they tell in times of strife. While not without flaws, “Star Ash” succeeds in creating an air of the otherworldly, helped along by some solid acting and strong artistic decisions.
Like some arcane rite, the play begins with ringing bells that create a mystical tension in the air and sets the stage for what’s to come. From here the various threads of the story are introduced: Eva and Maja (Kathleen S. O’Beirne ’15 and Anissa Y. Mak ’13) are two sisters in 19th-century Europe about to separate forever. Helen (Charlene S. Hong ’14) is a mother during World War II struggling to keep her emotions in check and her child Angelica (Alona Bach ’16) in line. Jenny (Nancyrose Houston ’15) is a young woman in the present, grieving the recent death of her mother, Adela (Rachel A. Gibian ’15), and chafing under the unwelcome attention of her aunt Carmen (Lelaina E. Vogel ’15). The exact connection that the groups of women have to each other takes some time and mental effort to untangle, but one string remains constant: the fairy tale that is passed down from one generation to the next about a girl trying to reach the stars.
Hong, Bach, and Gibian gave far and away the strongest performances of the show. Hong plays Helen as woman pulled in every direction by different needs she can’t satisfy. Bach, as Angelica, is able to capture both moments of innocence and instances when, trying desperately to please her broken mother, she is forced to cast her childhood aside. “Why won’t you eat what I grow?” Hong wails, as she translates her daughter’s refusal to eat the vegetables she worked so hard to cultivate into an assault on her ability as a mother, at which point Bach sheepishly pipes up that the vegetables are moldy. Scenes like this, with Bach’s character trying desperately to keep Hong’s from cracking but succeeding only in making things worse, are electric in the hands of such capable actors. While some of the other pairings struggle to make their relationship and age difference believable, these two were utterly convincing.
Gibian is the other standout. Her character has already died by the time the play starts, but she haunts her daughter, speaking to her and calling her back to look further and further into the past. Her facial expression, tinged with sadness at all times, conveys the deeper emotions of her character even when she has no lines to speak.
Some smart choices in set design (by set designer Sarah M. Batista-Pereira ’13 and set adviser Christopher M. Wankel ’13) facilitate the play’s complex chronology. The present is grounded in a fully furnished kitchen placed at the back of the stage, but for scenes in the past, the actors step forward and perform things out in pantomime, acting out their actions instead of using props. The weighty physicality of the present against the ghostly spareness of the past is both an interesting contrast and a practical decision. The play hinges on the ability to move seemlessly from the present to the past, and the spartan set  removes the need for disruptive set changes that would destroy the flow of the story. The use of paper screens, behind which “shadow plays” are performed add an aura of mystery. The imaginative design helps draw viewers in and gives the actors more freedom than a bulky conventional set would allow.
The play is not without flaws, however. The decision to dye pink streaks into Mak and O’Beirne’s intricate braids makes them look more like hipsters than women from the 1800s. And while there are plenty of great poetic lines, some of the metaphors seem forced from the mouths of Jenny and Carmen. Their ages are hard to get a handle on as well: if Jenny is old enough to have a full-time job, why does she act like a teenager? This confusion is largely due to Houston’s relatively weak performance: her portrayal of her character is one-dimensional ,pouty, and sarcastic.
“Star Ash” succeeds more in the avant-garde elements than in the conventional: while some of the modern domestic scenes may flag a little, the inventive staging, back-and-forth chronology, and poetry of the script succeed in casting a spell.

“Normal people do not hold trials in their living rooms,” says Bill (Brandan S. Griffin ’16) to his sister and father between verbal spars. And yet normal people do go through the absurd motions of accusation, betrayal, and self-denial that are presented so explosively in “Cheating Death,” a dramatic double-tale of troubled families. In the first piece—“Stingers,” a new work written by Andrew J. Boyd ’14 and directed by Sam S. Richman ’15—the screenplay’s crushing wit and masterful presentation of family tensions was paired with excellent direction and a strong cast to create a laudable piece. In “Cheating Death”—which ran in the Adams Pool Theater from October 4-6—“Stingers” was followed by an adaptation of André Gide’s existentialist classic “The Immoralist.” The second piece, however proceeded in fits and starts. The directing  of William H. Ryan ’14—who also wrote the adaptation—was strong in some scenes, yet seemed to sag in others, and while the acting was on par with that of “Stingers,” the reimagined plot failed to live up to Gide’s vision.
The unique brand of despair and dismissiveness found in “Stingers” was centered on the role of attorney Phil Pinkerton (Adam J. Conner ’14, a Crimson business editor), an aging patriarch. His unaccomplished dilettante daughter Nina (Camille Z. Coppola ’14) and good-for-nothing son (Brandan S. Griffin ’16) coerce him into coming to his own retirement party only to turn on him and accuse him of having ruined, among other things, their lives, their mother’s life, and his own moral sensibility. Boyd’s script moves dexterously between many elements: psychological drawing-room warfare, scatological releases (literal and figurative), and the classic frustration of lost hopes.
Connor was unimpeachable in his mix of scruffy faux-cynical humor and guarded vulnerability. His performance, a combination of helpless limping and angry gesticulating, fully related the poignancy of his character. Coppola’s painfully proper voice as Nina came out realistically pencil-thin  and hollowly self-righteous—revealing Nina’s own hypocrisy even as she railed against her father’s. Griffin, the alternately meek son and avaricious parasite of daddy’s patronage, nailed his role with only minor lapses into melodrama.
“The Immoralist” also dealt with these sort of domestic confrontations. Gill (Ari D. Brenner ’14) has been through it all. The prototypical successful man, he’s literally just begun making love to his newlywed wife (Leonie A. Oostrom ’15) when he suddenly falls prey to cancer and finds himself whisked away to a life in hospital beds. When a test later shows that he is in remission, Gill and his wife must now decide what to do with their lives.
The acting was mostly commendable, within the limitations of the play’s rather narrow interpretation of Gide’s novella. In Brenner’s bewildered Gill we had a superb central figure. His voice, ranging from loud and suave to pitifully hopeless, was complemented by the fluidity of his body movements. For example, the way he slowly rolled his head on the bed sheets as he regains consciousness in the hospital was a nuanced gesture. However, Oostrom’s twitching and squeaky fast talk around her sick hubby in the hospital seemed to be more the motions of a seated schoolgirl fighting the need to relieve her bladder than the pain of a genuinely distressed woman. When he came to, her “you’re awake!” was jarringly perky. Oostrum’s strongest acting came out in moments of silence, when her enormously expressive face betrayed all the sorrow and disappointment she has tried to hide from her husband.
Both of these plays dealt with characters who take their families for granted—a theme often communicated by the way actors treated the objects in the room as disposable. In “The Immoralist” nothing was more heart-wrenching about Oostrum’s suffering than when she painstakingly put away the cocktail glasses her husband and his lover (Alice F. Berenson  ’16) had emptied in her absence. Unable even to summon the strength to recork an empty bottle, she was devastated by the revelation that she, like a wine glass that can be cast aside, was an object in Gill’s life.
Lighting and sound effects in both plays were powerful in underscoring the real issues at stake. Especially effective in “Stingers” was the record that Phil gently lifted up and set to play when his children are out—showing his romantic and weaker side. Like Phil, the record is brittle and unsteady—the old-time music it plays sputters and goes out. When his children leave the room Phil stood under a projected shadow of chickenwire fencing, which implied his status of prisoner in his own home.
Regardless of quality of the acting, both plays hinged largely on the quality of the structural confines that actors had to work within. There was no doubt that the leading actors were the strongest in both productions; however, their formidable performances sometimes faltered because of a lacking script or questionable directing.

Next time you are at the theater take a look around you, and don’t be surprised if you are struck by waves of white hair cascading down from the balcony. The Broadway League—the trade association of the New York theater industry—in a 2010-2011 report of audience demographics found that the average age of theater-goers that season was 44, and that all ages under 30 were highly under-represented. The old age of audiences is not a problem unique to Broadway; similar trends have been noticed in theaters everywhere. Why aren’t young people going to the theater, and what moves can be made to attract younger crowds and to save theater-going from dying out along with the current attendees?
The Huntington Theatre Company, in partnership with Boston University, has recently taken action to try to answer these questions and provide solutions. M. Bevin O’Gara, the Associate Producer at the Huntington, believes this trend is largely due to the way modern youth live their lives.  “I used to think that it meant theater is dying, but I don’t really think that’s the case. I think those who have the time and money to sit in the theater and be quiet for two hours are 45 plus,” says O’Gara. “I think there’s a lot of energy and interest from younger generations, but we are so much busier than we used to be.”
O’Gara believes that one way to combat this trend is to make theater-going a more connective social event. “35 Below” is an exclusive promotional “club” created by the Huntington, which offers $25 tickets to patrons aged 35 and under. O’Gara said that the inspiration for the program was serendipitous, and it just involved tweaking a program the Huntington already had. “The idea for ‘35 Below’ actually started out accidentally at a meeting I had with the upper staff, where someone mentioned in passing that tickets for anyone 35 and under were $25 for any show and I said ‘Oh, well I had no idea,” says O’Gara. ”Another staff member said, ‘Why don’t you change that?’ and so we started a program that would spread the word about this ticket price that the Huntington has.”
Having purchased “35 Below” tickets, patrons gain access to after parties that occur four times each season, replete with live music, drinks, and games. Thus, “35 Below” has become more than a simple discount program or publicity stunt. Ryan A. Impagliazzo, a patron and part-time employee of the Huntington, says that the club’s greatest merit is its ability to make theater-going a social event and a fulfilling night out. “I think theater works best when it is an event: dinner before, drinks after, inviting friends for a whole evening rather than just sitting in a dark theater for two hours,” he says.
The creative team at the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) has a different philosophy about attracting audiences to their productions. Jared V. Fine, the Marketing and Communication Manager at the A.R.T., says that the vision of the creative team is centered on crafting an experience for the audience rather than appealing to a specific demographic. Fine believes that the under-representation among younger audiences is rooted in programming choices. “I think if you focus on producing things that are relevant to our society now, you are going to reach the demographics of everyone, rather than just gearing productions towards a certain group. If people see something on stage that they can relate to their own lives, that is going to build a connection,” says Fine.  For him, a good example of this is “Prometheus Bound,” which played last season. While being an older story, it also had lyrics by Stephen Sater, who wrote “Spring Awakening.”
In order to reach a wide and varied demographic, the A.R.T. strives each year to put together a season that will appeal to all ages, classes, and tastes. One certainly sees this when reviewing the list of productions in the A.R.T.’s 2012-2013 season. It began with “Marie Antionette,” a period tragicomedy with a modern spin, ends with the classic and beloved “The Glass Menagerie,” and has everything from epic theater to circus in between. “There is something for everyone,” says Fine.
Boston theater companies are struggling to make theater-going a social event and to cultivate young audiences. Different companies are employing different strategies. “[Boston is] a college town, and there are so many young people here. There’s no reason why they shouldn't be engaging culturally across this city,” O’Gara says. These programs are meant to be long-term solutions and a way of attracting new subscribers.“We want to make Boston a place they want to stay after they graduate,” she says.

Jenna’s Birthday
Oct. 11-12 7:30 p.m.,
Oct. 13 1:30 p.m., 7:30 p.m
Adams Pool
Directed by Sayantan Deb ’14
Produced by Alice Abracen ‘15
Written by Hayley C. Cuccinello ’14
Can you really grow up if you never leave home? “Jenna’s Birthday,” an original play penned by Hayley C. Cuccinello ’14, a Crimson arts executive, grapples with this question and more. Running from October 11 through October 13 at the Adams Pool Theater, the play chronicles a (birth)day-in-the-life of the title character: a twenty-three year old who suffers from a neurological disorder called hemiagnosia which prevents her perceiving her left field of vision, or from escaping the doldrums of her Midwestern hometown.
Though “Jenna’s Birthday” documents a very particular struggle, its overarching themes aim to strike a chord with the Harvard community. “In one sense it’s a play about a girl with a disability…but it’s not about invoking pity. It’s about something more universal: trying to deal with the banality of your life, and trying to grow up on your own terms,” Cuccinello says. “The characters are all youngish people in a fairly boring town and unsatisfied with their lives, and the play is really about them trying to find something more.”
The Adams Pool debut will mark the first time “Jenna’s Birthday” is staged, but Cuccinello’s play already has an impressive track record. In 2010, the play was one of eight winners of the Young Playwright’s Inc. National Playwriting Competition. Following its win, “Jenna’s Birthday” enjoyed a professional reading.
The team behind “Jenna’s Birthday” includes several students who are new to their jobs. This is the directorial debut of Sayantan Deb ’14, and stage manager Madeline R. Zhu ‘14 and set designer Zena M. S. Mengesha ’14 are stepping up to bat for the first time. Deb feels this fits in well with a theme of “Jenna’s Birthday.” “One of the messages that the play tries to get across is to try to trust in yourself and the people in your lives. I think we’ve also lived through developing that trust for each other,” he says.
The themes of “Jenna’s Birthday” will be aided by the relative smallness of the Adams Pool. “The play is quite intimate,” Deb says,. “It’s about bringing the audience into the world of these characters, into small town Appleton, WI. Why does Jenna feel so claustrophobic in this town?...We’re trying to get across this idea of feeling something’s not quite right” he adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Jesus, don’t stare. It’s just a meat painting,” says an older woman in the row behind me. Her husband clears his throat before responding, “I wasn’t,” in a strained whisper.
The theater is dark, and we are waiting for the movie to start. I wonder where this “meat painting” is. I briefly hope that there is a decorated ham somewhere in the theater. Then I remember that my hair is up, and the tattoo of California poppies on the back of my neck is visible to the now conspicuously silent couple seated behind me.
Got it. It’s me. My neck is the meat painting.
I’m not sure what the etiquette here is. Do I introduce myself? Take down my hair to cover the offense? Grab my crotch and yell “punk rock?” I sit there as the show starts, hair up, tongue held, brain humming. I’m not angry or embarrassed. I’m struck by the accuracy of her description: meat painting. Yes, it likens me to an entrée, but it also viscerally hits upon the most compelling and basic facet of tattoos—flesh as canvas. There is no material more difficult to escape. Carve a tree, chisel some marble, and you can leave it behind. Inking skin requires the confidence, however foolhardy, that a chosen image or series of letters is beautiful or important enough to bear on your skin for a lifetime.
The art of the tattoo is situated between the exotic and the quotidian. Tattoos can be ornate and nearly overwhelming in their vibrancy, but even the highest artistry cannot lift them from the day-to-day actions of their wearers. They are present for every snore and tooth-brushing; tattoos are art that you live in.
Social skirmishes and practical concerns aside, tattoos require a unique relationship between work and creator. “There’s a certain feeling of letting go,” says a local tattoo artist who goes by the name Joe Boo. “You let a complete stranger modify you forever…. It’s a very important interaction.”
The allure and the complication at the heart of the tattoo is this: the canvas talks back. The artist does not have the luxury to let their imagination run wild. Flesh, once marked, can’t be erased or crossed out. By the same token, the client, that living canvas, has an emotional and physical stake in the planning and execution of the art.
IN PRIVATE
For some, the idea of such collaboration would be stifling, even terrifying. For Boo, who works at Chameleon Tattoo & Body Piercing, it can be profound.
When I arrived to interview him, the air in Chameleon buzzed with the sound of tattoo machines. Boo is lanky, bearded and, of course, tattooed. A few inches of bright tattoo sleeves are visible between his wrist and his shirt. Boo, who also paints, says that the technique of tattooing relies on sound of the equipment and his own sensation. “You’re listening for a sound…and a certain level of vibration that you can feel in your hands,” Boo says. “I can equate it to driving stick…. You’ll hear what the engine is doing…and you can feel the terrain…. [It’s as] if you could cross driving stick with watercolor paint, or an ink pen.”
The tattoo machine itself, defined by Boo as a “rattling, far-out contraption,” is only part of the process. The clients bring a host of opportunities—and possible complications—to the studio. “Your canvas is going to be very moody and sensitive and prone to moving,” Boo says. “You have to be comfortable with people, and sometimes people can be a pain in the ass.” A prime example is Boo’s first client, who wanted to cover up a name in an intimate area with a series of small black hearts. “Her current old man wasn’t really fired up about whoever’s name was down there,” Boo says. The woman was a difficult customer, refusing to pay the minimum fee of $55, but insisting the work be done. Boo remembers being shocked when his boss consented. “Finally he said, ‘Okay, we’ll do it.’ I was like, ‘Woah, man, you’re going to tattoo that crazy girl?’ And he said, ‘No, you are.’” Boo says. “So my first tattoo was…on that wretched woman’s privates, which was a nightmare…. It took me an hour because I was freaking out the whole time.”
Luckily, that agonizing experience has been followed by many satisfying ones throughout Boo’s career. For him, the client’s attitude dramatically affects his process. “A good day for me isn’t cool tattoos, it’s cool clients,” Boo says. “I’m happy doing a shamrock, I’m happy doing a back piece. I get to hold a tattoo machine—I’m happy.”
In their search for a tattoo artist, many clients look for a connection that resembles friendship more than a business transaction. Joshua L. Boyd ’13, who has 10 tattoos, didn’t meet his favorite artist until he got his fifth. “Our conversations are great…. It’s just overall a good relationship, good vibe. I trust him,” Boyd says.
A junior at the College, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because she does not want her Jewish grandparents to know about her tattoos, has six pieces all done by the same artist. “I’m in love with him,” she says. “It’s good to have someone who’s really funny and snarky and can keep the conversation going.” She said conversational chemistry is highly important in a tattoo parlor, as having someone to there to talk to distracts from the pain you’re paying to experience.
RISK YA NECK
The antiquated stereotype suggests that tattoos could be found only on hardened individuals who spent most of their time riding motorbikes from one knife fight to the next, with occasional stops to ingest drugs and aggressively ignore personal hygiene. Today, it’s an entirely different scene. “I think it's a very outdated idea at this point,” Cathy Johnson, a tattoo artist at Regeneration Tattoo, wrote in an email due to the time constraints of her work schedule. “In most modern cultures and places, people have realized that tattooing is an art form and a very relevant one.”
Katherine Hinde, an Assistant Professor in Human Evolutionary Biology, is evidence that the culture is shifting. On the inside of her right arm, near the elbow, is a swallow done in blues and greens. Swallows, which migrate over 12,000 miles round trip to return to Capistrano, CA, are a common symbol of homecoming. From an informal survey of professors here at Harvard, it seems that Hinde is one of the few faculty members with visible tattoos. “I’ve seen people look at them and then not remark…. It could be that people are polite, and they don’t want to be invasive,” Hinde says. “Categories of people that were likely to get tattoos in the past were not the categories of people that were usually professors at Harvard.”
Hinde insists that her ink has in no way tempered her professional success. However, she is aware that having tattoos can still be limiting. “Decisions [people] have made about tattoos may constrain their options in the future,” Hinde says. “These things shouldn’t be a handicap.”
Many tattoos no longer are. Pieces which are easy to cover, like Hinde’s, are acceptable even for a professor at Harvard, a development which stands in stark contrast to outdated assumptions surrounding the art. Knuckle and neck tattoos, however, remain a source of contention. Boo has been very strategic about the location of his tattoos. “The world still has very strong opinions about very visible tattoos. I mean, shit, I’ve been in the trade since ’97, and I don’t have anything on my hands or throat. I look really normal in a suit,” Boo says. “Someday I might want to take out a mortgage, stand in front of a judge, talk to cops. I might have to go to a PTA meeting.” Barbed wire neck tattoos and lettered knuckles may still be stigmatized, but those aside, tattoos have entered the mainstream as a form of expression that is at once daring and innocuous.
THE BAD OLD DAYS
With this rise in acceptability, the culture of the tattoo has expanded from its crustier origins to embrace a bumper crop of young adults looking to express themselves. “Oh yeah, everyone gets tattoos now. I think it’s good and bad,” Boo says. He links the old sensations of fear and awe associated with tattoos to a higher level of respect for the artists.  “You know, before it was spooky going into a tattoo shop. You’d go in and there’d be these far-out cavemen…. You’d have to have some nuts to go in there. And now anyone can get them,” Boo says. “Everyone should be able to get their tattoos, but I like that trial-by fire aspect of tattooing…. I feel like the sense of earning it [was] there, and we’re losing that.”
As the fear wanes, so does the conception of the tattoo artist as a creative authority. Although he’s happy to ink a basic design if a client desires it, Boo admits that doing so strips him of his art, at least for that isolated job. “People aren’t respecting the artists,” Boo says. “They just look at us like we’re mechanics. ‘Oh, I want a shamrock. Put a shamrock on me.’”
When clients come into the parlor with fixed ideas of what they want, the process is faster and more straightforward, but not as stimulating for the artist. “My ideal client is someone who knows themselves well enough to have a clear idea of what they like but also someone who appreciates my work and trusts me enough to design the piece with a reasonable amount of freedom,” Johnson says.
Trust is the essential word here. It seems as if clients are split between trusting their artist and trusting themselves—and, frequently, the latter wins. As a result, the trend of found images or lettering tattoos is gaining momentum. Hinde has retained control over her tattoo designs by bringing found images to her artists. “I didn’t want [the artist] to feel like they were just [a] stencilist and didn’t have any creative input into what was done, but at the same time I didn’t want to be perceived as rude or end up with a tattoo I didn’t really want on my body,” Hinde says.
Her tattoos have acted as powerful and overt symbols in her life.  When her brother suffered massive skull trauma in 2006, Hinde immediately flew home from an international conference. She remembers sitting at his hospital bed with her mother. “I remember my mom kept turning to me and saying ‘Thank you, thank you for coming home.’ And I remember literally pointing to my [swallow] tattoo and saying ‘I don’t just have this because it’s pretty, mom. I have this because of what it means,’” Hinde says. “This is why I love my tattoos. I love them because they’re symbols of real experiences in my life and of things that have incredibly deep meaning for me.”
Tried and true symbols—such as the swallow—or other fixed designs offer the comfort of controlling the outcome and deep personal meaning behind the design. Asking an artist to design a piece has an element of risk that is not always appealing to a client who will wear the work permanently.
For Boyd, complex personal symbolism matters more than pure aesthetic appeal. “I definitely like to attach meaning to my tattoos,” Boyd says. “I like to get something that I can speak to, that means something to me. I mean, it’s on my body forever.” The idea of a meaningful tattoo is profoundly satisfying for most clients, but it also complicates the art form as it suggests that the intrinsic value of the piece is drawn equally, if not more, from the client’s personal experience than art itself.
SAVE THE STORY
In this respect, the art of the tattoo raises one of the most universal artistic questions—is aesthetic value more important than the overarching meaning of an artwork? For the clients I spoke with, meaning is clearly paramount—the aesthetic pleasure of a tattoo is valuable not simply for itself, but for its ability to deliver a deeper meaning. For the artists, the opposite holds.
“The idea that for a tattoo to be good or meaningful there has to be a big elaborate story behind it is false. A great tattoo simply has to look good…. If someone is drawn to an image, [that is] reason enough, and no tattooed person should feel they owe anyone an explanation or elaborate story to justify getting tattooed. If there is a story, that’s great, but a great tattoo doesn't need a story,” Johnson says. From an artistic perspective, there does not have to be meaning behind a tattoo because it is an art form. The piece itself is meaningful and can speak to the client on its own terms as a compelling piece of art, as opposed to an aesthetic narration of their life.
For Boo, a client who approaches their tattoos with this in mind will consider the artist and the style of their piece first and foremost. “If you went into the Museum of Fine Arts…you’re going to like one painting. Might be a Picasso, might be a Matisse. Might be a Michelangelo sculpture or some shit…. You’re really going to make a connection with a particular piece or a particular artist,” he says. This recognition of shared artistic taste allows the client to connect with an artist in a collaboration that Boo considers sacred.
In ideal situations, the understanding between artist and canvas is translated into a shared sense duty to the art itself. “It’s a sacred situation…. Some people come in and they get it. They say ‘I’ve always wanted this. It’s hard to explain.’ It can be emotional. Here I am, modern day medicine man—whatever you want to call me—witchdoctor, artisan...here to help you to get to that place that you need to be,” Boo says.
“Some people like myself are on this weird quest to be covered in tattoos because they feel more natural with them….That’s shit that defies a lot of explanation. And to be the guy that helps people get there? That’s a heavy trip.” When the client and artist form a mutually trusting and creative bond in the name of the art, the resulting tattoos can be stirring and beautiful.
Tattoos vacillate between high and low culture, mainstream and hardcore, and between artist and client. They can be beautiful, daring, and sexy. For every tattoo that is regretted when the client grows up or sobers up, there are pieces that ringingly affirm that tattoo is an art form in its own right. But for all the cultural and social complexity that surrounds them, tattoos are, first and foremost, art. For Boo, being a tattoo artist is not a means to an end anymore than tattoos themselves are simply vehicles for self-expression. As he says, “My whole life is tattooing. I don’t do anything else. I wouldn’t want to do anything else. If I’m lucky, I’ll die in a tattoo shop when I’m older. This is it for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Director Rian Johnson has a habit of tinkering with well-worn formulas. His first film “Brick” was a phenomenal riff on film noir set in a modern-day high school. His television directorial debut on “Breaking Bad”—in a bottle episode called “Fly”—peeled away all of that show’s elaborate social engineering and deception to simply have the protagonist and deuteragonist engage in philosophical conversation.
This is all to say that Johnson’s latest film, “Looper,” is not about time travel. I mean, it is technically about time travel, but it’s about time travel in the same way that “Brick” was about high school or “Fly” was about cooking meth. Time travel in “Looper” is a catalyst and a conceit, but it is not the main concern. It is secondary to rumination on fate, memory, identity, sacrifice, and inevitability.
Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), one of the titular Loopers, living a hedonistic life in Kansas, circa 2044. Joe explains that the mob, circa 2074, sends victims back in time, where Loopers hit them with a shotgun blast to the chest and then dispose of a body that technically doesn’t exist.
Near-future Kansas is a smart choice of setting on Johnson’s part: recognizable but just different enough. Odd pipes and paneling jut out of cars that still travel on four wheels and silhouettes of vaguely futuristic helicopters dot the horizon. In the city, the corporatocratic aesthetic of “Blade Runner” is just beginning to dominate the skyscrapers. Outside the city, however, the land is populated by sprawling agriculture and middle-of-nowhere diners serving burnt coffee.
But what exactly is a Looper? Eventually, the mob of the future ties up loose ends and protects itself by sending older hitmen 30 years back in time to be killed by their younger selves. Upon “closing their loop,” the hitmen recieve their pension. This system is upended when an older version of Joe (Bruce Willis) shows up in 2044 but manages to avoid execution. This is called “letting your loop run,” Joe explains, and the consequences are brutal, as illustrated in an ingenious, nightmarish, and tautly-edited sequence that occurs near the start of the film.
In the film’s second act, the two Joes split up. Old Joe embarks the 2044 equivalent of “Would you kill Hitler if you could?” It’s muddy moral territory, as Willis’s character carries a strong motivation, but quickly becomes irredeemable. The sympathetic villain role is perfect for Willis, who has built an impressive action career nearly in spite of his mumbly cadence. He embodies both ruthless and vulnerable.
While Willis is on the hunt, Gordon-Levitt holes up in a farm on the outskirts, waiting for Old Joe to show up. There he meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her young son Cid (Pierce Gagnon). While Blunt’s performance is solid, it is impossible to ignore Gagnon’s. Johnson has made the shrewd decision to base much of Cid’s presence around physical action—not saying anything that he can otherwise convey through body language. In a conversation between Gagnon and Gordon-Levitt, somehow Gordon-Levitt comes across as the less compelling actor.
This is not to say that Gordon-Levitt is not also outstanding. His gradual evolution from callous hitman to motivated defender is fascinating. Armed with a blunderbuss and prosthetics to augment his browline and nose in order to more closely resemble Willis, he makes the tension of waiting for the inevitable showdown compelling, much like Gary Cooper in “High Noon.”
The resemblance cannot be unintentional. Johnson’s cinephilia shines throughout “Looper” without overshadowing the film’s vibrant originality. At one point Johnson mirrors the singular moving shot of Chris Marker’s seminal work, “La Jetee,” also concerned with escaping a causality loop. The Loopers frequent a club named “La Belle Aurore,” a none-too-subtle shoutout to “Casablanca.” Bruce Willis even gets his own hero moment, striding down a dark alleyway, shooting from the hip. It calls to mind, well, vintage Bruce Willis.
Near the film’s beginning, Joe’s boss and Looper head honcho Abe-Jeff Daniels ridicules Joe’s fashion sense. “The movies you’re dressing like are just copying other movies,” he observes casually. But his assertion that film has become circuitous and stagnant is wrong. “Looper” builds upon previous films, rather than shallowly aping them. The film iterates upon their well-worn concepts to create something substantively original, inventive and exceptional. Ingenious, tightly directed, and occasionally funny, “Looper” is the rare film about time travel that transcends its genre.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Being poor sucks, and my kid can’t read.” Jamie Fitzpatrick (Maggie Gyllenhaal) sums up her character’s plight and the oh-so-nuanced tone of “Won’t Back Down” in one line. Much like this masterfully-crafted screenwriting gem, the film is about a woman who won’t back down.
The movie follows Jamie Fitzpatrick (Maggie Gyllenhaal), an optimistic, working-class, single mother on her quest to reform her daughter’s failing public school. After learning of the “Fail Safe Law” that allows parents to takeover failing school districts, Fitzpatrick rallies a team of angry parents and teachers to lead the charge. However, in-fighting, unions, and apathy all work to stymie her attempts. To add a stereotypical, arbitrary time limit, she only has two months to complete a task that usually takes three to five years. Nice white lady starts revolution to save troubled school. We’ve seen it before in “Freedom Writers” and “Dangerous Minds.” To add to the mediocrity, “Won’t Back Down” features forgettable soundtracks and cinematography to remind the audience that it is just more of the same. But unlike other “Save Our School” films, “Won’t Back Down” is a step-by-step manual to produce education reform, not so cleverly disguised behind an emotionally confused leading lady and an underdeveloped script.
While Maggie Gyllenhaal has been praised for her acting chops in films like “Crazy Hearts” and “Secretary,” her portrayal of Jamie Fitzpatrick has the emotional range and approximate depth of an inflatable children’s pool. Fitzpatrick’s upbeat, can-do attitude aids her throughout the film but also ceases to waver, creating a character that bounces between two emotional states: ecstatic happiness and mild disappointment. In multiple scenes, Fitzpatrick alternates crying and laughing such that she cries for five seconds, then laughs for five seconds, then wipes off her running eye make-up and carries on like nothing happened, leaving the audience completely bewildered.
However, while director and co-writer Daniel Barnz provides Gyllenhaal with no means to portray a complex character, Fitzpatrick’s counterpart, Nona Alberts (Viola Davis) compensates for the emotional depth that Fitzpatrick lacks. Davis’ character starts off as a sullen, apathetic, Ferris Bueller-style teacher and blooms into a charismatic and engaging leader, and she masterfully portrays this growth.
While Fitzpatrick and Alberts’ friendship is the main crux of the film, neither their relationship nor any of the other interpersonal connections are successfully developed. The women form a miraculous friendship after only two meetings: the first where Fitzpatrick pleads for Alberts’ help whilst on the brink of tears, and the second where Fitzpatrick pleads for Alberts’ help, whilst crying and laughing at the same time. Without much contest, Alberts joins Fitzpatrick on the dangerous journey that jeopardizes Alberts’ entire lifestyle, friendships, and career. The friendship does not progress far past that of fast-friends, which gives the audience very little substance to connect with.
Fitzpatrick and her sexy, rebellious teaching love interest, Michael Perry (Oscar Isaac) follow a similar pattern. Fitzpatrick meets Perry, invites him to a bar where she works, and ends the scene with a passionate make out session. Suddenly, they are living together. The two only encounter one major conflict during their time as instantaneous lovers, and make up silently in a single scene through Subtle Gazes. This leaves the audience to either discredit the film’s emotional content or believe that Fitzpatrick has an irresistible animal magnetism that has the power to win over and turn on any being within a five-foot radius.
Granted, “Won’t Back Down” is commendable for attempting to tackle the current issues in education reform. However, because the emotional content is lacking, the film falls back on its reform timeline to push the story forward. All that is left is an overly detailed how-to on overthrowing failing schools, overwatched by Maggie Gyllenhaal’s laughing/crying eyes.

“Rocky Horror” drag shows, pot brownies, David Bowie, and an “island of misfit toys” help create the work of art that is “The Perks of Being a Wallflower.” With composition like a oil painting, warm and blended, “Wallflower” does justice to Stephen Chbosky’s heartwarming coming-of-age tale with superb acting and a very realistic script.
From the very beginning, the movie captures an indie feel with soft music by a band you probably haven’t heard of (The Samples) and opening credits in typewriter Courier. Within the first few minutes, viewers are introduced to Charlie (Logan Lerman), an easily lovable high school freshman who suffers from problems he can’t quite verbalize. The friends he makes, specifically Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), help Charlie participate in life rather than just observe from afar as a wallflower.
The film centers around lessons of friendship, family, and love. One of the most touching scenes is when Sam organizes a Secret Santa game and Charlie gives everyone perfect gifts even though he’s known them only for a few weeks. Their stoner friend Bob, in the midst of blowing bubbles, whispers, “He knows me.” Charlie, as declared by Patrick, sees and understands people past the facade they adopt. As they open their respective presents, the teenagers act just the right amount of awkward and awestruck. Charlie stands there innocently, with a shy smile showing that he too feels a bit uncomfortable, but because he has given them so much of himself. Charlie is the film’s wallflower: quiet, perched in a corner, observing, learning, and loving. The character is so tangible and real he could be the boy sitting in the back of your math class.
All of the characters in Chbosky’s work are both complex and convincing. There is a certain realism within the movie, made tangible by the script and acting. Contrastingly, the movie is not shot in extremely crisp high-definition. Rather, it’s a more blurred view of the world, with focus subtly shifting as the camera moves so that it feels like you’re seeing things through your own eyes. The teenagers actually speak like teenagers, without any strange phrases being forcibly thrown into their lingo in order to seem age-appropriate. On the acting front, you forget that Emma Watson is Emma Watson, something very hard to accomplish especially after her being a main character in a eight-part major motion picture. She becomes Sam, who cares for Charlie deeply, and Charlie loves her dearly in return. They have a pure and enviable form of love, and thankfully, it’s not teenage gag-worthy love, but rather a mature type.
Music also plays a huge role in the movie and in the characters’ lives mostly because Charlie uses mix tapes and songs to express how he’s feeling. Together the music he chooses and the music that goes along with the scenes is what romanticizes the movie’s portrayal of teenage life. One of the most memorable moments revolves around a popular David Bowie song, “Heroes,” which plays as Patrick, Sam, and Charlie speed through a tunnel. At one point, Sam stands up on the backseat of the car, her arms spread out, with Bowie singing, “We could be heroes, just for one day.” In any other movie, this scene could have been the epitome of cliche. However, because everything thus far has been so realistic, a somewhat silly scene is actually enhanced in importance by Bowie’s song, which fits perfectly.
This pattern of realism and romanticism allows audiences to understand Chbosky’s points. The first is that things that may seem silly may actually be some of the most important aspects of a teenager’s life. Chbosky affirms that there’s a reason why those things are important, and that as adults people can find importance in them, too.  Even someone like Charlie, who nobody knew and who experienced pain in his past, is able to move forward and change his life and those of the people around him. Ultimately, Chbosky empowers teenagers and shows them there’s life beyond the angsty teenager stereotype.

Boston’s annual Fashion Week took place between September 27 and October 6, but four companies skipped the catwalk and strutted straight into the urban-chic new world of fashion trucks. What exactly is a fashion truck? Angela Schipano, who runs the a fashion truck with friend Tiffany Crews, says, “Take the truck, minus the food, throw in kicks and apparel...that’s kind of what [we’re about].” With items ranging from vintage to modern hand-printed, these four companies are taking on the northeast, one sidewalk sale at a time.
ARTichoke
ARTichoke, run by Cape Cod sisters Kate and Lizzy Escher, merges their love of all things natural with a passion for independent art. ARTichoke sells screen-printed vests, dresses, tees, and hoodies all designed by local artists and caters to a wide variety of people. “We have some really indie graphic designs, but we also have nature-inspired designs that my Nana rocks in her nursing home, and she’s like 93 years old,” says Kate Escher. The Eschers try to reinvest in the community as well by donating 10% of their profits to the American Community Gardening Association. Their down-to-earth pieces bring a bit of colorful funky flair to classic casual styles.
Lola's Urban Vintage
Nicoletta Lyons, more commonly known as Lola, describes herself as the kind of artist who follows no trends. Her statement is backed by her wild-but-fresh designs, including some fierce feathered heels and metal statement necklaces. “My pieces reflect a girl who wants to be different,” says Lyons, and from the moment you enter her truck, you’ll see what she means. No two pieces are alike, although they draw on what she describes as “urban landscape and vintage” with cheetah-patterns and quirky-cute gauzy layers matched with just the right amount of hard metal to give any outfit a distinct edge.
Sneakerbox
As a team of women in a predominantly male-dominated field, Tiffany Crews and Angela Schipano are two laid-back ladies bringing their love of top-quality kicks to the urban streets. Both women say that their idea to sell “sneakers off of a truck” started as a joke, but once their idea got rolling (figuratively and literally), there was no stopping them. “We plan to carry our own brand in the future, but right now we just carry a bunch of different brands,” says Schipano. When asked about her favorite sneakers of all time, Crews pointed instantly to a painting in the back of the truck, featuring a pair of Nike Air Jordan 11 Concords. Crews and Schipano are serious about streetwear, but also integrated a few jokes into their truck – the side of the truck is decorated like a shoe tag, and the barcode numbers represent their birthdays.
Brkfst Clb
Brkfst Clb, which stands for “Bringing Resources and Knowledge For Solutions Today,” is a fashion company that is making waves among the city’s youth. Boston native Taymullah Abdur-rahman was working as a prison counselor when he noticed that the inmate population was growing younger and younger. Realizing he needed to make a change earlier in children’s lives, he began teaching life skills in schools and offered the city’s youth a chance to create shirt designs based on individual research into an artist or philosopher’s life. He now sells shirts and hats with these designs, allowing the students to make money off of their endeavors. “At a certain point, a kid wants to make some money, and that’s when they start selling drugs – basketball’s not ever going to stop them doing that. This way, they’re into fashion, they’re into being creative, and they can earn a dollar,” says Abdur-rahman.

The Lowell House bells, a collection of 17 Russian bells, originally came from the St. Danilov Monastery in Moscow. They were given as a gift to the house in 1930. The bells are rung on Sunday afternoons from 1 pm to 1:30 pm. Some Havardians love the bells while others maintain that they’re a nuisance.
PRO: By Christine A. Hurd
As a Lowellian resident, I once held the esteemed, informed opinion that the Lowell Bells suck. However, much as C.S. Lewis once lamented that he was angry there was no God, only to become God’s biggest fan, I have converted to the much more psychologically comfortable opinion that they are awesome.
We’re just not using them to their full potential.
As a primer for this argument, let me just say that when people come to a city for college, it seems weird to complain about two things: noise and nicotine pollution. “Oh yes, I absolutely want to study in absolute silence, which is why I am thrilled about living in a city! Also, I have asthma and want fresh country air to breathe.” Also, it is societally acceptable to complain about the Lowell bells and that one girl who stands outside of Lowell House chain-smoking. What about the pan-flautists in the Square? What about the constant Mass Ave. traffic? What about the Owl and the Fly?
I always thought that the Owl and the Fly sounded like a rejected Aesop’s fable. The moral of that story is that it doesn’t matter how goddamn noisy you are, you’ll get a great job regardless. But, we could use the Lowell House bells in order to give a different moral story: that of the Ant and the Grasshopper. You reap what you goddamn sow.
Every time those fine establishments play music at odd hours, we should just start ringing the Lowell bells instead of wringing our hands. Instead of three calls to the Cambridge police, a well-rung “Dies Irae” will stop all festivities. It might wake up everyone a mile around, but a fresh reminder of one’s mortality by Mozart is always more welcome than a dubstep remix of “Call Me Maybe.”
Counterfactuals aside, the Lowell Bells serve one purpose that no other contraption can. They can be used to mourn the dead. The difference when “Call Me Maybe” is played by the Final Clubs and when it’s played by the bells is that the drooping song of the cold-brushed metal reflects the inherent entropy in life. Basically, they’re saying, “I just met you, and this is crazy, but entropy is always increasing in a closed, isolated system, so stop caring. Bitch.”
It’s fifteen minutes on a Sunday at 1 p.m. It’s telling you that brunch is over. Get your face out of the Boston Cream Cake and stop the weekend haze. It’s your wake-up call--your friendly, Russian wake up call. In Soviet Russia, you wake the bells and the bells wake you.

Once, dear reader, I was like you. I romanticized those Lowell Bells. I mean, the 17 of them made it here all the way from Russia. That’s dedication. And they’re beautiful. They’re historic. They just scream “OPPORTUNITY!” They’re so Harvard.
But let me tell you a secret: I dated someone in Lowell last year. (Scandalous, I know.) As tends to happen, I developed a lot of “feelings” during that time. At first, I thought I could resist. I sleep heavy. I own earplugs. I’m resilient. But Sunday after Sunday, I kept coming back, and slowly the bells took their toll. I could spill my heart about what it’s like, but who can out woe Poe? He, too, clearly had a lot of feelings, some of which are definitely about those bells.
Before I surrender the page, one last remark: the Lowell bells exist in virtual form. As in, you can play them, according the Lowell website, “in the privacy of your own room.” Intriguing.
“Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
…And the people - ah, the people
They that dwell up in the steeple,
All Alone
And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone”
—Edgar Allan Poe, “The Bells”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My eyes followed the boy as he checked out the girl from across the party.  My fingers twitched as he pointed her out to his friends as a potential target.  My arm flew up as the boy laced the girl’s drink with “some of that special stuff,” and I held it even higher as he slung his own arm around her and drew her to him even when she shrunk from his touch.  “STOP,” read the scrap of paper in my hand.
The facilitators of Camp Harvard’s Sex Signals had handed every freshman in the audience an identical “STOP” sign to display when he or she detected something inappropriate in the skits the group presented that night.  After the scene described above, the actors asked the members of the crowd at what point they had felt compelled to display their signs.  A few people called out, “When he roofied her drink!” or, “When he grabbed her!”  Another yelled, “When she wouldn’t hook up with him!”  The the first two comments inspired quiet murmurs of assent, but the last garnered a number of loud laughs and even a smattering of applause.  The actors chuckled along.
We have heard it said time and time again: rape isn’t funny.  Recent statistics from Harvard’s “Playing It Safe” report this fall revealed that about four rapes were reported to the Harvard University Police Department annually between 2008 and 2010 and that about 11 more rapes per year went unreported.  In light of this and especially in the wake of two stranger rapes on and around campus in August alone, it seems shocking that freshmen receive their sex education by joking about assault.  So why does Harvard bring in a set of actors who do exactly that year after year?
Sex Signals needs to make students laugh to make them listen.  If freshmen were corralled into a room every year to hear a somber lecture on the causes and effects of rape and other forms of sexual assault, many of them might not even show up, and some of the ones who did would likely zone out—texting, surfing the web, or simply daydreaming.  A dynamic, joke-filled performance, on the other hand, keeps the audience interested and entertained.
What’s more, the Sex Signal actors’ jests are designed to expose and then dispel stereotypes or to reveal the ridiculousness and even disgustingness of certain situations.  For example, by having the male in a scene insist that the female take on the role of “Beyoncé trapped in a meat locker,” the Sex Signals troupe explores the concept of the ideal woman (slim, sexy, and submissive) along with the concept of objectification.
The root of the trouble with the Sex Signals program, then, lies in the way students respond to the skits they view.  Of course, the interactive aspect of Sex Signals helps draw the audience into an important conversation they might otherwise ignore.  But when kids use the opportunity to participate as a chance to impress their peers by letting loose with insensitive, sexist jokes, they contribute to a culture in which women are devalued and sexual assaults considered less condemnable.
The one-liner I mentioned earlier does little harm on its own, but it preceded similar stunts throughout the program.  (“What should the girl do next in this situation?” a performer asked at one point.  “Hand job!” a boy enthusiastically replied.)  The fact that not only many of the freshmen in attendance but also the actors responded positively to those antics may have taught some students to mock what should be unmockable issues.
Unlike the performers, the students shouting out disrespectful words in Sex Signals every year lack noble, productive motives for their actions.  That is why, instead of laughing with those students, the performers should take it upon themselves to call out offensive student comments and explain to the crowd why those comments are problematic and where they can lead: to the legitimization of the very sexual harassment the show aims to sensitize the audience against.  Freshmen would still play as big a role in the discussion as they desired, but flippant, rude remarks would end up teaching the class just as much as more thoughtful student input and as the performers’ own wisecracks.
Catharsis Productions, the group behind Sex Signals, advertises the show as “Laugh Out Loud Serious.” In some ways, they may be on the right track—although Sex Signals performers quip about humorless subjects, they do so in an effort to engage the crowd and drive home a larger point about the true gravity of sexual assault and the importance of consent.  But when students chime in with crude comments as well, their jokes are not geared toward a meaningful end.  Rather, by encouraging other undergrads to make light of rape, such japes only benumb the community to one of the most relevant and significant problems it faces.  If the Sex Signals company is not willing to help prevent this, Harvard should find a group that is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During shopping week, I was quickly introduced to the typical gripes about freshman classes at Harvard: “there’s too much reading,” “the exams are brutal,” and of course, “the TFs are terrible.”  But there was one particular complaint reserved for Economics 10: “It has a conservative bias.”  A misunderstanding about the study of economics drives this common misconception.
To liberal students like myself and most other Harvard undergrads, economics can seem like an inherently conservative field.  Traditionally liberal policies, such as a highly progressive income tax, are often grounded in arguments about social equality and fairness.  Conservative policies tend to be rooted in arguments about the efficiency of free markets.  Thus, in a class that focuses on explaining how markets work, students will inevitably be exposed to more arguments used in favor of conservative policy than liberal policy.  This apparent bias is not due to Professor Mankiw’s political leanings, but to the nature of the subject.
Another major reason for the misconceptions about Ec 10 is the confusion between academic economics and policy economics.  Economic policymakers engage in debate about what policies governments “should” employ, including welfare systems and redistributive tax programs.  Ec 10 deals with the fundamentals of academic economics, a field that explicitly avoids making statements about what “ought” to happen, and concentrates on explaining economic data in dispassionate terms.  This means that although it is true that liberal economic policies are not heavily covered in the class, students should recognize that conservative policies are not given any more weight.
The fact that Professor Mankiw uses his own textbook is often used to fuel the argument against Ec 10—students complain that his personal, conservative opinions are given too much weight in the course—but it gives us an easy way to test those allegations.  If Mankiw’s “Principles of Economics” were really a conservative-leaning textbook, then surely it would contrast with that published by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.  Although Mankiw can reasonably be labeled a moderate, Krugman is a veritable liberal firebrand.  But the fundamentals of the two books are the same.
The reason for the textbooks’ similarities is simple—the basic methods of economics taught in Ec 10 are not politically controversial.  There are not competing schools of thought when it comes to the supply and demand curves.  Both books show that taxes generally result in outcomes that create less total surplus than if the market was left to its own devices.  They both also note that government intervention can help avoid market failure and provide some amount of equality that the invisible hand does not.  Critically, neither of these points is itself an argument for government policy; they are non-partisan statements about observable economic outcomes.
Liberal complaints about Ec 10 are nothing new.  In 1997, when Martin Feldstein taught the course, students distributed pamphlets protesting a “conservative bias.” Students aligned with the Occupy movement made headlines last November when they staged a walkout to draw attention to their criticisms of the course.  In an open letter to Professor Greg Mankiw, the students wrote that, “A legitimate academic study of economics must include a critical discussion of both the benefits and flaws of different economic simplifying models.”  It is certainly reasonable to ask that professors consider different interpretations and challenges to controversial theories, but no one would insist that an introductory language course present alternative interpretations of verb conjugations.  Ec 10 deals with the basic language of economics, and there is not much controversy about it.
The open letter written last November said, “we enrolled in Economics 10 hoping to gain a broad and introductory foundation of economic theory that would assist us in our various intellectual pursuits and diverse disciplines.”  That is why I am taking Ec 10, and I believe many of my classmates made the same choice.  The analytical methods and theories presented in Ec 10 are absolutely applicable to a wide range of fields, and it is a shame if students are discouraged from taking the course because of the unwarranted complaints it receives.
Criticizing Ec 10 also does an injustice to Professor Mankiw, whose opinions were made clear in the first lecture when he took a jab at a classic liberal punching bag: George W. Bush.  He projected a picture of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke giving a speech with W standing on his left; above Bush’s head, Mankiw put a speech bubble that read, “What the heck is he talking about?”  Would he make the same joke about Romney?  I think not, but I am equally convinced that Mankiw’s Ec 10 is fair and balanced, and that anyone who does not take the course out of fear of being brainwashed by right-wing economic theory is only doing detriment to him or herself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With each passing summer, early autumn is heralded by a number of familiar signs: the leaves turning brilliant shades of yellows and reds, a reduction in the number of joggers on the Charles, and the announcement of the most prestigious awards in all of science, the Nobel Prizes. This year, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for pioneering research in cellular reprogramming, which could be incredibly beneficial for medical treatments involving stem cells. The Physics Prize was granted to Serge Haroche and David J. Wineland ’70 for developing methods to directly observe quantum states of atoms and photons, which could revolutionize computing technology.
And while most Nobel Prize winners complete their research decades prior to winning their award, there are a number of compelling results being published each week. This past week, Dougal Ritson and John D. Sutherland of the University of Cambridge published a paper demonstrating that complex organic chemicals required for life can be generated using compounds as simple as hydrogen cyanide. Perhaps the most interesting unanswered scientific question in the universe after, “How was the universe created?” is, “How did organic life come to be?” Since the life we observe in nature is replicated from existing life, the question of abiogenesis—how complex, reproducible, organic systems were derived through simple chemistry—is non-trivial. The first major experiment to tackle this question was the Miller-Urey experiment in 1953.
Harold C. Urey, recipient of the 1934 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of heavy water, and his graduate student Stanley L. Miller took on the problem of abiogenesis by attempting to simulate the early atmospheric environment. Their model contained a simple collection of gases, including water vapor, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen gas, in a simple glass setup containing a heater, a condenser, and an electrical spark to simulate the heating and cooling processes in the atmosphere, as well as the energy supplied by a natural event like lightning. Amino acids are the basic building blocks of the proteins that make up every known form of life. Of the 20 amino acids in our biology, 11 of them were identified by Miller and Urey, and later analysis of their experiment demonstrated that all 20 amino acids had in fact been found.
But there is much more to life than just proteins. The central dogma of molecular biology as coined by Francis H. C. Crick describes the flow of information in life proceeding from DNA, transcribed to RNA, and translated to the protein chains that make up most of life. While this is the general procedure of information transfer in living systems, there are a number of exceptions, and Crick later admitted that perhaps the word “dogma” was not the best term for the process. The breakthrough of Ritson and Sutherland, then, was in determining that compounds necessary for RNA, in addition to proteins, could be completely constructed from basic, inorganic compounds given standard environmental conditions.
Though there are several kinds of RNA, each RNA molecule consists primarily of a ribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nucleotide base. Every sequence of three bases codes for a specific amino acid. In a 2009 paper, Sutherland’s group was able to form three-ringed structures completely encoding for cytosine using simple compounds. Their starting point, however, were relatively simple organic molecules, all of which may have come to exist in a prebiotic world. The breakthrough in the recent paper was the ability to generate those compounds out of simple hydrogen cyanide, using copper as a catalyst. Given that hydrogen cyanide has been found even in stars, a process describing life forming naturally using mainly hydrogen cyanide seems a more plausible explanation for abiogenesis. While there is much work to be done, this is a great leap forward for the field.
Understanding how life came to be is a question that has stirred our species since the dawn of philosophy and science. Having a reproducible, scientific model of this process is certainly a breakthrough for scientific reasons, but I would additionally argue that it is a boon for theology in that a seamless, functioning biological system derived purely from chemical and physical systems would be beautifully designed indeed. Regardless, there are many more mysteries to be unlocked, and I look forward to following the coming decades of progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A presidential debate has the potential to bring more clarity to voters about the candidates' stances, but last week’s content was far from achieving that ideal. While it is true that a cumbersome format and problematic moderation contributed to the substandard quality of the debate, the most unproductive aspect, it seems, was Mitt Romney’s choice to forego his own policy plan in front of a a national audience, and to fabricate what amounts to an alternative reality of policy plans, rather than engage in a direct dialogue with President Obama.
While it is true that Obama’s came across as somewhat listless and off-kilter last Wednesday, he at least attempted to engage Romney in a substantive discussion of their major differences in economic policy. Early on in the debate, Obama directly challenged Romney regarding his plans to cut taxes for the wealthy, to which Romney responded by saying that he is “not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.” This is, at the very least, an obfuscation of the facts, as a quick look at Romney’s policy plans reveals. In addition to ending the estate tax and the gift tax, Romney plans to drop the top tax rate for those with the highest incomes from 35 percent to 28 percent.
While discussing healthcare policy, Romney responded to Obama’s allegations about his plan not covering pre-existing conditions with another false claim. He said, “And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on—on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That’s part of my health care plan.” That is not part of Romney’s health care plan.
The very medium of debate is debased when one candidate chooses to make up policy on the spot. If citizens walk away with anything useful from last week’s debate, it should be a reinforced skepticism of Mitt Romney’s suitability for the job of being President. As President Obama pointed out, “At some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they’re too good?” The American people have an answer to this question. Last week’s debate demonstrated to us all that Mitt Romney’s plans are weak, insubstantial, and prone to constant transformation, just like the candidate who has proposed them.

Lobsang Sangay—the prime minister of the Central Tibetan Administration—expressed his hope for a dialogue for peace between Tibet and China in a lecture on Tuesday in the Tsai Auditorium.
Sangay, a Harvard Law School graduate, explained that the Tibetan government-in-exile is pushing for a resolution through the establishment of an administrative mechanism to unite all Tibetans under one government, rather than a territorial demarcation.
Cooperation between China and Tibet is not impossible, Sangay emphasized.
“Historically, Chinese and Tibetans have lived peacefully side by side,” he said. “Dialogue is the way to resolve the issue of Tibet. These are difficult issues and you have to use terms that are not to the liking of both sides.”
Sangay criticized the “hard-lined policy” of the Chinese government. Walking the streets of Lhasa, he recalled talking to villagers who told him that “every 20 meters, there is a checkpoint. Even buying a vegetable or going to market is cumbersome and difficult. There are more military personnel here than monks.”
To questioning from the audience that Chinese occupation has improved the life of many Tibetans, Sangay responded, “Just because you have solar power, water, and toilets, should you exchange that for freedom? That is the fundamental question?”
The discussion about a Tibetan dialogue comes in the wake of numerous self-immolations of Tibetans in recent years. Sangay highlighted the Central Tibetan Administration’s stance on these actions. “We do not encourage any protests inside Tibet because of harsh consequences. Someone protests, you get arrested, sometimes you disappear. But once it takes place it becomes our sacred duty to support the aspiration and share with the world what happened,” he said.
He maintained that this question of global image ensures that it is in China’s best interests to reach an agreement.
“Many people look at China as the next superpower, rising power. China is spending millions on soft power, and Chinese people generally like to be seen as good human beings,” Sangay said. “But what’s happening in Tibet negates all that. If China wants respect from the rest of the world, and wants to be seen as a peaceful power, they must show it in Tibet.”
The Tibetan prime minister remains hopeful that a peaceful resolution is in the works. He concluded his lecture, saying, “it is a difficult issue, but it can be solved and we will solve it.”
The lecture attracted an international audience, including representatives from both sides of the issue.
Alan Ma, who is visiting Cambridge from China, said he came to the event because he was interested in hearing a different perspective on the issue.
“The Chinese government shows things in a different light than the American government. I want to understand the difference between them, things which we Chinese might misunderstand about the situation.”

Hans Rosling’s mother, who suffered from tuberculosis, wanted her son to become a doctor. But he wanted to study the social sciences and economics.
“I think I ended up in public health as a compromise between those two strong wills,” he said.
Now a professor of international public health at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Rosling will join an elite group of public service leaders as this year’s recipient of the Harvard Foundation’s Rev. Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award. He will accept the award—which counts Desmond M. Tutu, Kofi Annan, and Thorbjørn Jagland among its past winners—on Oct. 24, The Harvard Foundation announced late last week.
“I feel as confused as a sportscaster would feel if he would win a gold medal at the Olympics just by talking about the performance of the athletes,” Rosling wrote in an email to The Crimson, because he could not be reached by phone. “The other award winners have done something for the world; I have just talked about it.”
In addition to teaching, Rosling co-founded Sweden’s Doctors Without Borders and Gapminder, an internet-based non-profit “fact tank” dedicated to promoting sustainable global development and the fulfillment of the U.N. Millennium Development Goals.
But he said that he found his years as a district medical officer working with female farmers in northern Mozambique to be the most challenging and fulfilling of his professional career.
“To listen to their life stories made me somewhat understand the depth and sufferings of extreme poverty,” he wrote. “It was the most meaningful intellectual experience of my academic life to realize that I would never have gained the same understanding without the face-to-face, human communication on the floor in their very humble homes.”
The Harvard Foundation, which aims to improve race relations and the overall quality of life at the University, will host a ceremony in honor of Rosling in Winthrop House. On Oct. 25, Rosling will give the Pickard Lecture for the Harvard Statistics Department, where he will discuss his work on global health disparities.
“Eliminating the health component and consequences of absolute poverty” remains the world’s largest challenge, Rosling said. “The world has become much better, but it is still far from good.”

A company founded by a Harvard professor and a College graduate will launch its inhalable energy supplement product, AeroShot Energy, next month.
The product, which works in similar fashion to an inhaler, gives its user a boost of caffeine. While AeroShot Energy initially went on sale only at 300 stores in the Boston and New York areas, within the next month AeroDesigns, which sells and markets the energy supplement, will expand its distribution nationwide to 20,000 major convenience stores. This growth follows the recent approval the company received from the Food and Drug Administration, which had in March questioned the wording in the product description.
AeroDesigns Director of Operations Jon T. Staff ’10 said that AeroShot Energy inventor David A. Edwards, a professor of biomedical engineering, began his exploration to answer one question: “What would it be like to breathe food?”
Edwards set out on his experimentation with “no commercial intention,” Staff said. Edwards’s invention, Staff added, proved to be an “exciting” fusion of art and science, presenting “a new way of introducing products into the world.”
The energy supplement was received “really well,” Edwards said in a phone interview from Switzerland, where he was meeting with investors. “It’s been amazing.”
“Sales have been really, really strong,” Staff said. “The number of units sold per week has exceeded our expectations” prompting AeroDesigns to expand from regional to national markets. AeroDesigns hopes to expand to Europe in the next year, Staff said.
After the FDA raised concerns over the wording of the product’s label, AeroDesigns “described the product a little differently” on the package, Staff said. “Whenever there is something this innovative, there is going to be some conversation. The laws were not written with a product like this in mind.”
Edwards, who called the FDA’s June decision a “favorable opinion,” said that thousands of consumers regularly use the product a few times a week. Heavy users of AeroShot are most often between 18 and 30 years old, with the stimulant particularly attracting athletes and college students, Staff said. These users, he added, are made up of both men and women, “bucking the trend of energy products.” Men generally make up a greater percentage of energy product consumption.
In July, AeroShot Energy was named the Best New Product by Efficient Collaborative Retail Marketing, a trade show of leading buyers for the big, national chains for large retailers.
The AeroShot model is not limited to energy supplements, according to Staff. “The ambition and the opportunity of this company is in delivering all sorts of foods and nutrients” through inhalable supplements,” he said.
For now, though, Staff said he uses AeroShot everyday. “Apple is my favorite flavor.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 10
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that AeroShot Energy is currently on sale in just 300 stores. In fact, while it initially went on sale in 300 stores, it is currently available in 5,000 stores. In addition, the article misstated a quote from AeroDesigns Director of Operations Jon T. Staff ’10.

Barnard College president Debora L. Spar addressed the challenges women still face in higher levels of business organizations in the Spangler Auditorium Tuesday, giving the keynote address on the 50th anniversary of the admission of women into the Business School’s two-year M.B.A. program.
Spar, who was formerly a professor at the Business School, praised the feminist movement for opening up new opportunities for women in education and in the workplace. Yet she acknowledged that women’s entrance into positions of power has been much slower, leaving “a subtler set of problems that could not be solved with regulational law.”
The year-long celebration marks 50 years since December 1962, when Business School faculty voted to admit eight women into the two-year M.B.A. program for 1963. Since then, the percentage of women in the program has risen to 40 percent.
“The truth is we’ve come a long way, but we’re not by any measure where we need to be,” said Youngme E. Moon, a professor at the Business School and chair of the MBA program, who made opening remarks and introduced Spar.
The event, organized by the Business School’s Women’s Student Association, is part of a year-long celebration that will feature guest speakers, a research focus on gender issues, as well as special alumni and classroom events. It will be continued with an address by Princeton professor Anne-Marie Slaughter on Thursday.
“I think people are taking this anniversary really seriously, and we’re seeing it in terms of the attendance you get at an event like this and a general appetite to talk about these issues,” said Deborah J. Singer, a second-year M.B.A. student who is co-president of the Women’s Student Association.
In her address, Spar pointed out that women are matching and passing men in various standards of performance in high school, college, and their early careers. Yet at a certain point, she said, the lives of men and women unfold differently.
“We need to understand those patterns of difference, or we will be condemning women to try to replicate lives that are not going to be easy to sustain,” Spar said.
E. Parker Woltz, the other co-president of the Women’s Student Association, said that while working in consulting before enrolling at the Business School, she never thought of herself as a female professional. Yet, she said she expects this to come later.
“I think it’s critical to be thinking about what’s coming ahead and be prepared for it, and to have a support group of female and male peers who want to talk with you about the issues and will provide support going forward,” Woltz said.

Felix Warneken, an assistant professor of psychology, discussed the question of whether human altruism is a product of biology or environmental conditions Tuesday evening in a seminar organized by the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior.
Scientists like Warneken try to understand whether the characteristic of cooperation is human-specific or shared by our nearest relatives. Biologically, humans are not so different from apes, Warneken said, though our social patterns greatly contrast.
Warneken said that many people like to believe that “humans are clever, apes are dumb.” He showed a video of a chimpanzee trying to get a peanut out of a skinny cylinder. The chimp, after failing to reach in, filled the tube with water and floated the peanut to the top. The video, Warneken said, shows that apes have the ability to problem solve in novel situations.
According to Warneken, children systematically outscore apes in tests of social cognition, such as those measuring understanding, imitation, and inferring from actions.
Yet in tests of physical cognition, he said, which measure the ability to determine the size, amount, or location of objects, children and apes achieved similar scores.
“So it’s not simply that we are smarter. The answer lies elsewhere,” he said.
Warneken also disputed the idea that altruism is due entirely to social norms, noting that it is a characteristic also exhibited by chimpanzees. He showed several videos to the audience, showing chimpanzees and one-year-olds responding situations asking them to assist in opening the door, to pick up a fallen object, or to find a lost spoon.
For both the humans and apes, the rate of helping was very high. The experiments involving children and apes controlled for many factors, he said, noting that rewards, parental presence or behavior, the novelty of the action, and opportunity costs did not influence the results. This, he said, proved that the helping was intrinsically motivated.
The altruism exhibited, he said, is rooted in the shared biology of humans and apes.
“Culture facilitates altruism, and, although it is important, it does not cause the cooperation itself,” he said.
“We try to get professors with interests related to the mind or the brain,” said Allison Gofman ’14, co-president of the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior. “And of course, the kids were adorable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University released an update on its ongoing contract negotiations with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Tuesday afternoon, detailing its position on the overdue contract. The statement was released on Harvard’s labor relations website, and in a letter sent by Marilyn Hausammann, the vice president for human resources, to administrative deans and vice presidents.
Harvard and HUCTW, which represents more than 4,600 of the University’s non-faculty staff, were scheduled to ratify a new contract on July 1. Due to disagreements on issues such as salary increases and health benefits, negotiations have dragged on into the fall. In late September, HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger told The Crimson that there had been “no significant progress” recently.
Hausammann’s letter cited the extended period of negotiations as a reason for the University statement. Though the University typically does not discuss ongoing negotiations “out of respect for the collective bargaining process,” the letter said, “it’s important to share with you details about some of the issues on the table and to dispel several mischaracterizations of the University’s position.”
The letter argued that the wages and benefits of HUCTW members are better than 75 percent of workers in comparable positions in greater Boston, and that HUCTW is asking for salary increases that far exceed what other union and non-union workers are receiving, despite the “global economic downturn” and the University’s diminished endowment.
According to the letter, the union’s proposed health benefits plan would move the burden of over $1.5 million in health care costs of employees making less than $50,000 per year onto higher earners. “That did not meet our test for a fair and equitable agreement,” Hausammann wrote.
According to the letter, the University proposed a contract that included a 2.8 percent wage increase in the first year, along with adjustable raises in subsequent years, in late September. “More than two weeks later, the union leaders have yet to make a counter offer,” Hausammann wrote.
The University remains committed to reaching an agreement that is fair for both sides, the letter stated, but Harvard is “preparing for the bargaining process to continue for some time.”
Hausammann did not return requests for comment.
Jaeger said that publicizing specific economic plans was unusual and counterproductive.
“I don’t think that’s the right way to negotiate,” he said. “This doesn’t make it impossible to keep going and keep trying to find a way to reach a constructive agreement—it just makes it harder.”
Harvard’s Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin declined to comment on Jaeger’s claim.
Jaeger also said that the University’s allegation that the union is not offering solutions to the stalled negotiations is “simply not true.”
“We have very recently put forward very detailed proposals which are trying to break the logjam by working with the idea of connecting wage increases to the rate of inflation,” Jaeger said. “I don’t really know what the University spokespeople are talking about.”
He disputed the letter’s claim that the University is still suffering from the economic recession, referencing the Faculty of Arts and Science’s financial report for the 2012 fiscal year as evidence. It is “a terrific indicator of just how solidly prosperity is returning to the University,” he said.
“Everything that’s coming out about the University’s financial situation would suggest happy days,” Jaeger said.

With Harvard faculty members showing unprecedented financial and public support for colleague Elizabeth Warren’s campaign for U.S. Senate, Harvard’s staff members have also begun to make their choice in the competitive race between the Law School professor and incumbent Senator Scott Brown. Working in the traditionally liberal bastion of Cambridge, many Harvard staff interviewed for this article—ranging from dining hall workers to security guards—say they stand behind Warren.
Blondell Newbon, a card checker in Adams dining hall, ranks the economy and jobs as her top priority this fall.
In the aftermath of the economic meltdown, “we’re still working from paycheck to paycheck,” she said. “We’re going to have to do something.”
For Newbon, that means voting for Warren—or “Elizabeth,” as Newbon calls her.
“I came from a poor background and raised my son alone,” said Newbon, who finds Warren’s middle class upbringing appealing.
According to Newbon, Massachusetts needs Warren’s level-headed approach to politics and strong advocacy for middle-class concerns for the next six years.
“Warren has proven herself,” Emeka F. Onyeagoro, a door checker at Lamont Library, said. “She’s just as capable as Brown in representing the people of Massachusetts.”
He listed her extensive experience as a consumer protection advocate as a reason to vote for her.
According to Onyeagoro, Warren’s Harvard affiliation “has no bearing whatsoever” on his decision.
“I traditionally vote Democratic,” Onyeagoro said simply.
Others echoed Onyeagoro in referencing loyalty to the Democratic Party as the main reason to vote for Warren.
“She’s a Democrat, and I’m a Democrat,” said Jorge P. Teixeira, the Adams House building manager.
He said he has paid attention to Warren’s work with the middle class and the way that she presents herself on the news.
A security guard, who wished to remain unnamed since Securitas policy discourages employees from speaking to the media, noted that although he remains undecided about the presidential race, he has recently begun to lean towards Scott Brown, despite Warren’s connection to Harvard.
When he met Scott Brown on the campaign trail last year, he was immediately struck by Brown’s charisma.
“He’s a more outgoing and personable person,” he said, comparing Brown’s easy manner to Warren’s somewhat stiffer persona.
“When someone makes themselves immediately and directly available to the people, that means the world to me. They’re at your level, part of the team,” he said.
Brown’s background in the military also “scores a lot of points with me,” he said.

Whether promoting English language fluency among Japanese citizens or stressing the importance of clear, straightforward presentations, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the U.S.A. Ichiro Fujisaki cited effective communication as a top priority in an interview with The Crimson Tuesday.
“If you don’t like to communicate with people, then don’t [go into diplomacy]” he said.
Remembering one particular anecdote, Fujisaki said that a Japanese politician recently attempted to convince him that language capabilities were unimportant in many cultural exchanges so long as a skilled interpreter was available.
“I said, ‘You’re wrong, sir,’” Fujisaki recalled. “We pretend it’s just as good, but we can’t really develop the same level of communication always using an interpreter.”
In this vein, Fujisaki has been involved in what he calls the “Reverse JET Program,” which allows newly-minted Japanese English-language teachers to journey to the U.S. for an immersive cultural and linguistic experience. This program is based on the well-established Japan Exchange and Teaching program, in which Americans move to Japan to teach English and fulfill ambassadorial roles.
Fujisaki said he hopes Reverse JET will not only improve the English-language skills of these teachers, but also facilitate “a more international view, and if they can continue contact, they can teach students how Americans or other countries are seeing Japan.”
Fujisaki noted that both American and Japanese education systems feature “some fundamental flaw” in their language programs. As a result, he has tried to promote study abroad and language immersion programs between the two nations. Fujisaki, who studied in Seattle during high school, said that teaching children to learn the languages of neighboring nations may sow seeds of peace.
“You have to try to make it optimistic,” he said. “If people get nasty and have a rather bad feeling about other countries and become nationalistic, then people get even more exclusive,” he said.
He hopes that that optimism also spills over into economics. If people think the economy is suffering, Fujisaki said, they will not invest, but if people are optimistic, the economy will grow.
Fujisaki will return to Japan after the U.S. presidential election as his ambassadorial term comes to a close, but he said his optimism is unlikely to fade.
“81.9 percent of Japanese [individuals] feel an affinity towards Americans, and 84 percent of Americans think of Japan as a trustworthy partner,” he said, citing data from the Cabinet Office and Gallup. The basis for cooperation, he said, is “quite solid.”
Fujisaki later spoke at a well-attended lecture in Tsai Auditorium. The lecture was moderated by Susan J. Pharr, a government professor and the director of Harvard’s program on US-Japan Relations.
“He is terrific,” said Merry I. White ’63, an anthropology professor at Boston University who focuses on Japanese Studies, about Fujisaki.  “He’s kind of a new wave diplomat, and more relaxed in global environments.”
Fujisaki urged young scholars to consider careers in diplomacy only if they were excited about the prospect of juggling my hats. Being an ambassador, Fujisaki said, involves a balancing a reporter’s affinity for finding out what is new, a professor’s ability to analyze deeper meanings, a politician’s communication skills, a hotel manager’s logistical capabilities, and cultural sensitivity.
“Ask yourself if you’d like to do all that juggling at the same time,” he said.  If the answer is yes, then “diplomatic life is good for you.”

When the 35 Harvard students of the River Charles Ensemble convene for rehearsal in the Holden Chapel every Saturday, there are stands, sheets of music, instruments, and players, but one critical component is missing: a conductor.
The new student group, the largest campus orchestra without a conductor, has become an avenue for students interested in playing symphonic pieces in the more intimate chamber-orchestra setting.
“I don’t think there’s enough of an outlet at Harvard where musicians are given more of an active role in the music-making process, especially when you are talking about symphonic pieces,” said Theodore A. Peng ’13, one of the group’s founders. “Usually you are just listening to the conductor at the front. If he says play it this way, you play it this way. If he says play it that way, you play it that way.”
Last spring, Peng, along with Bran S. Shim ’14, Max Tan ’15, and Jeremy Ying ’13, wanted to perform Aaron Copland’s “Appalachian Spring,” an orchestral suite scored for a 13-member chamber orchestra.
After pulling in nine other students, most of whom were members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, the group had difficulty finding an existing organization through which to perform. HRO was too large to have such a subset, and Music 187r, a class in which instrumental chamber music is prepared in private coaching, accommodated a maximum of around 5 players per group.
With no musical channel strictly for their 13-member size, the students decided to create something new and applied for funding through the Office for the Arts.
The formation of their name came about quite impulsively.
“Why don’t we just stick a name on it? Let’s call it the River Charles Ensemble because we’re playing American music and something that has to do with nature,” Peng said.
The morning of the group’s first recital—a performance of “Appalachian Spring” during April’s Arts First festival—the ensemble’s venue was switched from the smaller Adolphus Busch Hall to Sanders Theater.
After this debut, the founders spent the summer planning to develop a group modeled after the New York-based Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. In particular, the group was attracted to OCO’s ‘core’ method, in which the principal players, one from each instrumental part, get together in a small section to develop a basis of interpretation for the rest of the group.
At Monday’s RCE rehearsal, with no one to cue in the various entrances, the players breathed together, followed their respective core principal, looked at each other, and gestured by nodding at the downbeat.
“It’s essentially like chamber music in a full-size orchestra, so it stresses musicality and really listening to other people. It’s not so much about your individual performance but about how you can meld with the entire orchestra,” said oboist Gregory D. Schaefer ’16.
After a run-through of Mozart’s Symphony No. 41, the members descended into an eruption of ‘bums’ and ‘dums’—a vocalization of their parts to help them perfect the dynamics and phrasing of the piece. The flute and oboe worked on the timing of their duet, while the strings debated bow stroke direction.
“Our hope was to give musicians an outlet where they feel comfortable discussing music, arguing about music, sharing their interpretations very openly,” Peng said. “It’s a place where they can develop as a musician by talking about how the music should be played.”
The group’s first concert as an official student group will be Nov. 16 in Memorial Church.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PEABODY, Mass.—What becomes evident very quickly is that most people are not home. It is midday Saturday, and Derek J. Bekebrede ’13 and Samuel L. Coffin ’14 only get to talk to a handful of voters, a select few from the 42 suburban homes they approached along the tree-lined cul-de-sacs here. They ask a few survey questions; they smile when they meet supporters, but, mostly, they tuck campaign literature in between storm doors and walk away.
“Richard Tisei: Honest, Independent-Minded Solutions,” reads one of the fliers.
“Do no harm,” Bekebrede says, by way of explaining the chief rule of canvassing. “You don’t want to disrupt someone’s day because that reflects on the candidate.”
On this quiet mid-October afternoon, about a dozen Harvard and Boston University Republicans are canvassing for U.S. Senator Scott Brown and 6th District Congressional candidate Richard R. Tisei—both moderate Republicans. Their chief task for the day is to find out how independent voters in this swing district are leaning.
Fall canvassing trips like this one are a biennial rite of passage for Harvard College’s politically involved. Blurry-eyed and hopeful young Republicans meet at buses early in the morning and drive somewhere else—away from the securely Democratic Cambridge, to New Hampshire or, as on this recent Saturday, suburban Massachusetts to play foot soldiers in the state’s biggest political ground games.
The day begins with a rush of energy. Stuffed into a large van, the student volunteers jump in their conversation from campaigns, to college Republican happenings, to Republican Club alumni and mutual friends. For new canvassers, expectations run high. For veterans, there is time to trade canvassing notes.
“When you spend as much time as we do working on campus with the Republicans, it’s worth fighting for the candidates you believe in, who share your values,” Bekebrede, the Harvard Republican Club president, later says.
The whole day unfolds mostly uneventfully, from pick-up to canvassing to phone surveying—a testament to modern campaigning. Each house and each voter is targeted: With only a month until election day, time is running out.
Brown officials estimate there are 78,000 registered independent voters in the district. For Brown to win Mass., he will have to out-poll his opponent, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, here.
Tisei will have to win outright, and the hope is that each of the canvassers can help push him and Brown over the edge.
Statistics are hazy and each campaign has its own wisdom, but Bekebrede and Coffin say hand-to-hand campaigning works.
“You’re making a personal connection with people,” Bekebrede says, adding, “It’s definitely worth the effort. Door-to-door is important because I think people like to feel that the campaigns feel that their vote matters.”
To this end, Bekebrede and Coffin are careful. They keep a respectful distance from doorways, and they do not bother homeowners they see at work in the back yard. When they do meet a voter, they are polite and direct. No deviating from the script.
Canvassing can be frustrating, and it takes huge logistical organization. In the course of one afternoon, the volunteers reach 1700 or so independent voters targeted specifically by Massachusetts Republicans. By the day’s end, they have knocked on 657 doors and made 1189 phone calls.
Back at Tisei headquarters, Andrew B. Pardue ’16, Andrew Sun ’16, and Devi R. Nair ’16 take a break from phone banking.
“I am very interested in politics, especially being in the Northeast,” Nair says. “I’m from Texas, so I’m not used to having to fight for my candidate.”
All three say they have not ruled out eventually running for office themselves.
“I’m very interested in politics and, one day, would like to run for office,” Pardue says. “I figured the earlier I got inside a campaign and actually participated, I could see whether I like it or not.”
Thoughts of political futures recede by the afternoon’s end. As the van slides slowly toward Cambridge with the sun setting over Boston, conversation turns to schoolwork and Saturday night plans. Campaigning is done for the day.
“I’m not done with politics,” Bekebrede said earlier in the day. “I never will be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Fitzmagic” fizzled this week, as Buffalo Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 fell short in a 45-3 rout by the San Francisco 49ers. After throwing for 400 yards last week, he failed to find the end zone and was held to 126 passing yards with an interception. The Bills front office maintains that it has confidence in Fitzpatrick and will not look to make any changes in the near future.
While Fitzpatrick struggles, Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk ‘98 can’t seem to get enough of the spotlight. After writing an anti-gay marriage editorial that appeared in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, the 2012 NFL Man of the Year is now appearing in a video on behalf of the Minnesota Marriage Protection Amendment.
The editorial and video have drawn criticism across the board, and one notable dissenter is teammate Brendon Ayanbadejo, whose public stance in favor of gay marriage prompted Birk’s editorial in the first place.
Elsewhere on the gridiron, Oakland Raiders defensive tackle Desmond Bryant ‘09 is on pace to match his 2011 career-high 32 tackles. He has seen action in all four games so far this season, and the Raiders have gone 1-3.
In basketball, Houston Rockets point guard Jeremy Lin ‘10 is back in action. Training camp is in full swing, and Lin, who is six months out of a knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus, appears to be enjoying getting to know his new teammates.  Countdown to Linsanity: Houston Edition—T-minus 20 days.
Lin is back on the hardwood, but Harvard hockey alumni have yet to be allowed on the ice. The current lockout has pushed opening night back to October 25 and wiped 82 games off the schedule. The likes of Louis LeBlanc, formerly ’13, and Alex Killorn ’12 are unlikely to see the inside of the rink anytime soon.
In a disappointing week for Harvard alumni, at least we can rest assured knowing that Jeremy Lin is making money and having fun doing it.

While football standout Andrew Berg may have snagged The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week award, three other Harvard athletes’ stellar performances during this past seven days have earned them recognition as well.
HAI-LI KONG, WOMEN’S TENNIS
At the Tribe Invitational, the freshman stayed flawless in her singles play all weekend, winning the Cherie Dow Singles Flight by claiming two sets over Penn’s Alex Ion, 6-1, 6-0. Kong, who went 3-0 en route to her victory, did not drop a set as she defeated opponents from VCU and Kansas in the semifinals and quarterfinals, respectively. Kong also competed with doubles partner Natalie Blosser to take second in the Katrin Guenther Doubles Flight, losing only to her fellow Crimson teammates Sylvia Li and Amanda Lin.
COLTON CHAPPLE, FOOTBALL
Chapple makes his second consecutive appearance on The Crimson’s AOTW Runners-Up list, while also receiving his second-straight Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week award. The senior started Saturday’s game perfectly, completing his first twelve pass attempts. Chapple maintained his high level of performance throughout the contest, as he passed for a total of 362 yards and four passing touchdowns, three more touchdowns than highly-touted sameCornell quarterback Jeff Mathews threw for in the  game. Chapple, who is currently ranked No. 2 in the nation in passing efficiency, also showed off his ground skills, running for 53 yards and adding a rushing touchdown for good measure. With Chapple at the helm, the Crimson has the longest winning streak in Division I, having won its last 13 games.
NOAH HARRISON, MEN’S WATER POLO
Despite the men’s water polo team dropping all five of their games this weekend, the explosive freshman still managed to turn in outstanding performances throughout. In the contest against Pomona-Pitzer, Harrison led the Crimson with a career high of six goals, giving Harvard the chance for victory with a goal late in the third period, though the Sagehens would eventually prevail. Against No. 2 UC Santa Barbara two days later, Harrison tallied another four goals and showed off his defensive prowess, recording a career-high five defensive steals.

Cutting right, Harvard junior receiver Andrew Berg looked for the ball as he came out of his route. With no pigskin in sight, Berg spotted senior quarterback Colton Chapple quickly scanning the field for a target with his primary and secondary options already covered.
As Cornell defenders prepared to converge on Chapple, Berg sprinted towards the right corner of the end zone as Chapple lofted up a pass into coverage.
Leaping above a Big Red defender, Berg plucked the ball out of the air, tiptoeing his feet in bounds to grab his second touchdown of the day—a score that gave the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) an early two-touchdown lead against Cornell (2-2, 1-1 Ivy) that it never relinquished en route to a 45-13 victory.
“The play was like the scramble drills we do in practice,” Berg said. “We have rules for where we are supposed to be [when Colton scrambles], and he saw me at the last second. It worked out very well.”
After an injury to leading receiver sophomore Seitu Smith earlier in the season and the graduation last year of Chris Lorditch ’11, Alex Sarkisian ’12, and Adam Chrissis ’12—the team’s top three wide receivers from a year ago—this was Berg’s first game as the go-to receiver on his team.
After totaling zero receptions as a freshman and just three as a sophomore, Berg more than doubled his career total in Harvard’s season opener against San Diego, where he had four catches in his first career start.
This season, Berg has played in all four games and leads the team in receiving yards and is tied for the lead in both touchdowns and receptions. His 15.3 yards per catch rank fourth in the Ivy League and he is sixth in the conference in total receiving yardage.
Berg’s three touchdowns on Saturday made him only the fourth Harvard wide receiver to reach the end zone as many times in a single game and the first since 2005.
Berg finished with 10 catches for 132 yards to set career highs in both categories.
“I’ll start off by giving all the credit to the offensive line and Colton,” Berg said. “We had a few injuries on the offensive line this week, so for them to give us time to throw the ball is fantastic. The routes that we had [on Satuday] were perfect for the defense we were playing. Even on some plays where the routes weren’t perfect, we were still able to get a lot of good plays on coverages that didn’t necessarily favor us.”
Harvard piled up 544 yards of total offense with only one turnover, balancing an aerial attack that yielded four touchdowns and 362 yards against a running attack that averaged over four yards-per-carry and added two touchdowns in the second half.
Senior running back Treavor Scales had 106 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries, and Chapple chipped in 53 yards and one more touchdown to finish with five total scores on the day.
The team came out and scored on its first three possessions of the game—all on Chapple passes to Berg—but then only scored three points for the rest of the first three quarters, twice venturing into the red zone and failing to come away with points.
When the fourth quarter began, the Big Red trailed the Crimson by only 11 points, 24-13, before Harvard ran off three straight touchdowns to put the game away. With the win, Chapple improved his career record as a starter to 7-0 over the past two seasons.
The 21 straight points to start the first half extended a streak of nine straight first-half scoring drives going back to last week’s 52-3 victory over Holy Cross. The team has outscored its opponents by a combined 107-16 in the past two weeks.
“Cornell is playing a lot of young guys in the secondary and we knew that was something that we could exploit,” Chapple said. “Having the playmakers like [Berg] and [junior receiver] Ricky [Zorn] on the outside makes it a great matchup all around. You also have to give credit to the offensive line, who has shown that they can protect for 12 seconds. With the way we are running the ball, that makes us very hard to defend.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 10
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the final score of Harvard’s football game against Cornell. It was 45-13, not 41-13. In addition, it misstated the class year of Chris Lorditch ’11 and incorrectly stated that Ryan Fitzpatrick played for the Crimson in 2005. In fact, Fitzpatrick’s final season was 2004.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Cornell football game on Saturday was telling.
The team looks as strong as it has been in about a decade, perhaps longer. The Crimson currently holds the longest win streak in all of Division-I football, a run that dates back to week two of last year. Harvard is ranked No. 21/22 in the FCS. And the team handled the Big Red, the only squad in the league that was expected to contend with Harvard for the Ancient Eight Title.
None of this is the reason that the game was so telling. It was telling because the attendance was 7,112.
In what was probably the most important game in the Ivy League this season, Harvard couldn’t even draw enough fans to fill a quarter of the stadium—even if you assume that the official figure isn’t inflated, which it often is.
Saturday’s game is the latest demonstration of what has been clear for decades now: Ivy League football is in decline. The fact that Harvard cannot draw 10,000 fans in its most interesting game of the season shows that.
At a certain point, Harvard and the rest of the Ivy League will have to make a choice: compete, or stop pretending to try.
There are a number of fundamental issues in Ivy League regulation that holds the league back, the most significant of which is the mandate not to compete in the FCS playoffs.
Yes, I understand the arguments against participating: Harvard-Yale would not be the last game of the season, it would have a negative impact on academics, and it would go against decades-old tradition, to name a few.
The academic argument would be valid—except for the fact that every other varsity team on Harvard’s campus, and even some club teams, can participate in playoffs outside of the Ivies. And what the basketball program at Harvard has taught us is that there’s a very simple recipe for generating interest in a specific sport on campus: win, and compete nationally.
At this point, tradition is the only thing holding the league together. And the Ivy League’s inability (or at least lack of desire) to adapt has driven interest in Ancient Eight football to a low, even as Harvard fields one of its best teams in recent memory.
There are a few short-term solutions that would drive interest in Harvard football. In an interview last year with The Crimson, coach Tim Murphy said that the team would be interested in playing schools like Army, Navy, or Duke.
That’s a start, at least for the Crimson, but I think the program should aim higher. In a weird way, the program would do itself a service by inviting an FBS team to Harvard Stadium, selling 25,000 tickets, and getting killed (whether that’s good for Harvard competitively is a different question). Men’s basketball generated a lot of interest leading up to a game against Michigan at Lavietes in 2007, and the Crimson even managed to pull off a major upset over the Wolverines.
Even if this works, it’s a one-and-done deal that does not do much for the league as a whole. Then there are the gimmicky solutions, like playing the Harvard-Yale game in New York City. But that’s a short-term solution too.
Ultimately, the only real answer is participating in the FCS playoffs. At the moment, from the perspective of would-be casual fans, the teams aren’t playing for anything. Sure, you can argue that there’s pride, or honor, or tradition, but those rewards only draws the most loyal fan base, and an aging one at that.
Fans—and in particular, students—need to see that the team is playing for something more tangible. Participation in the FCS postseason can be that something.
In my brief career covering the football team, I’ve discussed the topic of Ivy participation in the postseason with a wide range of individuals everywhere from press boxes to offices to bars. The weird thing is that everyone seems to agree that they want it and that it’s necessary.
They also agree that there would be a lot of resistance, and they don’t know how it could happen. I don’t have the answer to that question either.
But something has to change, because at the moment, Harvard students are only interested in Ivy League football when it means waking up to find three unknown Yalies on their common-room floor, drinking themselves into oblivion by 11 a.m., and passing out in the Harvard Stadium bleachers sometime in the middle of the third quarter.
But hey, at least that’s tradition, right?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 14, 2012, when the final buzzer sounded at the Harvard-Vanderbilt men’s basketball game in Albuquerque, N.M., the Crimson’s 2011-12 season came to a close. Harvard, finishing with a 26-5 overall record (12-2 Ivy), had earned its first NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball tournament bid in 66 years and its first-ever solo Ivy-League title.
I watched with excitement as the Crimson became the latest Ivy-League darling to generate buzz in Division I basketball, challenging a star-studded Vanderbilt squad that featured three future NBA players.
While Harvard’s moment in the national spotlight eventually faded away, questions of whether or not the Crimson was a legitimate tournament team for the future continued to linger in the media.
While Harvard would lose senior forward and former Ivy-League Player of the Year Keith Wright and senior guard Oliver McNally to graduation, the Crimson would retain the services of junior point guard Brandyn Curry and junior forward Kyle Casey and have the chance to build on the promising, young talent put together by Harvard coach Tommy Amaker.
The future looked exceedingly bright for a Crimson squad that would spend the summer retooling and looking to improve upon its 2011-12 run.
Fast forward seven months, and Harvard has again garnered national attention, only this time, it’s not in a positive way. In the midst of an “unprecedented” cheating scandal involving about 125 students, Crimson co-captains Curry and Casey ultimately made the decision to withdraw from school and miss the 2012-13 basketball season.
Just like that, Harvard lost its all-Ivy League forward and starting point guard, leaving the team even more questions to answer.
With the departure of four of its starting five from 2011-12, the Crimson will go from the favorite to repeat as Ivy-League champion to a team with a lot of young talent but not a lot of time.
Harvard—which begins its season in about a month at Lavietes Pavilion against MIT—will undoubtedly feel the brunt of the losses of its starters sooner rather than later.
In the post, the Crimson returns talented but relatively unproven sophomore forwards in Jonah Travis, Kenyatta Smith, and Steve Moundou-Missi, while upperclassmen Jeff Georgatos, Ugo Okam, and Tom Hamel all have career averages of less than eight minutes per game.
On the wing, Harvard will rely heavily on the play of junior sharpshooter Laurent Rivard—the only remaining member of last year’s starting five—as well as 6’5” forward Christian Webster.
That leaves the team with five freshman recruits and a couple second-years with little-to-no playing experience at the collegiate level.
At this point, it seems easy to write off the 2012-13 season as a rebuilding year for the Crimson and start looking to next year when Curry and Casey are projected to return.
How can Amaker’s group of youngsters be expected to replace four of Harvard’s best defenders and shoulder 62-percent worth of offensive possessions? Will the Crimson be ready to compete with forward Ian Hummer and Princeton? Oh and don’t forget, without McNally, Curry and sharpshooter Corbin Miller, Harvard has a gaping void at the point guard position.
In many ways, the year looks bleak for the 2012-13 Crimson, but what we forget is how far the program has come in the past few years.
Great programs are able to recuperate after losing players to graduation and other circumstances.
They are able to do so by giving themselves the opportunity to improve by recruiting top-notch players, nurturing them excellent basketball environments, and then providing chances for them to achieve greatness. Harvard already has the pieces to retool thanks to Amaker’s ability to recruit elite talent.
Successful programs also figure out how to cope with adversity. In 2010, when Duke lost future NBA star guard Kyrie Irving to a toe injury eight games into the season, it didn’t hang its head  in despair. Coach Krzyzewski and the Blue Devils moved forward and played without Irving for the majority of the season to notch a 32-5 year.
In 2011, when UConn coach Jim Calhoun came under fire from the NCAA for compliance issues, the Huskies continued to take care of business and win a national championship.
The point here isn’t that Harvard should do whatever it takes to win, at whatever cost. It’s that elite collegiate basketball programs are able to treat defining victories and losses the same, staying hungry and continuing to prepare themselves at the highest level mentally and physically. They persist, they endure, and they play everyday with a chip on their collective shoulder.
Over the past few seasons the Crimson basketball team has showed it can compete on the national level. It has brought Harvard athletics to new heights in the basketball world that few saw coming.
But if the Crimson hopes to join the ranks of the elite, it must win another Ivy League title this season, not the next. Amaker & Co. must find a way to work past the roster uncertainties and put the distractions of the cheating scandal behind them in order to trump adversity and achieve success.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s no secret that this has been the best year in Harvard basketball history.
For starters, the Crimson ran through the Ivy League en route to its first appearance in the NCAA tournament. Students packed the stands in Lavietes and Harvard students actually cared about basketball. Yes, you read that correctly.
Over in the NBA, Jeremy Lin had Spike Lee reppin’ the Crimson in the first row of Madison Square Garden. Linsanity almost broke the Internet, and analysts talked about Harvard basketball on ESPN.
By our count that’s two miraculous feats in one year. Here are some tweets from the basketball players who brought you the magic of 2012.
1) Apparently, Keith Wright is keeping up to date with pop culture and his alma mater’s football team. The co-captain of the 2012 basketball squad had this to say about an upcoming film:
“Somebody please tell me this is a joke. Tyler Perry is doing an action movie!? Does Madea get kidnapped or something? I'm so lost”
Not a good sign when a movie’s plot can be condensed into a single Tweet. Even if it’s an action film, this will go down as the best joke in Tyler Perry’s career.
2) Wright’s fellow captain, Oliver McNally, is also keeping up to date with movies.
“A friend if mine: "I made a fake Facebook account under the name Brian Mills to exact revenge on a chick." Yes, the Brian Mills from Taken.”
Sure, a friend of yours.  Wouldn’t you say this is a little overboard?
3) Everywhere McNally goes he has to deal with his former, famous teammate.
“Hey ‪@JLin7 get out of my face bro. Can't a brotha just read Sky Mall in peace without your autographed mug plastered all over it? ‪#400bucks”
Forget the cover of Sports Illustrated. You know you’ve made it big when your picture is in Sky Mall.
4) Yes, Jeremy Lin’s face is just about everywhere these days.  But apparently some people still can’t match his face with the right name.
“This guy just said, "oh my god im your biggest fan!! nice to meet you mr. lee" ahhaha”
We have two questions for you, “guy.”  Where have you been for the past year?  And, if you’re Mr. Lee’s biggest fan, what does that make these people?
5) It has been a while since Jeremy Lee Lin served as  co-captain of the Harvard basketball team, but the superstar is reliving his college days. The Rockets point-guard is not pleased with the rookies on his team.
“Btw its not OK that all the rooks forgot their hello kitty, cody simpson, dora the explorer and smurfs backpacks...”
They make those backpacks in NBA size? Good thing Jeremy isn’t playing for the Celtics, because hazing is against the law in Massachusetts.
Those are your tweets of the week.  Their playing days might have ended, but these former captains are still providing Crimson fans with memories. Even graduation can’t stop the magic of 2012.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week after the decommitment of Noah Allen, the Harvard men’s basketball team’s Class of 2017 is back up to two members.
Forward Hunter Myers committed to the Crimson on Tuesday, joining highly-touted recruit Zena Edosomwan in coach Tommy Amaker’s fifth Harvard recruiting class.
Myers, ranked the No. 38 power forward in the high school Class of 2013 by ESPN, picked the Crimson less than a week after making an official visit to Stanford.
“[Harvard and Stanford] were my top two, so I spent a lot of time comparing,” said Myers, who visited Harvard in late September. “Basically what it came down to was I felt a lot more comfortable, just a lot more at home, when I was at the Harvard campus.”
“I really fell in love with the campus and campus life,” added Myers, who hails from Minden, Nev.
Known for his tall frame and ability to stretch opposing defenses with his jumpshot, Myers picked the Crimson over offers from Cal, UC Santa Barbara, Lehigh, and Princeton. At the time of his commitment, Myers had yet to receive a scholarship offer from Stanford, which is still pursuing Jabari Parker, widely considered the top prospect in his class.
“I just kind of wanted to get the decision out of the way, and Harvard’s definitely not a step down [from Stanford],” Myers said.
News of Myers’ commitment to the Crimson has already generated excitement and lofty expectations.
“Hearing Hunter Myers will attend Harvard. Don't be surprised he's an Ivy [Player of the Year] candidate one day,” tweeted Dave Telep, a Senior National Recruiting Analyst for ESPN.com.
Myers has more tempered expectations.
“I don’t know exactly how I’ll fit in, but I’m looking forward to a new opportunity,” Myers said. “I like to consider myself a jack of all trades. I’ll go out and do whatever needs to be done. But mostly I like spot-up shooting, and I really take defense to heart.”
According to Garry Hill-Thomas, Myers' AAU coach with the Nevada Wolverines, Myers wasn’t always a shooter.
“When I first got him he was strictly an under-the-basket type of player—just hook shots and finishes,” said Hill-Thomas, who has coached Myers since he was in the eighth grade. “We’ve been able to extend his range to outside the three-point line.”
Thanks to Myers' time in the gym, the coach now considers the forward’s range one of his strengths.
“Clearly he’s a great defender, but he can step out and shoot the ball extremely well,” Hill-Thomas said.
Myers' coach at Douglas High School Corey Thacker also commends Myers' work ethic.
"In school, things come very naturally [to him]," said Thacker of Myers, who boasts a 4.0 unweighted GPA. "In basketball he has to work for everything he's got, and he's worked very hard to get to the place he is right now."
Hill-Thomas expects Myers to make a smooth transition to college.
“He’s a special kid,” Hill-Thomas said. “He’s a kid who gives you everything he’s got on the court and in the classroom.”
“It’s a great situation,” he added. “He’ll do very well there."

On Thursday, Harvard Medical School Professor of Genetics George M. Church appeared on "The Colbert Report" with 20 million copies of his new book, co-authored with Ed Regis, in his front jacket pocket (don't worry, it's a DNA trick!). The book is called "Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves," and according to Colbert, it may contain information that "will eventually destroy all of mankind." In reality, the book is actually about the many possibilities presented by synthetic biology, one of which is digital information storage in DNA.
According to Church, the science of creating information-storing DNA could condense 20 million books onto a small slip of paper, which is exactly what Church did with his own book. Other applications of synthetic biology would make it possible to create living beings from scratch, prevent genetic diseases from occurring during a person's lifetime, and store incredible amounts of information inside a tiny genome sequence.
"I'm excited about this project because of what it means for long term data storage," said Doug G. Evans '15, who worked in Church's lab over the summer. "You could then take the entire Library of Congress and have it inside a vial." In order to get the final product of 20 million books stored in a tiny splash of DNA, Church and colleagues had to convert all of the text and pictures in the book into binary code—that’s 1's and 0's for those of you who never took CS50—then translate those digits into the DNA base pairs. Once the text is converted, it takes relatively little time to replicate one strand 20 million times.
In addition to his digital data storage project, Church is working on a number of other exciting ventures at his lab in Boston, including the Personal Genome Project. As Church told Colbert, "It's the only project in the world that allows us to share our genes, our traits, and our environmental data with everybody in the world." Scientists at the lab map volunteers' genomic data and share it publically on the internet (we're told Professor Steven Pinker's genome is in there somewhere if anyone's interested).

With two debates behind them and less than a month till election  day, U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth  Warren will face off once again tonight in Springfield for the penultimate  debate in the Massachusetts U.S. Senate race.
The Springfield debate, the candidates' only tête-à-tête outside the Boston media market, is not expected to draw as much attention as  the two previous debates. Still, experts say, with only two debates  left, the debate will be one of the last opportunities for the  candidate's to shift the momentum of the race.
To watch a live stream of the debate, tune in to Masslive.com at 7:00 p.m. tonight.
After  tonight's contest, the candidates will have more than two weeks to mull  over their performance before the race's final debate in Boston on Oct.  30.
Check The Crimson for post-debate reaction and much more on Massachusetts's U.S. Senate race.

Before he trekked around the globe unearthing fossils as a University of Chicago paleontologist and "National Geographic" explorer-in-residence, Paul C. Sereno excavated piles of long-forgotten rocks in the back rooms of Harvard's Natural History Museum. It was there that he discovered the Pegomastax africanus, a new species of dinosaur in the heterodontosaurus genus. After decades of research, he unveiled the new dinosaur last week in the online journal "ZooKeys."
In the late 1960s, Fisher Professor of Natural History, Emeritus A. W. "Fuzz" Crompton brought back a collection of fossils from an expedition into South Africa in search of evidence of the heterodontosaur. But back in Cambridge, Crompton's research moved in a different direction. "I'd sort of lost interest in that particular genus," he said in a phone interview.
Two decades later, Sereno, then a graduate student at the American Museum of Natural History and Columbia University, commuted to Harvard to study Crompton's abandoned collection. He frequently stayed in the Harvard Museum of Natural History's back rooms late into the night. "I would spook some people out, among the fossils at midnight, one o'clock, two o'clock," Sereno said in a phone interview. "I would often find myself alone with a rhino skull over my shoulder at night in the museum."
One day, a preparator pointed out an unusual specimen to Sereno. Within the slab of red rock were the remains of a tiny heterodontosaur. "I looked at it and I knew pretty instantly it was a new taxon," Sereno recalled.
But Sereno wasn't content to publish his discovery out of context. "To find this one group I was going to have to travel the world," he said. "I knew I had a new taxon already, in the bag, but I really wanted to write the handbook on this group."
And that's what he did. At 225 pages, Sereno's newly published article helps to explain the evolution of one of the earliest groups of herbivorous dinosaurs.
Pegomastax africanus stood under two feet tall with a one-inch jaw, a short beak, and sharp teeth. He has concluded that it used its massive fangs for self-defense rather than for hunting and eating meat. His finding provides evidence for the disputed theory that all heterodontosaurs were herbivores.
"He's used the specimen to really do a revision of the whole family," Crompton said.
Sereno hopes that, even if it has no further implications, his discovery will compel universities to continue funding paleontology and natural history museums and inspire students to continue frequenting them. "Many of us who hang around collections are bound to discover some amazing things," Sereno said.
