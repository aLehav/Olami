After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Logging onto Zoom and attending classes could not be any more different from the typical classroom setting, even when discounting the obvious changes in scenery. With classes held virtually, professors are placed into a much more passive position and are fighting an uphill battle against distractions — the entire internet, in fact — for their students’ attention. Even the physical positions of professors have drastically changed. Instead of looking up at my professor, who normally stands behind her lectern on a podium, from a few rows behind, we now occupy the same 5-centimeter by 3-centimeter real estate on my laptop screen and, if I were to desire (which I do not), I could even speak over the professor and expel her from the enlarged speaker square. To some extent, I am literally and figuratively leveled onto the same platform as my professors and teaching fellows.
At the same time, Zoom University also redefines class participation. Breakout rooms may be fun for the first bit, but the fun kind of subsides when you end up looking at turned off cameras and muted mics. And to speak up in section, I now have to press the “Raise Hand” button, wait for my tiny blue icon to be noticed, and then unmute my mic before speaking up.
By definition, transition periods are jarring, and it took some time before all of us, students and professors alike, could adapt. In the midst of this normalization, it is productive— both for sociological insight and as a pedagogical tool — to reflect on the power dynamics and norms that we had taken for granted.
Who speaks up normally? Who gets called on normally? Who does the calling? Do professors interact and engage with what students are most interested by? Should they do so? What roles do teaching fellows play in the classroom and in section?
These questions are sometimes on the mind of students and teachers, but they are also immediately relevant to our daily interactions in clubs and other social settings. As we move all interactions to Zoom, questions about power dynamics are thrust upon us. We may suddenly acknowledge that power was disproportionately accorded to someone in a meeting merely because they used to sit close to the center, because they were more comfortable within a certain environment, or just because of how they look, dress or act.
Discounting the clearly inappropriate cases, these influences are not always undue. Those who sit close to the center may do so because of the inherent structure or needs of an organization or a meeting, and someone may better fit into a role of power because they have more experience working in an environment. However, the shock of adapting to the new and different still forces us to scrutinize underlying assumptions about the accepted structures and working environments. Are we prioritizing a certain group of people? Or do our structures, in effect, result in the unjust prioritization of a certain group of people? Rarely do we have the chance to so utterly shatter the status quo, and we should seize the opportunity to understand whether our old systems are in fact the best way of operating.
Outside of Zoom, the coronavirus also challenges existing power dynamics in our daily interactions. As the pandemic sweeps across the world and cities and countries are under lockdown, the dynamics within our societies are vastly inverted. Quarantined at home, we suddenly find ourselves reliant on the supermarket workers, cleaners, and many normally neglected workers for essential goods and services. In fact, our reliance has always existed. But not until this pandemic has this reliance been clearly exposed to challenge assumptions about economic structures and inequalities.
Needless to say, many of the changes that we are adapting to will be reverted as the pandemic eventually subsides — we may, hopefully, look forward to the possible return back on campus and seeing our friends and classmates. And it is imperative that some of them — the emergency powers delegated to government officials, for example — must not stay. But even so, this period of adaptation allows us to actively reflect on what is normally hidden. Assumptions about power dynamics are rarely seen in the open; we should take a good look at them when they are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Donald Trump effectively forced meatpacking plants around the country to remain open during the pandemic by signing an executive order designating them as “critical infrastructure.” Interestingly, the president has declined to use the same justification to speed the production of coronavirus tests and personal protective equipment.
The industry always keeps plenty of meat in frozen storage, and because of restaurant closures we are going through this supply less quickly. Thus, the choice to keep meatpacking plants open is not attributable to the “critical” nature of the meat industry. Rather, it is more likely due to a deep-seated association between eating meat and our national identity. After all, America consumes more meat per capita than any other country. Even before this pandemic, our habits had negative consequences for animals, the environment, our public health, and workers in processing plants — but the virus might be worsening the effects. So, in times like these, rethinking that association may be necessary for our collective well-being.
For months, coronavirus has been spreading around meat processing plants, leading a few of them to close. To date, thousands of meatpacking workers have tested positive, and over a dozen have died. Even before the virus, meatpacking was a difficult job. Workers toil in factories described as crowded and unsafe; conditions are so harsh that it often leads to permanent physical disability. These workers also disproportionately come from vulnerable immigrant communities that might already be more susceptible to the virus.
The animals in these plants are also a source of concern. It’s no secret that the American meat industry doesn’t value animal welfare. The scenes from factory farms are truly awful — cattle raised in contained animal feeding operations, chickens bred to have breasts so large that they can no longer stand. Animals larger than humans are forced to spend most of their lives in darkness, confined to a few feet of space. Under ordinary circumstances, the lives of factory farm animals are miserable and short.
And this situation is deteriorating further due to the virus. Because processing has slowed, there are now a lot of animals with nowhere to go. Thus, farmers are left with no choice but to kill the animals en masse. Aside from the obvious waste, what’s troubling is that animals might actually suffer more in these methods of extermination than they would otherwise. Chickens, for example, are essentially drowned by filling barns with watery foam. In the coming weeks, millions of animals will be slaughtered not for consumption, but to make room for others.
These meat carcasses, disturbingly enough, might just be dumped in landfills. As their bodies decay, they will release massive quantities of methane and carbon dioxide, directly contributing to climate change. Food waste worsens the meat industry’s already severe environmental impact, and in a scenario where slaughterhouses are operating at 50 percent capacity, that seems likely to increase.
Another frequently underestimated consequence of the meat industry is its propensity for creating and spreading disease. This isn’t strictly limited to meatpacking plants themselves, though sickness has been known to spread quickly in such conditions. Rampant antibiotic use and the crowded and unsanitary state of farms also means that disease can quickly evolve and spread among animals — and even make the leap to humans. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and zoonotic diseases flourish in our factory farms. The Food and Agriculture Organization, a branch of the United Nations, has warned about the health dangers of industrial agriculture before. As far as we know, coronavirus didn’t come from animal agriculture, but it’s worth highlighting that deadly pathogens often come from animals. The way we raise our food is unnecessarily contributing to an increased risk that another pandemic will emerge in the future.
There’s an obvious solution to these problems: Eat less meat, and choose the meat you do eat more carefully. Doing right by workers, animals, and the environment doesn’t necessitate vegetarianism, though it probably means scaling back consumption. When possible, we should purchase ethically-raised meat from smaller farms, and support retailers and farmers who participate in responsible agriculture. Moreover, we should make a deliberate effort to eat meat less often. If the rest of the world is any indication, we can survive perfectly well with a few more vegetables. The way we eat meat is unsustainable; the pandemic is just making that irresponsibility more obvious.

Erin McDermott will serve as the first woman to head Harvard Athletics beginning July 1, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced in an email to Athletics affiliates Thursday afternoon.
McDermott comes to Cambridge after seven years serving as the Director of Athletics at the University of Chicago. She previously held positions in the athletics departments at Princeton and Columbia, and has burnished a reputation on the national collegiate stage. As an undergraduate, she played basketball at Hofstra University.
“Erin is someone who has formed a deep appreciation of Harvard and its place in the Ivy League, as well as the things that make the experience we create for our student-athletes unique,” Gay wrote. “Throughout her career, she has privileged face-to-face relationships as the foundation for collaboration, innovation, and change.”
Under McDermott’s tenure, UChicago achieved athletic excellence, Gay wrote. The school won 17 UAA championships, seven NCAA individual event championships, and six top-20 finishes in the Learfield Sports Directors' Cup standings among 450 NCAA Division III institutions. McDermott also introduced women’s lacrosse to the school’s varsity programs and secured a department-wide partnership with Adidas.
McDermott will succeed incumbent Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise, who has headed the department for two decades. She will steer the department through a tumultuous year as upcoming athletics seasons remain in flux and the department will have to trim its budget due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
McDermott’s appointment also marks a milestone in a profession dominated by men.
She told the Chicago Maroon in 2019 that “a way to help resolve [gender inequities] is for different people to be in the decision-making process, for more women to be present and around the table when decisions are made.”
McDermott welcomes her return to the Ivy League, she said in a statement provided by the College Thursday.
“This role is perfect in every way. I know there will be challenges, the current situation with the pandemic being one of them, but I’m excited to return to athletics at a level I believe in,” McDermott said. “The Ivy League is a model for Division I, and Harvard already has a natural platform to be a model for other institutions. More than ever, we need to have a voice that brings in excellence in every way, and I look forward to having that strong voice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than a year of reviewing comments on a draft of the new guidelines, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released the highly-anticipated Title IX rule Wednesday.
The new rule narrows the definition of sexual misconduct and imposes new guidelines for schools’ Title IX procedures. Title IX, a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions that receive federal funding, underpins universities’ sexual harassment prevention and adjudication policies across the country.
The new regulations — which were first released as a draft in November 2018 — shift the definition of sexual misconduct to “unwelcome conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive.” Previous Obama-era guidance defined sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that includes “requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”
The new rule encompasses “all of a school’s education programs or activities,” both on and off campus. However, for a complaint to be addressed under the new policy, the alleged sexual misconduct must have taken place on-campus or, if off-campus, in the context of a school-sponsored activity, building, or event in which the institution has “substantial control.”
Harvard has not clarified how these changes would impact its own Title IX process. Colleges and universities are expected to enforce this rule by August 14.
In a statement released on Wednesday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said that Harvard will begin looking into complying with these new regulations, while keeping community needs “at the forefront of our efforts.”
“With the issuance of the final rule today, we will begin reviewing the changes that are now law, with careful consideration of the implications for Harvard’s current policy and procedures,” he wrote. “All who call this University home must know that they are welcome and safe.”
Harvard affiliates have expressed concern that these new Title IX laws will undermine that project to cultivate a safe campus environment.
Harvard Law School Professor Janet E. Halley said the double “severe and pervasive” criteria are unreasonably stringent.
“We argued that ‘severe and pervasive’ is very bad, because in the conduct realm, it is too narrow,” she said. “It says ‘if it’s severe but not pervasive, it’s not included in the wrongful conduct. Or if it’s pervasive but not severe.’”
Diane Rosenfeld, a lecturer at HLS, said this policy raises concerns about scope because it limits the jurisdictions of campus Title IX officers. The new rule would not hold schools accountable for addressing off-campus sexual harassment that takes place at non-recognized social organizations.
At Harvard, for example, the new rule would prevent the Title IX Office from investigating complaints about sexual misconduct that takes place at unrecognized off-campus venues like final clubs. A 2016 University-wide sexual climate survey demonstrated a high percentage of sexual assault cases involving Harvard students take place at the clubs.
“You can’t tie schools’ hands in trying to prevent and address sexual assault like that,” Rosenfeld said. “So I expect that these regulations will be challenged.”
Another controversial aspect of DeVos’s new rule is the undertaking of a grievance process that requires a hearing with both parties.
The new DeVos rule requires that, when a formal complaint is filed with a school’s Title IX office, the complaint must first be evaluated by an impartial investigator who will then submit a neutral report for review in a hearing process.
In this live hearing, all witnesses — including both the complainant and respondent parties — can be submitted to cross-examination. Though the hearing must be held in real time with both parties present, the complainant and the respondent may choose to attend remotely.
Under the new guidelines, each question during the cross-examination period must first be vetted by the hearing officials. These regulations also invoke “rape shield” protections used in federal courts, which prevent either party from being asked about their sexual history.
The grievance process outlined in the new rule is distinct from the single-investigator model that the University currently employs. Harvard currently tasks a single investigator with questioning both parties and making a recommendation for a response based on his or her findings. Once the investigator has reached a conclusion, each school’s Administrative Board or equivalent body determines what sanctions may be necessary.
Halley said the new rule reflects standard fairness practices that, if implemented “in good faith,” would adequately protect both complainants and respondents under the new policy. However, she said, there might be a tradeoff between training investigators to be impartial and training them according to trauma-informed practices.
“Some aspects of trauma-informed training are going to not be all right anymore,” Halley said. “Although the theory does recognize trauma-informed training is important, you can’t teach people to believe the complainant first or something like that.”
Rosenfeld said these new grievance proceedings could have a “chilling” effect on victims and discourage them from coming forward.
The new rule puts the “burden of proof” on the school itself and guarantees resources for those who report sexual misconduct, per a Department of Education spokesperson.
“This rule makes it easier and more accessible for any person to report sexual harassment and receive supportive measures (such as class or dorm room reassignments, counseling, or no-contact orders), while respecting each survivor’s choice about whether to participate in a grievance process,” the spokesperson wrote. “During any grievance process, the rule grants both complainants and respondents equally strong, clear procedural protections (such as the right to an advisor, the right to inspect and review evidence, the right to an unbiased decision-maker)."
Beyond moving away from this single-investigator model, Harvard’s Title IX proceedings might also see a shift in the standard of evidence required to determine an instance of sexual misconduct.
Harvard currently uses a “preponderance of the evidence” standard in its Title IX proceedings, as directed under the 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter. The new guidelines allow schools to employ either the “preponderance of the evidence” standard or the more stringent “clear and convincing” standard in Title IX investigations.
While the choice is technically up to the institution, Halley said the policy is strategically designed to push universities to require clear and convincing evidence in their Title IX proceedings now that the option exists, given that faculty might not be amenable to the school adopting a standard of preponderance in evaluating complaints filed against them when a more stringent option is available.
Colby Bruno, senior legal counsel for the Victim Rights Law Center (VRLC), said these policy changes would assume the credibility of the respondent over the complainant.
“These new rules require the presumption of innocence, and thereby, the presumption that an accusing student is lying,” Bruno wrote in an emailed statment. “It is discriminatory to assume this standard for sexual harassment, but not for other types of student misconduct.”
Halley, however, said she thinks it is fair and appropriate for Title IX offices to adopt grievance procedures with live hearings and a standard of clear and convincing evidence. She said such measures are necessary to ensure credibility and accuracy from both parties.
“We should strive for accuracy,” she said. “And a crucial way to do that is to expose both sides to real time questions about the evidence that they’re bringing.”

Harvard Medical School announced Wednesday that astronaut, chemical engineer, and surgeon Robert L. Satcher Jr. will be the keynote speaker for the 2020 Medical School and Dental School Class Day ceremonies.
The Medical School will hold this year’s Commencement and Class Day exercises virtually on May 28, and expects to host in-person celebrations at a later date.
Satcher graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1994, a year after receiving his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from MIT. He joined NASA’s Class of 2004, shortly after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003.
Satcher became the first orthopedic surgeon to travel in space when he took part in an 11-day mission on Space Shuttle Atlantis in 2009. On the mission, he repaired International Space Station equipment and served as the crew’s medical doctor.
In the Medical School press release, Satcher said this year’s graduation is “notable” as it will be the first held virtually and “the future is more uncertain than most are accustomed to.”
"There has never been a more obvious need for our profession,” Satcher said in the press release. “Not only in caring for those afflicted from coronavirus but also in providing leadership in how to best strategize to manage health care as we move forward."
Satcher is now an associate professor of orthopedic oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, where he specializes in treating skeletal metastatic disease, teleoncology, and applying technology to improve surgical outcomes.
Satcher co-founded the eHealth Research Institute, a collaboration between Rice University, the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, and MD Anderson aimed at expanding specialized healthcare access.
He is also working on building a cancer center in sub-Saharan Africa with the MD Anderson Global Oncology enterprise.
“Dr. Satcher is a dynamic role model to so many of us and embodies exactly what leadership is all about,” Medical School Dean for Students Fidencio Saldaña said in the announcement. “We know that students, faculty and staff alike will be proud, encouraged, uplifted and inspired by hearing from Dr. Satcher, while his words will help send the graduates into the world of medicine with strength and poise for the challenges ahead.”

The City of Cambridge and Cambridge Redevelopment Authority will provide $3.6 million to assist small businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, the city announced Tuesday.
The Small Business Grant Program will offer qualifying businesses up to $10,000 to assist with rent, salaries, utilities, and the cost of goods. The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority will also provide local businesses with zero-interest loans of up to $15,000.
Though the initiatives are separate and are being funded independently, they will share a common application process. Businesses may receive approval for the full $25,000, or three months of business expenses up to that amount.
The city will fund the grants using $500,000 from the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund and $1.6 million in federal funds, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community Development Block Grant and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
“Through the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund, our goal has always been to extend this emergency financial support to as many Cambridge residents as possible,” Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said in a press release Tuesday. “We have always known that the second phase of distributing funds would include extending that support to our City’s small businesses.”
The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, serviced by the Cambridge Savings Bank, will fund the loan program and will provide up to $1.5 million in additional relief funds.
Businesses must repay the loan within five years, with zero payments in the first year and semiannual payments for the next four years.
All small businesses located in Cambridge qualify for the funds, provided they are not non-locally franchised chain restaurants, do not have outstanding invoices with the City of Cambridge prior to Fiscal Year 2020, and have not been cited for two or more health code violations within the past two years.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she appreciated the city’s willingness to help small businesses during the pandemic.
“We are so pleased with the 3.6 million dollar grant and loan program to support small businesses and are enthusiastically encouraging our member businesses to apply,” Jillson said. “At this point, every program is important, every dollar is a help.”
She added that, since the COVID-19 outbreak prompted a statewide stay-at-home advisory, Harvard Square has experienced a significant increase in business closures. Of the 200 eateries and retail businesses in the square, less than 25 remain in operation, Jillson said.

Heather Ann Thompson, a Pulitzer prize-winning author and University of Michigan professor, discussed the relationship between pandemics and prisons in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during a virtual event on Thursday.
The event — which was sponsored by the Hutchins Center’s Project on Race & Gender in Science & Medicine — featured a conversation between Thompson and Evelynn M. Hammonds, a professor of African and African American studies at Harvard.
Thompson said she believes the public health implications of the pandemic have helped move discussions on criminal justice reform forward.
“If you let somebody out because they are too elderly to withstand COVID inside of a prison, or you let people out of jail because they are only there because they can’t afford bail, it seems to me this raises huge ethical questions for us as a nation, which is, ‘why were they there in the first place?’” Thompson said.
Thompson also noted that she feared the coronavirus pandemic could potentially lead to a distinctly different outcome if the criminal justice system took a more punitive turn.
“What we don’t want is to take the world’s largest pandemic in our immediate history and say that the solution to our criminal justice system is more isolation,” Thompson said.
“Socially distancing does not mean isolation, does not mean that we are advocating for supermax prisons, doesn’t mean we are arguing that people should never come home,” she added.
Hammonds said she believes the ongoing pandemic has helped to draw out the similarities between the experiences of various marginalized groups and allowed Americans to “speak in more universal terms.”
Hammonds and Thompson both also voiced concerns about medical experimentation within prisons.
“One has to be vigilant, no matter the decade, no matter the victory,” Thompson said. “There are enormous pressures to open up that confined population to testing vaccines, testing all kinds of things.”
The Hutchins Center event comes almost a month after Kennedy School professor Marcella M. Alsan ’99 and Law School professor Crystal S. Yang ’07 announced a collaboration with the National Commission on Correctional Health Care to conduct the first detailed survey of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on American prisons, jails, and juvenile detention facilities.
In an April interview with the Harvard Gazette, Alsan said not only prisoners, but also correctional officers are at increased risk for testing positive for COVID-19.
“What’s striking to me about these findings so far is that correctional staff are also at high risk, either because of community exposure or exposure in the facilities themselves,” she said.
Yang told the Gazette that the initial survey results have elucidated potential next steps to prevent the pandemic from overwhelming the criminal justice system, including “releasing medically vulnerable inmates” and “limiting pretrial detention for individuals charged with nonviolent or misdemeanor offenses.”
“Our findings suggest that as the pandemic continues to spread, policymakers should implement criminal justice policies that can protect the health of inmates and correctional staff without endangering public safety,” she said.

The Cambridge Health Alliance is set to launch a testing center that will be free to all city residents above the age of 7 on Friday.
The testing center, which will be held in a tent at the CHA’s East Cambridge Care Center, will provide tests to anyone who makes an appointment in advance, regardless of symptoms, insurance, or immigration status.
“Expanding testing to all Cambridge residents is another important step in our region’s response to COVID-19,” Cambridge Health Alliance CEO Assaad J. Sayah said in a press release. “I appreciate our partnership with the City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Public Health Department to meet this critical public health imperative.”
Test results will come back within five days, according to Thursday’s announcement. The center will be open on weekdays from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m.
To make an appointment for a test, residents are asked to call the Alliance’s hotline at (617) 665-2928.
“The Cambridge Health Alliance provides vital health care services to many Cambridge residents, and plays a critical role in the City’s COVID-19 response,” City Manager Louis A. DePasquale and Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said in a joint statement. “Expanding the testing capacity for COVID-19 is an important part of the Commonwealth’s strategy for reopening, and this testing site will be a critical resource for Cambridge residents.”
Cambridge Health Alliance — which provides service to Cambridge, Somerville, and a part of Boston — partners with several University schools, including the Harvard Medical School, the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
Cambridge has had 808 residents test positive for the virus, 63 of whom have died. There have been more than 73,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 4,552 deaths in Massachusetts as a whole.
Massachusetts’ current stay-at-home advisory and its closure of non-essential businesses runs through May 18. Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 said Thursday that the state has “a lot of work to do” before getting the virus under control.
The Cambridge testing location will be the third such center the CHA operates. It will be open for drive-through and to residents who arrive on foot or by bicycle.

Harvard Medical School is facing losses between $39 million and $65 million for the current fiscal year, Dean George Q. Daley ’82 announced in an email to affiliates Thursday.
Daley wrote that a “significant portion” of the deficit stems from the decision to forgive a fiscal contribution from the Medical School’s affiliated hospitals.
Unlike most medical schools, Harvard Medical School does not own or operate hospitals and instead relies on fifteen affiliated clinical and research institutes, including Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Boston Children’s Hospital. These affiliates provide patient care and clinical training for students while also employing many physicians and scientists with joint Harvard Medical School faculty appointments.
The affiliates would have been expected to contribute $31 million to the Medical School.
“A significant portion of this deficit is the result of our decision to stand in solidarity with our affiliated hospitals, which are also facing devastating losses,” he wrote.
Other factors Daley listed as contributing to the deficit include the cancellation of external education programs and “unforeseen costs” incurred during the transition to remote education and research.
“Unfortunately, we anticipate further economic losses in FY21,” Daley wrote.
The Medical School has struggled with financial woes for much of the past decade: From 2008 to 2018, it operated in the red in nine out of ten years, facing a $49 million deficit in the 2016 fiscal year.
In his 2020 State of the School address, Daley said the Medical School had “rounded the mark” after “fighting financial headwinds” for much of the past decade, reducing its deficit to $10 million in the 2019 fiscal year. At the time of the January address, he said the projected deficit for the current fiscal year was $4 million.
Despite recent losses pushing the Medical School back into a state of financial uncertainty, Daley told affiliates he is “confident” that the school will come out the other side. He credited that positive outlook in part to the Medical School’s financial planning.
“To emphasize the positive, we had been anticipating and planning for a potential downturn in the economy even before the pandemic,” Daley wrote. “Because of this advance planning, we have already identified significant cost reductions, particularly in various construction projects across campus.”
Daley also wrote that the Medical School’s finance team is currently working to find more ways to reduce spending and determine which programs are “most essential” to preserving its research and teaching mission.
“While we are facing a very challenging situation, we feel confident in our ability to weather the storm,” he wrote.
