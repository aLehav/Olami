After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 24-year-old woman was sexually assaulted near Weld Boat House on Memorial Drive early Tuesday morning, in close proximity to Harvard’s Cambridge campus, according to police.
Massachusetts State Police are currently investigating the crime that officials say occurred at about 2 a.m. Tuesday. According to a state police release, the victim, a Boston resident, was approached by a man on a bicycle, who physically and sexually assaulted her as she tried to walk away. The assailant fled on his bike after the victim screamed for help and two witnesses ran toward the scene, police said.
The victim was taken to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital and has since been released. Police described her assailant as a “white male, estimated to be in his late 20s to early 30s, with a stocky build and blonde or light brown hair.”
The Massachusetts State Police Public Information Office declined to release further information on Wednesday. Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, who circulated an email advisory notice about the crime to University affiliates on Tuesday, could not be reached.
