In the mountains behind the football stadium in Berkeley, Calif., lies a narrow dirt path that the students call Fire Trails. It snakes up in switchbacks to the very top, where the view takes away whatever panting breath I have left. The whole Bay Area slopes down before me and in the distance I can make out the faded red geometry of the Golden Gate Bridge.
I have never felt quite at home on the West Coast. I prefer the historical chill of Philadelphia to California’s sunny sheen, have always been drawn to Hemingway more than Steinbeck. During this trip, though, I’m thinking about beginnings and endings and I feel the place’s tug. I’m reading On the Road, the original scroll:
It was the end of the continent, no more land. Somebody had tipped the American continent like a pinball machine and all the goofballs had come rolling to L.A. in the southwest corner. I cried for all of us.
San Francisco is different than L.A., but the two cities share a statewide simpatico. Is it the feeling of achievement—a country crossed and conquered—that I’m sensing here, even today on our smaller shrunken continent? A kind of relief at a journey completed or a frontier traversed?
It is the first week of Berkeley’s second semester, and one of the friends I am visiting is distraught over classes. She only has one English course left in her Berkeley career and she must choose between Borges and Virginia Woolf. She’s read Woolf and loves her, yet she’s also feeling an almost mystical Argentine pull. We sit in the Free Speech Movement Café deliberating. We return to her house, the African-American culture themed co-op near the entrance to Fire Trails, to deliberate some more with most of the co-op’s 21 other inhabitants pulled into the debate. It is P.’s turn to cook dinner and the conversations continue during her three-hour shift in the industrial kitchen, shifting sometimes up onto the roof for more beery deliberation.
At school I would never take three hours out of my day each week to cook dinner. Would things have been different if I’d gone to college here? The friends I am visiting love Berkeley with its classes and Co-ops, the deeply moral significance they place here on high-quality public education. They are desperately sad to graduate. I know I will not be. Would things be different here? Is this just another way of asking how I could be different, here or anywhere?
One day we take a car and drive down to Santa Cruz. We dip our feet into the Pacific and eat honey-almond ice cream on the softly groaning boardwalk. We talk about future jobs and plans and cities, how graduation’s the last real ending we’ll all share, how the lack of a next ending unnerves us all.
There was no end to the American sadness and the American madness. Someday we’ll all start laughing and roll on the ground when we realize how funny it’s been.
I watch the sun ease down over the ocean and think about how long it took to get here, historically, and all the disasters since the ending of that old American saga. Did Kerouac feel it, too?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its 5-2 loss to William and Mary (4-1) on Friday, the Harvard women’s tennis team (1-1) tried a variety of approaches in trying to claw out a couple of singles matches. However, after taking the doubles’ point, the team lost five of six singles matches as Crimson players varied their strategies in trying to battle back from early breaks off their serves.
On court five, junior Natalie Blosser blasted groundstrokes off each wing past her Tribe opponent but ceded break advantages in each set in a 6-3, 7-5 loss. Freshman Amanda Lin faced similar obstacles over on court three. Lin sliced the ball low and away to keep her opponent off-balance, venturing into the net to keep points shorter, but was unable to put enough pressure on her opponent with her serve and forehand and fell 6-3, 6-2.
Against a net-rusher who came in off both serves and returns, co-captain Kristin Norton consistently tried different passing combinations—working in both topspin lobs and flatter groundstrokes—but was broken at key junctures in each set.  Norton lost the match, 6-4, 6-3.
“I thought it was a very solid second match of the season,” coach Traci Green said. “We competed really well for the second match of the season and I’m really proud of the heart that we showed today. Our team showed a lot of composure here today for early and the season and we won a lot of the big points we played in doubles.”
Harvard’s lone win in singles came courtesy of freshman Crystal Yen, who lost only three games in defeating William and Mary junior Sydney Smith, 6-0, 6-3. Yen, who uses an unorthodox style of play to keep her opponents off balance and force them to play balls outside of their comfort zones, frustrated her opponent into frequent errors off both wings.
“Crystal is a very deceiving player and a very annoying player to play,” Green said. “She’s very fast and can get everything back and sometimes she can give you no pace and sometimes she can give you a lot of pace. Crystal is a very hard worker and she never gives up. When you have someone like that, you know you’ve got a good player.”
In doubles, the Crimson started slow before finishing strong. After co-captain Kristin Norton and freshman Amy He dropped line one doubles, 8-0, Harvard fought back from 6-6 ties in both matches to break their Tribe opponents and served out the contests. Norton and He were the only team to stay intact from the team’s victory over Cleveland State, as the Crimson displayed two new doubles teams against William and Mary.
“In doubles I think that we all played pretty well,” sophomore Sylvia Li said. “Coach was in our ear telling us ‘believe, believe’ and I think we all did that pretty well. When you play with [a new partner], you definitely want to have high energy and make sure you talk all the time before and after points.”
Li said that after the match against Cleveland State, where Harvard dropped only one set and swept every match played, the level of competition was significantly stiffer against William and Mary. While the Crimson was not able to pull out more than one singles match, only two of the 10 sets the team lost were by more than a break of serve.
“Because our first match was a lot easier than this one it showed us that we still have to keep working hard and improving,” Li said. “They were a really solid team and if we keep practicing we can beat teams this good if not better. [The match] was a good watch to keep us on track.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its trip to the Coal State this weekend, the Harvard men’s volleyball team struck gold on the first night but came up just short the day after.
On Friday night in Loretto, Pa., the Crimson (3-1, 1-1 EIVA) opened conference play with a strong statement, downing Saint Francis (1-6, 0-1) in straight sets.
Despite suffering an early setback with an injury to sophomore outside hitter DJ White, Harvard managed to pull out each set and preserve its undefeated record.
“It was big. It was our first league win,” said junior middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper. “It was nice to start with a ‘W’. We played a little bit sloppy in the beginning, but we cleaned it up and settled through pretty much the rest of the game. To get a win after a little adversity like that felt good.”
The Crimson faced a much tougher opponent in No. 6 Penn State on Saturday afternoon. Although Harvard battled to force a deciding fifth game in University Park, Pa., the Nittany Lions (9-1, 2-0) ultimately prevailed to seal the 3-2 Crimson defeat.
“It’s a loss to a good team,” said junior co-captain Nick Madden. “I think it showed us exactly what it’s going to take to get out there and compete and win our league. That’s going to be serves, serve receiving, and swinging high and hard off the block.”
PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 2
When Harvard captured the fourth set by a score of 25-16 to even the match at two sets apiece, the Crimson looked to have Penn State on the ropes.
But a strong Nittany Lions squad stormed right back in the final game, jumping out to an early lead and never looking back en route to a 15-6 win that sealed the conference showdown.
Harvard registered a game-high 13 kills in the fourth set, but strong serves from Penn State forced the Crimson into a defensive position in the fifth. The team mustered only a single kill in the game.
“I think the biggest [problem] was our serve receive,” Madden said. “We had a couple hitting errors, but I think for the most part they served really well, and we didn’t really put hittable balls up. I don’t think it was so much attacking in the fifth game as it was defense and receiving.”
A number of players came up big for Harvard on the offensive end. Madden contributed solid play in multiple aspects of the game, ranking first on the team with nine kills and also posting seven digs and six blocks.
Junior outside hitter Michael Owen and sophomore middle blocker Caleb Zimmick followed closely behind Madden with eight kills apiece, and freshman outside hitter Branden Clemens had seven kills from the perimeter.
“[Our attacking depth] helps us a lot,” Madden said. “We definitely were able to capitalize in the middle tonight. Our middles absolutely killed it. It makes it really hard on the defense because if they’re one-on-one blocking everywhere, we have a much higher-percentage chance of getting kills.”
Penn State managed to snatch a tight first set by a score of 25-23, but the Crimson battled back in the second game to even the score at one set apiece. The teams split the third and fourth games to set up the decisive fifth.
HARVARD 3, SAINT FRANCIS 0
Despite a straight-set victory for Harvard, the Saint Francis put up a fierce struggle, with the match decided by a total of seven points. After winning the first two sets, 25-22 and 26-24, the Crimson found itself tied at 23 with the Red Flash in the third game.
“The other team was serving, and they had a good server back there,” Baise said. “We just told the passers to relax and play with confidence, and we knew if we could pass the ball well and get the ball to our hitters, we could kill it.”
A service error and subsequent attack error from Saint Francis secured the win for Harvard.
The injury to White, who leads the team with 35 kills on the season, came in the first set.
“Mike Owen came in and played a great game, and our middle blockers were just extraordinary tonight, and that made the difference,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “[Owen] came off the bench and played a key role in a tough spot.”
St. Francis played a close match, extending its lead to as much as four in the second set. Kills by Rehkemper and Madden brought the score back within one, and the teams volleyed back and forth, never allowing the margin to surpass two.
Consecutive points by Clemens gave the Crimson a 25-24 lead, and a mishit by Saint Francis ended the set to give Harvard a 2-0 lead.
Rehkemper led the Crimson’s offensive attack with 12 kills on the night, while senior setter Rob Lothman notched 35 assists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say all good things must come to an end, and that proved to be the case Friday night for the No. 2 Harvard women’s hockey team, which dropped a 3-1 decision to No. 7 Clarkson to snap its 13-game ECAC winning streak to start the year.
Carly Mercer did all the damage for the Golden Knights (20-6-0, 12-2-0 ECAC), registering her first career hat trick in the victory. Junior forward Kalley Armstrong had the lone goal for the Crimson (17-2-1, 13-1-0), which remains atop the ECAC despite the loss.
“It certainly didn’t look like Harvard hockey,” junior forward Lindsey Fry said. “We were struggling a little bit. A big reason for that is that we haven’t really played a team that strong in a while... They threw everything they had at us and I think it caught us off guard.”
Mercer scored twice in the third period against Crimson freshman goaltender Emerence Maschmeyer, who earned her first loss against a Clarkson squad that outshot Harvard 25-19.
At the other end of the ice, Golden Knights netminder Erica Howe benefitted from her defense’s strong penalty kill, which denied Harvard on six of its seven power play opportunities. Seven Harvard penalties, meanwhile, gave Clarkson the opportunity to score two goals on five-on-four play.
“Our execution on the penalty kill was not what we wanted it to be and not where it’s been all year,” Crimson coach Katie Stone said.
Facing the team’s first ranked opponent since Northeastern on Nov. 27, Stone gave the rookie Maschmeyer the road start over co-captain Laura Bellamy, despite the latter leading the nation in goals against average and save percentage.
Though Maschmeyer has been dominant all season long as well, on Friday she could not stop Mercer, who scored the go-ahead goal 2:35 into the final period.
After the freshman made a sprawling save with her left leg, the rest of the net was left exposed. Mercer found herself wide-open on the rebound and lifted the puck over Maschmeyer’s stick and inside the left post to put Clarkson ahead, 2-1.
“They play a system and they play it very well, where they just sit people on the back door,” Fry said. “[Mercer] just happened to be at the right place at the right time, and she just whacked away at at the net. We didn’t do a good job covering her in front.”
Nine minutes later, Mercer was back at it again, putting home a rebound off of an Erin Ambrose shot for a power-play score that gave the Golden Knights some much-needed breathing room.
“We gave them more [chances] than they should have had,” Stone said. “Ultimately a goalie shouldn’t have to make three, four saves before a puck gets cleared.”
Harvard could not generate anything the rest of the night against Howe, who registered her 50th career victory to break the Clarkson all-time record.
Sophomore defenseman Michelle Picard led the Crimson with three shots, while co-captain Jillian Dempsey, who entered the contest fourth in the country in goals, was limited to just two attempts.
“That game was certainly very humbling for us and it taught us a lot,” Fry said. “I think that it’s really going to help us going forward here to learn about who we are and who we want to be for the rest of the season.”
Harvard was penalized for having too many players on the ice at the 3:34 mark of the opening period, and the Golden Knights got on the board 32 seconds later. Maschmeyer denied a shot by Jamie Lee Rattay, but Mercer again gathered the rebound and beat the rookie glove side. The Crimson had not allowed a goal that early in a contest all season, and it marked the first time all year that Harvard had trailed in ECAC play.
“They just rattled us, and we didn’t show up ready to play,” Fry said. “They took us off our game, and props to them for being able to that.... We were just out of place and we felt a little stunned from the get-go.”
Harvard answered back nine minutes later following an interference penalty on Clarkson’s Vanessa Plante, which gave the Crimson its first power play opportunity. Harvard took full advantage, as Armstrong, from the far post, took a pass from senior forward Kaitlin Spurling and was able to put a one-timer to the lower left corner, just before Howe could extend her right leg.
But Howe denied back-to-back good looks by Picard later in the frame, and Harvard was unable to score for the rest of the period, or the rest of the night.
“After [Armstrong’s goal] you kind of expect the momentum to shift and you expect the other team to sit back and be a little nervous,” Fry said. “They did a really good job of coming back at us and not backing down.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the men’s ice hockey season got into full swing in early November, no one would have thought both Harvard and St. Lawrence—then ranked No. 14 and 13, respectively—would hold losing records in the ECAC come January.
The Crimson began the season ranked No. 17 in the nation after recruiting what was considered to be the top freshman class in the country. Opening the season on a three-game win streak, Harvard had moved up to No. 13 by late October.
St. Lawrence began the season unranked but quickly picked up national attention after sweeping six of seven games to open the season. Both teams were ranked for three straight weeks, but after poor performances in November, they quickly fell out of contention.
Battling into overtime on Saturday, the Crimson and the Saints were locked in a 3-3 tie after Harvard fought back from a 2-0 deficit. But St. Lawrence took control in the overtime period and netted a sudden death goal to end the contest.
St. Lawrence now sits in seventh place in the ECAC, while Harvard rests at the bottom of the 12-team conference.
IT’S EASY FOR VESEY
While the return of freshman forward Jimmy Vesey has been unable to snap the team’s six-game losing streak, Vesey has reasserted himself as an offensive powerhouse.
After missing three games in late December and early January representing the United States at the world junior hockey championship, Vesey’s presence has been crucial in putting pucks in the net.
“Well, I think he’s been excellent,” Crimson coach Ted Donato said. “I thought tonight he was tremendous. He was a threat every time he was on the ice, and I think he gave us a big lift.”
Vesey has netted four goals in the last three games—including two against the Saints—and leads Harvard with ten goals on the season. On Saturday, Vesey singlehandedly brought the Crimson back into contention with two consecutive goals to tie up the score early in the second period.
“The second one was a beautiful play by both Blackwell and Hart,” Donato said. “We had a lot of guys step up, and certainly Jimmy was on the top of that list.”
Vesey’s first goal came on a power play in the first period and was the only man-up opportunity that Harvard was able to convert. He tacked on his second goal eleven seconds into the next period.
“We scored a power play goal tonight, and we struggled on power play in the past, and I think that’s good for us going forward,” Vesey said. “Also, we showed a lot of resilience coming back from 2-0 and 3-2, and I think that’s a positive going forward as well.”
SHOTS FIRED
While the Crimson matched the Saints with 14 shots apiece in the third period, it struggled in the first and second.
St. Lawrence opened the game with 14 shots on goal in the first frame, doubling Harvard’s total. The Crimson had a slow second period as well, managing only seven shots to the Saints’ 13.
After opening the first period with a quick shot by senior forward Marshall Everson, Harvard struggled to sustain offensive pressure for most of the frame. The team didn’t manage another shot until after the 13-minute mark.
“[Coach Donato told us to] stick to our forecheck, which we weren’t doing up until that point,” Vesey said. “We only had one shot up to that point, so we were trying to get traffic in front of the net and get some shots, and we took it from there.
After struggling in the first two frames, the Crimson stepped up in the third and matched St. Lawrence offensively, getting several good looks at the Saints’ goal before ultimately falling in overtime. A shot from junior defender Dan Ford bounced around between the posts and was ultimately ruled not to be a goal.
Harvard continued to pound the offensive zone, taking advantage of a two-man advantage to put in seven shots, including three on goal. The team credited the crowd with giving it the extra push to step up the level of play in the third after being outshot significantly in the first and second.
“I think it gives us a little bit of an advantage,” Vesey said. “The crowd was there the whole time, and any time the crowd’s behind you, it’s kind of like having a sixth man on the ice. We could use some momentum when things are going right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team turned the ball over 28 times and shot one-of-19 from deep Saturday in Hanover, N.H., posting its lowest point total of the season in a 58-45 loss to Dartmouth. In its last game two weeks ago, the Crimson (10-5, 1-1 Ivy) tallied its highest score of the year in an 88-66 victory over the same Big Green (3-13, 1-1 Ivy).
“I am shocked,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I did not expect such poor offensive performance. Our shooting was shockingly bad, which is very uncharacteristic of us.”
Junior Christine Clark led all scorers with 22 points. She posted the same tally in the last matchup, but this time it wasn’t enough as no other Harvard player finished in double figures. Sophomore Temi Fagbenle brought down 10 rebounds and accrued eight points but the rest of the team outside of her and Clark only made slightly more than 20 percent of its shots.
Senior Victoria Lippert and co-captain Emma Golen, the team’s second and fifth-highest scorers on the year, respectively, combined to shoot two-for-14, including zero-for-nine from three-point range.
“Our spacing wasn’t good, our timing wasn’t good, and our shooting wasn’t good,” Delaney-Smith said. “A lot of the shots were pretty good shots that didn’t fall that otherwise usually fall.”
Harvard’s inability to rebound consistently on the offensive end made matters worse.
“It’s just unfortunate that two of our very best shooters had a tough night tonight but we have to be able to back them up… and get offensive rebounds and get them second chances,” co-captain Miriam Rutzen said. “We weren’t really able to do that consistently tonight. It was one shot per possession on the offensive end.”
Outside of its shooting performance, the visiting squad did enough to protect its six-game winning streak against Dartmouth. The Crimson held the Big Green to 31 percent shooting, out-rebounded its hosts, 42-30, and only gave up four fast break points despite tallying 28 turnovers.
“Defensively we did fine, we did great,” Delaney-Smith said. “We would have held them to the low-40s if we didn’t have to foul at the end. So it was not the defense; we were absolutely horrible on the offensive end.”
Thanks to its stingy defense, Harvard nearly overcame its poor shooting late in the game. The Crimson hadn’t held a lead since the score was 9-8, but a Clark layup cut the deficit to 44-38 with just under four minutes to play, the smallest Dartmouth’s lead had been in over 10 minutes. After watching their male counterparts erase a large lead in a comeback victory earlier Saturday, the Harvard women knew the game was not lost.
“We never gave up,” Rutzen said. “Our toughness is key, and our willingness to keep fighting through despite adversity was evident.”
But the squad proved incapable of recreating the men’s afternoon success. The teams traded baskets and free throws to move the score to 47-41, but Golen and freshman Shilpa Tummula missed threes on the Crimson’s next two possessions while the Big Green sunk free throws to extend its lead on the other end.
Clark added two late buckets but it wasn’t enough as Dartmouth iced the game with 11 straight made free throws, beating Harvard for the first time since 2010. A number of those charity-stripe conversions came from junior Nicola Zimmer, who tallied a team-high 18 points on the night after missing her team’s previous three matchups, including its first contest against the Crimson.
“She was their absolute emotional leader,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a nice player, she’s important to them.”
Whether it was Zimmer’s return, the change of venue, or another factor that caused the different result, it was clear from the start that Saturday’s matchup would share few similarities with the two teams’ prior engagement.
Whereas Harvard jumped out to a 10-2 lead early two weeks ago, it was Dartmouth who grabbed a 7-1 advantage Saturday. The Crimson erased that early deficit but couldn’t keep up with the Big Green over the full 40 minutes.
“They just took chances, they were physical—they had absolutely nothing to lose and that’s how they played, and we played exactly the opposite,” Delaney-Smith said. “No matter what I could do, no matter who I put in, we just stayed tight.”
While it is still early in the season, the loss hurts Harvard’s ability to achieve its goal of dethroning three-time Ivy champion Princeton. The Crimson still controls its own destiny, but will now need to defeat the Tigers twice to earn the conference crown or hope that another Ancient Eight squad knocks off a Princeton team that notched its 25th straight conference victory with a 74-44 beat down of Penn Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend the women of Harvard Track and Field competed in meets from Boston to Texas, notching high finishes in early season outings.
The events were the team’s first away competitions and many freshmen made their collegiate road debuts.
"I think everybody’s learning about themselves,” freshman Autumne Franklin said. “I think these early-season meets are mostly learning experiences, and that’s what they’re there for…. You always get better because you learn about yourself and how to fix things and tweak this and tweak that to make yourself a greater athlete.”
BU Terrier Invitational
The Crimson traveled across town to the BU Track and Tennis Center for the BU Terrier Invitational on Friday and Saturday, where the team turned in a variety of results.
In a close race, the Harvard ‘A’ team won the 4x400m relay race with a time of 3:44.08, eclipsing a quad from the University of Connecticut by 0.43 seconds. The finish was less than a second from the school record. The winning group included two freshmen, Franklin and Christi Scott, while the ‘B’ team, which placed 13th among the 41 entries, included three rookies, Ali Monfre, Julia Kee and Madison Hansen.
“The four-by-four is one of those bookend events,” Harvard coach Jared Saretsky said. “It almost always ends the meet. We take a lot of pride in having a strong one, and they’ve been working really hard. I know they’re excited to take another crack at the school record.”
The Crimson also raced itself onto the podium in the 400m dash. Sophomore Gabrielle Scott raced to third place in 55.34 seconds. Franklin trailed her by 0.78 seconds and finished in fifth.
“I kind of stepped out of my comfort zone for the first time in a while and so I’m proud of myself for that,” Franklin said. “My four-by-four split was better than my open four because I ran a smarter race in the four-by-four, but at least I know I can actually do it in my open four. I sort of got out too hard in my four hundred and couldn’t maintain it in the end.”
Veteran Sydnie Leroy cleared 3.70 meters to take second play in the pole vault behind Claire Dishong of Cornell. The senior was just short of her personal best of 3.80m, the height Dishong achieved to win the competition.
Harvard found another second place finisher in sophomore Molly Renfer. Renfer completed the 800m run in 2:09.53, just under a second slower than winner Lorain McKenzie, an unattached runner who graduated from the University of Florida in 2008. Renfer was joined in the top ten by freshman Paige Kouba whose time of 2:11.58 placed her in sixth.
Sophomore Ashley Collinsworth was three places from the finals of the 60m dash, which only allows a field of nine runners.  She raced to a twelfth place finish in 7.86 seconds, .10 seconds off her personal best.
 
Texas A&M Mondo Challenge
A pair of Harvard women captured top-five finishes in the pentathlon at the Texas A&M Mondo Challenge on Friday and Saturday at the Gilliam Indoor Track Stadium in College Station, Tex.
Freshman Martina Salander finished second overall with 4094 points out of a field of seven competitors and was followed in fourth by senior Mary Hirst with 3583 points. Senior Keia Pinnick of Arizona State University, who led with 4208 points, won the field. Pinnick won four of the five events in the competition.
Salander won the shot put event. Her second throw of 13.59m launched her ahead of the competition. She put the shot 1.43m further than the second place finisher, sophomore Annie Kunz of Texas A&M. Hirst rounded out the top three with a throw of 12.03m.
Salander notched second place finishes in the 800m run and the long jump and was third in the 60m hurdles and high jump. Hirst leapt into second place in the high jump, clearing 1.72m and trailed her teammate in the other events, placing fourth in the long jump, fifth in the 800m run and sixth in the 60m hurdles.
“I would say I was really pleased with how both performed,” Saretsky said. “It was a great opportunity to go out to Texas and face some national level competition. Mary came away with a lifetime best and Martina broke our school record and is believe, now ranked third in the country so not too shabby.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team (1-2) lost consecutive 5-2 matches to William and Mary (4-2) and Kansas State (1-0). In both matches, the Crimson trailed by only one after the first three matches but then was not able to close out tight matches, losing four of the last five matches both time. The two losses were the first of the year for Harvard.
WILLIAM AND MARY 5, HARVARD 2
In its loss to William and Mary on Friday, Harvard tried a variety of approaches in trying to claw out a couple of singles matches. However, after taking the doubles point, the team lost five of six singles matches as Crimson players varied their strategies in trying to battle back from early breaks of their serves.
On court five, junior Natalie Blosser blasted groundstrokes off each wing past her Tribe opponent but ceded break advantages in each set in a 6-3, 7-5 loss. On court three, freshman Amanda Lin sliced the ball low and away to keep her opponent off balance, venturing into net to keep points shorter, but was unable to put enough pressure on her opponent with her serve and forehand and fell 6-3, 6-2. Against a net-rusher who came in off both serves and returns, co-captain Kristin Norton consistently tried different passing combinations—working in both topspin lobs and flatter groundstrokes—but was broken at key junctures in each set in a 6-4, 6-3 loss.
"I thought it was a very solid second match of the season,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We competed really well for the second match of the season and I’m really proud of the heart that we showed today. Our team showed a lot of composure here today for early in the season and we won a lot of the big points we played in doubles.”
In doubles, the Crimson started slow before finishing strong. After Norton and freshman Amy He dropped line one doubles, 8-0, Harvard fought back from 6-6 ties in the two other matches to break their Tribe opponents and serve out the contests.
"In doubles I think that we all played pretty well,” sophomore Sylvia Li said. “Coach was in our ear telling us ‘believe, believe’ and I think we all did that pretty well.”
KANSAS STATE 5, HARVARD 2
The iconic moment of the Harvard women’s tennis match against Kansas State came at the end of the doubles session. With Harvard trailing 1-0 and down match point on court one, line three teammates co-captain Hideko Tachibana and junior Hannah Morill reached triple match point with a smash. As the two moved back to the baseline, they turned around to find their opponents walking off the court. The line one Wildcats unit had just won, giving the team the doubles point and depriving the Crimson of a chance to finish the match.
In irritation, Tachibana approached the net and called out “Really guys? Come on!” The moment of frustration, which rattled the team, boiled over into the singles, where the Crimson came very close but was denied at crucial junctures in each match.
At line one, Norton fought back from a set down and held four break points in the key seventh game of the third set. However, her opponent proceeded to save every point and broke Norton quickly, subsequently holding to secure the third set, 6-3. At line three, Li battled back after losing the first set 6-0 and held a break lead in the second set before being broken twice, losing 6-4.
Harvard’s most unorthodox player—freshman Crystal Yen—lost only three games on Friday in defeating William and Mary junior Sydney Smith, but fell Sunday, 6-2, 6-4, to an opponent who was willing to play Yen’s game.
Yen typically keeps her opponents off balance with high topspin and relentless consistency, but while Smith was frustrated into frequent errors off both wings, her Sunday opponent matched Yen stroke for stroke in 50-ball rallies that led to a 90-minute first set.
“Crystal is a very deceiving player and a very annoying player to play,” Green said. “She’s very fast and can get everything back and sometimes she can give you no pace and sometimes she can give you a lot of pace. Crystal is a very hard worker and she never gives up. When you have someone like that, you know you’ve got a good player.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traveling halfway across the country for the ITA Kick-Off, the Harvard men’s tennis team split its matches on the weekend in Norman, Okla.
All four teams participating—the Crimson, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and Memphis—were among the top 32 teams in the nation.
“Our weekend was terrific,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “We came out a little bit banged up, which is not anything a coach gets wildly excited about, but we competed really hard and had some really good performances.”
The No. 28 Crimson opened up against the No. 30 Fighting Irish (3-2), and rode consistent production in both singles and doubles to a 4-3 victory.
But despite the close win against an evenly matched opponent, Harvard ended its weekend on a sour note, falling to No. 8 Oklahoma without taking a match.
“Overall, it was really good play, but [the Sooners were] just better,” Fish said. “They deserve to go to the national indoor team championships two weeks from now in Washington.”
OKLAHOMA 4, HARVARD 0
After taking down Notre Dame the day prior, Harvard  was easily beaten by Oklahoma, 4-0, Sunday afternoon.
“This team was definitely a cut higher than [the Fighting Irish],” Fish said. “It was fun—I was watching our guys grow in front of my eyes. They were getting some balls that we weren’t used to seeing, and we would get beaten the first time, and then the second time we’d adjust.”
The Sooners sealed their spot in the Round of 16 in the ITA Championships when Guillermo Alcorta posted a 6-4, 6-3 singles victory over sophomore Alex Steinroeder in the No. 2 match, giving Oklahoma the clinching fourth point to complete the shutout.
Already down by one after a forfeit due to injury, the Crimson lost another singles point when freshman Kelvin Lam lost in two straight sets, 2-6, 0-6.
“Kelvin played some tough people, so he was a little overmatched,” Fish said. “And [sophomore] Shaun Chaudhuri and Alex Steinroeder played one and two with [sophomore] Denis Nguyen out of the lineup, and they played great tennis.”
Chaudhuri and freshmen Nicky Hu and Conor Haughey began their singles matches but neither finished once the Sooners gained their fourth points to seal their victory.
In doubles play, the Oklahoma duo of Costin Paval and Dane Webb opened up the day with an 8-4 win over Chaudhuri and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster. Freshman Nicholas Mahlangu and Steinroeder also tasted defeat at the hands of Peerakit Siributwong and Leonard Stakhovsky, dropping the match, 8-5.
HARVARD 4, NOTRE DAME 3
Harvard and Notre Dame first met in early November, when the Fighting Irish convincingly defeated the Crimson, 7-0. But Harvard stayed competitive throughout in the teams’ second meeting this season, as Harvard battled its way to a 4-3 victory.
“We got smoked [last time],” Mahlangu said. “But we all came out [Saturday] with an unquenchable fire; we all wanted to win. And I think that’s what really just kept everyone going.”
In its first dual match of the season, the Crimson received strong production from both Mahlangu and Steinroeder, who paired to play doubles and dominate their opponents en route to an 8-0 victory.
“We play a lot of doubles in practice, so I feel like we were all pretty prepared for the matches,” Mahlangu said. “Alex always comes out with a lot of energy, so I just always try to match him.”
On the singles side, Mahlangu continued his solid play by defeating Wyatt McCoy at the No. 5 position. In what was the last match to finish, Mahlangu dropped the first set but rallied to win his final two sets, the second coming in a tiebreak.
Steinroeder racked up his second victory of the day in the No. 2 singles spot, soundly defeating Blas Moros by a score of 6-4, 6-3.
MacMaster also claimed a singles victory, winning in straight sets at the No. 4 position.
With Nguyen injured, Chaudhuri played at the No. 1 singles spot and lost to Greg Andrews, the reigning Big East Player of the Year, in three sets. Hu and Lam both suffered straight set defeats.
“We came out with a lot of energy,” Mahlangu said. “We got the doubles points right away, and everyone was pretty fired up because it was the first dual match of the season. We didn’t let down, we kept fighting the entire time, and we ended up winning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard fencing team opened its 2013 slate at the St. John’s Invitational in Queens, N.Y., going 0-5 on the women’s side (5-6) and 4-1 on the men’s team (5-5) against top-10 opponents on Saturday.
Junior co-captain Alexandra Kiefer posted the strongest record of the team through the tournament. Kiefer, who specializes in foil, notched a 13-2 record.
“She’s a rock,” freshman teammate Nina van Loon said. ”She’s insanely consistent and totally confident in basically everything. If I could fence like her, my life would be complete.”
The No. 8 women’s team began the day with a slim loss to No. 3 Columbia, 14-13. While the women successfully took the sabre bouts, 6-3, and edged the Lions in epee, 5-4, they fell to their opponents in the foil, 7-2.
While the next contest would see No. 4 Ohio State best the Crimson, 17-10, Harvard responded with two close bouts against No. 5 Penn State and No. 2 Notre Dame, both 14-13 losses.
Again, the Crimson was able to take the epee event against the Nittany Lions and the Irish, both by scores of 5-4. Harvard similarly won the sabre against Penn State, 6-3, but dropped the same event against Notre Dame, 6-3. Foil again proved to be a losing effort for the team, as the women lost 6-3 and 5-4, respectively.
“I feel like the women’s team as a whole performed really well, especially given the fact that we were down one of our foilists on the squad, and our foil squad is already down a foilist,” van Loon said.
Loon noted that despite the loss, the teamwork displayed by all involved is a good sign for the future.
“The fact that we had two girls that were willing to fence foil, when they don’t really fence foil and were trying their hardest to do well even though they don’t have much time to train, is really impressive,” Loon said. “I was really proud to be part of the team.”
In the final match of the day, the Crimson fell to the hosting No. 6 St. John’s team, 16-11. The Red Storm swept Harvard, winning the foil, 6-3, and the sabre and epee, 5-4.
Epee proved to be the strongest event for the Crimson, with two fencers, van Loon, and sophomore Emma Vaggo, each winning eight bouts.
“I would say my performance was really up and down just because it was the hardest tournament ever because there were so many strong teams that show up,” van Loon said.
Freshman Aliya Itzkowitz also recorded eight wins in her event, the sabre.
The No. 6 men’s team opened the Invitational with Harvard’s sole win, an 18-9 defeat of No. 7 Columbia.
“The Columbia sabre team is very strong,” freshman Duncan O’Brien said. “It includes two highly ranked junior members. They’re a very experienced team and it was great how well we fenced against them.”
Led by senior Thomas Kolasa, the Crimson demolished the Lions in the sabre, 8-1. The team sealed the win with 5-4 victories in the foil and the epee.
Kolasa, along with senior Alexander Rykjik, captured 10 wins in the sabre throughout the day.
The team however, was unable to find its point through the rest of the tournament, as Harvard fell to four higher-ranked opponents.
Against No. 1 Ohio State, Harvard’s strength in sabre showed through, as the team won, 6-3, but the Crimson couldn’t keep up, falling in epee, 6-3, and foil, 7-2. Similarly, the Crimson beat No. 2 Penn State in sabre, 6-3, but lost epee and foil, both 7-2.
The loss to the Nittany Lions was the biggest of the day, 18-9.
No. 3 Notre Dame blanked Harvard in all three weapons, winning the epee, 7-2, and the sabre and foil, both 5-4.
In the final matchup against the home team, No. 5 St. John’s, the Crimson found itself edged out of a win, 14-13. Harvard just barely topped the Red Storm in the epee, 5-4.
The Crimson narrowly lost both the sabre and foil, 5-4, facing several challenging fencers along the way.
“Kolasa had one of the best days of his life,” O’Brien said. “I thought he fenced incredibly well early in the day. He beat some really tough people against Penn State and Notre Dame.”
Next weekend, both the men’s and women’s teams will host the Ivy League Championships at the Gordon Indoor Track.
The tournament is the only home meet for the team this season.
