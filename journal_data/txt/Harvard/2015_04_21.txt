After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tucked away on a busy street corner in Harvard Square, in between the quaint green siding of Peet’s Coffee and Tea and the formidable red brick of the office building two units over, is a rather distinctive glass façade lined by thin pillars of light-brown cedar. At night, this small building transforms into a luminous beacon, shining a warm yellow glow through these wooden slats onto the bustling promenade of Mount Auburn Street.
During the day, one can enter this curious architectural work to find the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery of African & African American Art, which, since opening its doors late last October, has been one of the only exhibition spaces exclusively devoted to such works at Harvard University. Although its grand unveiling roughly coincided with the belated reopening of the Harvard Art Museums last November—which combined the University’s Fogg Museum, Busch-Reisinger Museum, and Arthur M. Sackler Museum over the course of an expansive six-year renovation process—the Cooper Gallery actually traces its origins to the office building next door, the Hutchins Center for African & African American Research.
Through a series of fortunate coincidences, the Cooper Gallery’s inception can be credited to two prominent Yale alumni—Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Ethelbert Cooper—who several years ago sought to establish a permanent exhibition space for African and African-American art on Harvard’s campus. In addition to addressing this historical need, the gallery serves as an idiosyncratic institution that exists at the intersection of art, academia, and sociopolitical discussion by developing and maintaining close, symbiotic relationships with both the Harvard Art Museums and the Hutchins Center.
Gates, the current director of the Hutchins Center, recalls attending Yale in the early 1970s with the gallery's namesake donor. Gates graduated in 1973, followed by Cooper a year later, but they were both members of the same secret society—the Society of the Book and Snake, Gates recalls. Cooper, a Liberian energy magnate, now serves on the board of the Hutchins Center.
Prior to Cooper’s donation, the Hutchins Center was already home to the Neil L. and Angelica Zander Rudenstine Gallery, the first exhibition space at Harvard specifically for artistic works by and about people of African descent, named after a former Harvard president and his spouse. According to Gates, his college years at Yale heavily influenced his emphasis on art in the Hutchins Center. “Because I was an undergraduate at Yale, where the study of African and African-American art were so much a fundamental part of African American studies under the direction of professor Robert Thompson, it’s just never occurred to me not to feature the study of black art in the curriculum and in the Hutchins Center,” Gates says. “And so when we moved over to Mount Auburn Street, we created a space named in honor of former president Neil Rudenstine—the Rudenstine Gallery—and it was very small, and we had many exhibitions there.”
But the Rudenstine Gallery, currently located on the third floor of the Hutchins Center’s 104 Mount Auburn Street property, was constrained by its size. Gates recalls an art curator friend advising him to search for a larger space; fatefully, he stumbled upon an available adjacent property the very next day. “I was walking home, and right at 102 Mount Auburn Street was this vacant space. So I had a person on my staff call, and the space was available,” Gates says.
By the end of the week, the rest of the pieces had miraculously fallen into place. “Literally, this was on a Tuesday, and I got the figure for what the rent would be, and that Friday, an old friend of mine named Bert Cooper…came to see me,” Gates relates enthusiastically. “It’s like a fairy tale. It is an absolutely unbelievable story…. This friend of mine mentioned it on Monday. On Tuesday I saw the space and found out how much it would cost. On Friday my friend comes to town saying he wants to make a major gift to the Hutchins Center because he loved the work that we were doing. And that was it—it was a done deal!”
The Cooper Gallery was designed by Tanzanian architect David Adjaye O.B.E., who previously held several teaching positions at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. According to gallery director Vera Ingrid Grant, the building’s unique glass-and-wood façade is inspired by Adjaye’s parental heritage. “These cedar planks are a metaphorical reference to the Ghanaian forest to invite everyone into the gallery,” Grant says.
The first visible piece of artwork from the gallery’s current exhibit, “Drapetomanía: Grupo Antillano and the Art of Afro-Cuba” is an intricate, white leather sculpture called “Selva en las Paredes” by the Cuban artist Elio Rodríguez Valdés. The foyer’s Entry Gallery is one of what Grant terms “curatorial moments,” and it branches in one direction to the ensuing Ramp Gallery and other artwork and in another towards the auxiliary ACT (Art, Community, and Teaching) Room, which is a technology-enabled venue for community events. The building is home to eight “moments” in total, culminating in the final Long Gallery, which terminates at a currently closed egress to Winthrop Street that forces the viewer back through each of the individual curatorial sections.
According to Grant, the exhibit’s name comes from a supposed mental illness that described the tendency of black slaves to escape from captivity—a derogatory term that has been re-appropriated and recontextualized by exhibit curator professor Alejandro de la Fuente, who aimed to showcase the complex racial themes of Grupo Antillano, a collective of Cuban artists who were only active during the short period of 1978-1983. A professor of Latin American History and Economics, de la Fuente also serves as the director of the Afro-Latin American Research Institute at the Hutchins Center. “The Gallery becomes a space for us to view from art what the Hutchins Center is trying to do in other areas, which is to really be the leading center—not just in the country, but in the world—in the study of black life globally,” he says.
Indeed, the Cooper Gallery serves a unique role as a space for the exploration of African and African American diasporic identities, something highlighted by the “Drapetomanía” exhibition. De la Fuente says its most provocative piece lies at the end of the Long Gallery. Titled “Resurrección,” the sculpture is an original work by Rafael Queneditt, the original director of the Grupo Antillano, and was created exclusively for this exhibit. “If you stand in front of the sculpture, what you find is this Christian figure with the colors of the Cuban flag on its wings. That’s the Cuba that you see. That’s the first Cuba that you encounter: This sort of white-looking, European-looking Cuba,” de la Fuente says. “As you walk around the sculpture, you find another, deeper Cuba: one that is perhaps not so easily visible, but one that is always there. And the sculpture from the back—instead of a cross, what you see is a slave stock, and instead of a Christian angel, what you see are different visual references to Afro-Cuban religions and particularly to Santería, the Yoruba-based Afro-Cuban religion.”
According to Gates, this exhibit’s focus on exploring the Caribbean context of the African diaspora was a very deliberate decision on the part of the Gallery. “I wanted to show that the Gallery was truly pan-African in its scope,” he says. Prior to the Afro-Cuban stylings of “Drapetomanía,” the gallery’s inaugural exhibit last fall explored contemporary Africa through a showing of modern African art from the collection of Italian businessman Jean Pigozzi ’74. Titled “Luminós/C/ity.Ordinary Joy,” this exhibit was curated by Adjaye and Mariane Ibrahim-Lenhardt, the founder and curator of the M.I.A. Gallery in Seattle. “When we approached the Pigozzi collection, which is one of the biggest collections focused on contemporary African art…. David and I were very into creating a form of a city,” Ibrahim-Lenhardt says. “We wanted to offer a critical view of the contemporary condition of the continent through…the situation of the artist who still lives in Africa.”
The opening of the Cooper Gallery—a smaller and separate space from the Harvard Art Museums—was also the impetus for some to criticize Harvard’s historical perceived lack of commitment to African and African-American art. In a December 2014 op-ed in The Crimson, Suzanne P. Blier, a professor of the History of Art and Architecture, wrote, “The separate and notably unequal treatment of African art at Harvard reinforces a long and deep history of racial prejudice in this country that sadly is still present and, in some contexts, even growing today.” Pulitzer Prize winner and New York Times art critic Holland Cotter ’70 agrees that African art has been historically underserved on campus. “Up to this point, Africa has made guest appearances within the larger Harvard museums,” he says. “I think there should be a permanent place for Africa in that larger art historical picture, just as there should be always courses taught on the art of Africa in the Art History department.”
Nonetheless, the Cooper Gallery is a victory in many regards for the representation of African and African-American art at Harvard. “I think one of the great strengths of it is that very fact, that it’s able to bring in cutting-edge, provocative exhibits, or engage students in the mounting of exhibits in a relatively short space of time,” Blier says. However, some argue that the Cooper Gallery pales in comparison to similar offerings at other Ivy League institutions. According to Cotter, African art is a central focus of the Yale University Art Gallery. “It has an entire gallery and curator devoted to the art of Africa, old and new,” he says. In contrast, the lone exhibit on Africa within the Harvard Art Museums is in the University Collections Gallery, which currently features an impermanent exhibit guest curated by Kristina Van Dyke that displays African artifacts from Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
Blier does acknowledge the tension inherent in making curatorial decisions, which by definition must exclude certain works from being displayed. “It’s one of the dilemmas of modern museums that it takes so long to organize shows, and often there isn’t enough space in large museums to have the kind of sort of diverse exhibits that are brought into play in the Cooper Gallery. And the fact that the Cooper Gallery is dedicated to the extraordinarily rich traditions of African diaspora art and really focuses on those traditions specifically also gives it a special importance,” she says.
Further, De la Fuente finds it significant to emphasize the differences between African artifacts and art. “It’s incredibly important to share with the Harvard community that African and Afro-diasporic peoples are also creators of art. Not a folk culture, but of real art, including contemporary art, which is what this exhibit does as well,” he says. Jeffrey Quilter, the director of the Peabody Museum, realizes the complexity of such discussions. In an emailed statement, he writes, “The issues concerning why collections of art/material culture at Harvard or in the world at large are in different kinds of institutions and are treated as ‘art’ or not, are due to both specific historical events as well as larger scale socio-cultural-political processes that are complex and difficult to unravel for a wide variety of reasons including the conditions of the bequests of donors, the history of The Academy and museums, and many other issues.” He adds, “Whether the Cooper Gallery should or should not be a separate institution, too, also is not an easy question to answer.”
The question that Quilter poses is one that many involved with the gallery have contemplated at great length. Grant says the Cooper Gallery’s unique development makes it a one-of-a-kind institution, especially because of its partnerships with both the Harvard Art Museums and the Hutchins Center. “[The Harvard Art Museums] have a legacy they’re dealing with—how was it dealt with in this new renovation? And what was decided would be forefronted and what became marginalized? Those are huge decisions and they’re not going to make everyone happy. And I think in terms of African and African-American art, we would have hoped for a much more expansive inclusion,” she says. “At the same time, this project absolutely was a separate and individual endeavor on the part of the Hutchins Institute, Bert Cooper, and Henry Louis Gates.”
While the project was conceived separately, Gates adds that a collaboration with the Harvard Art Museums was critical to allowing the Hutchins Center to establish this gallery. “I think of the Cooper Gallery as being part of the Art Museums. And we conferred with them to get their advice about how to set it up…. We have different committees and we have different people from the Art Museums sitting on those committees. I didn’t want it to be ‘separate but equal,’ in the old phrase. It’s just a specialized gallery focusing on art from the black world,” he says.
Although the existence of the Cooper Gallery does not necessarily override Harvard’s lackluster history with African art, or serve as a substitute for the lack of permanent African exhibitions in the Harvard Art Museums, it does function as a versatile space for the intersection of different communities. Cotter believes that the gallery serves a crucial role on campus in addressing such an important gap in Harvard’s artistic landscape. “I think it has to serve as a kind of multipurpose space, given that there’s no other place at Harvard that is devoted to art from the African continent,” he says.
Despite its smaller square footage compared to the Harvard Art Museums, the Cooper Gallery has already managed to execute an impressive display of programming during its first months. Just this calendar year, the gallery has featured regular film screenings as part of a Cuban Cinema Series and even held a Valentine’s Day Cuban chocolate tasting as part of a guided tour event featuring Rodríguez Valdés. “The array of programming around the exhibit has been really terrific too, whether it’s been films or discussions or engagements with artists,” Blier says.
The Cooper Gallery is a separate institution from the Harvard Art Museums, but one that is now inextricably integrated into the artistic conversation at Harvard. According to Grant, the Gallery’s relationship with the Hutchins Center yields it the opportunity to be more innovative and audacious in its operations. That said, the gallery still serves an important primary purpose in providing a permanent exhibition space for different types of African and African American art and allowing the public to interact with it in novel ways. “Look at our political-social landscape. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done. Art provides a wonderful healing and restorative space for some of the actions and experiences that are happening,” Grant says.
“There’s no other entity,” Gates adds. “We’re educating the American public about the nature of African and African-American art, and nothing could please me more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From its opening note, Katie Crutchfield’s new album released under her project Waxahatchee distinguishes itself from her previous two. While “American Weekend” and “Cerulean Salt,” released in 2012 and 2013, respectively, on Don Giovanni Records, opened with the sounds of Crutchfield’s melancholic guitar, “Ivy Tripp,” Crutchfield’s major label debut on Merge Records, is an experimental and expansive new release—it instead begins with a synth line that sounds more like a corroded organ. Crutchfield and her backing band, made up of Kyle Gilbride and Keith Spencer, have created 13 denser, richer songs that, nonetheless, manage to feel like a continuation and progression of Waxahatchee’s project rather than a departure.
Crutchfield has been making and performing music in bands since the mid-2000s, when she and her twin sister Allison performed in spirited pop-punk bands such as the Ackleys, P.S. Eliot, and Bad Banana. Since 2010, Katie has been performing with her project Waxahatchee. Her debut album, “American Weekend,” written and self-recorded in a week in her parents’ home, is an intense, raw listen. Crutchfield sings achingly and blisteringly of loss, grief, longing, and self-loathing over a soft guitar. “Cerulean Salt” is equally painful and powerful, featuring better recording quality and a sort of sharpening and amplifying of Crutchfield’s sound, with the addition of a backing band. Compared to “Cerulean Salt,” “Ivy Tripp” is an even bigger gamble, but Crutchfield’s sonic experimentation pays off powerfully.
This isn’t to say that Crutchfield’s sound on her latest album is entirely different from that on her previous releases. The album’s second track, “Under a Rock,” is reminiscent of her earlier work, blending elements of punk, folk, and even country. Crutchfield sings with searing force about a former lover: “The brick house that you built around your cranium / You wear it like a crown.” She is vehemently done with him—“You’re someone else’s mess tonight”—or so it initially seems.The song is scathing, but nuanced, resisting easy answers or conclusions about the ended relationship. Throughout the song, Crutchfield repeats the word maybe—in fact, it’s the final word on the track. She sings with an aching, wistful, and resigned quality, adding both ambivalence and complexity to the song.
In her song simply titled “<,” Crutchfield sings about another failed relationship—“I reveal more and more / Sculpting the bust / Of a man I'll forever ignore.” The final line of the song, “You’re less than me and I am nothing,” she repeats over and over again, like an incantation. This self-effacement is familiar territory for Waxahatchee—on the closing track of “Cerulean Salt,” “You’re Damaged,” she sang with a lacerating intensity: “This place is vile, and I’m vile too.” However, the sonic landscape of “<” is not so familiar. As Crutchfield repeats the final line, a clatter of guitar, drums, and pure noise builds under her singing. This sound continues for several bars after her voice stops. It is as if the song is powerfully bent, twisted to reveal some new way of expressing and moving through the emotions she sings about.
The track that is the farthest from her previous work, “La Loose,” is also one of the loveliest on the album. It is poppy and New Wave-y—complete with shimmering synths, a kicky drumbeat, and an ooh-ing hook. The lyrics, nonetheless, are pure Waxahatchee: “I know that I feel more than you do / Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh / I selfishly want you here to stick to.” It is an eviscerating, eminently danceable listen—a powerfully skewed take on a painful, dysfunctional relationship.
Waxahatchee’s “Ivy Tripp” is ultimately a powerful piece of art. It addresses pain, but, in its experimental fashion, it also explores how to represent pain in new ways. On the final track, “Bonfire,” Crutchfield sings of a friend in pain: “You got your heart broken / Now you unfold it when you're falling down.” The final words of the song, and the final words she offers as consolation are, “I say go ahead.” It is an emotionally evocative reckoning with pain, a powerful conclusion to to a stunning album.

Brimming with vitality both in her personality and in her music, composer, conductor, and arts educator Tania León draws on influences from all around the world in crafting her distinctive sound. Born in Cuba and now based in New York, León came to Cambridge to speak about her career and artistic outlook in a conversation presented by the Harvard University Department of Music on Thursday. The Crimson caught up with León on Saturday before the second of two concerts in Paine Hall featuring her 2006 piece “Toque.”
The Harvard Crimson: How would you describe your style of composition?
Tania León: I don’t know how to define myself. When I was starting I was rooted in trying the different techniques of the time—mainly the twelve-tone technique and serialism—so I tried everything and did works in all of those things. Later on, in the 1980s, I went to Cuba after not being able to go there for a while…. My father…was very intrigued about my sounds, and he didn’t feel that they had anything to do with who he thought I was…. He died after that…so he left with that question…. So I went into a quest trying to figure out what I was saying with my sounds…and that’s why I started bringing plenty of influences, musical influences into my life.… In other words I have been, in a sense, composing myself. That’s why I can’t define myself as generically in one style, because it doesn’t conform with my inner curiosity.
THC: How did you get started in composition?
TL: I was not thinking about becoming a composer at all…. I had big plans of being a pianist traveling all over the world, and I was a concert pianist…. The whole thing changed for me out of necessity perhaps because I met Arthur Mitchell, [the first African-American principal dancer at the New York City Ballet and founder of the Dance Theatre of Harlem]…. I went to play to replace a friend of mine who was playing for [his] dance…. One day Arthur said to me, “Why don’t you write a piece?” And that’s how the whole thing started. So I went to NYU and I said I wanted to shift to composition because I had to compose to understand…putting a piece together. It’s like writing poetry with sounds.
THC: Do you have a favorite part of the composition process?
TL: Not really, because when you are going to compose a piece, in my case, you get a little bit hysterical because you have to create that world that you might envision in your mind, and you get a lot of ideas, and you have music in your head, and the thing is—how do you begin? And then once you’re in, how do you end?  There’s also the world of sketching; it’s a puzzle, but once you get inside and you start creating the structure that is going to give the piece a form or is going to pull the piece together, then it becomes multi-structured. You have the arc and then you have the infrastructure, which means, rhythm, pitch, content, a sense of space, and the sense of timing and contrast.  There’s a lot going on, and you have to think about creating what we call a piece.
THC: How do you get your original ideas?  Do you have any favorite sources of inspiration?
TL: Anything. I love museums. Visuals do something to me, specifically art.  And it can be anything, anything that processes. I look at my iPad, and one of my dreams is to see what’s inside. I like to see how things are constructed. In painting, I look and I can see the mind of the person who put this all together, the strokes they used. If you go to the Louvre, there are all of these paintings from way back, and it’s still the same paint that makes the colors; there’s the element of not being able to destroy the artwork. When I was growing up, I wanted to be a lot of things, but I think it was all driven by the same curiosity.

The Harvard Art Museums have recently undergone a series of expansions, uniting their three buildings into a single facility and adding gallery space as well as classrooms and lecture halls. To celebrate the historical transformation of the buildings, on April 17, the museums opened a new installation, “Triangle Constellation,” by Mexican artist Carlos Amorales.
Suspended from the glass roof above Calderwood Courtyard, the specially-commissioned mobile sculpture connects 16 triangles with a flexible framework. According to Mary Schneider Enriquez, the Houghton associate curator of modern and contemporary art, it is the first artwork that visitors see upon entering the museum. This hopefully will lead them to look up and, through its steel skeleton, ponder upon the whole interior of the six-story building. Situated at the center of the building, the piece occupies a unique location that provided both challenges and inspiration for Amorales. “[The museums] use the courtyard as a space that’s public, so all things happen here,” he says.  “It’s not an exhibition gallery, but where people walk through, so this brings a very specific challenge.”
“Triangle Constellation” was created by Amorales to resonate with the character of the Harvard Art Museums. The graduated scale of the triangle, for example, symbolizes the expansion of the museums. “One inspiration I’ve been thinking about is the tornado,” Amorales says. “It is something that moves and spins, growing up, so it really has the sense of expansion.”
Amidst the Harvard Art Museums’ rich collection of more traditional works, “Triangle Constellation” shows the museums’ hope to make more contemporary works and artworks of more diverse forms accessible to visitors. “We are an institution of very strong historical collection, whether it’s Egypt or Ancient European or Impressionist,” Schneider Enriquez says. “Our contemporary collection has been slower to build. We are broadening and growing that collection, and [Amorales’s] piece really fits into the direction we’re taking.”
The museums curators first considered creating an installment on the ground, but since the Calderwood Courtyard is a busy, active area, they decided that they wanted a work that could be hung from the ceiling. It took Amorales almost two years to create a piece that suits this environment, and Schneider Enriquez describes the result as a simple and extremely organic form. “You have to see it well, to see it in different ways. It looks different everywhere,” she says. “The whole black structure is literally like the veritable of a fish. Not only does it appear this way, but it [also] moves and flows in this space. It draws us from here [the ground] way up to the cross space.”
According to Enriquez, other aspects about the location were also considered, including the natural light that comes through the glass roof and the locations of the two entrances on each side of the sculpture. Amorales also made his work more physically interactive by using an orchestra triangle as the smallest triangle in the installation. “You could play that triangle and make sounds from that triangle,” Amorales says. In this sense, the sculpture becomes a work that is not only visual but also potentially acoustic.
As a new addition to the Harvard Art Museums’ renovations, “Triangle Constellation” will be on display for several years after its inauguration, and the museums hope that it will complement the diverse works of art visible in the courtyard and those in the collections. “I’m thrilled [by the addition of this work],” Schneider Enriquez says. “I think throughout the museums everyone is very excited about it.”

Several chapters of Toni Morrison’s “God Help the Child” begin with a simple, harrowing statement. It’s not my fault, says one narrator. I’m scared, says another. Then: She’s lying. I thought he was a predator. Stark and straightforward, the phrases place brutal trauma in the context of everyday experience, tracing complicated psychological states in relatively inarticulate characters. Such is the essential project of Morrison’s novel. “God Help the Child” masterfully explores the nature of victimhood and the consequences of child abuse through a series of fascinating and believable narrators, and, while it fails to measure up to Morrison’s best work, it nonetheless serves as a fine addition to her canon.
One of the novel’s most interesting creations is its main character, Bride. Young, beautiful, and extremely dark-skinned, Bride owns a Jaguar, works at a cosmetics company, and enjoys the attentions of her boyfriend, Booker. After he leaves her and disappears, though, Bride begins to unravel both physically and emotionally; her miserable, loveless childhood begins to resurface. Her history and breakdown eventually become intermingled with the peripheral stories of her friend Brooklyn, her mother Sweetness, a child named Rain, and Booker himself, all characters with their own early emotional scars.
Among relatively conventional characters, Bride embodies a strange and compelling combination of ethereality and blunt human familiarity. Some of her actions—unexpectedly offering friendship to a woman who she helped to commit to prison for child rape, for one—seem utterly removed from the novel’s reality, and depictions of her physical appearance further serve to distance her from the everyday. Booker describes her as “a midnight Galatea,” a composition of night darkness and starlight. Her body also undergoes a transformation that can only be described as strangely magical-realist, reflecting this borderline fantastic tendency of many of Morrison’s novels.
However, Bride’s enigmatic allure often mixes intriguingly with a squalidly ordinary sense of arrogance and insecurity. Her makeup line is called “YOU, GIRL,” an insistent and narcissistic affirmation of self appropriate for a woman who whines about a lack of nail polish in the backwoods and repeatedly asks herself why she can be sad if she is beautiful. Bride’s flaws remain more humorous than truly repulsive, though, and Morrison imbues her character with occasional flashes of virtue. She may be bratty, but she also demonstrates a touching idealization of her friend Brooklyn—“the one person I can trust,” she rhapsodizes—and a willingness to grow and learn. The Bride at the end of the novel is a far more sincere and honest person than the Bride of the beginning, having completed an immense but believable metamorphosis. And, most importantly, Bride undergoes a deeper transformation: An initially submerged strain of childhood torment surfaces and becomes strength. This successful psychological and tonal complexity becomes the novel’s primary source of texture.
Bride also commands a distinctive narrative voice. Her sections are readily distinguishable from those of Brooklyn, Rain, and Sweetness, each of which involves its own complicated language: Brooklyn juggles colloquial humor and startling nastiness, Rain speaks plainly, and Sweetness combines confused earnestness with profound guilt. Booker’s sections take place primarily in the third person, but the rough stream-of-consciousness Morrison utilizes nonetheless succeeds in portraying a complex character, a deeply passionate and tormented man. In one particularly subtle instance, Booker remembers the September before a childhood trauma as a time when “nothing anywhere had begun to die.” None of the characters—even Booker, an amateur poet—are especially poetic, and Morrison conspicuously avoids the intricate, lush, lyrical prose that characterizes her early work. Still, she manages to convey an incredible level of human nuance through relatively sparse and natural speech.
The overlapping narratives serve a thematic purpose as well as an aesthetic end. Events appear from different perspectives, creating an insightful analysis of miscommunication in female friendships, romantic relationships, and families. Bride adores Brooklyn as someone she “couldn’t have healed without,” while Booker recalls the same person as an “obnoxious pseudofriend.” Likewise, Booker recalls encircling Bride’s waist upon meeting her as “more than a natural gesture; it was an inevitable one,” though Brooklyn regards the same instance as predatory. On a more fundamental level, the narrative dissonances reflect a key question about the nature of childhood. Sweetness recalls certain interactions with Bride as much more benevolent than Bride herself remembers them, and Sweetness justifies actions that her daughter condemns. The result is as a thoughtful exploration of parental culpability and early trauma.
This investigation of intimate social life—the tension between trust and wariness, the navigation of openness and resistance—is only one of the novel’s surface considerations. On a deeper level, “God Help the Child” considers the idea of victimhood in society across race and gender lines, and it does so with wonderful delicacy and perceptivity. The color symbolism, for example, becomes powerful without ever being explicitly explained: Appropriate to the modern-day, illusorily post-racial world, Bride wears white clothes to seem sophisticated but never acknowledges the prejudicial implications. The idea of mastering one’s blackness by becoming white constitutes just one of many complex concepts buried deep in the text.
Then again, the novel’s explorations of race never even approach the brilliance of those undertaken in “Beloved,” nor does it match “The Bluest Eye” for depth in its consideration of child abuse: [the][CAPS] former is one of the seminal works on race in American literature, and the latter is an unrelenting and viciously complex investigation into familial violence. “God Help the Child” inevitably fails to live up to such high standards. Still, the novel does not seem like a bid at another Nobel Prize-winning masterpiece. Short, plot-driven, and more colloquial than complexly poetic, the book is precisely the incisive fable it attempts to be.

The Harvard Book Store newsletter is not often a source of particular controversy. But in their January 2002 edition, they put out a column entitled “Spotlight: McLean Alumni” highlighting works on or of former residents of the infamous psychiatric hospital—Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, etc.—that could be purchased in the store. At the top of this list was Lydia Davis’s name. Davis, a renowned short story author and translator, has never been a patient of McLean’s, and, in fact, has only been inside that storied institution once, to visit a friend. In response to this newsletter, she penned a complaint entitled “Letter to a Marketing Manager.”
On the evening of April 8, the Harvard Book Store sponsored a reading and talk by Davis at the Brattle Theater. In a self-conscious acknowledgement of the aforementioned series of embarrassing events, an enormous image of the fateful newsletter was projected onto a screen on the stage. Davis began her talk—at which she was to read from her work and speak about her experience as writer—by reading the letter in question. Like many of her best pieces, it at first appears to be about an ordinary situation, but it becomes something funnier, weirder, and more wonderful.
Davis’s works are often only a few paragraphs or fewer and sometimes are no more than a witty or affecting one-liner. In addition to the aforementioned letter, she read other letters of complaint and many short stories she had written. Two particularly notable pieces included a celebrated letter addressed to a frozen peas manufacturer and a series of short anecdotes by Flaubert that she had pulled from his letters and translated. She generally delivered her works in a deadpan and slightly wry tone.
During the question and answer session, Davis, unlike her writerly self, spoke in a less prepared style—she gave long, thorough answers that seemed at least a little at odds with her usual brevity. Many audience members were curious as to how she came to her distinct, compact style. Why, one audience member wanted to know, does she consider what she writes to be stories, as opposed to poems, essays, or otherwise? In response to this query, Davis spoke to the difficulty of finding one word to cover the whole of what she does. But, she said, all her writing comes out of the same processes. “When I set out to write something, I don’t think ahead of time. I don’t think in categories, so I don’t think, this is going to be a rant, a meditation, a poem, or just a story,” she said. Later, she gave an expansive definition of what a story is. “If there is any narrative in it at all, if there’s a little tiny scrap of narrative, if there’s an I, if there’s a thought, if there’s a ladybug doing something, if there’s just something you can start with to build a little story around in your imagination, as a reader, then I think it is justified to call it a story,” she said.
One audience member asked her if she finds herself overwhelmed by all the possibilities around her, given that she can find a story in the minutest of details. “It’s true, I could feel that way. I could see why you think I might,” Davis said. This elicited significant laughter from the audience. She continued: “If I were writing a conventional short story, then it would take longer, and I would be making up a lot of it. But as it is, I am taking little bits of everyday life.” She then conceded to the audience member’s assertion. “It’s true that there’s just a wealth of stories. But I somehow don’t feel overwhelmed.”
Only once could Davis remember feeling overwhelmed. “On a train, I looked out a window, and I thought, what if you wrote up this train journey.” she said. “What if you wrote up everything you saw out the window, like every kind of rock you explain what it is. Every kind of tree. Every factory building, what it used to be. And then I felt overwhelmed. Because I kind of wanted to do it, but it would be an immense book. It would be interesting.”

For her last project as a student director at Harvard, director Ally M. Kiley ’15 will transform the Loeb mainstage into the aggressively average, small-town setting of “Middletown.” The play, which opens April 24, is an avant-garde drama that seeks to explore a confusing, unlikely, and short-lived relationship between two strangers.
"The thing that I really wanted to focus on is this feeling of loneliness,” Kiley says. “I think that this show is particularly resonant here because I think Harvard can be a lonely place for a lot of people. We as students at this age are constantly making these connections with other people, and sometimes they turn out to be really meaningful connections, and sometimes they just sort of dissipate.”
Cast members say that Kiley’s directing style revolves around giving her actors the freedom to explore these feelings of loneliness before she steps in to guide their portrayals. “Ally as a director is wonderful because she always has an answer but will only give it if you need it,” says Taylor Kay Phillips ’15, who plays protagonist Mary Swanson. “She can have been quiet for the entire rest of the [rehearsal], but as soon as you ask [a question], she has two or three answers ready to go…which makes you realize that she has answers to everything that you haven’t asked too.”
What’s more, Kiley says that her decision to apply for the Loeb mainstage—a space that is significantly larger than any other she had worked in before—was shaped in part by her desire to highlight this theme of loneliness. “The expansiveness of this theater is something that serves [“Middletown”] really well,” Kiley says. “In previous years I’ve seen a lot of shows try to bring the seats in and make the theater more intimate, but I really do want to emphasize the empty space here.”
Even more innovative and unusual is Kiley’s decision to add a score to the originally dialogue-only script. “I have always loved [music] as a storytelling device, and knew I wanted to incorporate it in some way,” Kiley says. This instinct led to the musical collaboration between Kiley and Sam C. Pottash ’16, the show’s composer.
“After talking about it a lot, [Ally and I] decided that the band could play lots of different roles,” Pottash says. “I call it a dramatically integrated band, at the risk of sounding like a total liberal arts student.” Not only will the three-piece band play snippets of popular songs in scene transitions, but it will also provide sound effects—like that of a phone ringing or a radio being tuned—in creative ways.
Why go to the trouble of composing a score and enlisting a band for a play that doesn’t call for these things? “The thing about Middletown is that it’s so real that it’s hilarious—but heartbreaking—because you cannot help but instinctually see yourself in the characters onstage,” Pottash says. “It’s just so human and visceral and to me; I don’t know what could give a more visceral reaction than music.”

The actors of Magnificent Bastard Productions, Ltd. take their craft very seriously—their craft beer, that is. Clad in sparkly pink Converse high-tops and minstrel-like garb, cast leader The Compère (Lewis Ironside) introduces the show by revealing the (impressive) quantity of alcohol consumed by the actors before the performance and dubbing the front rows the “vom zone.” From the start, it is clear that this isn’t going to be your average Shakespeare production; “Shit-faced Shakespeare,” which just announced an extension through June 20 of its run at the Davis Square Theater, is an unconventional interpretation of the beloved classic “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The performance’s interactive nature and bawdy humor engages the audience from the start and sets the stage for a fast-paced hour that is less a play than a wild, bizarre, and wholly satisfying experience, one that belongs just as much to the audience members as to the actors.
Advance knowledge of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” or any Shakespeare at all, is unnecessary to enjoy the event. A brief review of the plot, while helpful for any audience members interested in more dedicatedly following along, does not necessarily guarantee an understanding of the madcap action taking place onstage. The story serves as more of a backdrop than anything else; the only explanation Helena (Stacey Norris) provides for the irregularities in her slurred soliloquies—such as “to die like an orgasm is dying”—is “if you know Shakespeare it’s fine.” In the middle of a dramatic speech by Lysander (Saul Marron), Helena additionally interjects with a giggly, “What does that mean?”—a sentiment likely echoed by many audience members struggling to follow the play’s plot.
Yet even in the moments when it’s impossible to comprehend her lines, Helena shines in her role as the cast’s main imbiber. As she knocks over props and tries to kiss Hermia (Beth-Louise Priestley), slurring her professions of love and interrupting other actors’ attempts to deliver various, slightly-more-intelligible speeches, Helena entertains spectators and her openly-laughing fellow cast members alike. She continues the interactive style of the show by pulling various audience members onstage for light mockery and telling all who try to interfere with her antics to “fuck off.”
As the show proceeds and blood-alcohol levels rise, the cast’s humor becomes more and more risqué. If audience members were to take a shot every time Helena says penis, every viewer would have to use the free Lyft code included with their ticket to get home. When she points out that Lysander appears a bit too prominently through his tights, for instance, he bashfully replies that “it doth groweth, not showeth.” Proving that the only size that matters is that of the handle of vodka she has consumed, Helena exclaims, “Give me that teeny tiny penis!”—forcing the director to intervene on both actors’ behalf while Helena playfully licks his face. While her antics and crude gestures are consistently amusing and undeniably the highlight of the show, they are occasionally distracting enough that she is played off the stage with an aggressive musical interlude.
The interactive nature of the show ensures that each performance is unique. Warning the wielders of these tools not to “blow their load too early,” The Compère presents members of the front row with a gong and a horn to be banged and blown, respectively, if the actors seem to be sobering up. It’s often hard to tell which moments are staged and which are spontaneous. Helena’s use of the word “cunt” brings Ironside running from behind the curtain to chastise her, leading to the impassioned proclamation, “I’m reclaiming it—then they can’t use it against us! Revolution!” Her outbursts are made no less amusing by the possibility that they are planned—but the show would benefit from a slight reduction in their frequency, should the cast care to implement some semblance of continuity in the plot.
The real hero of the story might be Hermia, who spends almost 20 minutes of the show lying down pretending to be asleep and admirably resisting the urge to laugh at the nonsense occurring above her. Puck (Mac Young) serves as a happy medium between Helena’s carousing and Hermia’s relatively more serious demeanor, flamboyantly delivering eloquent lines while continuing to interact with the crowd and tailoring his performance according to audience response. As a transition between one of his scenes and one of Lysander’s, a minstrel-style “Rather Be” plays in the background, driving home the unapologetically upbeat nature of the show.
When the horn blows as the play nears its close, right before the requisite, if slightly random, sword fight episode, Helena cracks a Sam Adams and sprays her “love juice” on several unlucky-but-uncomplaining victims in the proximity. In lieu of a bow to end the show, the actors fittingly exit by raising a beer to an adoring crowd. A sparklingly irreverent show that would be just as much fun to watch sober as drunk (well, almost), “Shit-faced Shakespeare” is a without a doubt a worthy contribution to the Boston theater scene. This is no stuffy English classroom or overly-pretentious performance: It’s chaotic, it’s crass, it’s fun, and it’s a show that certainly should not be missed.

In the home where I lived for a year, we lay the electric lines against the concrete walls in government housing ourselves. I joke about it now with Nancita when I can reach her in the long distance letters that take weeks to reach the Amazon, as though we live in different centuries. And I can’t talk to this woman who is my adopted sister, mother, and best friend, because in her century it’s hotter and the rain is pouring through the sunshine, the distance too soggy and long to bridge with words. It’s a far-reaching joke today, but when we were trying to figure out how to get the wires to stay, the question of tape was a very immediate problem.
Excuse me very much, but who forgets to use electrical tape when they are dealing with literal wires? The crackle every night would wake me, and we had to get them checked twice to be sure the job was done right, albeit with Scotch Tape in some of the wrong places.
You don’t have to be an engineer to imagine what was going wrong when I was taping wires to the concrete walls and navigating the corrugated iron ceiling with my bare hands while Nancita held the wooden door open and picked at the lock she had installed when I moved in (moved in and away from an arbitrarily assigned host family and into her house like the wrecking ball that I am, with what little I had to offer from my fellowship stipend, and a reliance on the trust we had built in the short span of a month). She taught me a thing or two about the right way to use soap when you wash clothes in the river, how to shake cockroaches out of my scrubs and throw them back on, how to make tea from roots you pull right out of the ground, and how to avoid the ones that will kill you slowly if you try to eat them. But she also relied on me, in a partnership that is evolved motherhood, sisterhood, and daughterhood, to make light happen with electricity against the walls and to make water run through the lines we laid down in the backyard after digging it up for what felt like endless weeks of overturning fresh dirt.
She didn’t say, “I love you,” but she did say, “Live with me.” She didn’t say, “I’ll care for you,” but she did march silently into my room and aggressively nail a sliding lock into the rickety wooden doorframe with a determination that made it impossible to say how easy it would be to just break the door. She didn’t say, “I want you to thrive here,” but she laid the last bit of yucca on the table when there was nothing in the house to eat and nowhere for any of us to go but home, and she never said, “There is no dinner.” She didn’t say, “Who you are matters to me, and wherever you’re coming from, it doesn’t define your future.” But she did say, “Come into the bed with me.” She didn’t say, “I will feel with you,” but she did cry and cry for the things I couldn’t cry for. She didn’t promise to heal me, but she did hold me until I could cry again.
And I didn’t say what I meant, either. The complex world is not so simply articulable. I didn’t say thank you every day that I should have, but the wires still lay against the wall in the palpable darkness, against the emptiness in the room that was mine, and the crackle and spark is the smallest flickering inch of an expansive fathom of gratitude, the smallest inch I hope she still sees, across the centuries of space between us.

The artists:
The relationship between art and reality is perennially ambiguous. Should the purpose of art be to reproduce reality or to break away from reality in what English writer Arthur Christopher Benson calls a “story of escape?” Should artistic representations of the past be factually accurate or opposed to historical fact? One potential answer to these questions can be found in the words of Swiss visual artist Alberto Giacometti: “The object of art is not to reproduce reality, but to create a reality of the same intensity.” In this vein, what brings together screenwriter Michael B. Luo ’16 and pianist Alex P. Beyer ’17 is their use of a modern artistic lens to recontextualize universal human experiences that are otherwise difficult to articulate, giving these experiences a greater relevance, intensity, and viscerality.
Michael produces and writes for Ivory Tower, the longest-running show under the umbrella organization of Harvard Undergraduate Television. Ivory Tower’s latest installment, “Absent,” is a six-part series that explores the tight-knit friendships among six Harvard students who have inexplicably become literally invisible. Despite the otherworldly nature of the protagonists’ invisibility, the plot’s themes are quite relatable, tapping into the underlying concerns of Harvard students. “We play around with a lot of social themes, like trust, betrayal, and love,” Michael explains. “There are characters who are put out of their element socially and romantically, or trying to overcome their past—it’s not just sci-fi.” The juxtaposition of the supernatural and the everyday allows Michael to explore precisely what he loves about film, namely the medium’s ability to “take an audience away to another dimension where emotions and dreams can manifest themselves on screen, leaving memorable impacts.” The result is unconventional yet empathetic, alien yet entirely relevant.
While film and TV have generally embraced innovative adaptations of classic works and ideas, the growing movement of historically informed performance in classical music has prompted a struggle to reconcile modern technological developments with a respect for historical practice. The historically informed performance movement is devoted to the rigorous study of early music, with an emphasis on staying true to the aesthetic standards of centuries past. This goal often involves performing on instruments from a specific time period that are seldom heard on the modern classical stage, such as the harpsichord or viola da gamba. Proponents of the movement argue that using modern means to replicate past works only leads present and past aesthetic standards to converge in a faulty compromise, in which the former overtakes the latter to produce an inauthentic or anachronistic account of an historical work.
Alex, a classical pianist, possesses an artistic philosophy that looks beyond historical performance and readily embraces the modern piano and other more recent musical instruments. “I prefer the capacities of sound that we have now,” he says, adding that “it’s okay to expand beyond previous thresholds of sound, because obviously the capacities of instruments have changed.” Even though the instruments of the time were limited, he asserts that “the music itself, as it was conceived, is not limited, but rather boundless. For classical and baroque music, I always think of landscapes that are not limited by their time.” Incidentally, much of Alex’s inspiration to shine a more modern light on historical repertoire comes from his fascination with film and “its ability to create really visceral experiences,” which he attributes to the “shocking things” that can now be done on screen using advanced technology. This influences the way he sees the historical performance debate: “Seeing all this development in film makes it hard to limit other art forms to something confined.”
Michael’s and Alex’s perspectives invite reflection on how modern technology and ideas enable artists to bring out hidden insights into reality and history. In Alex’s eyes, historical performance paints an incomplete picture of a composer’s immense, almost otherworldly vision, whose complete manifestation is more readily facilitated by modern instruments and sounds. Likewise, Michael’s work for “Absent” suggests that “unreal” art is not necessarily “untruthful”; although “Absent” is unrealistic in that it immerses its characters in surreal, physically unfeasible situations, it is arguably truthful in its portrayal of genuine, relevant social situations. Even if art does not directly replicate reality or history, it can perhaps make us understand them on a deeper level, while granting both creators and audiences greater freedom from the demands, stereotypes, and limitations of the past and present. As with fantastical takes on everyday life such as in “Absent” or with modern adaptations of historical pieces in music, the most convincing artistic experiences often require a transcendence, rather than a rote replication, of reality, as well as a reconfiguration, rather than a mere affirmation, of the past.

In 2015, social networks are not news to anyone. They have been around long enough that any movie seeking to capitalize on the novelty of Facebook or Skype gives off a faint waft of obsolescence. Levan Gabriadze’s “Unfriended” is a horror movie that tries to leverage the trappings of the digital era into a competent, menacing revenge-fest—but only with mixed results.
The film tells the story of six teenagers who find their group Skype call infiltrated by the digital ghost of Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman), a classmate who committed suicide precisely one year prior to the events presented in the film, in bonafide, contrived-horror-film fashion. Laura’s suicide was precipitated by the posting and promulgation of a YouTube video showing her incontinent and unconscious at a party. Now she is trying to take revenge on the kids whom she perceives as her tormentors.
The plotline is fairly standard horror-film fare and does not merit much discussion. The main point of interest in “Unfriended” is its narrative conceit: The film shows us only the laptop screen of central protagonist Blaire Lily (Shelley Hennig). This is a surprisingly effective gimmick. The laptop screen is notably true-to-life, with open windows scattered about and email notifications popping up every now and then. The other characters are only seen via Skype and frequently disappear behind a webpage or a Spotify window. The film makes intelligent use of Skype lag, pixelating or freezing the characters’ faces at opportune moments. That, combined with the disorganization of Blaire’s desktop screen, contributes to the tense, claustrophobic aura. The presence of subtly different forms of communication—Facebook messages, Skype calls, and instant messages, among others—allows the film to flesh out nuances in the relationships among the otherwise slightly bland characters.
Of course, the framing device is far from perfect. There is, for example, an absurd scene in which a hysterical Blaire, upon witnessing the death of yet another friend, inexplicably decides to turn to Chatroulette for aid, blubbering incoherently into the faces of about seven or so different groups of nonplussed people. This exchange, intended to be somewhat climactic, comes off as little more than comical. Blaire finally finds a sympathetic listener in Nevada whom she convinces to call the cops, accomplishing, as per horror film usual, literally nothing. And, bowing to the horror film’s inexplicable precept that the general rules of the haunting must in some way be explained to the protagonist, Blaire stumbles upon a thread on some sort of forum for the occult in which an anonymous poster has oh-so-fortuitously happened to spell out precisely the conditions and motives behind Laura’s attack.
Many of the weaknesses of “Unfriended” can be traced back to its imperfect communion with the horror film form. While it presents itself quite ably, it is unwilling to expand upon the usual content of the genre; this intransigence imparts to it a certain damning clumsiness. Its cast, for example, is the standard mass of high-school stereotypes, from the chubby tech whiz to the drunken football player to the vain primadonna. The story of the bullied suicide victim seeking revenge is trite and overdone, and the lack of subtlety in the film’s anti-cyberbullying moral is underlined by the painstaking realism of the framing device.
In its details, the film takes great care to avoid condescending to the millennial audience it claims to depict—it does not try to fool anyone with ersatz products like FaceSpace or ePods, and Blaire’s cursor movements feel natural and unforced—but the display of the larger cyberbullying motif is articulated without nuance and shows an odd, dissonant ignorance of dominant web etiquette. The video that prompts Laura’s suicide displays, towards the end, in pink, curly letters, the message “LAURA BARNS KILL URSELF."  Horror movies are rarely strengthened by over moralizing, but if they insist on doing so, they should at least seek to portray the issue they claim to represent with some sophistication. This simple-mindedness is made especially frustrating in light of the care taken in other aspects of the movie. Gabriadze comes across as cowardly rather than incompetent, and the former sin is harder to forgive.
The premise of “Unfriended” is too simplistic and clichéd to make it an effective horror film, but its careful execution makes it impossible to regard as yet another vapid, throwaway screamer flick.  In an odd way, “Unfriended” would have been more enjoyable had it been worse—the awful horror movie is, after all, an institution in its own right. As it stands, “Unfriended” awkwardly straddles campy and effective and never rises to anything more than a narrative experiment that is novel but, ultimately, uninspiring.

This weekend, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department admitted serious wrongdoing in the FBI Laboratory’s hair comparison unit, one of the Bureau’s leading forensic units. Investigators have found that FBI forensics experts offered false testimony in hundreds of cases over two decades, or about 95 percent of all cases reviewed so far. These cases include 32 in which the defendant received a death sentence; in 14 of these, the condemned inmate has already been executed or died in prison. Thousands of other cases await formal review, which is likely to uncover similar problems.
The Washington Post called the admissions a “watershed in one of the country’s largest forensic scandals.” Already, defense attorneys for hundreds of defendants convicted in these cases have come forward to demand retrials, and several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have issued statements or published open letters to the FBI director. Senator Richard Blumenthal said he considers the revelations “appalling and chilling,” while Senators Patrick Leahy and Charles Grassley demanded a “root-cause analysis.”
The scope of wrongdoing—and the possible complicity of agency higher-ups in the evidence manipulation—is yet to be fully established. But this much is abundantly clear: Repeated abuses of power deserve sunlight and full accountability.
The best strategy to combat evidence manipulation at the FBI is to draw from the tactics of the Black Lives Matter movement, which in the past few months has so successfully called attention to police brutality against people of color. This means informing the public of the facts of wrongdoing, rousing a popular demand for change through bottom-up organization, and protesting until the demands for more accountability are met.
These revelations of false testimony are also another tragic argument against the death penalty, which should not be legal under any circumstances, even when forensic evidence seems to indicate guilt. Insofar as DNA tests and other forensic analysis are prone to human error and official manipulation, they are fallible, after all.
Furthermore, the news should remind us that the American criminal justice system, despite its promise that the accused is “innocent until proven guilty,” is all too often set against defendants. A culture of empowered prosecutors and elected judges often results in harsh and inconsistent sentencing. After the Revolutionary War, prosecutors were appointed officials, nominated by judges, governors, or legislatures depending on the state. Not until the mid-nineteenth century did election of prosecutors become the norm in most states. Today, 95 percent of all criminal cases end in plea bargains, and prosecutors exert inordinate power. Judges, too, face pressure at the ballot box to deliver harsh sentences, and studies confirm that elected judges are more likely to hand out harsh sentences in the months before they face the voters.
“Tough on crime" should mean the pursuit of real perpetrators and real justice, not trials where defendants are presumed guilty and law enforcement concocts evidence to gain a desired result. The FBI—as well as the criminal justice system at all levels—can do better, and the American people must demand that they do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In September of my freshman year, a friend and I scored tickets to see Wynton Marsalis in Sanders Theatre. I remember my excitement at entering the hip, artistic world of the Northeast, and the hour or so I spent getting dressed as I tried to craft an outfit that was both sharp and nonchalant. As we watched from the rafters, my friend and I slowly realized that we weren’t attending a jazz show, but a jazz talk. Marsalis spent an hour and a half lecturing us about the “sensual” beats of jazz, but he never touched his trumpet once.
While I appreciate the merits of talks like Marsalis’s, I’ve also sensed a strong bias towards such discussions at Harvard. Over the past few years, dozens of artists have cycled through Harvard’s campus, but only a small handful of them have actually performed. Most have appeared to receive medals and give academic talks, drawing broad lessons about the meaning and context of the art; very few come to create. There’s a constant, subtle pressure to zoom out from the specifics to see the “big picture.” And perhaps, in doing so, we are missing the point.
In the course of a year, I usually read between 30 and 40 books, many of them classics. But course curricula tend to deemphasize the specifics of each book in favor of the broader literary and historical trends that the books illuminate. Appreciating an author’s use of language or command of storytelling is often considered secondary to applying and developing theory that provide some broader “meaning” to the experience. Section discussions often take on certain monotony as the year progresses. Once students have isolated the “theme” of the course, a particular week’s readings become almost irrelevant.
While it is tempting to lay the blame entirely on Harvard’s shoulders, for me, the tendency toward crafting grand narratives began several months before I entered college. As a senior writing my applications, I found myself consciously omitting the parts of myself that didn’t make sense in order to shape my essay, resume, and recommendations into a coherent package. At college, the “packaging” impulse has only grown stronger as I’ve applied for classes, internships, grants, and jobs.  In some contexts, the ability to form a tight, cohesive narrative is appropriate. What worries me is how easily this mindset slips into other aspects of our lives.
Consider summer vacation. Every year, thousands of Harvard students take part in internships, study abroad programs, and research. Many of us have a great time. Many do not. And yet almost no one would admit to having a bad time over summer break in casual conversation. Instead, boring internships in hostile work environments are reframed as “learning experiences.” Similarly, there’s a certain rhythm to Harvard conversations where anecdotes need to have a point—preferably an uplifting or edifying one. (For example, “My boyfriend just broke up with me, and I’m kind of bummed about it, but now I’ll have a lot more time to devote to class work.”)
If these observations seem a bit disorganized, perhaps that is not such a bad thing. Thousands of things happen to us every day that have nothing to do with each other. Instead of seeing them and appreciating them as they are, we spend too much of our time trying to draw the line of best fit that will give things meaning, omitting or ignoring the points that don’t quite fit. I would like to become more comfortable with the chaos and noise happening on the margins—the experiences that simply don’t add up to anything more. I would like a little bit less lecture and a little bit more jazz.

The recent tentative nuclear accord between the United States and Iran is motivated by the United States’s commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Signed in 1970, the NPT is the only binding multilateral treaty that obliges nuclear weapons states to work towards the goal of disarmament. The United States has a duty under Article VI of the NPT to undertake “negotiations in good faith” towards nuclear disarmament, yet it has instead begun a program of nuclear “modernization,” under which it will upgrade its warheads and construct new missiles, submarines, and bombers, at an estimated cost of one trillion dollars over 30 years.
An international rally in New York City on April 26, ahead of the historic NPT Review Conference to begin the next day, is an opportunity for citizens to reaffirm that the NPT not only accords rights to the nuclear weapons states to demand non-proliferation, but also duties to make progress towards nuclear abolition. This is an issue which speaks to all citizens and which resonates with the concerns recently voiced during Harvard Heat Week, as nuclear weapons not only negate human freedom, but also threaten the survival of the species and the environment.
The existing nuclear arsenal poses catastrophic humanitarian risk. A nuclear strike on Moscow, for example, would result in 700,000 child deaths and destroy many hospitals, rendering meaningless any distinction between “combatant” and “civilian” targets—a distinction that is vital to international law. The United States is poised to violate this law. Its 14 Ohio-class submarines equal 4,000 Hiroshima blasts; eight of these submarines were built since the end of the Cold War, and our nuclear posture remains on high alert.
President Obama has already recognized the need to establish firm protections against nuclear weapons. In a 2009 speech, he asserted that "as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act." Obama's major achievement on this front has been the New START treaty, which caps the arsenal of nuclear warheads deployed by Russia and the United States at 1550 on each side by the year 2018. But the START treaty is modest: Despite strong rhetoric, the Obama administration has made fewer reductions to our nuclear arsenal than any other administration since the Cold War.
The trillion-dollar “modernization” risks igniting a new nuclear arms race, this time focused not on the number of warheads but on their overall capability. Such enhancements have already been made to arsenals in Europe and the United States. This money is better spent on increasing security of existing sites. The need for increased security has been powerfully demonstrated by Sister Megan Rice, an 84-year old nun, who was able to break into the Oak Ridge nuclear weapons plant in an act of protest for which she was sentenced to three years in jail. A similar risk exists with respect to nuclear cybersecurity, as the current electronic military infrastructure is vulnerable to hacking. Of the thousands of hacking incidents reported by the federal government each year, some have involved major defense breaches, including a 2009 attack in which hackers seized plans for the nuclear-equipped F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet.
Nuclear weapons threaten every form of life on our planet. Scientists have shown that even a small-scale deployment of nuclear weapons could cause unprecedented and lasting disruptions to our climate. Even the maintenance of existing nuclear arsenals generates toxic waste that contaminates our soil and poisons our groundwater. The urgent imperative to seek solutions to these environmental hazards—coupled with our moral responsibility to serve as custodians for future inhabitants of our planet—is an especially timely issue here at Harvard, where participants in Heat Week have called on the university administration to divest from fossil fuels. We share the concerns of those working to address global climate change, and stand in solidarity with efforts to safeguard a planet on which future generations will thrive.
It is not too late to reverse our course. A Harvard delegation, led by Harvard Peace Action, will be attending the April 26 rally in New York. We invite you to get in touch via our website, where you will find information about affordable transportation to the march, our next organizational meeting, and an international petition for the elimination of nuclear weapons, which has already been signed by over four million people. We urge you to join us in support of a peaceful and sustainable future. Now is the time to abolish nuclear weapons.
Abel Corver ’16, co-founder of Harvard Peace Action, lives in Pforzheimer House. Rebecca Kastleman, a PhD candidate in English, is co-founder of Harvard Peace Action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the early field of candidates for the 2016 presidential election takes shape, Harvard undergraduates say they are looking to engage with the upcoming race through political groups on campus and internships on campaigns.
Students involved in the Institute of Politics and political groups such as the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club said that they plan to connect their members to the election through internships and other programming.
Earlier this semester, the IOP launched the Campaigns and Advocacy Program, a weekly seminar running for eight weeks intended to teach Harvard undergraduates the skills necessary to work on a political campaign.
R. Blake Paterson ’17, the program’s chair, said that the program was created in anticipation of the upcoming elections. Paterson, who is currently comping the Crimson news board, said he hopes the program will serve as a basis for students’ independent involvement in the election.
“CAP has been working a lot with the internship side of the IOP and connecting students with campaign opportunities on both sides of the aisle,” he said.
Paterson added that one of the program’s advisors this semester, Mike Vlacich, will be running Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign in New Hampshire.
Harvard College Democrats president Jacob R. Carrel ’16 said that although the group will not officially endorse any candidate during the primary, members will be engaged throughout the election.
“We have a lot of contacts that can put people on campaigns, and that’s something we’re excited about and love to do,” said Carrel.
Victor J. Kamenker ’17, the Harvard Republican Club’s membership and publicity director, said that their group will also connect its members to candidates.
“I know that we’re planning on working with the IOP and with past fellows with whom we have connections to get our members who are interested working on campaigns next year,” Kamenker said.
One Harvard student planning to work directly on a campaign is Daniel R. Ki ’15, who said he hopes to work for a Democratic candidate after graduating in May.
“The timing of my graduation is really perfect. The campaign is just starting to heat up…Being able to build infrastructure right from the beginning is really exciting, and it would mean that if I wanted to, I could stay on the campaign for the next year and a half and really get a substantive experience from it,” he said.
For her part, Jenny Gao ’16, communications director of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee, said she thinks having students engaged in this presidential election is important.
"It’s incredibly important that as we move forward, young people continue to stay active in civics in general, so that they have a voice and so that the decisions that are being made on their behalf are actually the decisions they want to see made,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years after two bombings left the Boston Marathon’s finish line in chaos in 2013, more than a dozen Harvard students, faculty, and affiliates took to the 26.2 mile Marathon course on Monday, the recent conviction of bomber Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev on their minds.
With more than 30,000 entrants, the Boston Marathon is one of the three largest marathons in the country, according to the Boston Athletic Association’s website. This year, Ethiopian runner Lelisa Desisa won the Marathon, with a time of two hours, nine minutes, and 17 seconds. Desisa also won the race in 2013.
For many Harvard runners, like last year, the 2013 tragedy—which left three people dead and more than 260 injured—remained a motivating factor in their decisions to run this year’s race.
“I’ve always wanted to run a marathon,” said Miguel A. Perez-Luna ’15, who laced up Monday to run the Marathon in Boston. “But two years ago when I went to see one of my friends run the Boston Marathon, and that was the year of the bombing, for some reason I really thought that was motivating enough for me to want to run with the rest of Boston.”
“Like many runners, I thought that running the marathon is one way to honor the victims of the bombing,” Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who now has run the Boston Marathon five times, wrote in an email after he finished running the course on Monday. “And I was very moved when I saw some of the victims running or walking the marathon. Their determination and resilience are inspiring.”
Anna E. Dolan ’15 added the solidarity that onlookers demonstrated also inspired her as she ran on Monday. She passed spectators wearing shirts emblazoned with the phrase “Boston Strong” and the names of the bombings’ victims.
“Those definitely made me think, ‘You know what, I can definitely finish this,’” Dolan said Monday evening. “A tragedy had occurred; the least I could do was complete the Marathon.”
For others, running the Marathon was much more personal. Glynis K. Healey ’15 referred to the Marathon as her senior thesis because she did not write one for class.
“It's definitely been nice to have something to look forward to and work towards all year,” said Healey, who is an inactive Crimson sports editor.
But no matter their reason for running, Harvard runners said this year’s record-setting snowfall was a severe impediment to their training regimen. For Shubhankar Chhokra ’18, the snow meant adapting the day-to-day length and intensity of his runs, resulting in a training schedule that was less strict than he would have liked. For Healey, the snow made going on long runs especially challenging.
The dreary weather that came on Marathon day, however, did not phase Jasmine P. Opie ’16.
“I’ve never smiled that much during a run,” Opie said. “I actually love running in the rain. I’ve always loved walking between the raindrops, so to speak.”
In addition to thousands of supportive fans, the Marathon landscape was filled with security officers and law enforcement.

Harvard Business Publishing—a publishing platform under the University that prints Harvard Business Review among other material focused on management—will relocate its headquarters from its current location in Watertown to Boston Landing, a new complex in Brighton, to achieve more space for its expansion.
The transition will open up an additional 35,000 square feet of office space for HBP and will be expected to be completed within the next year, as reported in the Boston Globe last week.
A spokesperson from the Business School told the Globe that the University had considered other locations, namely developing new buildings in ongoing Harvard projects in Allston, but it instead chose Boston Landing because of the property’s earlier completion date.
Since the approval of Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan in 2013, construction has begun on the nine projects that will be completed over the next ten years, which will add 1.4 million square feet of new development and 500,000 square feet of renovations. Among the projects is the construction of a new executive education facility at the Business School.
HBP is currently headquartered out of the Arsenal Complex in Watertown, a property the University purchased in 2001. Harvard had originally planned to develop the complex, but it has since been sold to an electronic medical records company, according to the Globe.
“Harvard Business School Publishing is exactly the type of tenant we envisioned for 20 Guest Street, and we are thrilled to welcome them as one of our anchor tenants,” said Jim Halliday, managing director at the New Balance Development Group, the commercial real estate company managing the development of Boston Landing.
According to Boston Landing’s public plans, the mixed-use development will span 15 acres of land along the Massachusetts Turnpike and is expected to include 650,000 square feet of office space, an ice arena, retail space, a boutique hotel, and a sports complex. HBP is set to rent nearly 125,000 square feet of office space at the 20 Guest Street property, according to the Globe.
A press release from NB Development Group states that private real estate firms Transwestern/RBJ and Jones Lang LaSalle represented NB Development Group and HBP, respectively. JLL Managing Director John Osten and Senior Vice President Molly Heath negotiated on behalf of HBP.

The Mahindra Humanities Center has named prominent American novelist and Nobel laureate Toni Morrison the 2016 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry.
As the Norton Professor, Morrison will give a series of six free lectures called “Baring Witness, Bearing Views” to begin next year on March 2 in Sanders Theatre.
Endowed in 1925 by Charles C. Stillman, class of 1898, the Norton Professorship is awarded to “individuals of extraordinary talent who, in addition to their particular expertise, have the gift of wide dissemination and wise expression,” according to the Mahindra Humanities Center website.
The Norton selection process considers poetry  “interpreted in the broadest sense to encompass all poetic expression in language, music, or the fine arts,” according to the Harvard University Press website. Previous Norton Professors have included poet T.S. Eliot, class of 1910, composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein ’39, and jazz artist Herbie Hancock.
A winner of a Nobel Prize for Literature, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Morrison is one of the most decorated living authors. She is the author of more than ten novels, including Beloved, for which she won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1988 and the 1987 National American Book Award.
It will not be Morrison’s first appearance at Harvard. The octogenarian writer has given multiple previous talks on campus spanning a wide range of topics from advice on writing to good and evil in literature. Notably, Morrison delivered the Massey Lectures in 1992 which gave rise, in part, to her book of literary criticism, “Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination.”
Morrison was selected by the Norton committee, led by Professor Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Center for the Humanities.

The annual Cambridge Science Festival, which features events such as the Science Carnival, Robot Zoo, and an exhibit on Black Holes, began last Friday and will run through this Sunday.
Sponsored largely by science-based companies like Biogen Foundation and Novartis, the festival is a collaboration between Harvard University, the MIT Museum, the City of Cambridge, the Museum of Science, and the Cambridge Public Schools, and the Cambridge Public Library. This Wednesday, Harvard will host the festival’s Sustainability Fair in celebration of Earth Day.l. The event will highlight sustainable living and organic landscaping and will take place in the Science Center Plaza.
According to P.A. d’Arbeloff, the festival’s director, undergraduates from area universities, including Harvard, are heavily involved in the festival’s activities.
On Wednesday, the Harvard Ed Portal will host Science Meets Art, an interactive event in which Harvard undergraduates will host activities geared toward exploring the intersection between science and art. One part of “Celebrating Einstein,” a series of events commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, brings sixty undergraduates to thirty different middle and high schools in the area for physics-related workshops and activities, according to d’Arbeloff.
John R. Durant, Pforzheimer House co-master, said that he initiated the festival after moving to Massachusetts from the United Kingdom, where such events were more common.
“What I first noticed when I came here from England was that there were very few science festivals,” Durant said, “At that time, they were very well-known in Europe, and I was wondering where they were in the United States.”
D’Arbeloff said that the event has grown considerably since its founding in 2007, when around 15,000 people attended.
“Durant hired two part-time event planners. They had very few resources,” she said.
Durant said that he expects over 56,000 people to attend this year’s festival.
The festival has an interdisciplinary focus and attracts participants of all ages interested in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math. The festival includes workshops geared toward adults, like a beer-brewing science workshop, while others, such as the Robot Zoo, are targeted at younger children.

The Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee recently chose to cap funding for annual student performances at $1,000 this semester in an attempt to push student groups hosting the events to search for funding sources outside the UC.
At a UC general meeting in March, the UC passed a grants package that allotted $1o,500 out of the requested $34,900.32 to 10 student groups seeking to fund “large venue” events. Seventeen groups had applied for funding.caps
Students organizing the Eleganza fashion show requested $5,ooo in funding, but only received $1,000. Similarly, Ghungroo and the Identities Fashion Show, two annual events, only received $1,000 from the Council—a fraction of what organizers requested.
According to Finance Committee Chair Riya N. Patel ’17, large venue grants are supposed to help newer and “more collaborative” events find funding. Eleganza, Identities, and Ghungroo happen annually and have for several years.
“The Finance Committee spent a lot of time discussing the events, and while they reach a wide audience and are loved by the community, they've become a tradition here on campus and the UC large venue grant can't become a source for expected annual funding,” Patel said. “There are so many new events that people present every year, and large venue [funding] is really meant to support those initiatives.”
According to Patel, the large venue grants package passed last month was meant to be a “transition period” for the older events, as the Finance Committee did not “want to pull the plug completely without any warning.” In years following, the Council plans to push older events toward alternative, non-UC sources of funding, according to UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16.
The amount at which each large venue grant will be capped in the future will vary based  on the number of events that request funding, according to Patel. Student performances will be capped at $1,000 per show.

Dozens of undergraduates piled into the Winthrop House Junior Common Room on Monday for a nearly two hour-long discussion about exclusivity in social spaces at the College.
Although the event, hosted by the the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, was open to all undergraduates, organizers closed off the meeting to the press to “provide a space for productive dialogue.” The event’s Facebook page repeatedly requested that students not attend in their capacity as journalists, and several attendees said they were strongly discouraged from speaking to the press about the event.
The event attracted about 100 students in total and featured undergraduates who are members of unrecognized social clubs as well as students who are not, according to Irfan Mahmud ’16, a Harvard Foundation intern who is also an inactive Crimson news writer.
According to Cary A. Williams ’16, who is listed as a Harvard Foundation intern on the organization’s website, organizers purposefully did not invite administrators because they wanted to have a discussion only among undergraduates.
According to Sam R. Peinado ’15, who attended the meeting, the organizers allowed for free responses and questions. He added that they did not seem to “shepherd” the conversation.
“Some people got a window into a perspective they didn’t know about before,” Peinado said.
William A. Greenlaw ’17, an Undergraduate Council representative who attended, said the meeting was “really good” because it featured a diverse array of perspectives and participants were patient in responding to each other.
Several attendees declined to comment on specifics of the meeting, and organizers initially requested after the event that The Crimson not include information from students who attended the meeting and described specifics of the conversations.
Although The Crimson did not agree to that request, few students described, even in broad detail, the course of the conversations.
The discussion follows an increase in both the prominence of Greek life on campus and debate about the influence of unrecognized social groups on student life.
Although the College purposefully does not recognize all-male or female final clubs, sororities, and fraternities, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and other administrators do engage with the groups.
In recent months, Khurana has more vocally broached the topic of exclusivity in social spaces. Persistently criticizing perceived exclusivity in extracurricular organizations, Khurana sent an email to undergraduates in March condemning a controversial party invitation sent to some students by the Spee Club, one of the College’s all-male final clubs. Khurana has also met with leaders of male and female final clubs at regular meetings hosted by the Office of Student Life.

As a growing number of candidates jump into 2016’s presidential race, members of Harvard’s faculty say those who have declared face a number of party-specific challenges.
Many faculty members interviewed contrasted candidates in the crowded Republican field—who they say are concerned with distinguishing themselves from their competitors—with former U.S. Senator and First Lady Hillary Clinton, currently the only major Democratic candidate to have declared her intention to run. Faculty experts said Clinton is focused on protecting her reputation against media scrutiny.
Although the 2016 presidential election is more than a year away, several faculty members stressed that the early stages of a presidential election can serve as a critical time for candidates looking to secure their party’s respective nomination.
According to Richard Parker, a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, primary season starts far before the official voting primaries commence and consists of three informal primaries, a “funder or donor primary,” an “elite primary,” and a “media primary.”
“To successfully win the voting primary, one must win two of the three informal primaries,” Parker said.
While Clinton is largely viewed as the only major candidate so far in the Democratic race, the Republican field is “much more competitive,” said Theda R. Skocpol, a professor of Government and Sociology. Skocpol attributes the competitive race to the fragmented schools of ideology within the current Republican party.
“It’s hard to tell who’s going to emerge from the pack,” she said.
Likewise, Stephen D. Ansolabehere, a Government professor, said each Republican candidate has gained support from different constituencies within the party.
“Republicans view [Florida Senator Marco] Rubio and [former Florida Governor Jeb] Bush as embodying the vision for the future of the party, [Kentucky Senator] Rand Paul does really well among independents,” he said. “[Wisconsin Governor] Scott Walker is doing very well among young Republicans.”
A few faculty members said they believe that Jeb Bush could emerge from the crowded Republican field as the party’s nominee. Steve Jarding, a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School, noted Jeb Bush’s advantage because of the influence of the Bush family among potential Republican donors.
Despite the relative lack of competition for the Democratic bid, some members of the faculty cited challenges that Clinton could face during her presidential bid. Parker said that while Clinton’s prominence will aid her in what he labeled the "elite" and "donor" primaries, it could attract greater scrutiny from the media, as the press will be looking to “test” her political and personal past.
“She’s her own challenge,” Parker said of Clinton.
Other faculty members discussed Clinton’s departure in strategy from her previous presidential bid. Kennedy School lecturer Barbara L. Kellerman spoke of Clinton’s newly minted image as what Kellerman calls “Granny for President,” in which she portrays herself as a more “maternal, womanly figure.” Kellerman contrasted this with “the much more strident, competent, and competitive image that she presented the first time around.”
Jarding said he thinks the 2016 presidential election will be interesting to follow due to rising voter dissatisfaction as a result of rising income inequality.
“You could probably make the argument that there is more voter unrest today in America than there has been at any time since the Great Depression, with the possible exception of the Vietnam War,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Crimson took O’Donnell Field on Saturday aftenoon looking for its second win of the day against its archrival, the team turned to senior right-hander Matt Timoney to do what he does best—lead his team to victory.
After the Harvard offense exploded for 10 runs in the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader against Yale, it was Timoney who stole the show in the second half of the twin bill with a commanding performance. The senior dominated the Bulldogs in what was one of his best collegiate performances, coming just four outs shy of throwing a complete game. Timoney struck out seven while allowing just six hits and no earned runs in a winning effort.
“That was huge for us as a team,” junior reliever T.J. Laurisch said. “He kept wanting to pitch to another hitter and another hitter. It was huge from a team perspective to get that many out of him and get such a good performance out of him, especially in one of his last starts.”
The victory kept the Crimson alive in the Red Rolfe Division at the time. But with two losses on Sunday, Harvard was eliminated from Ivy League Championship contention.
The Crimson beat Yale, 7-0, as the offense posted six runs in the game’s first two frames. Timoney entered the weekend as the team’s most consistent starter, leading the rotation in wins and earned run average and solidified his role as staff ace by picking up his sixth win of the season and lowering his ERA to 3.63 overall and 3.09 in Ivy League play.The Glenside, Pa. native has been at his best in Ivy League play.
Harvard is 3-1 in his conference starts, having allowed just eight earned runs in his four Ivy League outings in his last season donning Crimson. After walking 14 batters in his first six starts of the season, Timoney has consistently been able to locate all of his pitches as of late. The righty has walked just three batters while striking out 15 in his last two starts.
“He’s a good pitcher to play behind,” senior infielder Jake McGuiggan said. “He’s very efficient and he likes to work fast. He’s pitched well all season so we know that if we can get him a few runs, the chances are, we’re going to pick up a win.”
Timoney has been steadily improving ever since he graduated from boarding school at Mercersburg Academy in rural Pennsylvania. He has shaved more than half a run off of his ERA each season he has been in Cambridge, including a 1.13 drop in his ERA from his junior to senior year. The evolution of Timoney’s slider, which baffled Bulldog hitters Saturday afternoon, has led to an increase in strikeouts this season.
“I’ve put more focus on throwing my slider for strikes early in the count,” Timoney said. “With that, it’s just a simple changing my focal point a little higher so that it’s more consistently in the zone rather than curving away from the hitters. Once I’m able to get ahead of hitters, they’re more likely to chase my other pitches.”
On Saturday, Timoney threw 77 of his 114 pitches for strikes and did not allow a single extra-base hit. The righty has taken advantage of his first season as a fulltime starter and has played a big role in what will be the most successful Ivy League season of the senior’s career if the team is able to split its four-game series with Dartmouth this weekend to close out the season.
Timoney has served not only as the team’s go-to pitching option this year but also as a leader of the rotation. He and fellow fourth-year Tanner Anderson are the lone seniors on a predominantly young Crimson pitching staff. The two have accounted for only 28 percent of the total innings pitched this season.
“Matt Timoney is the only true pitcher in the senior class,” McGuiggan said. “He’s had a great career for us. He’s definitely progressed over the years as one of our better starting pitchers and I think that he really capped off his career in a good manner this season with a really good senior year.”
The Computer Science concentrator hopes to build off of one of his best performances as a member of the Crimson and take this year’s eight seniors out in style against Dartmouth.
“I just want to go out there and compete the same way,” Timoney said. “It would be special if I were to pitch well in my last game.”

A guy in my section is a cross-registered student at MIT. Last week, the two of us were discussing the upcoming course schedule, and he noticed that class would not be cancelled the day of the Boston Marathon. This puzzled him. Did Harvard not have the day off?  We answered in the negative. Horrified surprise ensued.
Needless to say, my MIT friend was not in class Monday morning. I was, however, and at all the rest of my classes that day as well. Because Harvard, unlike other universities and public schools in town, has declined to let its students have the day off.
Did the brave men of Harvard drive off the British so that we students could spend Patriots’ Day sitting inside studying? I think not. Not your best move, Harvard.
Now, I’ll be the first to admit my case for cancelling class doesn’t stand up to much cross-examination. Would I do any work if class were cancelled? No. Would I take advantage of the time to watch the whole Boston Marathon? Of course not; the race starts before nine. Have I ever been to the Boston Marathon? No again. Would I actually go to the marathon? Honestly, no. Would I spend the whole day drinking and hanging out with friends? It’s within the realm of possibility, I’ll admit.
But none of that matters. Harvard needs to give us the day off anyway. Because as long as they don’t, people like my buddy at MIT will keep coming in on the Tuesday after Patriots’ Day to tell future generations of Harvard students how much fun the marathon was, and what a terrible shame it was we missed it, and how he guesses there is always next year.
Let us go see the marathon, Harvard.
Or, you know, you can just give us a different day off. That’d be just as good.

Happy Tuesday, Harvard! Only seven more days of classes; hang in there! That’s one week of spending all of section in the back row on Facebook, skipping lecture because you’re sure you will watch it online before the final, and finishing a pset right as you’re supposed to be turning it in. It is definitely that point in the semester, but we can make this one final push to the end.
