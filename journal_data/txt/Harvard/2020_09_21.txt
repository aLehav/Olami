As a casual way to pass the time during one’s infinite quarantine afternoons, “All the Bright Places” on Netflix seems, at face value, to be the perfect choice. A teenage romantic drama clothed in the genre-obligatory aesthetic packaging of muted colors and sunlight, "All the Bright Places" is populated with archetypical sensitive characters struggling with mental illness. Its motif of "wandering" (complete with the requisite drifting long shots of picturesque bike rides through nature) is envy inducing for today’s quarantine-caged audiences. Yet even with the low expectations set by a classic angst-filled romance narrative, “All the Bright Places” squanders potentially meaningful depth by failing to convincingly develop characters’ inner turmoil.
At a time when mental health is prominent in the cultural conversation, “All the Bright Places,” based on the novel of the same name by Jennifer Niven, depicts familiar topics of suicide, grief, and trauma. The story centers around high schoolers Violet Markey (Elle Fanning) and Theodore Finch (Justice Smith), who become partners for a class project at Finch’s encouragement. Their relationship develops slowly as, over the course of various "wanders" where the class must visit interesting places in their home state of Indiana, Finch coaxes Violet out of her shell of grief. She's been hiding there since her sister’s death in a car accident. As the weight of Violet’s sorrow begins to lift, however, Finch’s own struggles with mental illness rise to the surface, and the tables turn as Violet seeks to understand and alleviate his pain.
The two’s love story, which gains traction towards the middle of the movie, is unabashedly cheesy, featuring Finch quoting poetry, writing Violet a song on guitar, and actually throwing pebbles at her window — not to mention the obligatory sun-drenched montage of their honeymoon phase. Fanning and Smith bring poignant performances to their battered characters, but the film spends too much time on brooding stares or dramatic nighttime adventures and fails to devote enough attention towards developing the audience’s understanding of the characters. The stakes of this film are high — on paper. Yet the movie’s treatment of mental health fails to hook the audience, to allow viewers to become properly invested in their tragedies.
It’s not just the principal characters and their relationship that succumb to insufficient development. Violet’s friend Amanda (played by Virginia Gardner) appears several times but their friendship is never fleshed out, leaving viewers indifferent to Amanda’s role in the story. Family members receive similar treatment — take Finch’s sister, for example. We can tell that their bond is meaningful, but the movie does not take the time to develop their relationship beyond a cute handshake. Accordingly, their emotional rapport falls flat.
Haley does not execute his narrative progressions well at any turn, from the first kiss to the unexpectedly grim climax. Though we witness Finch’s sudden black moods, the journey to them is clumsy and heavy handed. Perhaps Haley wanted to show that we can’t get inside someone’s head, and that we don’t always know why people do the things they do. But even then, one never gets sucked into the story — audiences are always on the outside looking in, seeing scraps of Violet and Finch’s lives in a stilted sequence as disjointed as the colorful Post-It notes Finch populates his wall with.

In 1965, Frank Herbert’s novel “Dune” irrevocably changed the science fiction landscape, becoming a cornerstone of the genre. Over 50 years later, following a previous attempt by David Lynch, critically acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve seeks to do the project justice on the big screen. The book depicts a future world in a galaxy far, far away, where warring royal clans compete for control over the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune — a hellish desert planet that happens to be the only place in the universe where the spice melange necessary for interstellar travel grows. “Dune” is an expansive story, littered with unfamiliar vocabulary like “landsraad” and “Sietch Tabr,” which can complicate the narrative on the page, much less on the screen. Yet Villeneuve, a lauded auteur, seems to respect the expansiveness and complexity of “Dune.” Alongside a star studded cast and production team, “Dune” offers the promise of an artistic touch from a true filmmaker.
Satisfying book fans in a film adaptation is never easy, and “Dune” has never quite hit the mark. David Lynch’s 1984 version was a critical failure, called “an incomprehensible mess” by critic Roger Ebert and hated by Lynch himself. Despite becoming something of a cult classic over time after its terrible first reception, a true “Dune” film adaptation has yet to be seen. In fact, arguably more important than Lynch’s version has been the colossal success of “Star Wars,” which was inspired by “Dune” and has been called “the great “Dune” film” by the Guardian. However, “Star Wars” is a far simplified and more family friendly story, leaving plenty of room for a grittier, successful “Dune” that is true to the original work.
Villeneuve seems necessarily respectful of the book’s history, yet also undaunted by its legacy. His solution to the problems of doing justice to the scope of “Dune” has been to break the film into two parts. “I would not agree to make this adaptation of the book with one single movie,” Villeneuve says. And this seems to be a reasonable solution: Lynch infamously voiced distaste for his own rendition of “Dune” after the studio trimmed his three hour film into a two hour blockbuster, from which Lynch promptly removed his name from the credits. However, there are certainly obstacles to a two part film. Villeneuve’s most recent science fiction film, "Blade Runner 2049," was critically praised, but a box office flop, calling into question the financial feasibility of a two part “Dune.” Moreover, the sequel has yet to be greenlighted by the studio, and the implications of the global pandemic leaves “Dune”'s success shrouded in uncertainty.
Yet there is hardly a director more up to the job than Denis Villeneuve, who has proved his finesse with sci-fi movies recently with the highly successful films "Arrival" (2016) and "Blade Runner 2049" (2017). Both movies were critically well received, regarded as among the best films in their respective years. And despite “Dune” being a major blockbuster film, Warner Bros seems to be allowing Villeneuve a certain measure of artistic freedom and trust. Stellan Skarsgard, who is set to play Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, said in an interview with Collider that “It’s not going to be directed by the studio. It seemed like they were giving him pretty free hands. And you have to, because his personal stamp on the film is paramount for the success of it.”
Along with the stellar director, the upcoming film features a star-studded cast and crew. Eric Roth ("Forrest Gump," "The Insider") and Jon Spaihts (“Passengers," "Doctor Strange") working with Villeneuve on the screenplay, and Hans Zimmer ("Inception," "Interstellar," "Blade Runner 2049") scored the film. The cast includes such high profile names as Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgard, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, and Timothee Chalamet as the protagonist prince, Paul Atreides. One thing that can be seen in this casting is Villeneuve’s feminism. Many of his movies feature female leads, and part of "Arrival"’s” success has been attributed to Amy Adams’ strong lead female character; the movie’s opening weekend audience consisted of almost 50 percent female viewers, despite science fiction's predominantly male audience. Though Herbert’s female characters are already powerful, Villeneuve takes their strength a step further, expanding the role of Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica, and casting Sharon Duncan-Brewster, a Black woman, as the formerly white male role of Dr. Liet Kynes, a character who helps keep the peace between warring factions on Arrakis. “Women are very good at that, so why can’t Kynes be a woman?” said Duncan-Brewster as she explained Villeneuve's decision.
As stories often take on different overtones in a new time period, so too does this half-a-century old narrative. In returning to “the images that came out when I read it [Dune],” Villeneuve saw that the story had prophetic overtones about environmental issues: “It was a distant portrait of the reality of the oil and the capitalism and the exploitation — the overexploitation — of Earth.” And though the novel was originally inspired by Herbert’s environmental research on the shifting sand dunes of Oregon, his themes come into far sharper focus in 2020 as the climate crisis looms larger. The film is not set to be released until Dec. 18, 2020, and the studio has not yet postponed its release date, hopeful that audiences can return to theaters by the end of the year.
Correction: September 23, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the name of "Dune"'s author. In fact, he is Frank Herbert, not Paul Herbert.

If the last 15 minutes of “The Irishman” (2019) left you hankering for another geriatric gangster flick, writer-director Josh Trank’s vision of a demented and guilt-ridden Al Capone may be just the ticket. For the rest of us, though, “Capone” is a competent but ultimately derivative character study that is easy to sit through and just as easy to forget.
Tom Hardy plays Al Capone, the titular gangster, who has been released from prison to live under government surveillance in his Florida mansion. Suffering from advanced neurosyphilis and facing financial ruin, Capone is under pressure from those in his inner circle – including his brother Ralphie (Al Sapienza) and doctor (Kyle MacLachlan) – to reveal the location of a 10 million dollar stash he buried years ago. The catch is he can’t remember the hiding place.
“Capone” is desperate for you to take it seriously, and that’s the problem. Many of Trank’s artistic decisions – from the overlong opening credits sequence to the grandiose, Puccini-heavy soundtrack – are prestige picture clichés bound to elicit a few eyerolls.
This is also true of the film’s handling of Capone’s mental illness. In the film, Capone’s paranoid delusions commingle with reality, with figures from the past appearing in the present and vice versa. Given the simplicity of the plot, this element provides much of the film’s intrigue. But there’s little here that hasn’t already been done more effectively – particularly in Ron Howard’s “A Beautiful Mind” (2001), which seems to be a major influence. Capone’s cryptic (and frequently gruesome) visions often borrow from famous horror films: A mysterious boy (Christopher Bianculli) holding a golden balloon evokes Georgie Denbrough from “It” (2017), and Capone’s memory of a glitzy Prohibition-era party recalls Jack Torrance’s vision in the ballroom of the Overlook Hotel from “The Shining” (1980). “Capone” also takes cues from Scorsese’s “Shutter Island” (2010), another movie that centers on a paranoid mental patient who is preyed upon by malicious doctors and false friends.
These elements are derivative, but they are not wholly unsuccessful. There is fun to be had piecing together the details of Capone’s past from the fractured memories we see on-screen. And though some of Trank’s directorial flourishes feel canned, “Capone” is a visual pleasure. Thanks to cinematographer Peter Deming, the deep blues and reds of Capone’s opulent estate (recreated by production designer Stephen Altman) pop beautifully in contrast with the murky grays that fill the nightmare sequences.
More importantly, the performances are first-rate: As Capone, Hardy is almost unrecognizable, his voice raised to a raspy falsetto. He somehow manages to exude both great menace and utter helplessness, a remarkable feat. The role of Capone’s long-suffering wife Mae (Linda Cardellini) is mostly thankless, but Cardellini does a wonderful job conveying her character’s muted grief. Matt Dillon also stands out in the role of Johnny, an old mob associate whose affability conceals a dark past.
There is humor, too, which works despite the film’s self-seriousness. After a stroke, Capone’s doctor insists that he stop smoking and suggests that his cigars be replaced with carrots. Ralphie objects (“What is he, fuckin’ bugs bunny? He’s gonna go on a rampage!”). But Capone doesn’t notice the switch, and he spends the rest of the film with an orange wedge dangling from his mouth.
All told, “Capone” is not nearly as bold or innovative as Trank seems to think it is, but that’s okay. The film’s strengths make for a compelling enough divertissement – certainly worth 100 minutes of your time and a few bucks on Amazon Prime Video.

In 2013, Steve McQueen's period-piece behemoth and eventual Academy Award Best Picture winner “12 Years A Slave” made its US premiere at the New York Film Festival (NYFF). Seven years later, McQueen has returned to the NYFF, this time for the world premiere of “Lovers Rock.” It couldn’t have come at a more unique time in the film festival circuit. McQueen’s film was an official selection at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, but COVID-19 ultimately delayed its premiere. The NYFF has also been forced into unprecedented changes, with a hybrid setup of drive-in theaters and virtual screeners.
“Lovers Rock” is one entry in a series of films titled “Small Axe,” a five-part anthology that brings underrepresented stories of the West Indian experience in Britain to screens big and small. Unlike his previous NYFF entry, McQueen’s latest film isn’t one interested in painting an epic, unflinching picture of history. Instead, McQueen tells the story of a young couple — Franklyn (Micheal Ward) and Martha (Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn) — drawn together over the course of a Blues Party in the 1980s. The film’s events unfold in one night, featuring minimal dialogue, shot almost exclusively in one location, and led by a small cast of characters in just 68 minutes. But in that ephemeral evening, McQueen crafts a self-contained film that sparks a radiant, nostalgic experience.
In a press conference moderated by the Director of Programming at the Film Society of Lincoln Center (and a Visiting Lecturer in Harvard’s AFVS department) Dennis Lim, McQueen commented on the sparse use of dialogue in “Lovers Rock.” “It was more [about] moods. More about the senses,” he said.
That commitment to capturing "moods" is clearly on display with the film’s gorgeous cinematography. Director of Photographer Shabier Kirchner uses a saturated, almost amber color palette that lends an effusive glow to the film. He also plays with the role of the camera as a participant: at times, the camera is passive, like a distant and static observer. In those moments, it’s easy to feel like you’re a fly on the wall — lucky to happen into the company of a burgeoning party scene. In others, Kirchner uses a handheld camera and films close-ups of the characters, cranking down the frame rate to stimulate inebriation. The result is an intimacy so vivid it’s almost tactile.
McQueen also sprinkles the film with subtle clues that hint at a larger social commentary. Characters frequently code switch — adapting their way of speaking to their surroundings, personal and professional. In a press conference, McQueen described that relationship as “very colonial.”
An unnamed character is also seen carrying a large white cross in the dead of night, which he picks up again in his next appearance at the end of the film (in the morning). It’s a striking visual and a deft reminder that, even after this night of revelry, the realities of colonialism and White racial hegemony persist. These deeper questions are often brushed aside, more integral to McQueen's thematic worldbuilding in "Small Axe" than strictly to the plot of "Lovers Rock."
“Lovers Rock” can also get carried away with itself. While McQueen was able to craft a poignant film in just over an hour, there were also scenes that could have been shortened without detracting from the overall experience. For instance, McQueen shows the entirety of a largely unedited, improvised a cappella session that seems slightly off-kilter from the film’s main narrative.
Despite these brief moments of overindulgence, McQueen’s film is a triumph in visual and sensorial storytelling. While only 68 minutes, “Lovers Rock” manages to linger much longer than its runtime suggests — vivifying a snapshot in history with contagious enthusiasm behind the camera for the cultural significance, and personal memories, of stories longing to be told.

It’s difficult to describe what kind of film “Malmkrog” really is. It unfolds over the course of a day in an aristocratic Transylvanian manor at the turn of the 20th century, as a host and four guests engage in deep philosophical debate. “Malmkrog” is divided into six chapters, each segmented by a shift in the topic of conversation. The film is, first and foremost, a philosophical debate, with negligible attention to character or plot. In it, director Cristi Puiu (who won the Un Certain Regard in the 2005 Cannes Film Festival for “The Death of Mr. Lazarescu”) challenges the classification of narrative films, and also the attention span of his audience.
The characters discuss topics with a relentless intensity, from war to religion, race, and morality. Suffice to say, one can certainly find profundity in “Malmkrog” — but Puiu’s film requires an insatiable amount of unbroken attention. Because there are few conventional elements, like narrative, characters seem stuck in a perpetual loop of discussion. That was probably the direction Puiu pursued, but it’s one that ultimately undermines any message that he wished to convey: Topics of debate that are at first engrossing quickly turn robotic and repetitive. Like most humans who inhabit this planet, this reviewer found that plowing through the film for 200 unrewarding minutes was a physically tiring task.
“Malmkrog” is thematically rich — I’d go so far as to say that some of the film’s self-aggrandizing gravitas is granted. But Puiu’s film is so glacially paced that whatever audience he manages to hook is quickly pummeled by an overwhelming urge to nap, packing the equivalent punch of a shot of NyQuil per minute.
One could make the argument that it is exactly the self-absorbed, unending nature of the film that Puiu draws our attention to — that the world’s fate rests on the laurels of a ruling aristocratic class so helplessly in love with the intelligence of their own thoughts. In that vein, it’s particularly self-aware that “Malmkrog” displays the last moments of a dying European aristocracy with the retrospective knowledge that the coming century would throw the continent into two World Wars and Transylvania into Communist rule. But if that was the point that Puiu wanted to convey, he doesn’t make a consistent case for it.
The crowning jewel of “Malmkrog” is its cinematography; Director of Photography Tudor Vladimir Panduru creates stunning compositions. He often frames characters within frames, within frames, using compositional tension to stoke striking questions: Are these characters so rooted in their social hierarchy that they’re incapable of seeing outside their bubble? Panduru also shoots with deep focus — sometimes, the audience is posited as an outsider, peeking through a doorway into the lives of people in this insular, wealthy society. The opening scene perfectly encapsulates how Panduru creates unease; as two characters have a conversation, the camera pans a few degrees to reveal a scene unfolding through a door, and back again repeatedly. It leaves the impression that this conversation, although it is as broad as the meaning of good and evil, of God and the devil, must be kept clandestine. And when Panduru has the full ensemble of characters on screen, he barely cuts: His camera glides as it reframes characters moving around, creating fluidity and naturalism. But that continuity is the very same feat that condemns the viewers of “Malmkrog” into a state of purgatory.
Puiu seems adamant on creating a film that isn’t coddled by something as disgustingly mainstream as characters or a narrative. In fact, the characters in "Malmkrog" are reduced to vessels of speech, held together by the lightest fabric of characterizations. Perhaps Puiu thought the philosophy deserved so much attention that the audience can’t afford to be distracted. "Malmkrog" says a lot, but rarely does the film feel like it’s engrossing enough to tell us something unique and worthwhile — or at least enough so to warrant undivided attention for over 200 minutes.
This begs the question — who is “Malmkrog” really for? It will definitely make a select minutia of film critics happy, but Puiu pushes the limits of what cinema can curtail — and what most audiences can endure — to get there.

Harvard needs to create a Class Studies secondary field.
We already have an incredible list of courses offerings that take on the important issue of socioeconomic status. Think Sociology 1121: “Understanding Meritocracy,” African and African-American Studies 189Y: “Sources of Interracial Economic Inequality in the United States,” General Education 1159: “American Capitalism,” and Studies of Women, Gender & Sexuality 1469: “Luxury and Commodity Pleasures: Histories of Gender, Sex, and Racial Capitalism.” We have faculty committed to addressing issues of socioeconomic status, economic inequality, and capitalism. We have students interested in enrolling in the courses.
What we don’t have, however, is an infrastructure for students to identify socioeconomic status as a lens of inquiry that is intriguing and important to them in its own right. Often, a pathway into a designated curriculum is as important as the curriculum itself. The creation of a secondary would provide the pathway that the course offerings themselves cannot.
Class Studies could work much like the other standalone secondaries that Harvard has already created. Similar to how the new Translation Studies secondary is part of the Comparative Literature department, a Class Studies secondary could become part of a department such as Sociology or Anthropology.
What would the secondary actually look like? One of the requirements could be a foundational course in theory on socioeconomic status and capitalism (for example, reading Marx). Beyond that, the secondary could be based in courses already offered in various departments at Harvard. Following the model of Translation Studies and Educational Studies, the secondary could require three or four “electives” from a set of courses that faculty determine take on socioeconomic status as a central theme. There could be more specific requirements for those electives, such as a course that ties socioeconomic status in with issues of race or gender, or a course with a primarily historical methodology. The secondary could end with a “capstone” project, such as original research or a project in the local community.
Is Class Studies an established field of inquiry? Although I was unable to find any related program of study at any of Harvard’s peer schools, in academia more broadly, some scholars have created “Working-Class Studies,” a field meant to address the same issues of the lived experiences of socioeconomic status in a capitalist society. This interrogation of “how class shapes and is shaped by race, gender, ethnicity, and place,” as the book “New Working-Class Studies” describes the field’s mission, can extend beyond the working class. As Harvard students and future citizens of the world, we have a duty to understand how socioeconomic status, inequality, and capitalism have impacted the lives of so many.
The novelty of Class Studies would be invigorating to students, not limiting. Some of the most exciting intellectual experiences that Harvard has provided me are in some way new. For example, I’m taking a course that looks at the United States’ nuclear stockpile as an expression of imperialism through the lens of critical Indigenous Studies. Getting to look at a complex issue in the world from a new lens — getting to feel like a part of the creation of a body of knowledge rather than just absorbing it — is not only exciting, but could be formative for undergraduates who have little opportunity to combine various fields of studies in new ways.
Beyond the intellectual excitement that would originate from the creation of this secondary, it would also be personally meaningful to many students. Harvard’s student body might become more socioeconomically diverse, but it is still not at all representative of the country. According to a 2017 New York Times study, 67 percent of Harvard students come from families whose incomes are in the top 20 percent of the country. This leaves many lower-income students to wrestle with all the nuances that come with attending a wealthy school largely built for wealthy people. Outside of student-led groups designed for lower-income students, such as the First-Year Retreat and Experience and Primus, there are very few opportunities for Harvard students to grapple with the impact that socioeconomic status and capitalism have had on their own lives in an academic context. Giving students a foundation in the vocabulary, theory, and history of economic inequality could help them make better sense of their own experiences.
Harvard has the ability to determine what intellectual fields are elevated. Harvard has the ability to identify a line of inquiry that is important and timely — one that their own students would benefit from — and to put the resources behind it to demonstrate to the broader academic world why it matters.
Understanding socioeconomic status, economic inequality, and capitalism are integral to understanding the very fabric of our society. Harvard should acknowledge this through the creation of a Class Studies secondary field. The secondary would give students whose lived experiences have been especially affected by socioeconomic status an intellectual framework to understand those experiences. It would allow undergraduates to become part of something new in the intellectual world. And it would make a statement to higher education about the importance of this lens of inquiry. Isn’t that what Harvard is all about?

Harvard College’s three-year experiment in sanctioning unrecognized single-gender social organizations came to a sudden, quiet end in June. Though the announcement came in wake of a landmark Supreme Court decision, which debatably threatened the legal standing of the sanctions, the timing also feels rather convenient. With no undergraduates on campus — to protest or celebrate — it might have been an opportune moment for the University to drop a failing project.
Truthfully, we’re not all that sad to see sanctions go. The practical effect of their implementation was quashing social spaces for women (female-only final clubs are nearly gone, and all but one sorority has disappeared from campus) while more established, all-male social groups retreated into their gilded cocoons. And while Harvard exempted cross-school single-gender cultural groups from the sanctions, the University does not allow them to use campus resources — sending a rather ambiguous message about its support or lack thereof for cultural bonding along gendered lines.
In the post-sanctions era, Harvard has to think hard about how it can remedy some of this unintended damage. In particular, the University needs to make sure that the new social club landscape isn’t a total wash for the exclusively male and exceptionally wealthy groups that fared best during the brief sanctions moment. And it may already be trending in that direction, as the all-male Delphic Club and all-female Bee Club, which merged in 2017 just as sanctions were beginning, announced that they will be parting ways.
The College initially offered two rationales for targeting single-gender final clubs and Greek life: first, that they rewarded social exclusivity and economic privilege, and second, that these organizations are hotbeds for sexual assault. Both concerns are as valid now as they were then, but the College has displayed either an inability or unwillingness to offer answers about whether the end of the sanctions also marks the end of the University’s efforts to address these underlying issues. What grand strategy, if not sanctions, will address them?
There are also a plethora of other issues with the social club system at large: namely, how it entrenches socioeconomic and generational disparities, and cultivates a performative, competitive social dynamic. With sanctions, Harvard took a blanket — and largely ineffective — approach to solving these problems. In the post-sanctions world, the University should focus instead on applying targeted solutions that strengthen Title IX procedures, promote social alternative spaces to the clubs, and work to further foster diversity and inclusivity.
In recognition of our COVID-tinged world, Harvard should be working to create extensive, safe, on-campus social spaces so that students living in residence aren’t driven to socialize off-campus: a wilderness where the University has no control over social distancing and other health precautions. Other colleges are already leading the charge on this front: Harvard should take notes and copy winning schemes on campus.
But the pandemic will wane and eventually end, and with its passing the College will be crowded once more. Students returning to friends they have missed and those arriving for the first time will be craving college’s trademark rambunctious. Parties. Drinking. Loud Music. And we support them (so long as they’re blasting anything but Mr. Brightside). Still, all of that occurring within a healthier social environment should be possible. But the inescapable reality of the current social system at Harvard is that, as long as the University owns almost all the land in the area, final clubs and Greeks organizations with off-campus spaces will have a monopoly on two precious commodities: the ability to host parties that Harvard could or would not allow if it saw them and the social prestige attendant with that ability.
The solution, then, is likely twofold. First, Harvard needs to take an issue-specific approach to leveling social inequities and creating a safe and inclusive social environment. The University should lean heavily on the Title IX office to combat sexual misconduct; it should continue to develop a student body that is diverse and a culture that is inclusive; it should help students develop safe substance use practices; and it should open up channels of support and communication for students worried about or struggling with any of these issues.
Second, it needs to make ample space on campus for open and diverse socialization and community engagement — thoughtfully relaxing some of the restrictive policies that push students toward off-campus social clubs.
There’s no reason students need to rush back to final clubs when COVID-19 ends. But as it stands, we wouldn’t be shocked if they did. The University has work to do. A better, safer, more inclusive Saturday night is possible, but getting there won’t be easy.

The Undergraduate Council Election Commission announced the results of this year’s general election on Friday, after a virtual campaign period unlike any in the body’s history.
The Council virtually welcomed the incoming 45 members to its ranks with introductions and an overview of procedural rules Sunday afternoon.
Oak Yard Representative Anant P. Rajan ’24 described how the election process differed from high school student body elections, in part because of social distancing requirements. He said he was “very active” in the GroupMe chat for the Class of 2024, promoting his candidacy using somewhat unconventional means.
“One thing a lot of upperclassmen and a lot of people told me about was the importance of name recognition,” Rajan said.
“I was known for making dad jokes and bad puns,” Rajan said. “I also just started learning guitar before I came to campus, so I brought it with me and made a couple of jingles and posted them in the GroupMe.”
Rajan said one of his strategies was forming a coalition with other freshmen running for office. Four out of the five members of the coalition went on to win seats on the Council, including Ivy Yard Representatives Tarina K. Ahuja ’24 and Arjun A. Akwei ’24, as well as Oak Yard Representative Craig W. McFarland Jr. ’24.
Eighty-six students declared candidacies for this year’s election cycle, marking an uptick of interest in serving on the Council for the first time in two years. Of the competitors, freshmen made up the largest share of candidates at 50, with 12 ultimately joining the Council as representatives of their respective Yards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a normal semester, Jaxson T. Hill ’23 studies stars in his astrophysics classes. This year, he gets to see them firsthand from the Utah home he and his friends rented for the semester.
Hill and his blockmates are some of the many Harvard students whose off-campus living arrangements afford them a lifestyle far different from the Houses along the Charles. Shut out of the dorms due to the coronavirus pandemic, students have set up camp with friends and significant others from Hawaii to Utah, North Carolina to New York, and Rhode Island to remote corners of Massachusetts.
In their new headquarters, those students can dress up their standard school routine with culinary exploration, forays into pet ownership, and other adventures — whether to the Grand Canyon or their local Stop & Shop.
Hill and four classmates are taking a break from the bustle of Harvard Square by retreating to Brian Head — a tiny town in Utah with a population of 83, as of the last census. The five friends are taking Zoom classes from a ski lodge-style Airbnb located 40 minutes away from the nearest Walmart, where they stock up on provisions every few weeks.
Hill said the group is situated just a few hours from “tons and tons” of national parks, which they hope to visit on the weekends.
At nearly 10,000 feet, Brian Head boasts one of the highest average elevations of any city in the U.S. Hill said he and his friends often drive up an extra 1,000 feet from their house to Brian Head Peak, where they can stargaze with a telescope he brought.
“Since we're so isolated, the dark sky is just absolutely breathtaking,” Hill said.
Far from snowy Utah, Ana M. Mundaca ’22 is spending the semester in Hawaii with her partner, who is also a Harvard undergraduate. She said she has mostly kept herself busy with online classes, cooking, cleaning, and caring for her new cat, which the two adopted in the state.
Mundaca and her partner were eating at an outdoor restaurant recently when a stray cat approached them. She said they decided to take him home and have been fostering him since, nursing the animal back to full health.
“His name is Mr. Muffin. It used to be Muffin because he was a girl at first, and then we went to the vet and they were like, it's actually a man,” she added.
Mr. Muffin recently made a bid for Lowell House representative in the Undergraduate Council Election, Mundaca said, though the cat did not ultimately win a seat.
Other students haven’t ventured quite so far from Harvard’s campus.
Maxwell A. Gillmer ’21 — who is living with three friends — signed a lease for a lakehouse near Plunkett Reservoir in the Berkshires, a rural region in the mountains of Western Massachusetts.
“Being by a lake in a tiny town where the only excursion that we have is to go to the grocery store, sometimes I actually really forget that we are living in a pandemic,” he said. “We're already so isolated here that staying at home and social distancing don’t seem like an order right now.”
Gillmer said he and his housemates get most of their groceries from a farm owned by the local family for whom one of his housemates currently works as a nanny.
“Part of [the housemate’s] pay is, once every other week, they get a farm share,” Gillmer said. “They'll get a bucket of produce with things like squash and carrots, a lot of tomatoes, cabbage, onions.”
Gillmer said he and his housemates purchase the rest of their ingredients from a Stop & Shop 15-minutes away, keeping track of their receipts and costs using an app called Splitwise. They have cooked a variety of dishes together, including many kinds of pasta, shakshuka, and French onion soup. They plan on making pizza this week.
Otto Barenberg ’22 said he and four classmates converged in Providence, R.I., a convenient middle point for the students, who are all from different states on the Eastern seaboard.
Though Barenberg said he and his housemates spend most of the day in their bedrooms taking online classes, they try to eat dinner together every night. Each person is responsible for cooking dinner for everyone else one day a week, and people usually volunteer to cook the other two nights of the week on an ad hoc basis.
“It's been a little more work to manage extra responsibilities, but I think we've been managing okay,” Barenberg said.
“It's also a great experience to have because otherwise, I wouldn't have lived on my own like this until after college,” he added. “I feel like I'm gaining some basic skills like how to set up a utilities accountant, how to pay rent, and how to sign a lease that are actually very applicable and useful beyond college.”
Kevin T. J. Chew ’23 is living with five Harvard friends at an Airbnb in New Bern, N.C., a locale roughly equidistant from their hometowns.
Since Chew is the only one in his group enrolled in classes this semester, his schedule is rigid compared to his friends’. Nonetheless, he finds time to play basketball with them at a neighboring court.
The group also shares home cooked meals, which one of his buddies has spearheaded.
“He is an absolutely magnificent chef. He is a connoisseur of food,” Chew noted, citing a variety of curries and steak his friend has cooked up.
“He made a really good squash and zucchini marinara sauce. He fileted a salmon,” Chew said. “I’m eating better here than at home!”

The co-ed Delphic-Bee Club will split into the all-male Delphic Club and the all-female Bee Club three years after merging, according to club affiliates.
The graduate and undergraduate leaderships of both clubs announced the decision in an August 25 email to undergraduate members and alumni, according to two club affiliates to whom The Crimson granted anonymity to discuss confidential internal emails.
The divorce comes one month after Harvard dropped its controversial sanctions policy targeting members of single-gender social groups.
The email stated that the leaderships of the Delphic and the Bee mutually decided not to extend the agreement they reached in 2017 to share membership and a clubhouse at 9 Linden St., which historically housed the Delphic Club. Though they shared a clubhouse, the Delphic and Bee conducted punch — the process whereby final clubs select new members — separately during their short-lived merger.
Bee undergraduate president Kristina E. Jacobsson ’21 declined to comment on behalf of the Club for this article. The trustees of the Delphic — Guilliaem “Rusty” Aertsen IV ’70, Lief D. Rosenblatt ’74, and Sanjay H. Patel ’83 — did not respond to requests for comment. It remains unclear where the Bee will hold events in future semesters.
The two clubs’ 2017 merger coincided with the debut of the College’s sanctions policy, which came into effect with the Class of 2021. The sanctions prevented members of single-gender social organizations from receiving College endorsement for fellowships or holding sports captaincies and leadership positions in extracurricular groups. The policy provoked vehement opposition, including twin lawsuits in state and federal court.
The sanctions proved short-lived, though, and the Delphic-Bee’s split came one month after Harvard rolled back its policy. Announcing the reversal, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that Harvard believed it would lose its lawsuit in federal court and would therefore be legally barred from enforcing the sanctions.
The Delphic and Bee’s leaderships did not address the sanctions policy directly in their email, though.
They instead characterized the clubs’ three-year-long union as positive. But ultimately, their missives went on to say, both clubs believed they would better serve their members as separate organizations.

Commonwealth Wine School — which offers wine classes ranging from tastings to multi-year certification programs — opened for in-person classes this month at the Garage in Harvard Square.
Owner and director Jessica L. Sculley first signed a lease for the business in late February but had to postpone the school’s physical opening until September due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sculley said the school began offering a full slate of hybrid in-person and online classes last week.
Harvard Square Business Association executive director Denise A. Jillson said she was glad to see the school open in Harvard Square even in the middle of a pandemic.
“Very excited for her, and I know she’s going to be successful,” Jillson said of Sculley.“Seeing the advent of a new business, Commonwealth, is particularly hopeful for us.”
Sculley, a Cambridge resident and former math and science teacher, said she has always been interested in wine education.
Commonwealth Wine School initially opened a pop-up store on Brattle Street last fall, according to Jillson. Due to the pandemic, the school began offering online classes in May and has since expanded its offerings to include in-person instruction.
Jillson, who said the school is “something we haven’t had in the Square before,” promoted its opening on the association’s Facebook page.
Sculley described the precautions the business was taking, including separating its “consortium” of wine educators with plexiglass shields, maintaining seven feet of distance between tables, and employing a robust air purification system.
“I’m still pretty dedicated to wanting to create a community, but I am not interested in contributing to a public health crisis,” Sculley said.
Opening in the middle of the pandemic has been a “precarious” endeavor, according to Sculley, though the business has already attracted clientele from across the country. Many students reside in Cambridge and Boston, but others come from all over New England to take classes, she said. Online learners have joined classes from as far as Chicago and Cincinnati.
Despite the precautions, Sculley noted, many patrons would still rather stay home and take classes online. She called her hybrid reopening plan “a swivel system” that would allow students to take the same classes either online or in person.
Sculley said that business is “picking up” and she believes there is enough interest to sustain Commonwealth Wine School into the future as its operations continue through the pandemic.
“We’ve made our expectations really clear. And I think people feel safe with those expectations,” Sculley said. “I’m committed to Harvard Square being a vibrant place, not a place with empty storefronts.”

As faculty and students across the University adjust to this fall’s online academic model, some are turning to a web app developed by a team of Harvard affiliates to promote inclusive classroom learning.
Dubbed Teachly, the app collects data on how often students participate in class as well as how often professors call on any given student, helping professors identify participation gaps and encourage wider class participation.
The Teachly team — composed of Harvard Kennedy School professors Dan Levy and Theodore “Teddy” Svoronos; Kennedy School alumni Kartikeya “Karti” Subramanian and Louise Baldwin; College alumna Amelia R. Knudson ’13; and faculty assistant Victoria Barnum — began developing the app in 2015. They say that pedagogy research shows that class participation translates into better learning outcomes, and that the app’s goal is to improve the entire class’s learning.
Svoronos — who was Levy’s teaching fellow at the time Teachly was developed —said the two first came up with the idea for the app because they wanted such a tool for their own course.
“We sort of feel in our teaching that the backgrounds and experiences of students in the classroom are some of the greatest assets that we have,” Svoronos said. “And it felt like we weren’t making as much use of that as we could.”
In addition to tracking class participation, Teachly allows professors to get to know their students through learning profiles, which provide information about students’ backgrounds and interests. Levy and Svoronos collected the initial data for the profiles through a survey of students, according to Subramanian, who was Levy and Svoronos’s student at the time.
“Teachly came about because they were trying to use data to see how they can make better decisions in the classroom to further teaching practice and learning objectives,” Subramanian said. “I had a background in technology, so we basically whipped up a very quick web application that pulled in various data that they were already capturing from students in the class.”
The app also allows professors to check “conscious or unconscious biases” by collecting data on whether a professor tends to call on a certain demographic more than others.
“Our co-founder Dan Levy often tells the story about how he was certain he didn’t have any implicit biases on his call patterns, and that he was calling on male and female-identified people equally until he was able to get data on this and found out that he was actually calling on men 14% more than women,” Knudson said.
Knudson added that through using the Teachly tool, Levy is now “easily able to achieve parity across most of his demographic groups."
A number of other professors have begun using Teachly in their classes at the Harvard Kennedy School, including Ambassador Samantha Power and professors Cass R. Sunstein, Sheila P. Burke, and Randolph Wentworth.
Barnum said in an interview that Power uses the app to prepare for class in the same way she once prepared for diplomatic meetings.
“She kind of took the approach of using Teachly as a way to have a binder about her students with the profiles and the different information, to kind of enter the classroom as she would one of her former meetings in her other careers, and have a strategy for how she wanted to kind of take on the classroom for the day,” Barnum said.
The Teachly team said an open version of the app is available for K-12 schools and other universities, and a Harvard-specific version is accessible through HarvardKey.
“Any faculty member at Harvard can be using Teachly, and anyone in the world can use this open version of Teachly. No matter what kind of class they teach, and what contexts they teach it whatsoever,” Svoronos said. “And we just sort of want to see how useful people find it and to see if we can actually help kind of make a dent in some of the things that we care about.”

A group of Harvard Medical School researchers has developed statistical models that determine a mouse’s biological age and how long it has left to live.
The research team, led by Medical School professor David Sinclair, tracked the health of 60 mice until they died naturally. They observed many variables, including spinal curvature and hearing loss, to measure the mice’s deteriorating health throughout their lives.
The researchers ultimately programmed two computerized clocks using their collected data. The first, “FRIGHT,” or “Frailty Inferred Geriatric Health Timeline,” determines the biological age of the mouse based on its frailty, while the second, “AFRAID,” or “Analysis of Frailty and Death,” predicts how much longer a mouse has to live.
Alice E. Kane, a first author on the study and a postdoctoral fellow in genetics, said the researchers were able to predict the mice’s lifespans with a small margin of error.
“Considering that these items are kind of a general assessment of the mouse, and noninvasive and incredibly quick, we were able to predict the age with an error of less than one and a half months and the lifespan with an error of less than two months,” Kane said.
Kane said the clocks could allow researchers to gauge whether a medical intervention is effective much faster than is typically possible.
“The main immediate implication is that these clocks will enable us to do preclinical studies much faster and much more efficiently to find interventions that will affect health and lifespan,” Kane said. “Instead of having to do studies that take three or even four years — which is how long a mouse normally lives — and take hundreds of mice, hundreds of thousands of dollars, we'll be able to much sooner than that know whether interventions are going to affect aging.”
The researchers have made both FRIGHT and AFRAID freely available online for other research groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Young people are far from enthusiastic about voting for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — but they may just hold enough disdain for President Donald J. Trump to do so in big numbers anyway.
A Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll released Monday shows Biden — the Democratic presidential nominee — with a 33-point lead over Trump among 18- to 29-year-olds who say they are likely to vote. Biden’s advantage marks a 10-point jump from the lead he held over Trump among likely young voters in April, when the IOP released the spring edition of the poll.
While less than a third of young Biden voters said they are very enthusiastic about casting a ballot for the 77-year-old former vice president, young people still responded as more likely to turn out to vote than at this time in 2016. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they will “definitely be voting,” compared to just 47 percent in the same poll four years ago.
“A lot of people have been comparing 2020 to 2016, but what we’re seeing is, it actually compares better to 2008,” Justin Y. Tseng ’22, president of the Harvard Public Opinion Project — the student-led IOP program that produces the poll — said of the potential turnout.
The 2008 election, in which former President Barack Obama defeated the late United States Senator John McCain, marked the highest turnout among 18- to 29-year-olds since the census began tracking voter turnout in 1986. The demographic has consistently had the lowest voter turnout of any age group.
Young Trump voters are more enthusiastic about voting for their candidate than young Biden supporters, according to the poll. But the 60 percent to 27 percent lead that Biden holds over Trump among likely young voters is larger than the one held by Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, at this point four years ago.
Notably, 19 percent of likely young voters in 2016 responded that they would likely go for a third-party candidate; this year, that number is just 6 percent.
The survey’s questions and administration were overseen by longtime IOP pollster John Della Volpe, who is now working for the Biden campaign. HPOP analyzed the poll’s results after Della Volpe took leave from his main role at the IOP.
Biden failed to win over young voters in the Democratic primaries, when the demographic largely backed United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) instead. But the poll indicates that, despite his lukewarm enthusiasm numbers among young people, they could nonetheless be an important demographic for him in November.
A plurality of 23 percent of young people listed the economy as their top issue — a striking increase from the spring poll, when just 6 percent of respondents said it was the most important issue for them. However, in stark contrast to the strong marks that Trump receives from the electorate writ large on handling the economy, just 34 percent of young people responded that they trust the current president to manage the economy.
Despite the ongoing pandemic, which has now killed more than 200,000 Americans, the poll also showed that only a quarter of 18- to 29-year-olds said they will “definitely” get a COVID-19 vaccine. Twenty-five percent of young Republicans say they will “definitely not” get a vaccine, while just 9 percent of young Democrats said they won’t get a dose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana said in a Friday interview that taking proportional disciplinary action and protecting student privacy were among the principles that informed the College’s process for adjudicating pandemic protocol violations.
Khurana said the disciplinary process is aimed at promoting student well-being and stressed that the College was committed to “proportionality” in its response to students who break the community compact.
He confirmed that the Harvard University Police Department — in addition to other emergency services — is prepared to step in and address social distancing violations in the case that events escalate beyond the capacities of house staff such as on-call proctors or tutors.
“We're all trying to make sure that they're used appropriately and in proportionality for whatever the situation requires,” Khurana said. “And that's been a lot of the training, which is to make sure that we have a proportional response to the situation.”
Khurana added that he supports creating norms in which issues are resolved “at the local level” before involving emergency services.
Khurana also explained the thinking behind convening a new Community Council — composed of an equal number of student volunteers, faculty, and staff members — to enforce the community compact which students were required to sign before returning to campus.
Khurana said administrators decided to create a new body, rather than delegate enforcement to the existing Honor Council or Administrative Board, because they felt it was imperative to address violations with the “right set of tools.”
“Since the goal of what was behind the community compact has to do with the health and well-being of our community — specifically around the transmission of COVID-19 — we felt it was really important to keep that separate from academic continuity and academic issues as well as from the questions around student conduct,” Khurana said.
Khurana added that it was important to set up a group specifically attuned to maintaining the privacy of students’ health information amid the pandemic.
The Community Council employs a system of tiered responses to violations according to their severities. Council decisions will have one of four outcomes: a determination of no violation, a warning, “community responses” like education, and removal from housing.
Khurana declined to comment on what would constitute a minor or severe violation of the community compact. He did say, however, that the Community Council is committed to evaluating each transgression in context and avoiding an algorithmic, one-size-fits-all approach.
“One reason you bring a diverse group of people together with different backgrounds and understandings is that you want them to apply their judgment and their different lived experiences and perspectives, and to collectively come together to inform that judgment,” Khurana said. “The goal of the community compact is not to punish people, but it's to protect the health and the well being of our community.”
Though Harvard administrators praised undergraduates earlier this month for largely adhering to social distancing norms, students said large gatherings on the Charles River and in campus courtyards contradicted this success story. Nonetheless, undergraduates in residence are enjoying increased flexibility from when they first arrived on campus, with permission to gather in groups of ten while maintaining distance and wearing masks.
“I think we're doing okay,” Khurana said of student adherence. “I've been really impressed by how hard our students are working to adapt to this environment and following the guidelines.”
Still, he stressed that the situation could at any moment spin “out of control very quickly” and called for students to continue exercising diligence in social distancing.
“I also understand the natural inclinations of wanting to get to know people and group in larger numbers,” he said. “We all need to keep doing better, because it takes a while to develop a new set of norms.”
Unable or unwilling to return to campus this fall, a number of undergraduates have chosen to take up residence in the Cambridge or Greater Boston area this semester. Many said they hoped living close to Harvard would help them maintain the continuity of their College experience, facilitate socially distanced meet-ups with friends, and allow them access to certain campus resources.
During the Friday interview, Khurana said administrators are aware that a “not insubstantial” number of students have chosen to find independent housing near campus. Though only students living in residence had to sign the community compact, Khurana emphasized that the College still expects students living elsewhere to be “ambassadors of Harvard.”
“We've also tried to make very clear to our students wherever they are that the handbook continues to be in force, and that our expectations are that the students will abide and adhere to those handbook guidelines,” he said.
“They're living in communities in which there are people with different health conditions. We all have to operate in a way that is really mindful that the impact that we're having is not just simply for ourselves, but for people we might never know,” he continued. “Our positive impact can have that effect and really keep people safe. And similarly, a disregard for public health guidelines has serious health consequences and, in some cases, life-and-death consequences for others.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a Harvard Law School student in 1956, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was allegedly asked by the then-Law School dean to justify taking the place of a man in the Class of 1959. She would spend the next 64 years breaking gender barriers and making history in the U.S. Supreme Court.
The first female tenured professor at Columbia Law School and the second woman appointed to the Court, Ginsburg served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court for more than 27 years. During that time, she authored many notable opinions, speaking out against gender bias in the case United States v. Virginia and defending disability rights in Olmstead v. L.C..
After a lifetime of advancing equal rights, Ginsburg died on Friday at her home in Washington, D.C., at the age of 87.
“Justice Ginsburg personified the best of what it meant to be a judge,” Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in a press release. “Her powerful and unyielding commitment to the rule of law and to equal justice under law place her among the great Justices in the annals of the Court.”
‘Her Story’
Born on March 15, 1933, Ginsburg grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her mother, Celia Amster Bader, was the daughter of Polish immigrants while her father, Nathan, emigrated from Russia as a teenager.
Ginsburg graduated from Cornell University in 1954 with a degree in government and married Martin “Marty” Ginsburg that same year. The two briefly lived in Oklahoma before moving to Massachusetts in 1955 so her husband could attend the Law School. Ginsburg herself enrolled at HLS the following year.
As one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 law students, Ginsburg excelled as an editor of the Harvard Law Review while simultaneously caring for her daughter Jane and her husband, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer.
She spoke of her time at the Law School before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993, recalling the “indignities” imposed upon women at the time. In one instance, she claimed to have been shut out of a room housing old periodicals in Lamont Library due to her gender.
“It was closed to women,” she said in her testimony. “There was nothing I could do to open the door guarded by a university employee who said, ‘You can't enter that room.’”
Following her husband’s graduation, the family moved to New York, prompting Ginsburg to transfer to Columbia, where she graduated at the top of her law school class in 1959. She would later join the Columbia Law School faculty in 1972.
As a Columbia faculty member, Ginsburg co-founded the Women’s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which sought to strategically challenge laws that discriminated on the basis of sex.
“Modeling her efforts on those by Thurgood Marshall and civil rights giants a generation earlier, she brought carefully chosen cases to the Supreme Court that, incrementally, established that sex discrimination has no place in the law,” Ginsburg’s former clerk Julia E. Kobick ’05 wrote in an email to The Crimson.
During this time, Ginsburg argued six successful cases before the Supreme Court and oversaw more than 300 gender discimination cases while still teaching full-time.
“She stood before a nine-member male Supreme Court and convinced them for the first time to strike down a law on sex discrimination grounds,” David C. Codell ’90, a former clerk and close friend of Ginsburg, said. “The importance of that can never be overstated.”
“She changed the world before she ever got on the Supreme Court, decades before,” he added.
Former president Jimmy Carter named Ginsburg to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit in 1980, and 13 years later, President Bill Clinton appointed her to the Supreme Court.
“Her story already is a part of our history,” Clinton said at Ginsburg’s swearing-in to the Court. “Now her words and her judgments will help to shape our Nation today and well into the 21st century."
‘An Inspiring Role Model’
Dozens of Harvard law students served as clerks for Ginsburg during her tenure in the Supreme Court. These former clerks recall her dedication as a public servant and as a mentor.
“RBG was tenacious, unflappable, and deeply wise,” Law School Professor Daphna Renan — who clerked for Ginsburg in 2006 — wrote in an email. “She was grace and grit combined, and she never lost sight of the impact law can have on people’s lives.
University of California, Berkeley School of Law Professor Amanda L. Tyler — who clerked for Ginsburg in 1999 — noted in an email that Ginsburg refused to stay home even after battling cancer throughout the weeks leading up to the formal start of the Court’s Term that year. Tyler explained the Justice surprised her with a phone call the first day of the Term to say she would be present.
“As things turned out, I was fortunate enough to be first to arrive in chambers on the morning of October 4, 1999 — the first day of oral arguments that Term — and this meant I was the one who answered the phone when the Justice called chambers from her car that morning,” Tyler wrote.
Tyler wrote that this episode demonstrated Ginsburg’s courage and commitment to her fights against both cancer and discrimination. She described Ginsburg as “an inspiring role model at each and every turn” who set high expectations and offered her law clerks wisdom and comfort.
“She was a profoundly dedicated public servant in no small measure because she appreciated just how important her role was to ensuring that our Constitution belongs to everyone,” Tyler wrote.
Kobick echoed Tyler’s view of Ginsburg as a mentor and personal inspiration, saying the Justice was never afraid to speak her opinion and always held firm to her morals.
“She taught me so much—about how [to] make your voice heard and about how to work tirelessly for what is right and just,” Kobick wrote. “She had confidence that, in time, her vision of equality and fairness would prevail.
Kobick also noted that Ginsburg was unique in her tenacity and grace — as well as in her vocabulary.
“RBG loved the word ‘pathmarking,’” she wrote. “I had not heard of the word before working with her, but go through her opinions, and you’ll find them peppered with references to pathmarking civil rights legislation or pathmarking cases.”
Elizabeth M. Prelogar, a lecturer at the Law School, picked up on that habit after clerking for Ginsburg three years before Kobick.
“Her pathmarking advocacy advancing civil rights will live on,” Prelogar wrote in an email.
“There is no person more deserving of admiration, and there is no person I admire more,” she added.
‘Her Enduring Legacy’
Ginsburg’s lifelong mission was to ensure equal rights for all people through the work of those she taught and mentored, Codell said. The Justice’s strategic approach to civil rights litigation inspired his own career.
“She taught me how to do that, and I became an LGBTQ rights lawyer,” he said. “It was my great honor not only to serve as her law clerk, but even decades later, to submit briefs before her at the Supreme Court, arguing for the rights of same-sex couples to marry.”
John M. Rappaport, who also clerked for Ginsburg, wrote in an email that the Justice always refused to allow the quality of her work to deviate from excellence, recalling how she would read standing at her desk to avoid sleeping. He said Ginsburg believed this effort was necessary to produce the lasting change she strived for as a justice.
“While Justice Ginsburg enjoyed her late-found celebrity as the ‘Notorious RBG,’ her life reflected an understanding that lasting social progress comes not from flash and fame but rather grit, persuasion, and endless hard work,” he wrote. “To honor her legacy is to continue that work.”
HLS professor emeritus Laurence H. Tribe ’62 described Ginsburg as “a titanic force” who will continue to affect American law and life and advance the causes of equality and inclusion even in death.
“Her departure from the scene on the eve of the Jewish New Year should be an occasion for renewed celebration of her enduring legacy as a woman whose tiny physical stature belied her massive contribution to the best angels of our nature,” he wrote in an email. “May she rest in peace and power.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bicycle safety activists held a memorial service for Darryl Willis, the victim of a fatal August cycling accident in Harvard Square, Saturday.
Willis was killed on Aug. 18 when a tractor-trailer collided with his bike near the former Out of Town News kiosk on Massachusetts Ave. His death intensified calls for Cambridge to institute safety measures for cyclists in the heavily trafficked Harvard Square area.
Another pedestrian, 67-year-old librarian Sharon Hamer, died in Sept. 2019 after being struck and killed by a truck while crossing outside of the crosswalk.
After Willis’s death, the city ultimately instituted a number of safety measures, such as constructing separated bike lanes.
Activists constructed a “Ghost Bike” memorial near the spot where Willis was killed. Ghost bikes are roadside memorials placed where cyclists have been killed or seriously injured.
Pastor Laura E. Everett presided over the memorial service.
In a video posted to Twitter, Everett thanked the attendees at the ceremony.
“By being here, you honor Darryl. By being present together, we proclaim that Darryl’s death will not go unnoticed,” Everett said.
Peter Cheung, the Ghost Bikes Boston founder who organized the ceremony, said the service was “very beautiful” and praised Everett’s remarks.
“She presides on all of our ceremonies, and she has a beautiful ceremony prepared every time,” Cheung said.
Cheung also lauded Cambridge’s recent efforts on bicycle safety.
“That was a really great improvement,” Cheung said. “Unfortunately, it did take a fatality for that to happen.”

Though you might not be able to become a Lamonster from all those late nights “studying” this semester in that building we all miss so much, we definitely don’t want you to become a Zoomster (see what we did there? Zoom + monster!). Check out these tips and tricks for navigating your way around the traps of the Zoomster (beware!). Good luck!
A simple rhyme: When not on Zoom, leave your room. 
Actually. Stand up. Stretch. Take a few deep breaths in and out. Maybe walk to the kitchen to grab that snack you’ve been craving all day, or even be adventurous and go for a social-distanced walk outside. Reset. You’ll need it.
Put screen time limits on your phone.
This is a life and time SAVER. Have you ever been mindlessly scrolling through social media only to realize it’s been two hours and you missed section? Set a time limit on social media and other time-consuming apps to make sure you spend at least a few hours technology-free.
Phone a friend. 
For real (aka don't just call your friend and spend the time scrolling through GroupMes and Instagram while having a half-hearted conversation). Sometimes we all just need to focus our attention on anything other than Zoom and technical difficulties (arghh — how are these STILL happening?!)
Color. 
Buy a coloring book, or just use those colorful pens you have lying around your house, and color anything and everything. Not only is it fun, but it’s also very relaxing. And guess what? No touch-screen device required!
Whether the academic year has started off smoothly or you’ve been frantically experiencing wifi glitches, computer screens are probably your new (maybe not “best”) friends. We spend all day with them, we talk to them, and we even eat with them on a day-to-day basis (except in those classes that impose “no eating” rules, even though we’re hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away). But honestly, sometimes giving your new best friend, Zoom University, some space — aka taking some time away from the blue light that’s giving you that pounding headache — is healthy.
