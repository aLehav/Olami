After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Luke Z. Tang ’18, a Lowell House sophomore, has died “suddenly and unexpectedly,” Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck told House residents in an email Saturday.
Local authorities are investigating the cause of the death, Eck wrote, and there is “no reason to believe that foul play was involved.”
“This is a terrible tragedy for Luke's family and friends and for the extended College community. Our thoughts and prayers are with his entire family, and all of those who have been touched by his passing,” she wrote.
Lowell tutors will be on staff throughout the House on Saturday. Eck told residents that she and Lowell co-master Dorothy A. Austin, House Dean Caitlin M. Casey, Harvard Chaplain Lucy A. Forster-Smith, and some House tutors will gather after dinner in the masters’ residence, which will be open to anyone who “would like to talk and be together.”
Tang was a member of the Asian American Christian Fellowship at Harvard, and was a 2014 U.S. Presidential Scholar. He attended the Benjamin Franklin High School in New Orleans and was named the school’s 2014 Student of the Year. 
In an email to College students, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote that administrators “will continue to share any further information we can with the community as it becomes available to us.”
Middlesex County District Attorney spokesperson Elizabeth Vlock wrote in an email that “the death is not believed to be suspicious” and that her office “will not release any additional information on this incident.”
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano referred questions about the investigation to the Middlesex County D.A. and the Medical Examiner. A spokesperson for the Medical Examiner did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 15, 2015, at 4:51 a.m.
Speaking to graduating seniors of the Benjamin Franklin High School in New Orleans, Luke Z. Tang ’18 had a message for his classmates.
“There are no bad people in this world, only complex ones,” Tang said. “Everyone has a story whether you know it or not ... everyone has the capacity for good and evil.”
Tang, who was a sophomore in Lowell House, died on Saturday suddenly and unexpectedly.
The message of empathy and faith that he delivered to his high school classmates that spring day is one he lived throughout his time at Harvard. A month into his freshman year, Memorial Church named Tang a Church School teacher, describing him as “an avid teacher” who planned to study physics and was “passionate about math and poetry.” In high school, Tang taught at a summer Bible school for the Chinese Baptist Church of New Orleans, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune.
He was a member of the Asian American Christian Fellowship at Harvard, according to an email sent to residents of Lowell House. He also served on the board of the Harvard Interfaith Forum and as education chair on the Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association's executive board.
"I still remember interviewing him, and being absolutely astounded by the visions he had for the future of our organization," Mathematics Association president Jimmy Jiang '17 wrote in an email.
Several of Tang’s friends at Harvard, still mourning the loss, were not available to comment for this obituary. But Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck said she met Tang at the House’s sophomore outing last Sunday, where she took pictures of Tang surrounded by his friends.
Eck recalled Tang standing in the front of the boat, the location of the outing, as he looked out at the Charles River banks, sunshine splayed across his face.
Prior to enrolling at Harvard, Tang was named his New Orleans school district’s student of the year, a semifinalist in the Intel Science Talent Search, and a U.S. Presidential Scholar. He also taught violin to inner-city New Orleans children and served as a concertmaster of the Greater New Orleans Youth Orchestra, according to the Times-Picayune.
Tang’s parents, Wendell Tang and Christina Tang, came to the United States in 1990, according to the Times-Picayune. He also has an older brother, Richard.
In an interview, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said words could not adequately describe the magnitude of the tragedy.
“My heart goes out to the family and the friends who are grieving and I hope that everyone in our community knows that they don't have to travel on this journey of grief alone,” Khurana said.
Administrators in Lowell hosted students at a gathering on Saturday evening in the wake of Tang’s death. Originally planned to take place in the Lowell masters’ residence, House staff had to move it to the larger junior common room to accommodate the stream of people who attended. Many people still had to stand, Eck said.
“This was a profound testament to how important he had been in the short time he was at Harvard,” Eck said. “There is such a strong group of students who are sophomores who know him, knew him, loved him, and will continue to remember him.”

Following through on their plans to protest the all-male cast of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, more than a dozen women flooded Farkas Hall on Saturday and auditioned to act with the campus drag troupe.
The group, however, will “be maintaining an all-male cast” for its 168th production this year, according to an email protesters received from Theatricals executive officers Saturday evening.
Over Labor Day weekend, a group of undergraduate women filled Pudding audition slots en masse in public protest of the makeup of the troupe’s cast, which has been composed of all men since its first performance in 1844.
Women are involved in the Theatricals—famous for its burlesque shows and tradition of “roasting” celebrities—through its business staff, tech crew, band, and creative writing and music teams. But to a group undergraduate women who organized this weekend’s stunt, that is not enough.
“It’s just really outdated and unfair that this cast for the last almost 200 years hasn’t had women,” Tess V. Davison ’16 said on Saturday, after her own audition. “We just decided, let’s shake it up a little bit and get a huge group of women to audition, and here we are.”
Davison, who is active in theater on campus, organized the protest alongside Olivia R. Miller ’16.
Although their auditions for the Pudding were in fact a protest of the organization itself, several women who participated said they did not sense animosity from Theatricals members. Many of the protesters are friends with members of the group.
“There was a really great energy, both outside of the room and inside of the room, and it was just a very supportive environment, both from the girls auditioning and the boys auditioning there and all of our friends from the Hasty Pudding in the room,” Miller said.
Several members of the group declined to comment Saturday afternoon, and reporters, gathered outside the audition venue, were barred from Farkas Hall.
Theatricals president Robert T. Fitzpatrick ’16 could not be reached for comment early Saturday evening. Last week, however, he released a statement saying that the Pudding is considering adding women to its cast and that the group appreciated “those outside of our company” engaging with the topic.
In the email protesters received Saturday evening, Theatricals officers wrote that the stunt was "very productive for the conversation that we’ve been having and will continue to have, and we really appreciate your taking the time to do so."
The women who auditioned Saturday took to the stage with varying levels of acting and singing experience, but were united in their goal of calling for reform.
In an impromptu display for reporters following her audition, Elizabeth P. Terry-Kantor ’18 sang “Joey Is a Punk Rocker,” an excerpt of which she performed for a panel of judges, including several Theatricals officers.
Nicole C. Hirschhorn ’16, a member of the campus improv comedy troupe the Immediate Gratification Players, simply sang “Happy Birthday” and said she is not a “born performer.” Still, she said, it was “powerful” to hear other female voices audition from the hallway.
“I just can’t help thinking that there’s so much talent here and I hope that all the voices get heard,” Hirschhorn said.
The women’s protest has stirred discussion on campus about gendered organizations, and it has also attracted extensive attention on social media and from outside media outlets.
Several women interviewed said they see their biggest obstacle not as the Theatricals’ current undergraduate members, but rather the influence of its graduate board. The Theatricals is part of the umbrella organization the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770—which also includes the Hasty Pudding social club and the all-male Krokodiloes, an a capella group—and boasts many famous alumni who are still involved with the group.
Terry-Kantor, one of the women who auditioned, observed that there is a “level of separation” between the protesters and the graduate board. Undergraduates will have to communicate their message to alumni, she said.
Two days ago, the Theatricals posted a statement about the protest to its website, writing that the tradition of having an all-male cast is an “artistic decision.”
“Presenting men in women's roles is the Hasty Pudding's artistic trademark, the artistic merit of which comes from its challenge to traditional perceptions and expectations of masculinity,” the statement reads. “That brand of satire is what makes the Pudding unique and has been a significant draw for our audiences and patrons.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Longtime Harvard Management Company investor Andrew G. Wiltshire will retire from his position as alternative assets manager later this year.
Wiltshire joined HMC—the University’s investment arm that oversees its $35.9 billion endowment—in 2001 as a natural resource specialist. During his time at HMC, he grew Harvard’s natural resources investment portfolio, which delivered an annual return of 11.6 percent over the 10-year period from June 30, 2004 to June 30, 2014, according to the press release.
Wiltshire spearheaded HMC’s timberland investment strategy, which began in 1997 and expanded greatly under the guidance of former President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo. Harvard’s timber investments, though, fell into controversy after a former contractor for Harvard’s 33,00-acre plot of forest in Romania was arrested on bribery and money laundering charges in January 2014. Soon after, Harvard put the Romanian timberland up for sale, and it was acquired by Ikea Group this summer.
“Andy was a pioneer in developing HMC’s timberland strategy and innovative natural resources portfolio, and was a vital member of the HMC management team that helped Jane Mendillo lead the organization through the financial crisis and its aftermath,” HMC President and CEO Stephen Blyth said in a press release.
Like other university endowments, Harvard’s took a significant hit during the 2009 global financial crisis, an investment lag from which it has still been trying to recover. Mendillo’s tenure as leader of HMC ended abruptly in 2014 when she resigned after a turbulent six-year stretch that rendered subpar returns.
Wiltshire, 58, has consistently been among HMC’s top-paid executives, who are compensated on a performance-based system linked to overall investment performance. He made $8.5 million in 2013, according to Internal Revenue Service tax filings.
