On the surface, “Carrie & Lowell” is Sufjan Stevens’s simplest album yet. Compared to the extravagant behemoths that were “Michigan” and “Illinois,” “Carrie & Lowell” is much more autobiographical and brooding. Certainly, the album’s subject matter contributes to this shift; Stevens’s mother Carrie, who passed away in 2012, is a recurring, almost ubiquitous figure throughout the album’s 11 tracks. Forgoing the intricate, symphonic compositions of some of his earlier work, Stevens alternatingly aims forgiveness and bitterness at his mother’s ghost on “Carrie & Lowell” through some of the barest lyrics and instrumentation he has ever used.
Despite its instrumental sparseness and narrowed scope, “Carrie & Lowell” is not a simple album to digest. The emotional weight of the album alone is staggering; for all of Stevens’s expert lyricism, it feels as if the songs on “Carrie & Lowell” are straining to convey his often paradoxical feelings, touching on faint memories and vignettes that serve as windows into his childhood. On “Eugene,” Stevens croons, “A lemon yogurt, remember I pulled at your shirt / I dropped the ashtray on the floor / I just wanted to be near you.” These fleeting images are the fiber of “Carrie & Lowell,” and Stevens stitches them into mosaics of emotions. It’s this creation’s alluring, breathing, and, above all, convincing quality that provides a humble yet striking setting for “Carrie & Lowell.”
Woven into this fabric, any emotional wound can be fatal, and “Carrie & Lowell” is Stevens going straight for the heart. It’s an exhausting album, not for the length of its tracklist but for its stunning sincerity—the type of unflinching directness that is needed to make an autobiographical album about family convincing. Lyrically, the most familiar track on the album is the opening “Death with Dignity,” which features characteristically imagistic descriptions in heart-wrenching detail: “Your apparition passes through me in the willows / Five red hens, you’ll never see us again.” Even the repetitive “We’re all gonna die” chorus of “Fourth of July” fits naturally into the album’s sincere emotional palette; thoughts that Stevens can’t fight from his head appear regularly, even stubbornly, throughout the work.
Despite the directness of the album, Stevens rarely sounds sure on “Carrie & Lowell.” The tumultuous collection is a changing self-examination for Stevens, and the constantly shifting voices and emotions in the album are evidence of a man with more to say than he can share. Stevens quotes his mother throughout “Carrie & Lowell,” particularly through the development of “Should Have Known Better,” one of the rare moments of optimism on the album. “Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing / the breakers in the bar, / the neighbors greeting,” he echoes in the words of Carrie, before musing, “My brother had a daughter / The beauty that she brings, / illumination.” Lines like these are among the most powerful on the album; as memories of past conversations materialize in the music, it is painfully obvious that Stevens is playing both parts.
Though comparing “Carrie & Lowell” to anything from Stevens’s previous discography is a little bit like comparing a travel guide to a eulogy, there are elements that persist through his latest album, including masterful composition, arcane references to mythology, and a strong connection with Christianity. Stevens spends much of the album’s 45 minutes searching for forgiveness, in turn from his mother and from God. The death of a loved one can easily shake one’s faith, and Stevens accordingly repeatedly appeals to to God for advice and comfort as well as clemency. “John My Beloved,” almost hymn-like in its contemplative repentance, ends with a desperate plea: “Jesus, I need you, be near me, come shield me / From fossils that follow my head / There’s only a shadow of me / In a matter of speaking, I’m dead.”
“Carrie & Lowell” is in many ways an homage to a lost mother, but it ultimately tells the story of an internal struggle; its recurring mentions of religion and guilt ensure that no moment on the album takes place outside of Stevens’s head. “This is not my art project; this is my life,” Stevens professed in an interview with Pitchfork, and in the context of his eclectic discography—which includes voluminous Christmas albums, albums dedicated to states, and even a hip-hop project—the distinction is an important one to make. “Carrie & Lowell” is an incredibly intimate album, more so for its thematic elements than for its sparse instrumentation or its bedroom production. In this intimacy, Stevens is freer to speak than ever before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earl Sweatshirt has always had a penchant for the dark—from disturbingly violent fantasies on “Earl” to verses about his fatherless upbringing on “Doris,” he does not shy away from the gloomy.  But “Grief,” Earl’s newest single off his recently released album “I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside,” takes his characteristically bleak style to an entirely new level. While tracks on “Doris” were kept somewhat positive by catchy melodies and appealing beats, it seems that Earl is abandoning all pretentions of cheeriness on his newest work.
There is little semblance of a melody on “Grief”; any possible melody is replaced by a deep, reverberating bass. One can barely hear Earl’s voice—in its distinctively defiant tone—over the rough, unpolished synth of the track. He still raps at the same deliberate, patient pace of “Earl” and “Doris,” unfolding his wordplay and verses delicately. In fact, despite his low energy, Earl’s gift for lyricism remains prodigious: “Grief” is an impressive tangle of witticisms, turns of phrase, and references to his own personal traumas. “Thinking ‘bout my grandmama, find a bottle / I’mma wallow when I lie in that,” he raps at one point, displaying his pain over his grandmother’s passing. His affecting couplets sound even sparser and more vulnerable in the context of his heavy and dissonant backing.
Earl may be reaching new levels of somberness, but “Grief” is a far cry from his early days of teen destruction and thoughtless gore. He has embraced, in its stead, a highly contemplative and mature phase that allows him to confront his own psychological battles and past. Lines like, “Making sure my man wallet’s straight like a collar / When you iron that,” indicate that, while the talented Earl may be troubled, he’s no longer even keeping up the semblance of the gun-and-drug-toting emcee he once claimed to be. If “Grief” is any indication, “I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside” will provide a glimpse into the deeply fascinating and distressed mind of one of rap’s most unpredictable confessors.

“My brain is a fairy brain, but from the waist down I’m all gibberish,” Strephon (Rahul Kulka GSAS) says in the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ production of “Iolanthe; or The Peer and the Peri.”  Like the half-fairy, half-human Strephon, the operetta, which runs March 27-April 5 in the Agassiz Theater, blends the fantastic and the mortal with humor and panache as its characters straddle the divide between Fairyland and upper-crust, parliamentary Britain.
In traditional G&S fashion, “Iolanthe” features a twist-and-turn-filled plot, upbeat music, and subtle, socio-political satire. The show begins 25 years after the title fairy, or “peri,” marries a human being, an act that fairy law deems a capital crime. Iolanthe (Kimberly A. Onah ’15) has had an illicit son, Strephon, with her mortal husband. The Queen of the Fairies (Laura A. Peterson ’16) takes pity on Iolanthe and chooses to exile rather than to execute her. The show starts with the fairies’ desire to bring Iolanthe back into the fold. “[W]hy not forgive her? 25 years is a long time,” Celia (Julia E. Belanoff ’18) pleads with the Queen.
Celia and Leila (Tamsin E.M. Jones GSAS) speak for the fairies through solo performances. While Belanoff’s voice rings out clear, articulate, and delightful, Jones at times could not be heard above the swelling music. But it is Peterson who commands the stage. Dressed in a red-and-gold dress and holding a glittering star-tipped scepter, Peterson as the Queen inspires awe not only in her doting fairy followers but also in the chorus of uppity Brits from the House of Peers who strut around the stage pretentiously, trying to impress her and to hide their own foolishness.
Stepping spritely and flitting about the stage in color-coordinated wings and eyeshadow, the fairies might seem caricaturish at first glance (“We must dance, and we must sing,” they sing tunefully in “Tripping hither, tripping thither”). But their interactions with the peers make them relatable, even human. Indeed, the cohort of peers—who make quite the entrance as an ensemble wearing Louis XIV-style red capes with white leopard trim and jewel encrusted crowns—appear more outlandish than the fairies. “Bow, bow, you lower-middle classes,” they sing smugly. Indeed, the peers tiptoe around the idea that they have few intellectual qualifications to control society but are nevertheless imbued with incredible legislative power.
When taken together, the peers draw attention to the absurdity of British legal system and the players who dominate it. Lord Chancellor (Aaron A. Slipper ’18) brings the house down during numbers such as  “Love, unrequited, robs me of my rest.” Troubled because he adores Strephon’s lover, Phyllis (Camille L. Crossot ’16), the Lord Chancellor moves from merely coveting her (“My regard for her is rapidly undermining my constitution,” he says in Act I) to bumbling about forlornly  in his matronly nightclothes and disheveled hair. Slipper successfully plays both versions of the Chancellor, first demanding respect as the wig-clad, snobbish judge he is and then eliciting huge laughs as the bug-eyed, restless unrequited lover.
All of the action unfolds in front of a lushly painted backdrop complete with dappled trees, quaint stone steps, pink flower buds, and tiny button-capped mushrooms. By Act II, posh lampposts and a detailed rendering of Big Ben join this landscape. Smart lighting choices, including a dreamlike pink glow that fades in and out as characters transition between Fairyland and Parliament, add to the ambiance. The scenery and lighting both support the whimsy of the fairies and highlight the absurdity of the peers.
This production of “Iolanthe” stays upbeat and entertaining, even though it is a long operetta whose denouement comes toward the very end. Ultimately a mockery of stuffy British law, the show garners laughs through several strong performances and a humanity-affirming message. “I’d rather have half a mortal I do love than half a dozen I don’t,” Phyllis says to Strephon, accepting him for who he is.

So you probably scrolled through your newsfeed this week looking for videos of good April Fools’ pranks only to encounter black and white photos of symmetrically-faced boys and girls telling you to come to Identities. If you don’t know what that is, we’ve got you covered with everything you need to know about where to find these beautiful people this weekend.
What is Identities...is it a new final club?
Nope, no final club here. Identities is the College’s annual fashion show run by students. It’s a showcase to display creativity and student diversity. Every year, the Leadership of the Arts award is given to a designer of Identities’ choice who has made an impact in the fashion and design world. Last year, they gave it to Vera Wang- who will get it this year?
Wait...Identities and Eleganza aren’t the same thing?
Eleganza is a fashion and dance show, whereas Identities is a traditional walk down the runway. The models tend to overlap a lot for both shows though!
Why do these models keep trying to sell me donuts?
That’s right. The students involved in Identities have been strutting around campus selling Krispy Kreme donuts ($10 for a dozen) weeks leading up to the event in order for fundraising. Shameless, especially if you’re still trying to lose the Freshman 15.
What are these Swag Bags everybody keeps talking about?
These are the goodie bags given to those with VIP tickets. Who knows what’s in store for this year, but Identities 2014 Swag Bags’ included makeup, snacks and gift cards to Aritzia. So what if Aritzia is Canadian and we love to make fun of Canada? Swag is swag.
But, you still haven’t told me– How do I go see Identities?
Head over to Northwest Labs at 8 p.m. tonight with your ticket, and enjoy the wonderful clothes and the people who wear them!
