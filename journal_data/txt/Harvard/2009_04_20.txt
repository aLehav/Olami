After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Obama recently took significant steps to repair the damage done to American justice by the Bush administration, issuing an executive order banning torture and releasing three previously classified memos issued by the Office of Legal Counsel—a group of lawyers who provide binding legal advice to the executive branch. However, in order to truly close the book on the dark days of America’s endorsement of torture, Obama should go further and see that those who committed torture are held accountable for their actions.
Under President Bush, the OLC memos regarding national security and detainee issues had been classified. Since these are legal documents, however, and not intelligence reports, they constituted a form of secret law under which the United States government operated for seven years. The Obama administration’s decision last Thursday to declassify and release four additional memos represents an important step toward transparency. For shedding light on some of the government’s worst abuses, President Obama deserves commendation.
However, the release of the memos was accompanied by a statement declaring “it is our intention to assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice that they will not be subject to prosecution.” White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel expanded on this statement in a weekend interview, declaring that the president “believes that [those who devised policy] should not be prosecuted either, and that’s not the place that we go.” We find this position extremely problematic.
The OLC memos describe, in sterile, bureaucratic language that evokes Orwell’s 1984, the brutal treatment of “high value detainees” at the hands of American interrogators. In contrast to previous statements by Bush officials in which specific forms of interrogation were never discussed, these OLC memos specify particular techniques, ranging from facial slaps to waterboarding. Upon learning that one detainee had a fear of stinging insects—the OLC authorized confining him in a small box with insects–a technique that seems eerily reminiscent of Orwell’s Room 101.
Most of the blame for these heinous acts lies with the politicians and OLC lawyers who concluded that “[t]he waterboard is simply a controlled acute episode, lacking the connotation of a protracted period of time generally given to suffering.” As a result, one of the most iconic forms of torture—recognized as such since the Spanish Inquisition—was used by the Bush administration 183 times on a single prisoner over the course of a month. Ironically, the United States has long recognized these methods as torture, prosecuting and convicting Japanese soldiers for waterboarding after World War II. 
In order to uphold the rule of law, President Obama must immediately appoint a special prosecutor to investigate violations of both American and international law. Shielding those who perpetrated this American torture regime from investigation and prosecution—or, in the case of Jay Bybee, currently serve on the federal bench—would be a grave miscarriage of justice.
The argument that America needs to move forward instead of looking back is unconvincing.  Nearly all crimes are prosecuted after the fact; murder prosecutions are not dismissed because they would force people to dwell on the past. The Department of Justice is, in fact, compelled by American law and the Convention on Torture to investigate any credible allegations of torture. The UN special rapporteur on torture stated that the U.S. “is committed to conducting criminal investigations of torture and to bringing all persons against whom there is sound evidence to court.” By refusing to investigate, the Obama administration risks complicity in the worst crimes of the Bush era. 
While we find the lawyers and politicians who authorized the torture regime most culpable, America cannot simply turn a blind eye to those who actually carried out torture. The Obama administration must also conduct an internal investigation to determine the role of CIA interrogators in abusing detainees. The Nuremberg Trials established the principle “that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law,” and the Uniform Code of Military Justice requires American soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. While CIA agents are not bound by the UCMJ, the principle is the same: Individuals are responsible for their own actions.
We hope that President Obama will live up to his campaign rhetoric and recommit the United States “to the rule of law, [rejecting] a false choice between fighting terrorism and respecting [the legal system].” Investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the worst abuses of power under the Bush administration is a necessary step toward that restoration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Martha, the hired help is here! The hired—no? Undergraduates, you say? Well, then. Come in, come in! Make yourself comfortable. Admire our walnut paneling, our sumptuous rugs, our impressive portrait collection of pasty, unidentifiable friends of the College. Take a seat in one of our plush armchairs. A waiter will be by with champagne momentarily.
It pleases us immensely that you have responded so favorably to our electronic mail invitation. We must admit that we initially feared our recent decision to open our posh Quincy Street premises to students for a fee might be, well, misunderstood. Taken crassly, reduced to financial terms of the crudest sort. The term “desperate” may even have been thrown out—presumptuously, of course.
But why should not a Faculty Club admit students? Will not students one day assume the roles of professors and successful business professionals themselves? Is this not the ideal time to initiate them into the mysterious world of cutlery, fine wines, and so forth? The situation is what our banking friends so aptly call a “win-win”: you rub shoulders with graying dignitaries, we enjoy the presence of fresh-faced visitors and potential future donors. The logic, you must agree, is impeccable.
If you have finished with your drinks, shall we proceed to dinner? Tonight’s menu—lobster bisque, rosefish, hazelnut soufflé—will be prepared by our star chef Jean Luc, who trained for six years at Le Benardin julienning carrots and perfecting his flambé. What was that? No, unfortunately, at the present time we do not prepare beef tacos, though high demand may necessitate a reconsideration of our current bill of fare. It is possible, however, that ramen noodles al dente—a staple of your demographic, we hear—are currently available, though naturally an 18-percent surcharge will apply.
As we were saying, this decision to admit students is arguably our most significant change in policy since we granted women access to the main dining rooms in 1968. My, what a fuss that was! The Ladies’ Dining Room was pleasant enough, with ample space for their knitting circles, but—heh—you know how those Radcliffe women can be. We must admit, though, that their feminine touch lends a charming dash of domesticity to our proceedings. It can’t be all cigars and snooker all the time, you understand.
If it is not undue, might we remark on what interesting garments you have chosen to don this evening? In our day, business casual practically meant a three-piece suit. Well, it is true that cravats and waistcoats are only adopted now by a particular kind of man. But if you would just remove your Converse sneakers from the white linen—if you could just—ahh, here is the bill.
Sign right there, right by the X; yes, there we go. Scented towels and after-dinner mints are available in the bathroom just down the hall. The coatroom is to your left, from which you may reclaim your belongings for a mere $25 service fee. Thank you very much. We hope you have enjoyed your glimpse of our values, the quality of service and New England virtue we strive to embody. Incidentally, have we mentioned our reduced membership fee for students? Good evening sirs, mademoiselles. Good evening. We hope to see you again soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paint-can drums thundered and homemade signs shuddered outside the Holyoke Center last Thursday as the Student Labor Action Movement protested the university’s staff layoffs. But the hordes of passersby—aloof to the anger—indicated that the “Man” needn’t quake in his boots: The picketers, like many campus activists, proved ineffective.
Why, then, do students continue to hit the pavement? Without a draft to oppose or a president to elect, students search for some purpose in their lives, and they usually find it in the latest fad, like unionizing hotel workers or divesting from Darfur. Because these issues hardly affect students, students hardly affect these issues’ outcomes. As a result, campus activists take solace in their intent instead of their impact. Unlike their apathetic friends, they at least cared enough to try.
Unfortunately, students’ antics deflect attention from their stated goals. Last week, SLAM interrupted University President Drew G. Faust’s lunch in Eliot dining hall to offer her a letter detailing their demands. And at FAS Dean Michael D. Smith’s town-hall meeting on the university’s budget, the group unfurled a banner that read, “Greed is the New Crimson.” Rather than encourage empathy for workers facing possible layoffs, these stunts drew criticism for their rudeness.
While students perform such political theater to gain an audience, their initiatives routinely flop. In 2007, SLAM held a hunger strike to promote higher wages for Harvard’s security guards. Consequently, campus debate shifted from whether the security guards deserved larger salaries to whether the strike was justified. After some strikers were hospitalized, the security guards asked SLAM to cease its protest. 
On top of the song and dance, campus activists speak in hyperbole, further undermining their cause. While students think they’re reciting soliloquies, onlookers think they’re watching standup. In 2006, SLAM called for Harvard to sever ties with Coca-Cola because the company allegedly smothered Colombian workers’ attempts to unionize. Then-SLAM leader Michael A. Gould-Wartofsky ’07 declared: “There’s literally blood on the hands of that corporation.” Perhaps some thug in Colombia was guilty, but Gould-Wartofsky went too far: Did any receptionist at corporate headquarters “literally” have blood on her hands? 
The true blue-collars would argue that dog and pony shows build support for their objectives. But sometimes their rhetoric seems more concerned with showing their good intentions than with showing results. A recent SLAM e-mail rallied students to “Save Harvard Jobs” by playing on their consciences: “It’s time to show that our support goes beyond high-fives in the corridors or chats by the security desk.” Instead of convincing students that layoffs were bad policy, SLAM insinuated that, if students did not oppose job cuts, they were uncaring. 
This latest campaign is part of a larger trend among campus activists: Since they can’t enact the change they desire, they might as well show that they are good, moral people. Many student activists are sincere in their efforts and accept that they’re promoting lost causes. But, besides being futile, this approach can harm the very causes that students support.
For instance, when members of the Westboro Baptist Church appeared in Cambridge last month, almost 400 protestors greeted them. The students who confronted the WBC had the best of intentions: They meant to show their opposition to a despicable group. Nevertheless, the WBC fed off the publicity like a cancer. It should have been ignored. But these students’ desire to show that they were better than these bigots proved too powerful to ignore.
Certainly, students are entitled to express their opinions on any issue. But activists assume a higher purpose: They hope not only to articulate, but also to enact their vision of the world. So, when students use the weapons of civil disobedience as everyday tools, they blunt their edge. People don’t stop to listen to the kid with the bullhorn because they see him all the time. If students focused their energies on campaigns that directly involved them, they might have greater effect.
Until then, campus activists will wage fruitless campaigns. They’ll pass out flyers and wear ribbons and march on the Yard, but to no avail. And they will likely ignore these words of caution, as they are convinced of the righteousness of their causes. Many protestors like to quote Frederick Douglass, who once said that those who want freedom without agitation “want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.” But point out that these protests don’t make so much as a splash, and campus activists seem content in responding, “Well, at least I’m aware there’s an ocean.”

The federal court of appeals recently overturned a motion by Harvard Law School professor Charles R. Nesson ’60 to allow what his staff says would have been the first Internet broadcast of a federal judicial proceeding to the general public in history.The development came in the midst of a case that Nesson is defending on behalf of Joel Tenenbaum, a graduate student at Boston University who faces up to $1 million in damages after being sued by several prominent record labels in 2005  for allegedly downloading seven songs from a file-sharing Web site in high school. Nesson, working the case pro bono with a handful of his students, has seized on the case as an opportunity to campaign for openness and access, both on the Internet and in the courtroom. In a representative effort to increase transparency, the Tenenbaum team motioned in December to broadcast a key courtroom hearing on the Internet.“Every trial should be Web-cast so long as the judge deems it appropriate and beneficial for all parties involved,” said Tenenbaum.“This decision will invariably have far-reaching consequence once it is resolved,” Tenenbaum added. “All subsequent attorneys seeking to either ban or allow Web-casting of their proceedings will inevitably cite the decision reached in this case, whatever that may be.”According to Nesson, giving the public first-hand access to the case would have had immense educational value.“Joel is being dragged into court by arbitrary authorities...If the public was aware of what the recording industry is doing to Joel and others like him, they would be outraged,” Nesson said. “I believe that this outrage would be expressed in the form of [seeking] change.”In January, U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner allowed the Tenenbaum team’s original motion to allow Internet in the courtroom. The record industry then appealed Gertner’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.Last Thursday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals overrode Judge Gertner’s decision, despite admitting that there was indeed good reason to webcast the proceedings.In reaching its decision, the court cited Local Rule 83.3, a Massachusetts law that prohibits recording and broadcasting court proceedings in District courts.Though he acknowledged that the judges’ application of the rule to the Internet was “reasonable,” Nesson said that Gertner’s interpretation cannot be called “palpably erroneous,” as the appeals judges did.Expressing disappointment in the judges’ ruling, D. Yvette Wohn, a Harvard Extension School student assisting Nesson with public relations, said the recording industry is stuck in an age where music came on a CD and could be expressly owned and sold.“Broadcasting this case over the Internet is very relevant because it applies the Internet in a way that hasn’t been done before,” Wohn said. “By being denied the webcast, Joel is losing his constitutional right to a public trial.”The Tenenbaum team will continue to pursue all available legal avenues and cannot yet view this reversal as a setback, said Nesson, who told the Boston Globe that he intended to appeal the Web-casting decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.“We’re going forward with the same issues as we would have in January, except without the Internet,” he said.Nesson said he will continue to pursue an open strategy so that the public can understand the recording industry’s actions and their implications.“There’s a story here that in its way, in some ways, bigger than the case,” said Nesson. “And it’s the telling of this story that will get the problem fixed.”—Staff Writer Helen X.

On Saturday night, the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub was awash with booze, boas, and bared backs as cross-dressed students and spectators gathered to celebrate Drag Night, an annual event hosted by the Harvard Queer Students and Allies.The event featured drag musical artists as varied as mermaid “Fishy Snatch” and farm-boy “Oliver Heart,” both of whose stage names have been used in lieu of their real names for this article to protect their privacy. Consistent with the drag tradition, their performances offered a departure from gender normativity perhaps unfamiliar to the average Harvard undergraduate.But as Johnny Blazes, the night’s iridescently-clad MC, noted afterward, many attendees seemed uncomfortable with the hands-on nature of drag, or at least unsure of what to expect.“At bars I work for tips, but at college shows, there isn’t that code,” Blazes explained. Blazes, a professional drag performer from Jamaica Plain, nonetheless praised the event as an important opportunity to disseminate information on the practice of ‘gender bend’—a blurring of gender constructs, of which drag is a prominent element—and to encourage greater acceptance in the community.Still, Blazes added, “Surprised reactions surprised me.”Blazes, confidently straddling the line between male and female, opened the set with an original presentation before handing the stage over to student performances. The enraptured crowd, meanwhile, maintained its quiet during most of the night’s acts, often breaking into nervous laughter when one the audience was pulled into the fray.Queens “Miss Patience” (James P. Alexander ’10) and “Mariza” solicited the rowdiest laughter with their performance of R&B hit “The Boy is Mine,” pantomimed with the help of a drag-king aide. Similarly, “Fishy Snatch” channelled Mariah Carey for her moving rendition of “Always Be My Baby,” overcoming the shortcomings of spotty microphone coverage with the help of a crowd whose voices undulated in unison with the chorus.Despite an initially tepid audience, the event’s organizers were quick to call Drag Night a success, especially for the student performers, who enjoyed the positive support of many their fellow classmates. Marco Chan ’11, one of QSA’s co-chairs, noted that the performance night brought diversity to the QSA’s programming, to the benefit of members and outsiders alike.“Pushing those boundaries of gender perception and conformity is really interesting, and again it’s an exercise that rarely happens at Harvard,” Chan said. —Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.

The Boston Teachers Union’s rejection of Teach for America earlier this month—based on the argument that corps members are replacing laid-off teachers—illuminates anxieties about a program that more Harvard students are flocking to than ever before.Boston Public Schools plans to place TFA recruits in about 20 local positions, which Joshua Z. Biber, TFA recruiter for the greater Boston area, said was not a result of layoffs. “Even with some potential cuts in some areas, they are still making hires in the district, particularly in subject areas and local areas of high need,” Biber said. “We are only looking to fill spots that will already be empty.”But Richard F. Stutman, president of the Boston Teachers Union, said that about half of those positions are already filled by provisional teachers who will lose their jobs to TFA corps members.“Teach for America claims that it does not come in and take positions from incumbent members. That is a lie,” Stutman said. “They are doing it in Boston. We have asked them nicely not to come into Boston and take the jobs of real live, incumbent teachers. Their arrogance is appalling.”Stutman also added that Boston public schools, which do not have a shortage of “qualified candidates,” has no need for TFA teachers.But Elizabeth A. Texeira ’09—one of the record-breaking 50 Harvard students who will join TFA next fall—said she believes Boston could benefit from the program. “I think there’s always going to be some resistance to change when an organization comes in to fix a failing system,” she said. “I love Boston Public Schools but I also absolutely believe that there is a place for TFA here.”Eve R. Meyer ’09 emphasized that the intention of TFA is to supplement, not replace, current teachers.“We certainly would never want to displace a 30-year veteran teacher, but clearly Boston is an area they thought could use more teachers,” she said. “You’d think that everyone would be happy that there are people who want to teach and help students learn.”Stutman also raised the concern that the short-term TFA recruits will be displacing union members who are better qualified.Elizabeth B. Hadaway ’09, another TFA recruit, said, “I’m not sure why being a teacher for a long time is inherently a priority over being a good teacher. I think TFA prides itself on its model of no excuses and significant gains.”Stutman said that he is not opposed to the TFA program, but believes that its introduction to Boston was handled poorly. “They are doing a disservice to their own members, their own people and to the mission of their own organization by forcing this issue,” he said. —Staff writer Sofia E.

Despite the inhospitable chill and Sunday-night scheduling, singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles and electronic duo Ratatat drew hordes of undergraduates to Yardfest 2009 in Tercentenary Theater yesterday evening. 
Initial estimates from the College Events Board, the student-staffed body responsible for planning the event, placed Sunday’s attendance just around 7,100, slightly above last year’s figure, despite the considerably colder weather.
“Everything went better than we could have ever hoped for,” said James A. McFadden, the CEB’s vice-chair. “It was surprising that it went so well.”
But despite the on-campus hype that built quickly after their appearance was made official, Ratatat disappointed some Yardfest-goers by limiting their repertoire to their original electronic material and not venturing into their better-known remixed work. 
“I hoped they would play more from the remix albums,” said Peter Fodroczy ’11, maintaining that nonetheless, “They were still really good.”
The digital duo elicited may spectator screams throughout their performance, taking the stage at approximately 7 p.m. underneath a shower of glow-sticks and inflatable beach-balls. Their set progressed with eerie clips of the band’s music videos playing in the background—at one point, band member Mike Stroud wildly screamed “I love Harvard!”  
Bareilles, in contrast, opened the festivities at 5:30 sharp, after the crowd had feasted on the corn dogs, kebabs, and similarly carnivalesque fare. The songstress played her pop-rock hit ‘Love Song’ only after a preliminary set of largely unknown numbers, taunting the crowd at the beginning of one initial track, “It’s not what you think it is!”
On her third-to-last track, Bareilles finally relented, to the welcoming cries of a large sector of the gathered mass. 
‘Love Song’ has been Bareilles first and only chart-climber, reaching a peak position of number four on Billboard’s Hot 100 in the summer of 2007. 
While opinions on the weather, the food, and the performances varied widely, many students simply expressed gratitude for the opportunity to commingle with friends and classmates.
Max R. Selver ’11 echoed this sentiment, commenting, “I’m just happy there’s music playing out loud right now.”
Ratatat was due to make appearances at the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub after the event; they arrived around 9:15 p.m. 
Asked about the quality of the show, Stroud replied, “Once the sun went down, it got better.”
He further elaborated that he was “more psyched for the security guards than the students” in preparing for the show. His bandmate, Evan Mast, insisted on replying on paper, commenting only, “KAMBLOCK RENSALEAR BAGEL RUB.”  
Mast also reflected on the quality of food offered, writing “THES KABLAHS ARE VARIOUS BRANGE RENSE.”

Due to recent changes in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology Department’s scheduling policies, students looking for help with computer troubleshooting on Saturdays and Sundays are no longer able to take advantage of the Science Center’s computer clinic.Yet according to Noah S. Selsby ’94, a spokesperson for FAS IT, the cuts in weekend hours resulted not from FAS’s economic woes, but rather from the results of a statistical evaluation of the Clinic’s weekend traffic, which indicated an average of only three client-calls per hour worker shift on weekends. The clinic, located on the building’s second floor, will now only be open from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m., Mondays through Fridays.Referring to the conceivable connection between the change in hours and the University’s current budgetary concerns, Selsby said, “There is obviously a savings to us there, but I don’t believe [the change in hours] was a direct repercussion of the current economic situation.” The impact of this change on undergraduate User Assistants—FAS IT’s student employees who staff the help desk and the clinic—remain unclear. Selsby denied that the economic crisis has significantly affected student employees, adding that the eliminated shifts were often left unstaffed after the lottery process used to assign shifts at the beginning of each semester due to student preferences.Selsby indicated that FAS IT will prioritize its infrastructure and provided services in responding to the economic crunch, though he emphasized that the UA program also remains high amongst those priorities, since the department already considers the program a cost-saving measure in itself.Selsby mentioned, however, that FAS IT might actually see a trend of increased student employment as economic realities reverberate, especially for undergraduates with webmaster experience. “I deal a lot with departmental Web sites that want small design projects done by students, because the students are in many cases just as talented as professionals,” Selsby explained, “but you pay them a student rate.”Due to strict policies within the UA program concerning employee-press communication, it is difficult to ascertain whether some or all workers have been asked to work fewer hours in response to the truncated schedule. But a University-wide emphasis on cost cutting, however, seems to indicate that placing additional workers on weekday shifts in compensation for the lost time is unlikely.  —Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.

Entering the weekend a half game behind the Ivy League leaders No. 58 Brown (19-4, 5-2 Ivy) and No. 46 Princeton (18-7, 6-1), the Harvard women’s tennis team knew it had to sweep its two matches against the Bears and No. 44 Yale (14-6, 5-2 Ivy) to keep its hopes alive for the Ivy crown.After staying in contention on Friday with a 4-3 win over Brown, the Crimson (12-8, 5-1) continued its strong performance yesterday by defeating the Bulldogs for first time since 2006, by a margin of 5-2.“We knew Brown and Yale were going to be tough,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We lost to them last year. Our mindset was get the doubles point and fight for every singles point.”Now the Crimson controls its own destiny. If the squad defeats Dartmouth on Wednesday, it will share the Ivy title with Princeton. HARVARD 5, YALE 2Yale entered yesterday’s match at the Murr Center as the favorite and with a chance to clinch at least a share of the league title. The Bulldogs had won five consecutive Ancient Eight matches and had outscored opponents 26-2 in their last four matches. But the Crimson was determined to snap Yale’s streak. Harvard maintained its recent strength in doubles, winning its eighth-consecutive doubles point. The Crimson swept the three doubles matches for the fifth time in that span.Sophomore Agnes Sibilski and senior Beier Ko disposed of their Bulldog opponents, 8-3, to earn their twelfth win of the season and extend their partnership’s win steak to five.At No. 3, freshman Camille Jania and captain Laura Peterzan moved to 8-0 on the season by clinching the doubles point for the Crimson with an 8-5 win.To complete the sweep, sophomore Samantha Rosekrans hit an overhead smash up the middle on match point to take the set, 8-5, with her partner, freshman Holly Cao.To keep its chances for an Ivy title alive, Harvard had to take at least three of the six singles matches, but history was not on its side—the Crimson had gone 0-12 in singles in the last two meetings between the two teams. But history changed yesterday.After Rosekrans lost 6-3, 6-2, Cao gave Harvard a 2-1 lead at No. 5 with a crosscourt backhand into the corner to take the match 6-1, 6-3.No. 88 Ko extended the lead at No. 1, avenging last year’s three-set defeat against the 2008 Ivy Player of the Year, No. 101 Janet Kim, beating Kim 6-3, 6-2 this season.“Going into this match I was very determined to beat her,” Ko said. “I was very pumped…and gave it all I had. It definitely paid off.”All was looking good for the Crimson until freshman Samantha Gridley lost her match after taking the first set.  Then Sibilski, with a 5-2 lead in the second set, seemed to let victory slip out of her fingertips, losing the set 7-5.But fortunately for Harvard, Sibilski stormed back in the third set to win the match 6-1, 5-7, 6-2. Knowing that the victory gives the Crimson a chance to determine its own destiny in its season finale, Sibilski’s onlooking teammates rushed onto the court to congratulate her.“It was very exciting,” Sibilski said. “I’m really proud of our team.”To add to the victory, Peterzan defeated No. 85 Jessica Rhee in a super tiebreak, 7-6 (1), 5-7, (10-7).HARVARD 4, BROWN 3On Friday, the Ko and Sibilski partnership defeated No. 67 pair Bianca Aboubakare and Cassandra Herzberg to earn its second win of the week over a ranked opponent. With the 8-6 victory, Ko and Sibilski delivered only the second loss of the season to the Brown duo.Cao and Rosenkrans moved to 5-3 on the season with an 8-3 win, while at No. 3 Jania and Peterzan remained undefeated with an easy 8-1 set. Despite having the doubles point under its belt, the Crimson had its hopes of a title on the verge of collapse when Harvard dropped four opening sets in the six singles matches.But the momentum of the match shifted in the Crimson’s direction when Cao moved to 6-1 on the season with her 6-3, 7-5 win at No. 5.The momentum stayed in with Harvard as Ko pulled ahead in the second set after dropping the first, 6-1. She went on to win the second set, 6-4, as well as the decisive third set, 6-2.“I was a little frustrated [with the first set]…so I changed my tactic,” Ko said. “I was like ‘Let me do something different. Let me come to the net, let me be more aggressive, but consistent at the same time.’”Rosekrans earned her tenth dual win this season, tying her personal mark set last season, with a 6-4, 7-5 victory in a hard-fought match.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the world of sports, it’s not often that an opposing team can be your friend one week, then your biggest rival the next.Just one week ago, the Harvard men and women’s track and field team teamed up with Yale to compete against Oxford and Cambridge. Last Saturday, the two teams took the track one more time—this time meeting at the Crimson’s McCurdy Track—as Ivy League rivals.“I have always believed that when the gun goes off that’s when the competition really begins,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “When you cross the line, camaraderie and respect for your opponent is really crucial. I think it’s a great experience for our student-athletes to join forces with our biggest rival, and it really adds to the tradition, and to the competition, it gives it that extra spice.”The Crimson women had a dominant performance against the Bulldogs, earning 101 points to Yale’s 61. The men, on the other hand, witnessed a number of outstanding individual performances and lessened the point-total gap from last year, falling 100-54.“I’m very pleased with the women’s side,” Saretsky said. “They had a great performance, and really came out firing on all cylinders to take the victory by a sizable amount.”Senior Favia Merritt continued to dominate on the track Saturday, posting ECAC qualifying times of 11.90 and 24.68 seconds in the 100- and 200-meter sprints, respectively. Merritt was also a member of the winning 4x100-meter relay team.Perhaps the most impressive performance of the day was given by senior Brittan Smith. Smith competed in four events, placing second in the 100- and 200-meter runs. She also ran her leg of the 4x400-meter relay, and tied her career best of 6.01 meters in the long jump. Smith’s first place finish was part of a long-jump sweep for Harvard, with seniors Shannon Flahive and Elissa Reidy finishing second and third, respectively.“Brittan Smith also had a fantastic day,” Saretsky said. “She competed in four events, so she did a really good job spreading out her energy.”Other events that also stood out for the women included the women’s 800-meter and the 3000-meter run. The Crimson earned nine valuable points from the 800-meter after sophomores Thea Lee and Jamie Olson and senior Jan Ng finished 1-2-3 for Harvard. Sophomore Claire Richardson continued her outstanding outdoor campaign, running an ECAC qualifying time of 9:52.60 in the 3000-meter run.While the women had no problem taking care of the Bulldogs, the men continued to struggle against their counterparts.“We had some really strong individual performances,” Saretsky said. “We cut into Yale’s advantage over us. We’re definitely not where I would like us to be just yet, but we’re getting there.”Freshman Stephen Geloneck led the way for the Crimson in the 100 meter run. His time of 10.60 seconds met standards for the IC4As, and was the fourth-fastest time in the program’s history.“This was my fastest time, but we trained really hard in order to get ready for this week,” Geloneck said. “We really wanted to kill Yale.”As impressive as Geloneck’s time was, the rookie was not entirely satisfied with his race.“To be honest, I’m never really satisfied,” Geloneck said. “It’s a good time and I’m happy with it, but I felt like I could have run a lot better. I noticed a lot of things that could have been improved.”Sophomore Dan Chenoweth won the 5000-meter with a time of 14:35.35, a full 12 seconds ahead of his closest competitor. Freshmen Justin Grinstead also performed well in the 400-meter hurdles, clocking in at 53.28 seconds to take first place. Junior Jack Brady recorded a personal best of 50.17 meters in the discus throw to move into 10th all time in the Harvard record books.But while many members of the team had outstanding individual performances, it wouldn’t be all fun and games for the Crimson men. With many of Harvard’s male athletes injured, it would have been difficult for the Crimson to pull out a victory against the Bulldogs.“In the 4x100, freshman Chuma Ogunwole was sick and tore his hamstring,” Geloneck said. “We messed up the handoff, and were disqualified.”Rookie Jon Dingus also sat out on the sidelines with either a broken or stress-fractured foot.“I think it’s important to remember that a lot of people on our team are freshmen and sophomores, so we’re a young team,” Geloneck said. “[Yale] had a lot of experience on us.”Harvard will head to Iowa for the Drake Relays coming up next week. This will be the Crimson’s first appearance in the prestigious meet, and both the men and the women are looking to make a good impression at the national level.“We’re always preparing, day in and day out,” Saretsky said. “That’s one of the things with track and field, everything we do is gearing up for the next competition. We’ll continued to do the things that got us this far, and continue to work hard and get after it.  —Staff writer Kevin T. Chen can be reached at ktchen@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rivalry, redemption, revelry—three of the most central and palpable themes in college athletics—were all in play this past weekend for the Harvard men’s tennis team. Continuing its season-closing seven-match tango in the Ivy League, the Crimson (12-9, 4-2 Ivy) hosted No. 73 Brown (18-9, 4-2 Ivy) at home at the Beren Tennis Center on Friday, then traveled to New Haven on Sunday to battle rival No. 64 Yale (13-8, 3-3 Ivy). Against two familiar, higher-ranked enemies, Harvard secured a pair of morale-boosting 5-2 wins.The Crimson’s class of 2009 had another task at hand on Friday: defending their turf one last time in the final home game of the season. Notching a win against the Bears on “Senior Day” had symbolic importance—co-captains Chris Clayton and Michael Kalfayan, alongside Sasha Ermakov and Michael Libert, will never again compete on Harvard’s evergreen concrete courts.HARVARD 5, YALE 2The Crimson was again a late bloomer yesterday against the Bulldogs. For its ailing hopes of retaining the Ivy League title, however, it was too little, too late; league-leaders Columbia defeated Princeton to secure its second Ancient Eight championship in three years.“We came out and fought today,” Clayton said. “We thought there was still a chance to get a share of the Ivy Title [if Columbia lost]. But once they won, we still fought hard.”In the doubles, a lackluster Harvard fell to a bullish Yale. The No. 3 combination of junior Michael Hayes and freshman Alistair Felton recorded the Crimson’s sole victory with an 8-4 win.After a sluggish start, Harvard responded in the best way possible—winning five of six singles matches. At No. 1, Clayton clawed back to victory after dropping the first set to the Bulldog’s Jeff Dawson, turning it around in a third set victory (2-6, 6-4, 6-1)—a captain’s display epitomizing the squad’s persistence.“It looked over in a hurry,” said Harvard Assistant Coach Andy Rueb ’95. “That’s what a senior captain does…once the door opens a crack, he just comes barging through, and that’s what Chris did.”The Crimson increased its lead through sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans, winning 6-2, 6-3 to maintain his undefeated Ivy status at the No. 2 position this season. At the third spot, Ermakov overcame a second-set loss to his Yale opponent to win in three (7-5, 2-6, 7-6), while No. 5 freshman Davis Mangham clinched the match with a 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 victory.No. 4 sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien also recorded a win (6-4, 7-6) as Harvard compensated for its loss of the Ivy League championship by triumphing over its classic rivals.“The team showed great resilience in singles,” Omodele-Lucien said. “We rebounded really well. Everybody just played their heart out, and we had a good result.” HARVARD 5, BROWN 2Shouts of “Tough Break Bruno!” and “C’mon Bruno!” could be heard from Beren Tennis Center on Friday afternoon, as the Crimson faced a boisterous Brown team and its fans.In a competitive doubles period, Harvard sealed the first point of the contest with wins at No.’s 2 and 3. At No. 3, the partnership of Hayes and Felton secured an 8-4 victory over their Bears counterparts. In a tighter match, the No. 2 tandem of Omodele-Lucien and Ermakov withstood a late surge by Brown’s Chris Lee and Basu Ratnam to clinch the crucial doubles point (9-7).Down early, the Bears’ response was instantaneous, winning four of six opening sets in the singles matchups.Despite some uncharacteristic unforced errors in early baseline rallies, No. 1 Clayton defeated Brown’s Jonathan Pearlman in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4. At No. 2, the Bears’ Lee, a speedy counterpuncher with deceptive power, took the first set 6-0. However, Chijoff-Evans remained competitive and pulled out a close victory in a dramatic third set tiebreaker (0-6, 6-3, 7-6(5)).With poor opening sets behind them, No. 5 Omodele-Lucien and No. 6 Felton looked to the skies as they regrouped mentally. Both players fought back after being down by match points simultaneously, winning 2-6, 7-5, 6-3, and 2-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3, respectively.“It was a rare happening,” Rueb said. “There was a definite energy switch. There’s a lot of synergy that goes on between the courts.” With Brown’s victory mere points away, the Crimson fought back from the brink to complete a remarkable turnaround.“I just told myself that you can’t really worry about losing at this stage,” Omodele-Lucien said. “It’s obviously not helping.”Though Rueb was vocal in his approval of the team’s performance, he insisted that there was no single highlight that could summarize the weekend—only a phrase.“[It was] a hell of a performance,” Rueb said.

The Harvard women’s water polo team (11-14, 4-6 CWPA) was able to overcome a dismal start to the Northern Division Championship on Saturday to end with a third-place finish yesterday. The Crimson dropped two games on the opening day of the championship—hosted by Connecticut College—to two ranked opponents. Harvard came up big on Sunday, however, as the Crimson scored a combined 38 goals in yesterday’s doubleheader. The team now awaits a decision from the Collegiate Water Polo Association to find out whether it will play in the Eastern Championship, which will be hosted at Blodgett Pool this weekend. “We went to the championships with the intention of winning the division but we put ourselves in too many tight situations,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar said. “We have to take these lessons...it was a new experience for a lot of people.” HARVARD 20, UTICA 2The team exploded against Utica College (2-12, 0-8), scoring evenly throughout the match. The Crimson came out focused and with high intensity throughout, using a different offensive play each quarter to maintain the pace of the game. The variety of attack formations led to several players netting multiple goals. Freshman Devan Kennifer had a terrific weekend, and continued her good play in the final game of the championship by scoring a game high four goals. Six more of her teammates also contributed to the barrage of scoring, with juniors Kristina Bergquist and Kelly Peeler and freshman Ita Barton-Kettleborough earning hat-tricks. Harvard maintained an upbeat offensive tempo throughout the game and was able to keep Utica at bay with solid defense. Freshman netminder Laurel McCarthy had five saves and only allowed two goals in her second win of the day. The Crimson ended with a 2-2 record at the tournament, a mark that may keep them alive for the big upcoming championship. HARVARD 18, CONN COLLEGE 4The Crimson played an early morning match against the Camels (4-7, 3-6), and proceeded to get the job done without a spectacular performance. Harvard started off the game with low intensity, though it picked up throughout the game. Barton-Kettleborough had a big showing, finding the back of the net four times as the Crimson cruised to an easy victory. The hosts never posed much of a threat, which lulled Harvard into a lackluster pace, but the Crimson managed to post a strong offensive output and attone for Saturday’s defeats.BROWN 8, HARVARD 7 (OT)After losing to No. 15 Hartwick, the Crimson showed resilience against another highly-ranked opponent. Harvard faced No. 19 Brown (23-13, 8-2) in a rivalry matchup that took several turns. In the first half, the Crimson ran off to a 6-1 lead thanks to a balanced offensive effort characteristic of the weekend. However, Harvard wound up on the other side of a 6-1 run during the second half, forcing the game into overtime. Both teams were scoreless in the first overtime period, but Brown junior Lauren Presant scored with 1:22 left in the second overtime period to give the Bears a hardfought victory.“In the first quarter against Brown we came out hard and focused and we played the best two quarters we ever played,” freshman Shannon Purcell said. “We played really well as a team and we’re going into [next weekend] with a very focused mindset and a good team dynamic.” Purcell and teammate Barton-Kettleborough each had a pair of tallies to keep the Crimson in the game. Peeler and Kennifer also added to the score, each netting one goal. Former Crimson magazine chair and co-captain Nicola Perlman had a valiant effort, attempting to put a halt to the Bears’ offense with nine saves. The efforts fell short, however, and Harvard dropped its second game of the day. HARTWICK 12, HARVARD 8The Crimson had a rough start on Saturday, facing the highest ranked team of the competition. Hartwick (28-11, 9-1) came out strong, scoring the first six goals of the match before Harvard came back within striking distance, 8-6. However, Hartwick’s offense was too much for Perlman, who still had impressive numbers after a tough match. She ended the game with 12 saves and three steals and was critical in keeping Harvard in the game. Kennifer and Barton-Kettleborough each had three goals to lead the Crimson. Kennifer also had two assists, two kickouts, and two steals. Freshman Monica Zdrojewski netted twice to show why she is the current Northern Division Rookie of the Week, though these efforts were in vain after the squad had fallen so far behind. “We had some really good stretches and some not so good stretches,” said Farrar. “We dug a big hole against Hartwick and we tried to come back but we can’t just keep creating too big a [deficit].”

With the Ivy Championship looming on the horizon, the Caves Valley Spring Intercollegiate was an important match for the Crimson men’s golf team. After struggling against Ivy competition last week at the Princeton Invitational, this weekend had to be different if Harvard wanted to turn its season around.The squad did just that, as the Crimson dominated the field to win by 13 strokes, positing a combined score of 595 (294-301). George Washington came in second, tallying a team score of 608. Facing off against the majority of its Ivy competition, with the exception of Columbia and Dartmouth, the team thrived.It was able to clinch an easy victory on Sunday, running away with the title by shooting a 301. If the squad can get the same quality of play, from top to bottom, it will be favored to win the Ivy championship next weekend.“This week was a huge confidence booster for us,” freshman standout Mark Pollak said. “Going into next weekend, we feel like, as the Yale coach put it, we’re the team to beat.”On the first day of play, the Crimson came out firing. The team shot a combined score of 294, six shots ahead of its rival Bulldogs.Led by the stellar play of Pollak, who shot a team-best round of 70 (-1), Harvard left the rest of the field far behind and put itself in excellent position to claim victory on Sunday.Pollak did not compete last week at the Princeton Invitational, taking a weekend off to focus on academics, and the squad suffered as a result. On the second day of play in Princeton, the Crimson posted an abysmal 315, falling into eighth out of 14 teams. At Caves Valley, Harvard was in need of a spark, and Pollak provided it, leading the team with a fourth-place overall individual finish.“Last week we didn’t have one of our best players in [Pollak],” junior Greg Shuman said. “It was great to have him back.”Pollak has been a force on the course all year, coming in as the first Crimson competitor at nearly every tournament.Shuman, coming off an outstanding third-place individual finish at Princeton the week before, continued his hot play, finishing sixth overall to pace the Crimson attack.The one-two punch of Shuman and Pollak proved lethal for the rest of the competition. The squad hopes it will be more of the same next week.“Having [Shuman] here really pushes me to be a better player,” Pollak said. “We’re always battling it out to see who will win this week.”Harvard was able to get back to its winning ways in part because the conditions were greatly improved. Facing blustery winds and cold rain, the Crimson struggled at Princeton. At Caves Valley, it was smooth sailing, as the squad played well on a great course with even better conditions.“We got really lucky with the weather,” Pollak said. “It was nice to finally warm up the muscles and take a full swing. I always feel good in the spring time.”The team had already won the Yale Invitational early in the spring, shooting under 600 at 595 in early April. In winning again this weekend, Harvard is righting the ship just in time, as the Ivy Championships will take place next weekend. The Caves Valley tournament was introduced this year by Yale to serve as a final chance for the Ancient Eight schools to test the waters before the three-day Ivy League Championship begins Friday at Atlantic City Country Club in Northfield, N.J. Bucknell and George Washington rounded out the eight-team field, and the golfers got to attend a special dinner Saturday night with guest speaker Mark Whittaker, who is the Washington Bureau Chief for NBC News.After gaining momentum back at Caves Valley, the Crimson is poised to make a run at an Ivy title. “It’s an overall effort—everyone has to play well for us each week,” Shuman said. “While it helps to have [Pollak and me] up there, it’s important that everyone plays well.”—Staff writer Walter E.

Another weekend, and yet another strong showing by the Harvard women’s golf team. This time, however, it was not the usual first-place finish. In its penultimate tournament before the all-important Ivy League Championships, the Crimson ended up six strokes behind Princeton, good for second place in the Roar-EE Invitational, hosted by Columbia University at Spook Rock Golf Course in Suffern, N.Y.It was Harvard’s first tournament loss since last year’s Roar-EE Invitational.The Tigers jumped out to an early lead Friday and never relinquished it, shooting 302-310 in the two-day competition to finish ahead of the Crimson and four other members of the Ancient Eight. The only Ivy League team not to participate was Cornell.“We had a decent tournament,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It would have been nice to come away with the win, but Princeton played slightly better than we did.”Crimson sophomore Mia Kabasakalis tore her way through the par-72, 6018-yard course, leading her team with a total score of 154, which put her in a tie for fifth. Building upon a first-day 78 with a second-day 76, she finished only four strokes behind Eva Mayr of Fairleigh Dickinson, who earned medalist honors at 150.“Mia’s been playing really well,” Rhoads said. “I’ve been expecting this kind of tournament from her any time now. She putted beautifully on greens that provided a lot of challenge for most people…and her long game was really solid as well.”Senior Emily Balmert tied for seventh with a two-birdie 75 and an 80 the next day. She chalked up the jump on her scorecard to the randomness inherent in the sport.“With golf, what’s tricky is you have to work with what you have that day,” Balmert said. “Golf is funny like that. Sometimes things work out, and sometimes they don’t. [Saturday] the ball just didn’t go in the hole as fast as I would have liked.”Freshman Christine Cho turned in another solid performance, tallying a 79-77 to end up in a tie for 12th place. Her three birdies on Saturday were highlights of the round.“The technical of her full swing is quite good; her short game is really good,” Rhoads said. “Christine made some mistakes, just like everybody else did, and still shot a good score. That’s just a good indication of an all-around game, which she has.”Cho struggled with her putting, a common complaint among her teammates. The course was aerified three weeks ago, leaving quite a few bumps on the quick greens.“I had a lot of three-putts; I missed a lot of short ones,” Cho said. “They cut [the greens] a couple of weeks ago, so they were kind of tricky.”Rounding out the top twenty was senior Ali Bode, who improved by eight strokes following a first-day 84.  Junior Claire Sheldon seemed to be off her game, tying for 36th with a total of 166. Her 77 on Friday was eclipsed by an 89 her next round, but her coach did not sound too worried about the decline.“Claire’s swinging as well as I’ve ever seen her swing; she’s putting great,” Rhoads said. “In terms of the overall structure of all the players’ games, I’m pretty happy about where we are.”Up next is the Ivy League Championships in Atlantic City, N.J., next weekend. The tournament serves as the pinnacle of the Crimson’s season, and all eyes will be on the Harvard squad as it prepares to defend its title.“We’re excited,” Balmert said. “Coming off of our win last year, we would love to do it again and prove that we really are the strongest team in the Ivy League. It’s a strong statement, but it’s our chance to back it up.”—Staff writer Dennis J. Zheng can be reached at dzheng12@college.harvard.edu.

PROVIDENCE, R.I—For most of its Ivy League schedule, the Harvard softball team has struggled to coordinate solid pitching with timely hitting, and Saturday was no exception. After its resurgent offense posted nine runs in the first game, the Crimson’s typically dominant pitching unraveled in the nightcap as Harvard and Brown split a doubleheader at Erickson Athletic Complex.The Crimson came from behind with a four-run sixth inning to take Game 1, 9-6, but the Bears responded with a breakout sixth inning of their own in the second contest, scoring seven runs with two outs and winning the game, 11-5.“We did well staying on them—they would score, we would score, never giving up, never letting down,” said rookie first baseman Whitney Shaw. “We should have prevented that runaway inning and should have just stopped the bleeding before it got bad, but we did make a good effort at the end to try to come back.”BROWN 11, HARVARD 5In a slugfest that featured a combined 20 hits and 14 walks, a pitching breakdown in the sixth gave Brown an easy victory in what had been a neck-and-neck contest.After junior Margaux Black recorded two quick outs, Bears pinch hitter Danielle Commissiong drove a double to deep center field, the first of seven straight Brown players to reach base safely. Black would give up three straight singles, one that drove home Commissiong, before yielding to co-captain and starting shortstop Bailey Vertovez.With little time to warm up, Vertovez walked a run home before allowing a 2-RBI single to Bears freshman Jackie Giovanniello.Brown rookie Kate Strobel then hit a three-run bomb to straightaway center, her second home run of the day, to break the game open, 11-4.“We just need to prevent the runaway inning, just try to hit our spots a little better,” junior pitcher Dana Roberts said.Harvard started off the top of the seventh with three straight hits, including an RBI double from Vertovez, but it was too little, too late.“This team has a lot of heart,” Roberts said. “Even in that last inning of the last game, we were down by seven but we never gave up. We kept getting hits, kept trying to string things together, so that’s a confidence boost.” The Crimson got on the board in the top of the first, as Bears starting pitcher Trish Melvin struggled to find the strike zone. With the bases loaded on two walks and a Shaw double, Melvin walked junior Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, to plate the first Harvard run.Brown got three back in the bottom of the inning off of freshman Marika Zumbro, but the Crimson battled back to take the lead, 4-3, in the top of the third.The Bears evened the score at four in the bottom of the fourth, scoring on a passed ball, to set up the game-winning rally.HARVARD 9, BROWN 6Harvard opened up the series with a first-inning run, setting the tone for a stellar afternoon for the Crimson bats. And although ace Rachel Brown didn’t have her best outing, the freshman’s complete-game effort was enough to give Harvard a crucial division win.“I thought it was really great that we came out and scored a lot of runs,” Roberts said. “We got everybody’s bats going and we had doubles all over the place, so that was really good to see.”The Crimson took the lead for good in the top of the sixth. With the bases loaded and one out, sophomore Ellen Macadam ripped a double to left-center, knocking in junior Jennifer Francis and Vertovez.Shaw then reached on a fielder’s choice, but an error by the Brown third baseman allowed Macadam and sophomore Emily Henderson to come home, making the score 8-5.“We call it being a spark in the lineup—just making sure to get on base no matter how you do it,” Shaw said. “Getting a walk, getting a hit, getting anything, just kind of keeping constant pressure on them so they’re never able to just lie back and relax.”After Brown dominated the first two innings, striking out four, the Bears took the lead with a three-run third. Harvard co-captain Hayley Bock hit a two-run homer in the top of the fourth to tie the score, but the Bears got two back in the bottom of the inning.The Crimson’s ace settled down, allowing just one run through the last three innings on a seventh-inning Strobel solo shot and letting the Harvard offense take over.With the victory, Brown moves to 13-5 on the season, and her 10 strikeouts place her second on the Crimson single-season list, just 13 behind Tasha Cupp ’98 for the all-time record.—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard softball team swept Brown in dominating fashion in yesterday afternoon’s doubleheader at the Erickson Athletic Complex.The Crimson (24-14, 10-6 Ivy) won the first game, 11-0, and the second, 12-2, to narrow Dartmouth’s lead in the Ivy League North Division standings to a single game. Harvard and the Big Green meet next weekend in a home-and-home series to decide the division title.“They were huge wins for us, because if we had split today and Dartmouth had split, as they did, we would have been two games behind, which means we would have had to win four out of four against them and now we only need to win three out of four,” freshman pitcher Rachel Brown said.  “They really were breakout games for us, and we have a lot of confidence going into next weekend.”Junior Jen Francis paced the Crimson’s offensive efforts, launching a home run in Game 1 and going 3-for-3 in Game 2. She was helped by co-captain Bailey Vertovez and sophomore Ellen Macadam, who both drove in three runs on the day.“I think everyone–our whole lineup, one through nine–was so tough,” Brown said. “I definitely would not want to be pitching to our team right now, because I have confidence. We’re really hitting our stride right now at the end of the season, which is the most important time to do it.”HARVARD 12, BROWN 2The Bears came out firing in the second game, scoring two runs in the first inning to take its first—and only—lead of the day. The Crimson made sure that the lead was short-lived, as it scored two runs of its own as its bats came alive in the second inning.“We were patient,” freshman Whitney Shaw said. “We knew we were hitting the ball, and we knew that we had to keep doing what we were doing and we weren’t going to let [Saturday’s] split get us down. We’ve been working hard to get out of our hitting slump and it just really paid off this past weekend.”Shaw got the action going when she singled to first. She was able to score off a Francis double and a single by junior Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor. Harvard’s biggest inning of the weekend came in the fourth, as Macadam hit a double with the bases loaded for two RBI, and singles by Francis and Schellberg combined for three more runs, making it a 9-2 game.The Crimson scored three more in the fifth inning to end the game early by the mercy rule. “We’ve all been working really hard to tweak our swings and work hard on our fundamentals–swinging and taking a lot of cuts,” Shaw said. “We did a good job and stuck with it and were a tough out every single time.”HARVARD 11, BROWN 0Brown and freshman Julia Moore combined efforts in the opener to pitch a two-hit shutout against the Bears. Brown, who pitched the game’s first five innings, struck out six Bears batters in her 14th win of the season.“Coming off of a rough outing from the day before, I talked with the coach and went out with a strong mental approach to approach every inning like it’s the first inning,” Brown said. “Sometimes it’s really hard when you have such a big lead. Pitching’s really a mental game, so today I felt a lot better.”Harvard got the scoring going in the fourth when Vertovez hit a double to center with two runners on base. She came home when sophomore Emily Henderson and junior Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson sports editor, followed up with successive singles. The inning ended with Harvard up, 4-0, when Shaw was walked with the bases loaded.Things just kept getting better for the Crimson, as it added three in the fifth inning and four in the sixth. And that was all Harvard needed to ensure an early ending to the game, as Moore stepped in to pitch a scoreless bottom of the sixth.—Staff writer Lucy D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Although Brown’s Spring Weekend filled the campus with excitement, the Harvard baseball team took no part in the merriment. The Crimson dropped both games in a critical Saturday twinbill against the Bears, vaulting the hosts out of a second-place tie with Harvard.Trailing Dartmouth by three games entering the weekend, the Crimson was looking to make a statement at the expense of its Ancient Eight rival, but Brown asserted itself as the stronger team, claiming victories, 3-1 and 8-5.“We just didn’t get it together today,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “We took two losses, so we’re very disappointed.”Sophomore center fielder Dillon O’Neill went 4-for-9 on the day, including a solo shot, and junior designated hitter Chris Rouches belted a two-run homer en route to three RBI in Game 2, but the Crimson struggled to find its offense and overcome early deficits.BROWN 8, HARVARD 5Following a low-scoring opening game, the Crimson took to the field for Round 2 eager to make plays and produce runs. Unfortunately for the visitors, they may have been a bit too ambitious. In the bottom of the first, a bloop single with a man aboard resulted in two Harvard errors and a Bears run, setting the tone for a difficult afternoon.“We need to cut down on mistakes,” Walsh said. “Mistakes on the mound, mistakes throwing to bases, our approach at the plate…it’s the little things that add up.”The Crimson would keep the game close throughout, finding enough offense to pound out 12 hits, including the home runs by O’Neill and Rouches. Sophomore catcher Tyler Albright also had a strong performance with three hits and an RBI, but Harvard struggled to match the timeliness of Brown’s offense, which always seemed to produce with runners in scoring position.A two-out RBI triple by Robert Papenhause and a three-run home run by leadoff man Steve Daniels off of freshman starter Brent Suter pushed the Bears’ lead to 6-1 before the Crimson began to fight back. Suter, who shouldered seven earned runs through 6.2 innings, struggled at times but settled down to keep his squad in the game. The rookie produced his best innings at the end of his outing, mixing in a big breaking ball to rack up nine strikeouts while walking only one.After Rouches collected three straight RBI in the fifth and sixth, O’Neill’s opposite field drive in the seventh brought Harvard within reach, 7-5. But Brown’s bullpen stifled the Crimson’s momentum, as Andrew Backowski and Matt Kimball combined for 2.2 innings of one-hit ball, preventing Harvard from closing the gap.BROWN 3, HARVARD 1The morning effort did not yield better results for the Crimson, as it floundered against Bears starter Mark Gormley. Harvard mustered only six hits in the contest, perhaps due to over-eager bats.“Brown’s got some good pitchers, but we were also swinging at a lot of bad pitches,” Douglas said.Other than an RBI double from Douglas in the top of the sixth, the Harvard offense did little to help rookie hurler Jonah Klees, who mirrored his afternoon counterpart by overcoming early struggles to pitch effectively.Despite walking the first two batters of the game on eight pitches and allowing a runner to reach in each of the first four innings, Klees held the Bears in check with well placed side-arm breaking balls on the inside part of the plate. The rookie yielded three earned runs and only five hits through six innings, but could not outduel Gormley.“[Gormley] was very good,” Walsh said. “He was tough and I tip my hat to him.”The hulking righty worked 6 2/3 of the game’s seven innings, allowing a run with six strikeouts and no walks.The Crimson put a scare into its hosts during the final inning, getting the tying run to second base. Rouches singled with one out before junior first baseman Dan Zailskas worked the count to 2-0 to chase Gormley. Zailskas earned a walk, and a double steal by pinch runners junior Sam Franklin and freshman J.T. Thomes gave the Crimson hope. But Kimball struck out the final two batters to pick up his first of two saves on the day.—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a disappointing Saturday afternoon, the Harvard baseball team returned to Murray Field at Brown yesterday looking to avenge a pair of ugly losses. Instead, the Crimson (10-26, 8-8 Ivy) left as befuddled as it had arrived, dropping its second twinbill in as many days and falling out of contention for the Ivy League crown.Although falling to the Bears (19-16-1, 12-4) in four consecutive games signals a dismal weekend, Harvard showed some improvement in the 3-1 and 8-1 defeats, keeping both contests competitive early on. A stellar outing from junior Dan Zailskas in the morning and three innings of no-hit pitching from rookie Conner Hulse in the nightcap gave the the Crimson hope, but the squad failed to follow Brown’s example of consistent play.“We tried to make adjustments based on what happened the day before,” captain Harry Douglas said. “But really, we didn’t make the adjustments too well. It’s just frustrating.”The once-potent offense mustered only eight hits on the day, as Harvard’s bats appeared lost against the Bears’ starters.“[The Brown pitchers] were nothing special,” freshman hurler Conner Hulse lamented. “We’ve seen better pitching all year long, but I felt like we weren’t extremely disciplined at the plate, swinging at pitches we shouldn’t have.”The Crimson struck out 12 times on the day, drawing only four walks, and failed to set up meaningful scoring opportunities. Other than RBI singles from senior right fielder Tom Stack-Babich in each game, the offense did little to help its pitchers.“You can’t blame the pitchers because the hitters haven’t produced,” Douglas said. “If we had our usual production that we have been having, we could have won today.”BROWN 8, HARVARD 1Leadoff man Dillon O’Neill walked to open the game and came around on Stack-Babich’s two-out single to give Hulse an early lead, but the Crimson offense would be dormant for the rest of the game.Harvard enjoyed a lead for the first time all weekend, and remained ahead as Hulse worked three hitless innings. But the Bears fought back to tie the contest with a two-out RBI of their own from Dan Shapiro in the fourth. A throwing error from shortstop Matt Rogers an inning later gave Brown the lead for good before Hulse came undone in the sixth.The freshman loaded the bases before yielding two singles and a double, which plated five runs for the Bears.“I felt like I started out throwing well and just fell apart,” Hulse said. “I started making mistakes, and Brown is one of the best hitting teams in the Ivy League.”The Bears showed consistency up and down the lineup, amassing 10 hits off the bats of seven different players and enjoying six RBI from the 7-8-9 spots in the order. Although freshman reliever Will Keuper held the home team to just one run in the final 2.2 innings, Harvard never threatened to catch its rivals. With three wins already under its belt on the weekend, Brown cruised to a clean sweep behind starter Will Weidig, who picked up his first victory of the season. While the Bears now have a shot to catch Dartmouth for the Rolfe Division crown, Harvard finds itself relegated to the role of spoiler, looking to end its season next weekend with stronger efforts against the Big Green.“Dartmouth has always been a pretty big rival of ours, so we’re looking to end the season on the right note,” Douglas said.BROWN 3, HARVARD 1The morning contest also began with a strong Crimson pitching performance, as Zailskas looked to spark a change for Harvard in its second twinbill. The junior starter went the distance for the Crimson, allowing three runs on eight hits and striking out two. The visitors spent the morning playing catch-up, after the Bears collected all three of their runs in the second on three singles and a sacrifice fly. Harvard responded in the fourth following a one-out double from Meehan, the team’s only extra-base hit of the game. With two outs, Stack-Babich again came through to knock home the runner and cut the deficit to 3-1.But as much as Zailskas kept Brown’s offense in check, Bears sophomore starter Conor Burke matched him pitch for pitch. The right-hander commanded the contest through 5 1/3 innings—striking out five—before a leadoff walk and wild-pitch third strike put the tying runs on base.With Stack-Babich looming in the batter’s box, the Bears turned to closer Matt Kimball, who picked up two saves on Saturday. The reliever delivered a crucial strikeout en route to 1 1/3 innings of one-hit ball. As Kimball worked towards his ninth save of the season, Harvard watched as its hopes of salvaging a weekend split evaporated.“It’s frustrating because of how big this weekend was for us,” Douglas said. “It would have been nice [to pick up wins], but things just didn’t go our way this weekend.” —Staff writer Max N.

Lead team to victory. Check. Score a career-high number of goals. Check. Uphold the family lacrosse dynasty. Check. All in a day’s work for Harvard men’s lacrosse standout, freshman Jeff Cohen.Cohen—who leads the Crimson in goals, points, shots and shots on goal—continued to make a name for himself this past Saturday during his team’s complete trouncing of the visiting Holy Cross Crusaders, 11-4. The Syosset, N.Y. native scored six goals for then-No. 17 Harvard. Cohen’s tally marked a career-best for the freshman. This offensive explosion also raised Cohen’s total for the year up to 26 goals, and helped him earn this week’s commendation of Ivy League Rookie of the Week.But for Cohen, this was just another day’s work.“We played our offense the same way we always do,” Cohen said. “I had the help of my teammates. We didn’t do anything special—we just took the same approach we do to every game.”Co-captain Max Motschwiller and the team have gotten used to this sort of outstanding play from Cohen.“[Cohen’s] capable of doing that in every single game,” Motschwiller said. “He’s great at getting the shot and then putting them in the right spot.”Cohen burst onto the collegiate lacrosse scene in the Crimson’s season opening upset over then-No. 5 Duke. The attackman filled in for pneumonia-plagued sophomore Dean Gibbons and registered a hat trick against the powerhouse Blue Devils. Cohen was awarded his first Ivy League Rookie of the Week designation for this performance.Once the freshman standout began his trek down the road to Harvard lacrosse stardom, there was no turning back. Cohen has consistently been a scoring threat for his team, netting five goals in his team’s matchup against Hartford and adding another four in the team’s heartbreaking loss to Cornell.“He’s having an unbelievable year for anybody, [so] as a freshman, what he’s doing is wild,” Motschwiller said. “As far as goal scoring, the stats speak for themselves. He’s really stepped it up and worked hard.”This past weekend was especially noteworthy for Cohen and his family. The attacker was the first Harvard player to tally six goals in one game since his brother, Greg, accomplished the task in 2007.“My brother’s always been my biggest role model,” Cohen said. “To do something Greg did is really special.”Cohen’s impressive scoring record is aided by an uncanny ability to adapt to any given situation. This past Saturday was no exception, with the attacker switching to a lower shot in response to a Holy Cross goaltending weakness.“We watched some film, and we talked to [Cohen] about some things that he could do, and he adjusted well,” Coach Tillman said after the contest against the Crusaders. “He tweaked where he was putting the ball and how he was shooting and I was impressed with that.”Despite setting the bar remarkably high for himself in his Harvard lacrosse debut, Cohen has continued to make progress over the course of the season.Cohen believes that getting to know his teammates and their style of play has been responsible for his greatest improvement—being in the right spot at the right time.“You know the way everyone’s going to move,” Cohen said. “It’s definitely a maturity thing in that regard.”Apart from Cohen’s athletic prowess, the attacker’s attitude both on and off the turf has made him a model player for coaches and teammates alike.Motschwiller notes that Cohen’s love for the game is both evident and inspiring in every situation.“[Cohen’s] the guy who’s always having a good time playing,” Motschwiller said. “He rarely ever gets down on himself or upset, [and] when he’s scoring five goals a game, he’ll still be very humble and even-keeled…It’s very refreshing.”Cohen and the Crimson will be back in action this coming Saturday against Yale in the team’s last home game of the season.—Staff writer Alexandra J.

The Harvard sailing team’s season is a marathon.It seems rather appropriate, then, that Marathon Monday takes place every year in the heart of the Crimson sailing squad’s spring schedule.With a fall season beginning at the start of the school year in early September and a spring portion finishing in early June, both the co-ed and women’s teams are faced with a rather long competition schedule. The Harvard sailors must possess great endurance in competing virtually every weekend throughout the spring, and just as the closing miles of a 26.2 mile course often prove the most crucial, the Crimson competes in its most important regattas near the end of its spring regimen. The Harvard co-ed sailing team always nears the end of its season with one goal in mind: to qualify for nationals. The squad took the first step towards that target this weekend.“Our main goal this year was to qualify for nationals and do well when we get there,” said sophomore co-ed captain Alan Palmer. “With our performance this weekend, we assured that we make it to the next round of qualifying, so we are really happy with ourselves.”Attempting to rebound from some disappointing performances in recent weeks, both the co-ed and women’s teams took to the water this past weekend throughout New England against some stiff competition in some rather stiff winds. The co-ed team competed in the New England Dinghy Championship in Chestnut Hill, Mass., placing seventh overall, while the women’s team traveled to New London, Conn. for the Women’s Wick and Shrew Trophies, and brought home a fourth place finish. While the Crimson failed to emerge victorious at either of the regattas, both squads progressed on their season-long objectives as they close in on the championship portions of their schedules.“We host the next round of qualifying for nationals, so it was really important we moved on this weekend,” Palmer said.NEW ENGLAND DINGHY CHAMPIONSHIPHarvard’s co-ed squad placed seventh overall at the New England Dinghy Championship hosted by Boston College and UMASS Boston over the weekend, earning the top-eight performance it needed to qualify for the next round of national qualifying later in the season.“Any of the top 10 teams could have placed within the top eight,” Palmer said. “So we were really pleased with our seventh-place effort.”Palmer skippered all 16 races of the A division, while senior Lauren Brants and sophomore Teddy Himler split time as crew. The Crimson earned a third-place finish in that division of racing.In the B division, Harvard placed ninth overall, as Himler and senior Jon Garrity shared skippering duties, with sophomores Grace Charles, John Stokes, and Quincy Bock taking turns as crew.“Teddy did a great job this weekend, contributing to both boats’ efforts this weekend,” Palmer said.Boston College took home the team competition trophy for the two-day affair. WOMEN’S WICK AND SHREW TROPHIESHarvard’s women’s squad took home fourth place in the team competition over the weekend at the Women’s Emily Wick/Sloop Shrew regatta hosted by the US Coast Guard Academy. Senior skipper Megan Watson teamed up with sophomore crew Meghan Wareham to place first overall in the 16 races of the A division, earning five victories over the two days of competition.“The pair of Watson and Wareham sailed consistently all weekend,” freshman crew Alex Jumper said. “Their strong performance in the A division greatly contributed to our fourth place team finish overall.”The rookie duo of skipper Emily Lambert and Jumper paired up in the B division, earning a seventh-place finish. They had two top-three finishes during the weekend of competition.While the freshmen could not match the high placing of their more experienced teammates in the A division, their performance was impressive given the fact that they have rarely been paired up in competition.“The wind was doing strange things all weekend” Jumper said. “We faced a stiff Northerly on Sunday, and Emily and I, who were one of the lighter combos, had a nice end of the day on Sunday. We will only get faster as we get used to each other and practice our different maneuvers.”The tricky winds on the weekend also provided some worthwhile practice for the Crimson, as it near their more important competitions late in the season.“It will likely be consistently windy at nationals, so we will probably test out some of our heavier combos over the next couple of weeks in preparation,” Jumper said. “This practice will hopefully help us overcome some of the better teams we face.”Squads from Yale, Boston College, and Charleston all finished ahead of Harvard on the weekend.OBERG TROPHYAlso competing this weekend was a small Crimson contingent at the Oberg Trophy in Boston. Freshman Annie DeAngelo teamed up with junior Michelle Konstadt, while sophomore Colin Santangelo paired up with freshman William White. The duos led the Crimson to a twelfth place team effort.—Staff writer Thomas D. Hutchison can be reached at tdhutch@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re as beloved and celebrated a personality as Kathy Delaney-Smith, you shouldn’t have to do much pretending. But Harvard women’s basketball’s head coach for 27 years running has a mantra that at once belies and explains her confidence: “Act As If.”A short documentary of that title, written and directed by Melissa Johnson ’00, played last night at the AMC/Loews Boston Common Theater as part of the Boston International Film Festival. The festival began last Friday and runs through this Sunday, April 26. The mantra “act as if,” a hallmark of Delaney-Smith’s coaching philosophy dating back to her first days as a head coach, focuses on the importance of carrying oneself with confidence and concealing concern from others. The coach recounted a story from the start of her coaching career, where she read about various basketball drills in her office and then directed practice, running the newly learned drills as if she had known them for years.“It’s not Xs and Os, it’s psychology,” Delaney-Smith explained. “I was fooling a lot of people early.” Johnson’s film tracks Delaney-Smith’s career from her beginnings as the head coach at Westwood (Mass.) High School and her tireless support of Title IX policies, to her success at the helm of Harvard’s program—a program that, under Delaney-Smith’s guidance, has won 11 Ivy titles and garnered the only victory by a 16-seeded team over a top-seeded team in the NCAA tournament. That win by Harvard’s 1998 squad over top-ranked Stanford—a game that Delaney-Smith admitted was “full of ‘act as if’s’”—featured prominently in Johnson’s film, complete with an ESPN interview in which Delaney-Smith compared the happiness of that day to that of her wedding day.But it had been a long and varied road until that point. Raised in Newton, Mass. as the fifth of six children in a blue-collar family, Delaney-Smith had considered Harvard another world.“There’s the perception that Harvard is a geek school, a rich school, an entitled school,” Delaney-Smith said on camera. “When I applied for the job and told my mom, there was silence on the other end.”As the 6’5 Johnson discussed the idea behind “Act As If,” the crowd didn’t need too much explanation to figure out that she spent her time at Harvard on the hardwood. But for one weekend last year at Lavietes Pavilion, she traded in her sneakers for a camera, and shadowed Delaney-Smith and her Ivy champion squad. The film includes personal interviews with seniors Emily Tay and Katie Rollins, sophomore Claire Wheeler, and several former players to highlight their experiences under Delaney-Smith’s tutelage. Many current and recent Harvard players, including outgoing co-captain Niki Finelli and 2008 captains Lindsay Hallion ’08 and Jessica Knox ’08, make cameos in game footage as well. The film also dealt briefly with Delaney-Smith’s diagnosis with breast cancer, which the coach said forced her to “call on [the ‘act as if’ mentality] the most.” She recounted a game her team was playing at Cornell, in which she was in the middle of delivering a locker room halftime speech and, as a side effect of her chemotherapy, forgot everything she had been planning to say. “I had to ‘act as if,’” she remembered on camera, “but really, I was humiliated.”The film features many anecdotes like these and, perhaps more importantly, assures the audience that hundreds more like it were left on the cutting room floor. Now that Johnson has tackled the story of her former coach, she turns her attention to a project about Tay and Rollins, and their ambition to continue their basketball careers in Europe after their June graduations.Tay said that Johnson has already compiled roughly 90 hours of rough footage featuring the two players, and admits that she has come a long way since she first told her coach that she was unwilling to be interviewed in front of the camera.“I’m very shy and don’t like being in the spotlight—I didn’t want to do it at all,” Tay recalled in a phone conversation. “[Delaney-Smith] just forced me to do it, and after [Johnson] was around for a while I felt a lot more comfortable.” “I did a lot of work to try to make her feel relaxed,” Johnson added. “She was the toughest.”While Delaney-Smith was unable to attend last night’s screening—she is recovering from back surgery—her philosophy touched every part of Johnson’s project. The footage of Delaney-Smith’s speeches on the Lavietes Pavilion sideline, coaches and players’ soft-spoken remarks in front of the camera, and the film’s own status as the artist’s fledgling idea all contribute to a short but affecting project.“If you ‘act as if,’ it becomes a reality,” Delaney-Smith said.—Staff writer Emily W. Cunningham can be reached at ecunning@fas.harvard.edu.

Sure, FlyBy admits it: Before March rolled around, "Ratatat" was an onomatopoetic way of suggesting that somebody was at the door.  Or that the old man upstairs was doing his Riverdance routine again.  You see, FlyBy's never been one of those hipster blogs.  Our jeans hang reasonably loose, the frames of our glasses are metallic and top out at only a few millimeters of thickness, and we don't look at the Top 40 with complete disdain.  That is to say, we like it when songs have words.  And when you can hear those words broadcast on radio stations that have good bandwidth and advertisements from major corporations.  So you can imagine our confusion when we typed "Ratatat" into the good old Googler a few weeks ago and found selections like this queued up for our viewing (and listening) pleasure.
"Loud Pipes." It wasn't just the fact that the title of the song sounded like a selection from our 6th grade recorder class.  No, we're an enlightened bunch and far be it from us to judge a book by its cover.  But when a book has no words—now that's a different story.  And when a song has no words—well that's a book that FlyBy doesn't want to be reading.  In our (hopelessly uncultured but humble) view, lyric-less selections are meant to be the stuff of symphonies, stoners, and stoners who occasionally listen to symphonies.  This was Yardfest, not some crappy Woodstock do-over with a tire swing, bad corndogs, and a lot less acid.  This was CEB-certified.  This was supposed to be a sure bet.  So FlyBy decided to check it out.  And...well...it was pretty much what we expected.  More after the jump.
Right, so, long story short, Ratatat is onstage, doing their thing.  There's lights going: purple, orange, red.  Smoke, too.  And a screen with some weird video clips on it.  Pretty much all the bells and whistles you'd expect somebody to have if they couldn't communicate to you in spoken syllables. An odor of marijuana in the front, there.  Very exciting.  Well, not really.  Sort of awkward, actually, for a hopelessly un-hip blog, which doesn't have time on a Sunday afternoon to get blasted out of its gourd so that it can fake like it's "feeling the music."
But others have fewer inhibitions.  Circles of people writhe, hands turned upwards, arms limp, like flower children from another decade.  Ahhhhh, sweet liberation. A pair of music lovers cavorts by us, locked in mock battle.  One shoots invisible missiles (an automatic weapon?) at the other, in time with Ratatat's pulsing guitar.  The other falls to the ground, body trembling.  His partner joins him.  Lots of rhythmic twitching.  The song ends.  A final twitch.  FlyBy thinks hard about the pros and cons of mind-altering drugs.  Ratatat begins again.  FlyBy leaves.

We know what many of you are thinking. Harvard has cheerleaders? And even for those of you who have been to a basketball or football game and seen them in action, how many knew that this bubbly club J.V. team is a fully-fledged Division I large co-ed squad? That’s right, and you know what else is probably news? They’re good. Actually, really good.
Over the weekend of April 9-12, this year’s squad became the first group of Crimson cheerleaders to make it the NCA/NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championships in Daytona, Fla., after painstaking fundraising and tireless practice.
Click here and search for Harvard to see the squad in action at the preliminaries, but to hear more about their trip and what it means to the program, read on after the jump.
Having never qualified for nationals, Harvard cheerleaders spent three months putting together a video showcasing their mad skills to the NCA. If your only experience with cheerleading is Bring It On, then you’re all set. That is EXACTLY what college cheerleading looks like. Tumbling, flipping, and stacking human bodies into giant pyramids are all routine for these peppy athletes and Harvard proved itself worthy of a national stage. But, the team also had to face harsh reality: the best trip of their cheering lives would cost a whopping $20,000, sparking a fundraising marathon.
“Once we found out we had gotten a spot at nationals, we had to ramp it up,” tri-captain Lucas Toffoli said. “We contacted alums, held fundraising events, applied for grants…some people on the team even went to do dormcrew to get a little extra money.”
For a great underdog story, FlyBy should tell you that the Crimson sparkled in its nationals debut, trouncing more seasoned squads on its way to the medal stand. Instead, it acted how any group would in the face of exciting new surroundings: the squad ran out onto the mat for preliminaries and got nervous.
“It was so different from any other competition,” tri-captain Devin Hein said. “There were flashing lights and the room was packed. But right after we took the floor for the first time it clicked for everybody and we saw what it meant to be a nationally competitive squad.”
While early jitters hurt its performance and kept Harvard from reaching the finals, the Crimson got another shot to show what it could do in the “challenger’s cup.” Demonstrating its newfound perspective, Harvard nailed its routine the second time around, scoring 9.8 out of 11 in the pyramid section.
Even if the squad isn’t ready yet to take home hardware, the captains recognized the importance of the opportunity to compete.
“It was the pinnacle of our season,” Toffoli said. “We got to showcase our routine and let people know that Harvard does indeed have a cheerleading team that is serious about what we do. It was also a really great experience for bringing the team together.”
Considering the tremendous experience for all involved, Hein insists that the team will be back in Daytona next year and that the question is only, “Can we bring something new?”
Let’s hope the rest of the squad is just as enthusiastic about this goal, because after all, it’s not a democracy, it’s a cheerocracy.

You’d be surprised at what can happen when you spend two hours a hotel suite. In the Kirkland House Drama Society’s production of Suites—based on a collection of Neil Simon plays—four sets of characters love, fight, and forgive in four different storylines that all take place in a hotel suite. Alcohol flows, expletives fly, and arguments rage—check out all the drama (and a surprise cross-dressing guest star) after the jump.
The first act, which takes place in a Los Angeles hotel suite, tells the story of a man, Marvin (Mark Isaacson '11), who has to hide a sleeping hooker (Krystal Cantos '11) from his wife Millie (Alison Schumer '11). FlyBy thought Isaacson’s Marvin was a bit of a ham, but his exchanges with Cantos were often sharply funny. One of our favorite moments: when he tells her, “I love you,” she quips, “Please, not in front of the hooker.”
The second act spotlights two sets of preppy couples who are supposedly friends but are constantly fighting during their vacation together. Far more action-packed and funny than the first act, FlyBy especially loved the Asian jokes and the possibly sexual double entendres. Watch a clip from Lisa Rosenfeld '09, Hannah Frank '09, Andy Choi '10 and Loren Amor’s '10 (who is also a Crimson sports chair) performance below.

The third act is about Diana (Kelly Quinlan '11), a television executive who meets up again with her gay British ex-husband Sidney (Kenneth Saathoff ’09), only to find out that he is dying of lung cancer and is requesting her to support his lover financially. FlyBy has to admit that we're completely smitten with Saathoff’s Sidney, who totally stole the show.
The final act involves a couple trying to coax their soon-to-be-married daughter, who suddenly has cold feet, out of the bathroom on the morning of her wedding day. Ernest Fontes plays a very convincing mother, but the best cross-dressing performance without a doubt comes from Kirkland House Master Tom Conley.

Hey there, space cadets, we at FlyBy just thought we'd wish you a happy 4/20 (4:20). While Harvard has a devastating lack of smoker solidarity, we still love walking by certain finals clubs on Mt. Auburn, where members apparently let skunks loose all over the place to mark this occasion, or stopping to appreciate the glorious smell of dirty laundry as we saunter along the river. What we're trying to tell you here, is that we salute you, you little stoners.
Check after the jump for some 4/20 dos and don'ts. Or don't, since you're probably pretty apathetic and confused right now. Whatever you're into maaaaannnnn.

FlyBy was feeling hungry and a little blue after checking out today's dinner menu on HUDS website.
Beef Fajita Fettuccini--from the beef fajitas at Yardfest?
Garlic Chicken--from the grilled chicken at Yardfest?
Polenta with Grilled Veggies--from the grilled veggies at Yardfest?
Yum.
To cure our tummy rumbles, we decided to head over to the Square for a little midday snack and discovered a few promotions you might want to check out.
Tomorrow, Dunkin Donuts will have "Iced Coffee Day," where you can get a 16 oz iced coffee for only $0.50. And you can feel good about your purchase because "10% of the purchase price" benefits Homes for Our Troops, an organization that builds handicap accessible homes for severely wounded veterans. Wait, that's only $0.05...okay, so don't feel too good about your generous philanthropy.
If you are feeling really ambitious tomorrow, you can take that iced coffee right on over to Ben and Jerry's in the Garage, and get a FREE scoop of ice cream from noon-8pm. You'll be glad you brought that coffee with you while you wait, because sales associates at Ben and Jerry's say that the line for this annual event is usually out the door.
Now if you are really shameless (come on, we know you secretly hoard plastic silverware from Greenhouse and tea bags from the [insert your dining hall here] in your desk drawer), then you will mark your calendar because Wednesday, April 29 from 5pm-10pm is $0.31 scoop night at Baskin Robbins.

Hey Harvard, what did you do today? Catch your friend crossing the finish line of the Boston Marathon?  Go to Fenway to watch the Sox crush the Orioles 12-1?  Celebrate 4/20 in style?  No, you didn’t do any of those things.  Instead of being allowed to join in today’s festivities with every other college in the Boston area, you were in class.
We know; FlyBy is pretty pissed too.  Apparently Patriots’ Day doesn’t qualify as a real holiday in the eyes of the administration.  What could be a better reason for a day off than commemorating the first battles of the Revolutionary War at Lexington and Concord?
And no, next year’s calendar change does not recognize the right of Harvard students to get their patriotism on on the third Monday of April.  Thanks, administration.
