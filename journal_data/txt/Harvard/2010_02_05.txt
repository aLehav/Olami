After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just days ago, the State of the Union address reassured Americans that the President would do what he could to “finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.” Now, the nation’s top two defense officials have thankfully set in motion a campaign to repeal the infamous “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” law, 16 years after its institution. While long overdue, the move to repeal this law—an insult to many Americans and an embarrassment to all—is both a welcome and a necessary step in the pursuit of civil equality.
Although it is certainly true that barriers against gay Americans no longer exist in many aspects of contemporary society, an attempt to change the military’s stance on differing sexual orientation is a particularly significant step. While the military—which integrated blacks in World War II long before federal law ever did—seems recently to have forgotten the progressive elements of its history, the geographic diversity represented in the armed forces will make the eventual repeal of DADT an especially effective move. There are few organizations that simulate a more accurate picture of this country’s socioeconomic and regional gradations better than the military. If homosexuality is no longer nominally prohibited among such a diverse group of individuals, the same tolerance of gay Americans can better spread to those segments of the U.S. population unrepresented by the outspoken elites in both major political parties.
Moreover, removing DADT will not be an ephemeral change; the authoritative structure of the military—in which those who serve share a sense of duty with a common cause and clearly delineated hierarchy—will ensure the longevity of this essential step toward a more equal America. Among the best ways to inspire tolerance against bigotry is through an immediate personal relationship, and we feel that homophobia in the military will begin to dissipate as soon as soldiers realize that some of their companions—the ones they have sworn to protect—are homosexual. When they see that their comrades are the same in every way except for their newly announced sexual orientation, hopefully they will become more accepting of homosexuality.
Naturally, the repeal of DADT raises some important questions as to its implementation. For instance, the current discriminatory policy cannot merely be abolished. It must be abolished in conjunction with the establishment of a cultural and education program that will ensure that any current military prejudice is removed from more than just the annals of federal law. It is one thing to make a nominal change and another to make a real one. To prevent the persistence of vestigial homophobia, soldiers at all levels and of all genders must be encouraged to participate in conversations about the meaning of sexual orientation in the private and public aspects of human life.
Naturally, such measures should occur while are soldiers are at home in basic training—a new policy with so much potential for controversy should not be instated while troops are in combat. That said, we do not wish to pass judgment on how and where soldiers should reveal their sexual orientation, if they choose to at all; we merely maintain that the military’s emphasis on such a broad integration should occur in an environment that is less emotionally taxing than combat.
An important counter-argument many have made against the repeal of DADT is that it will create unbridled unrest in the military. And while some of these arguments are not as influenced by homophobia as the certain ideological camps often make them out to be, they are still beside the point. After all, the repeal of DADT will not force every homosexual soldier to reveal his or her sexual orientation to fellow comrades; individuals can choose to “come out” on their own time, iand on their own terms. It is as misguided to worry about every homosexual in the military coming out simultaneously as it is irrelevant.
Another common objection to DADT’s repeal is the nebulous claim that there are more pressing issues to be addressed in contemporary American society other than the official integration of homosexuals into the armed forces. In other words, now is not the time to deal with such an issue, which lacks the urgency of the economic crisis, healthcare, the war in Afghanistan, and the continued threat of terrorism. In reality, however, there will always be something that arguably outweighs the repeal of DADT in terms of importance, and the presence of these other issues in no way diminishes the pressing need to abolish this anachronistic form of discrimination, which has no place in the world of today, much less the United States. Just as the Civil Rights movement, for instance, was not deterred by the “heavier issue” of the Vietnam War and the ensuing civil unrest, so too the repeal of DADT must not be derailed by the existence of other important problems.
But, most importantly, erasing DADT from federal law will do much to allow homosexual soldiers—and homosexuals in general—to be viewed in the heroic and patriotic light they deserve as dutiful American citizens.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The new semester is upon us; new classes, new notebooks, new opportunities. The stress of the end of the fall semester has been abated, and Harvard students are looking forward to a fresh start. Ambitions are high, and the concept of taking that fifth class seems all too doable. However, it will be only a matter of time until the stress of problem sets and midterm exams build up. The typical Harvard student reacts to the stress by working even harder, pulling all nighters in Lamont, or doing painful cram sessions. However, this semester, students might find that the key to surviving the stressful times can be found on a MAC treadmill, rather than a Widener carousel.
The relationship between body and mind is no secret; a healthy body produces a healthy mind. Therefore, during periods of high stress, such as midterm seasons and reading week, Harvard students need to spend more time doing physical activity. While the physical benefits of exercise are more or less widely know, it is easy to overlook the mental benefits.
According to research done at University of Colorado at Boulder, exercise has been proven to prevent the development of depression anxiety, among other stress-related disorders. In the experiment, lab rats were exposed to a stressor, and those that had been allowed to exercise had increased levels of serotonin, the chemical that regulates mood, and were shown to be less anxious and stressed than the rats that were not allowed to exercise. Exercise, in a sense, is a natural antidepressant. Other scientific research has also shown that exercise increases the development and maintenance of brain cells, as well as the hippocampus, the part of the brain necessary for memory.
If staying happy and sharp wasn’t enough reason to exercise, Harvard students should be aware of the benefit to their immune system. Moderate exercise has also proven to increase immunity. According to Mary P. Miles, Ph.D., an associate professor of exercise sciences at Montana State University, the risk of being infected with the flu virus or a cold will drop with moderate exercise. Another study, done at Appalachian State, found that those who walked at moderate pace for 40 minutes a day reported half the number of sick days taken off from work than those who didn’t exercise at all. It is still cold in Cambridge, so the flu is still a threat on campus, and it seems that regular exercise is key to staying in the classroom and out of University Health Services.
This research should also be a wake-up call for Harvard’s administrators. There are no real outlets or motivators for students to get active, especially toward the end of semesters when intramurals have ended. There are gym classes, but only those who are very self-motivated attend those. In many liberal arts colleges across the nation, there is a physical educational requirement. Although Harvard does not necessarily need to add such a requirement, it might be time to offer outlets for exercise, such creating and facilitating student run groups, keeping gyms open later, and longer intramural periods.
This semester, Harvard students should rethink their exercise habits and how they could be affecting their mental health. An hour at the gym might be as good as an hour at the library, in terms of mental preparation. The health benefits are so great that students ought to engage in some sort of exercise regularly, and the University should help motivate students to do so as well. Hopefully there will be more students jogging along the Charles from now on and less cooped up in the Widener dungeon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dead men tell no lies: I’m more confident of this than I am that Harvard’s concentration policies benefit us. In fact, it’s because I trust the opinion of the not-so-recently deceased that I think that the rules regarding what students can study have to change. Take Aristotle, for example. In a head to head-to-head match, Aristotle’s educational approach proves more conducive to students’ pursuit of their educational goals than that of the Harvard Registrar’s Office.
In one corner, we have the Harvard Registrar informing us that:“All degree candidates must fulfill the requirements of one of the recognized fields of concentration, an approved joint concentration, or an approved special concentration.” Want to major in art history and English? First, have a thesis in mind. Petition both departments, and you might get approved. You’d like to concentrate in economics and mathematics, you say? Transfer to Columbia.
While the administration has good reason to be wary of students taking on excessive course loads, students who desire to study two subjects and who are prepared to handle the work should be allowed to do so. Objectors might reasonably point to the existence of secondary fields, but this response is less than satisfying. Secondary fields are meant to provide the opportunity for guided work in a field outside of the concentration, not to unite two fields in the same way a joint concentration would.
Yet declaring a joint concentration requires an approval process that is unnecessarily difficult—art history and English as a pairing should be considered as intellectually worthwhile as English alone. The College’s approval process sends the message that studying two fields is inherently more suspect than studying one. Even worse, some fields, such as economics, apparently have no way to integrate with other subject areas—or so the College would have us think.
A student should be allowed to pursue two fields even if they do not form a unified thesis. The point of education is to learn, not just to write a thesis. The Freshman Dean’s Office tells first-year students that “your choice of concentration should be based on your intellectual interests.” What, then, are students to do when their intellectual interests combine two disparate fields, such as art history and engineering sciences? Yes, these students can pursue a secondary field. But their desire to pursue more than six courses should be recognized by the College as if their interests, in the Registrar’s words, constituted “an undergraduate concentration offered in its own right”.
Such rhetoric does students a disservice by indicating that their interests require a bureaucratic seal of approval because of their unusual nature. Instead, the process for declaring a concentration should include a provision in which all concentrations offer pre-approved ways to combine their field with any other field. That way, these students can have a sanctioned progression of courses that can simply be filled in their plan of study.
When students learn for learning’s sake through a dual major, they find support from Aristotle. The famed Greek philosopher notes that as long as education is meant to further our ability to “act with understanding,” students should pursue it. That means majors, double majors, and nearly every other type of academic classification should be treated as equally worthwhile.
What should Harvard administrators learn from this long-dead thinker? College policies should allow students to be students: to study without rigid barriers to concentration choice. Even for those who happen to like art history and engineering sciences, the College’s attitude should not begin with the assumption that the unusual is aberrant.
Restrictions on combining certain fields with others should also be removed. For example, the art of household management, Aristotle’s version of economics, is studied as an integral part of quite a few disciplines; in fact, “all other pursuits that involve the acquisition of what is necessary for life.” A broader interdisciplinary approach towards economics couldn’t be found even in Social Analysis 10.
Most importantly, Aristotle’s notion of school as leisure should remind us that a thesis need not be required in order for us to study what we want. If students’ education, as the FDO rightly notes, ought to answer the question, “What do you want to learn?” then the College should establish concentration policies that give primacy to our answers to this question—not to a thesis or the interrelatedness of the multiple answers we might well give.
Aristotle: 1. Registrar’s Office: 0.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Space Age began on Oct. 04, 1957. It ended on Feb. 01, 2010.
On that day, President Obama announced his inexplicable decision to ‘realign’—read “scrap”—NASA’s mission to replace the space shuttle and return humans to the Moon by 2020, in his fiscal year 2011 budget.
It’s baffling because the cancellation of the Constellation moon program is tantamount to taking the nine billion dollars already spent on the program over six years and setting it on fire. It’s baffling because the decision will eliminate thousands of jobs—this comes days after the President said in the State of the Union, “jobs must be our number one focus in 2010.” It’s baffling because the decision could not have been made to save money, since the proposal actually increases NASA’s budget, even though the President announced days ago, “we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years”.
Obama probably didn’t make the move to boost his image as a unifier, although it’s certainly had that effect: the new plan faces virtually unanimous bipartisan opposition across the Senate and the House. “Simply unacceptable,” said one Democratic Congresswoman; “[a] death march for the future of U.S. human space flight” a Republican Senator added. A former NASA administrator compared it unfavorably to a similar decision made by Richard Nixon, labeling it, “one of the most…strategically bankrupt…decisions in human history.” This is what you get when you try to destroy a program that has had nearly unanimous support in two Congresses: one controlled by Republicans and one led by Democrats. It passed in the latter by a vote of 409 to 15 in 2008.
Obama claims to have scuttled Constellation in order to replace it with a partially privatized space program. But this is Washington doublespeak at its worst and nothing less than a cover for doing away with the program. Like national defense and fire departments, space exploration is at present a public good, optimally undertaken by governments. The private space industry has a very important role to play but it cannot and should not replace the role of government—the two are synergistic.
The real problem with the decision is that it undermines the strength of the nation’s economic and technological leadership. To understand this, we can invoke the words of a key Democrat who has previously given eloquent speeches in support of the Constellation program—Barack Obama.
“...[My staffers were] talking about delaying…Constellation… I told my staff we’re going to find an entirely different offset,” Obama said in Aug. 2008. Obama cited Constellation as a specific example of how his administration would be more “pro-science” than Bush, with one campaign press release stating he would, “support the development of this vital [program].”
“I still remember sitting on my grandfather’s shoulders as some of the [moon] astronauts [returned]…[he said] this is what America’s all about, we can do anything when we put our mind to it,” President Obama reminisced. “And that was what the space program described, that sense of possibility and always reaching out to new frontiers.” Apparently today’s American youth don’t need this sense anymore. The power of space exploration, however, is quite clear to China and India, who will now gladly take this opportunity to land their own astronauts on the Moon or Mars well before the US is capable of doing so.
Yielding the lead in space exploration to other nations doesn’t just look bad on television—it also has serious long-term repercussions for the nation. Space exploration has long been the source of many of the nation’s most capable engineers and scientists, and it is difficult to see how this decision will inspire more students to study math and science. This comes at a time when U.S. Ph.D.s in science and math are at historic lows (as President Obama has also pointed out). This is not just hyperbole; among those who have cited the Apollo program as their inspiration to go into science and technology are Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (who now runs a space company). Imagine today’s world without these individuals, not to mention the many thousands of others who were inspired by Apollo, and one gets a sense of the devastation Obama’s decision can wreak on our economic and cultural future.
A healthy and robust space program generates not just national esteem and extraordinary people but other developments as well, including the discovery of global warming, smoke detectors, and bar codes. And if one takes a long-term view of civilization, human expansion in our solar system is as inevitable as the journeys made across the Atlantic Ocean that ended in the New World. The solar system as a whole has land and resources equivalent to millions of Earths—to simply ignore it would be unimaginably shortsighted. The Moon alone, for instance, has enough fusion fuel to provide totally clean electricity for centuries.
NASA’s Constellation program to return to the Moon and proceed onward to Mars is exactly the kind of mission that NASA does best and it has great benefits for both the world and the United States. By eliminating this program, President Obama will cause serious long-term damage to American leadership in science, technology, and economic prowess.

The English department will welcome two new professors from Columbia University and grant tenure to one of its current associate professors.
Amanda J. Claybaugh, an expert from Columbia on 19th-century novels, will join the English and American Literature and Languages Department as a professor next fall, according to a press release from Tuesday.
The department will also add Martin Puchner, a co-chair of Columbia University’s Ph.D. theater program, and Harvard associate professor of English Stephen L. Burt as full professors, according to English Department Chair James T. Engell ’73.
Claybaugh, who is currently an associate professor at Columbia University, received her Ph.D. from Harvard in 2001 and was a visiting professor at Harvard in 2007 and 2008. Claybaugh—who is currently on leave abroad—said in an e-mail that she was excited by the changes in concentration requirements within the English department, which are moving “away from ‘Brit Lit’ and ‘US Lit’ and toward courses that follow literary works as they cross national boundaries.”
While no final decisions regarding class curricula have been made, Claybaugh hopes to teach a survey of the bildungsroman—which translates to “novel of education”—around the world.
“The genre [bildungsroman] entails much more than that,” Claybaugh wrote. “The genre asks what it means for a young man or woman to take his or her place in society, and so it explores the kinds of compromises and accommodations that society requires.”
Claybaugh also said that she values challenges from students. “For me, the best moment in a semester comes when the students start arguing with me—I think of it as my responsibility, at the beginning of each course, to establish a useful framework for literary analysis,” she wrote. “Arguing with the framework shows that [students are] really thinking for themselves.”
Puchner, who is also from Columbia and also on leave, will teach courses in modern drama and theater. He attended Harvard Summer School in the late 1980s and received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1998. In an e-mailed statement, Puchner wrote that he was “excited to be back for good.”
Puchner’s appointment is part of a long-term effort to strengthen the drama offerings in the English Department, according to Engell.
“I would like to build bridges to [Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club] and the [American Repertory Theater], especially since Harvard is moving to give the arts, including theater, a more important place,” Puchner wrote. “When I teach drama, it’s important to me to convey what happens when a dramatic text is performed on stage: it’s a thrilling but also mysterious process...” he added.
Associate professor Stephen L. Burt is well known among English students for his unique course on science fiction. His recent book “Close Calls with Nonsense: Reading New Poetry” was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award.
“When people are laudatory of professors they tend to say he had a passion for the subject, but I dont think I could say that with enough emphasis,” said Alexander J. Pease ’10, who took Burt’s class last semester. “That’s truly how Professor Burt comes across, you could tell how much the subject meant to him.”

Yale President Richard C. Levin announced Wednesday a new round of sweeping budget cuts as part of the university's ongoing efforts to close a $150 million budget deficit.
In a letter to the community, Levin called for salary freezes for top administrators and a 2 percent cap on salary increases for faculty and staff. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will take a 10 to 15 percent reduction in the number of accepted students, and funding for research and undergraduate study abroad programs will also be affected.
Levin cautioned that despite improved market conditions, the university must absorb cuts to core academic programs to close the budgetary gap for “the next and subsequent years.”
The proposed cuts, when combined with a previously announced slowdown in campus construction, will bring the deficit down to $100 million, Levin wrote.
Levin assured that Yale would continue its commitment to keep staff layoffs to a minimum.
“We are, of course, hoping to keep staff reductions as low as possible, but some will be necessary,” Levin wrote.
Geoffrey Little—a spokesman for the Yale University Library, which chose to cut its collections budget rather than lay off employees last year—said that top administrators had painted a grim outlook during a series of town hall meetings in early December.
“This was not a surprise,” Little said, adding that he expects further cuts in the collections budget this year.
The announcement came a day after Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith updated the Faculty with a more positive financial outlook—FAS had exceeded its expectations and cut its own deficit from $110 million in September down to $80 million.
Smith reiterated plans announced in December to unfreeze staff and faculty salaries and avoid cuts in library funding.
Last academic year, Yale took cost-cutting measures similar those FAS implemented, such as slowing faculty recruitment and freezing non-essential staff hiring.
In planning for the fiscal year ending in 2009, FAS Spokesman Jeff A. Neal wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson that FAS dealt with the financial crisis by reacting quickly with steep budgetary reductions.
“That work,” Neal wrote, “along with a realigned focus on current use gifts, has enabled us to emerge sooner and stronger than might have occurred otherwise.”

More than 170 years ago, then-President of Harvard University Josiah Quincy III, class of 1790, gave new meaning to the concept of “zero tolerance.” The namesake of Harvard’s own Quincy House shocked students and faculty alike when he expelled the College’s entire sophomore class in May of 1834.
Many Quincy House residents learned this notorious history for the first time yesterday evening at Josiah’s 238th birthday celebration in Quincy dining hall. Cake, a history lesson from House Master Lee Gehrke, and a rousing chorus of “Happy Birthday” colored the celebration.
Quincy was a statesman in the Massachusetts legislature, Mayor of Boston, the founder of Quincy Market, and the 15th president of Harvard.
Gehrke mentioned that during Quincy’s time in the House of Representatives, he tried to have President Thomas Jefferson impeached. The movement failed by a vote of 171-1.
His reign at Harvard was not much more successful.
“Like the Obama Administration, Quincy inherited a lot of problems,” Gehrke said to the buzzing dining hall.
Gehrke said many local clergymen felt Harvard had become a place for “unruly, lazy, immoral young men,” a description which elicited cheers and whistles from the crowd.
“Of the approximately 250 men in the college in 1821, 26 of them were diagnosed as having a venereal disease,” Gehrke said. “Quincy was determined to do something about this.”
Quincy’s crackdown involved threatening to expel a freshman whose primary offense was refusing to do his Greek homework. In defiance, the student left Harvard.
Quincy then expelled a student who sophomores suspected was dismissed because he was a southerner, Gehrke said. Juniors proceeded to burn an effigy of Quincy in Harvard Yard a few weeks before commencement.
That was the last straw for Quincy: he dismissed seven freshmen, one junior, seven seniors—and the entire sophomore class.
“People in the development office at the time must have been horrified,” Gehrke said. “To think of losing all that donor money in years to come.”
Several sophomores admitted they were ignorant of Quincy’s colorful past until last night.
“It’s funny to remember that each house was a person, and each house has a history,” Quincy resident Daniel F. Selgrade ’12 said.
Other residents listen eagerly every year.
“Josiah Quincy has this spirit about him and every single person who lives in this House feels it,” said Quincy resident Honor S. W. McGee ’10. “He took a stand and said ‘get your act together,’ and so we proudly eat cake and celebrate his life.”

The Harvard Financial Analysts Club is in the final stages of negotiation for a contract that would grant the club $100,000 dollars to use in its new Cleantech Investment Fund.
Under the tentative conditions of the current contract, the team of Cleantech Investment researchers, led by Samir Patel ’12, will submit potential investment proposals for final approval to prominent businessman Peter van Stolk, who is providing the funding.
Patel said that the fund will target a variety of different clean technology investments, though not necessarily research.
Lukas W. Roots ’11­­, co-president of HFAC and a member of the Crimson IT Board, said that the grant will be used for investments with a two to four year time frame.
Unlike HFAC’s current $32,000 equity fund, the new grant will allow members to make investments in any class of assets, according to Roots.
“From our perspective, one of the major advantages of this fund is that it provides HFAC the opportunity to teach its members about bonds, derivatives and other investments, which we couldn’t do with the current fund,” Roots said.
Roots added that HFAC will keep a percentage of the profits from their
investments, to be determined by their final contract.
Simon Pickup, a former member of the Jones Soda Youth Advisory Board and an associate of van Stolk, approached HFAC last fall with a proposition to start the Cleantech Investment Fund, according to Patel.
Roots said that former HFAC President Tracey C. Shi ’10 and current co-president Prateek Kumar ’11 began negotiations with van Stolk last November.
“This allows us a new opportunity to develop investment strategies based on what has been learned not only in our Comp process but also in lecture halls,” wrote Patel in an e-mailed statement. “The degree of independence in this venture will provide HFAC members with a great financial experience.”
According to Roots, the Cleantech Investment Fund will also be larger than the funds managed by other Harvard finance and investment clubs.
HFAC members said the fund will be operational in the near future, though they refused to disclose further details due to their confidentiality policy.
Van Stolk’s grant will last for one year according to the terms of the contract, but will be renegotiated each year.
Van Stolk could not be reached for comment.

The anxiety of recruiting season has descended upon the campus, but a networking event organized by the Office of Career Services yesterday sought to dispel the pressure to find the perfect job immediately after graduation and encouraged students to keep an open mind when considering career options.
Over one hundred students attended the workshop, which included a panel event and a networking session during which students met with alumni who were on campus for a leadership conference.
“The point was to offer students a safe environment to practice networking with alumni who really do want to help them learn,” said OCS Associate Director Susan M. Vacca ’76.
The six alumni panelists boasted a diverse array of undergraduate concentrations, interests, and professional background—ranging from public service to law—but they offered similar advice for students seeking to enter the job market.
“I encourage you to consider the notion of whether you’re really taking a risk,” said Thomas H. Mattox ’82, the panel’s moderator and managing director at Lancaster Street Partners, a real estate firm. “You’re going to have your Harvard degree to fall back on and a community to support you.”
Echoing Mattox’s sentiment, OCS Director Robin E. Mount emphasized the strength of the Harvard community in times of need: “Last year, when the economy was really deteriorating, a lot of alumni approached us and offered to help,” she said following the event.
The panelists at “[Making Sure You Have A] Life After Harvard” also offered some practical tips for interviewing and networking.
Ellen G. Reeves ’83, the Harvard Alumni Association’s vice-president of engagement and marketing and a frequent public speaker, said students should recognize their individual aspirations and be straightforward and honest during networking events.
“Make it easy for others to help you,” Reeves said. “God might help people who help themselves, but people love to help people who help them to help them.”
Alexandra T. Monti, the Harvard Alumni Association senior class coordinator, said undergraduate attendance at the event was split relatively evenly among the four classes.“This just goes to show that the theme of the panel was something all students could relate to,” Monti said.
Neagheen Homaifar ’10, who attended the event—co-sponsored by the Harvard Club of New York Foundation, HAA, and OCS—acknowledged that recruiting can be a stressful process.
“This panel, if held last semester, would have been so helpful,” Homaifar added. “[The panelists’] wisdom and their idea of viewing failure as another opportunity to gain skills would have really helped.”

The Committee on Student Life reflected on the College’s inaugural January Term yesterday at the first meeting of the semester and contemplated possible minor improvements for 2011.
The 18-member committee—comprised of Undergraduate Council members, House Masters, and College administrators—concluded that the break offered students unique opportunities for reconnecting with friends and family, recharging for the spring, and pursuing productive endeavors.
“Getting home was really nice after the intense fall,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
Much of yesterday’s discussion centered around how to better allocate resources to students who choose to stay on campus during January, based on the committee members’ personal observations of this J-Term.
For example, undergraduate use of the libraries—all of which remained open over break—was minimal, and Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis suggested that if thesis writers on campus were not using the libraries, the College’s financial resources could be redirected elsewhere.
Another improvement proposed was keeping the Malkin Athletic Center open instead of just the smaller Hemenway Gymnasium and the Quad Recreational Athletic Center.
A few committee members suggested providing more structured January programming, similar to MIT’s four-week January “Independent Activities Period,” though it seemed unlikely the College would undertake such a project in the current fiscal climate.
“In this era of budget cuts, I can’t imagine we’re going to build a whole new program on campus,” Dingman said, expressing uncertainty about “how we’re going to pay for it without sacrificing other things.”
But UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said that the College could provide more support with helping students take advantage of their J-Term
The Office of International Programs, for example, did not offer funding opportunities for this year’s J-Term.
During yesterday’s meeting, the committee also expressed general support for Crimson Cable, a student-run organization founded in 2006 by Nicholas J. Castine ’10, to offer television service to all undergraduates through Harvard Student Agencies—provided that the cable service would not slow down Harvard’s network.
Christakis, however, expressed concern about the “intellectual and social consequences” of allowing students to watch a large amount of television.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A portrait of renowned government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 smiles benignly alongside a portrait of staff member Medardo A. Landaverde and 26 other portraits as part of an exhibit launched yesterday in CGIS South.
This collection of 30 total portraits—two more paintings will soon join the exhibit—is housed in the basement of CGIS South and is part of the building’s efforts to promote the arts.
CGIS Art Board Associate Bettina K. Burch, who painted all the portraits over the course of three years, called the exhibit a “democratic representation” of the members of the CGIS community.
“I went to the various departments and centers to find people from different backgrounds,” Burch said. “I presented them so that they’re all on the same level and without any gilt frame, so you just see the faces, in their own element.”
Burch said that she arranged the portraits in the exhibit not by the subject’s department or position within the University but by pure “aesthetic,” in order to maintain “a diverse representation near each other.”
“There’s no hierarchical representation,” she added.
Each of the portraits in the exhibit features its subject posing with a distinct expression and hand motion, gestures that Burch said embody the subject’s personality.
As an Art Board Associate at CGIS, Burch is responsible for the maintenance of the artwork in both CGIS buildings.
After working hard to fill the basement with beauty for many years, Burch “shyly but insistently” requested to have a space of her own, according to Steven B. Bloomfield ’77, executive director of the Weatherhead Center of International Affairs who spoke at the exhibit launch.
Landaverde said he thought Burch was joking when she told him that she wanted to paint a portrait of him.
“I mean, I was really touched that she took the time to make portraits of us staff guys as well,” Landaverde said.
Matthew P. Stec, the manager of facilities in the CGIS buildings, said he admired the goals of the exhibition.
“I think it’s a great way to build a community—she’s represented a great cross-section of CGIS,” he said.
“I think that she really captured people’s personalities,” said Stephen E. Coady, assistant director at the International Quantitative Social Sciences and also a subject of one of Burch’s portraits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One quarter is the perfect sample size. For instance, the first bite of a burrito is often disappointingly lopsided—too much tortilla and sauce (unless, of course, you start eating your burrito from the middle—can’t say that I’ve tried that). But one quarter of a burrito unleashes the truest blend of delicious flavor and texture.
Similarly, at exactly one quarter of the way through the conference schedule, a clearer picture of the Ivy League is beginning to emerge.
At the top in a class by itself, Cornell reigns as the league’s Qdoba. Last weekend’s 36-point blowout win over the Crimson demonstrated as much. Seeing as two of Cornell’s three losses came against Syracuse and Kansas, the recipe for beating the Big Red seems to be nothing short of playing like a top-five team. Coaches around college basketball have taken notice, honoring Cornell by ranking it 25th in the nation, the first time an Ivy team has cracked a poll since the Tigers reached 8th in 1998.
Harvard and Princeton belong in the next division with Chipotle. The two teams have shown that, while capable of competing with anyone, they are not invulnerable to struggles. Last week, on the biggest stage it’s seen in years, the Crimson showed a surprising lack of poise, turning the ball over 25 times, getting into foul trouble, and giving up 14 offensive rebounds. The Tigers too have some clunkers on their resume, including a 27-turnover loss at home to Army, and a road defeat to Rutgers, a game in which Princeton shot 28.8 percent from the floor.
After Harvard and Princeton comes a dramatic drop-off. Brown, Columbia, and Yale—the Felipe’s of the Ivy League—all have either seven or eight wins, but only two of those 22 victories have come against teams with winning records. They might be able to steal a win or two against teams in the tier above them, but as the Bears’ loss to the Quakers last weekend demonstrates, they are just as likely to lose to the Ivy’s cellar dwellers.
Which brings us to the bottom of the league. In terms of burritos, Dartmouth and Penn are like 7-Eleven or a T station—the place that’s probably violating health codes (though you’d rather not know for sure). Yet, each team has shown flashes of competence lately. The Big Green has challenged both Harvard and Columbia for a full 40 minutes, and, improbably, the Quakers defeated Brown in Providence on a controversial tip-in at the buzzer.
Penn’s win goes to show that although the league hierarchy is taking shape, the remaining three quarters of the conference schedule promise to hold plenty of surprises.
PRINCETON (11-5, 2-0 Ivy) at HARVARD (14-4, 3-1)
The Tigers and the Crimson, tied with one another for second place in the conference, make for by far the best matchup on the weekend. Adapting to Princeton’s unique style of play will be Harvard’s greatest challenge. Crimson coach Tommy Amaker compares the Tigers to Georgetown, who beat Harvard, 86-70, in December.
Harvard will need to contain Princeton point guard Doug Davis, whose swagger will surely attract the derision of fans. I get the sense that the Crimson is looking to redeem itself for its lackluster performance in Ithaca and will come out with guns blazing.
Pick: Harvard 68, Princeton 54
YALE (8-13, 2-2 Ivy) at No. 25 CORNELL (18-3, 4-0)
From what I saw out of Cornell last weekend, I think they could beat the Bulldogs with just four players. Although Ryan Wittman is rightly considered his squad’s biggest weapon, at least four other Big Red players are capable of leading the team in scoring on a given night. Yale, on the other hand, relies exclusively on league-leading scorer Alex Zampier. One-dimensional teams can’t survive against Cornell, and neither will the Bulldogs.
Pick: Cornell 75, Yale 58
PENN (2-14, 1-1 Ivy) at DARTMOUTH (4-14, 0-4)
Thankfully for one of these teams, someone has to win. Penn is coming off a surprising win against Brown, but that game might have said more about Brown, which couldn’t close out a five-point lead with 20 seconds left, than it did about the Quakers. Dartmouth is the only Ivy still winless in conference play, but this match-up at home is its best chance for a win all season. I’m taking the Big Green in a nail-biter.
Pick: Dartmouth 62, Penn 59
BROWN (7-14, 1-3 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (7-11, 1-3)
The Bears stumbled last week against Penn, and their road gets harder this week with a trip to New York. Knowing that Cornell looms on Saturday, Brown needs to play with extra urgency against the Lions or risk falling to 1-5 in league play.
Columbia would normally have a good shot at the Bears, but senior guard Patrick Foley went down with a shoulder injury last week, and his status is questionable. This game is a toss-up, but I like the Lions behind guard Noruwa Agho, who seemed to find his three-point stroke against Dartmouth.
Pick: Columbia 65, Brown 60
PRINCETON at DARTMOUTH
The Big Green had better win Friday night, or its season will continue to snowball with a loss here to Princeton and next week on the road to Brown and Yale. The Tigers are simply in a different class than Dartmouth and have no business losing on the back end of their trip.
Pick: Princeton 66, Dartmouth 47
YALE at COLUMBIA
This game is another virtual toss-up for Columbia. I imagine Yale will be hungry after getting shellacked by Cornell, but the Bulldogs simply aren’t good enough to have their way with the Lions. The game will likely be a showdown between Zampier and Agho. Given the injury to Foley, I don’t know if Agho can carry the scoring burden on back-to-back nights. I’m giving the slight edge to Yale.
Pick: Yale 61, Columbia 56
BROWN at No. 25 CORNELL
In terms of margin of victory, I wouldn’t rule out any possibilities for this game. Cornell beat Harvard, the supposed second best team in the conference, by 36. My guess is that the Big Red will stop around 25 tonight.
Pick: Cornell 80, Brown 55
PENN at HARVARD
After facing two tough teams in a row, the Crimson will find some respite on Saturday. Penn’s Zack Rosen is an excellent point guard and is even being heralded as a dark horse for conference Player of the Year, but the Quakers simply aren’t on Harvard’s level. Hopefully the Crimson uses this game to work out some of the problems it’s had over the last few games—ball control, shooting, and foul trouble.
Pick: Harvard 79, Penn 54
RECORD LAST WEEK: 7-1 (To date: 7-1)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the return of co-captain Gil Weintraub to the lineup and Harvard playing on its home floor for the first time all year, the scene was set for the men’s volleyball team to capture its first victory of the season.
But things did not pan out as expected.
Plagued by inconsistent serving and confronted with a strong attack, the Crimson (0-4) fell in straight sets to Baruch (10-2) in front of a home crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center last night.
Despite the lopsided outcome, the Crimson managed to keep the scores tight within the sets, outscored by just a combined seven points. Harvard lost its first two sets by two points apiece (30-28 and 33-31), before dropping the final set, 30-27.
“I think in the end it’s about closing out,” Weintraub said. “We were able to hang with them the entire match through all three sets. Closing the game is what makes the difference.”
Weintraub, a former setter turned outside hitter, returned to the lineup for the first time after missing the Crimson’s first three matches with an ankle injury. The senior’s return was welcomed by an ailing Harvard team, which dressed just seven players for last night’s match.
Weintraub was able to make his presence felt immediately, leading his team with 16 points on 13 kills and two serving aces. But Weintraub’s first game back was not without its hiccups, as he finished with five serving errors.
“It feels really good not to be on the bench and where you can actually contribute,” Weintraub said. “And I think I was able to, but it just wasn’t enough in the end.”
Weintraub played a crucial part in orchestrating a Harvard run early in the second set that got the Crimson back in the game after the squad fell behind 11-8 and was in danger of dropping its second set.
After a Baruch serving error put the ball back in the hands of the Crimson, sophomore outside hitter Matt Jones hammered a ball off a group of Bearcats defenders, getting Harvard back within a single point.
Weintraub knotted the score at eleven, this time getting the ball past a triple block. On the following possession, Weintraub blocked a Baruch spike attempt and when the ball landed on the Bearcats side, the Crimson took the lead—and the momentum.
The teams exchanged points down the stretch, tying the score at 25 and then at 27. Weintraub broke the tie on his next serve, getting the ball to dance on the net before dropping onto the Baruch side for the ace.
But the co-captain’s next serve went long and the score was knotted again at 28.
“We need to serve better,” said Harvard coach Brian Baise, whose team finished with 17 serving errors.
Despite its woes behind the service line, the Crimson would come away with two opportunities to capture the set.
But Harvard was unable to convert on either opportunity.
Up 30-29, sophomore Dan Schreff floated a nice serve, but Baruch was able to control the serve and tip it past the Harvard defenders to come away with the point.
Moments later with the Crimson back up 31-30, co-captain Erik Kuld stood behind the service line with the opportunity to even the set total at one-apiece, but his serve would sail long.
The Bearcats took advantage of the swing in momentum, following with two straight points to go up by two sets.
“I thought we played some good defense and I thought we blocked pretty well,” Baise said. “We had a hard time doing those things at the key moments. When it’s 30-all or 28-all, that’s when you really need to make those plays. We didn’t do that tonight.”
Baruch came out strong following the finish of the second set, jumping out to a 12-7 lead. Behind strong hitting from sophomore outside hitter Sequiel Sanchez, who finished with a game-high 19 kills, the Bearcats extended their lead to 25-21.
“[Sanchez] was hard to stop,” Baise said. “We felt with that team we really had to serve well so that they couldn’t get him the ball as much. We only served okay.”
Although the Crimson managed to pull within two points near the end of the third set, Baruch finished the night with a three-point victory to win the match.
“I just feel like closing out is going to be the biggest thing,” Weintraub said. “As soon as we do that, we can start winning matches and take the season where we want it to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The men’s hockey team travels to take on conference rival Brown tonight at 7 pm, and the time is ripe for a Crimson comeback. Harvard was last left reeling from a 6-0 loss to No. 14 Boston College in the semifinals of the 58th Beanpot tournament Monday night.
The Crimson (5-12-3, 5-6-3 conference) and the Bears (7-12-2, 5-7-2) have already met once this season on Dec. 1, when Brown skated away with a decisive 4-1 victory through impressive goalkeeping and power-play execution.
Ever since then, Harvard has been on a wild roller coaster of wins and losses, including a trio of two-game losing streaks and a four-game unbeaten run. Tonight’s match-up will be critical in proving that although it may be down, the Crimson is not out.
“It’s an important game, particularly come off the bad loss to Boston College,” senior Doug Rogers said. “This is our chance to get back on track if we can stick to what we set out to do and win.”
The Bears have been experiencing troubles of their own, battling a five-game losing streak in early January during which they fell to conference opponents, Dartmouth, 9-4, and Yale, 8-5, leaving Brown currently one point behind Harvard in the conference.
“Obviously we’ve had a bumpy season so far,” captain Alex Biega said. “With Brown so close to us in standings, we can place anywhere. It’s a huge game and a huge weekend for us.”
This will be the 156th time the two Ivy teams have met, making it the oldest rivalry in hockey. The Bears have come away with three straight victories over the Crimson and are 3-0-2 against them in the last five games.
Back in December, Harvard opened with a string of shots that were all stopped by Brown’s goaltender, sophomore Mike Clemente. The scoreboard remained empty until 1:58 remained in the first period, when Bears sophomore Jared Smith was able to deflect a shot past Crimson netminder Kyle Richter for a 1-0 lead.
Brown furthered its lead early in the second period on a goal by another sophomore, Jeff Buvinow, who was able to sneak a shot by Richter between the left post and his glove. Harvard managed to get on the board late in the second period, ending the Bears’ four-game shutout streak against Harvard.
The goal came off the stick of freshman Conor Morrison, who deflected the puck inside the near post.
But after the game-changing goal, Brown was able to secure the win with two empty-net goals in the third period after Richter was subbed out in favor of an extra attacker.
To win out over the Bears the second time around, the Crimson will need to match Brown’s intense level of play.
“It’s always a battle against [Brown],” Biega said. “We have to just take it period by period and play our game.”
“We have to come ready to play and stick to our game plan,” Rogers added. “We need to play hard and with a lot of effort, regardless what happens.”
With only nine games remaining in the season, including a final contest in the Beanpot at Boston’s TD Garden, the Crimson needs to settle on an effective playing style and translate it into wins.
“Now it’s about finding our identity, individually and collectively,” Biega said. “Once we establish that, we can put wins together, and when we’re playing well, we can beat any team in the country.”
Harvard has had moments of brilliance throughout its season—namely, its three-game winning streak against Yale, Dartmouth, and Union, which was followed by an overtime 3-3 tie against Rensselaer. The trick will be in taking these moments of brilliance and extending them over the course of a season, or at least another game.
The Crimson has the talent, just not yet the consistency.
“It’s easy to forget the game plan and panic if we go down a couple goals,” Rogers said. “But against [Brown] we need to come ready to play and stick to the strategy.”
For Rogers, Biega, and the four remaining seniors on the team, the game against Brown—and the eight match-ups following it—mark not only the end of their season, but the end of their career at Harvard.
“We have 9 games total left to play and win,” Biega said. “We’re not taking anything for granted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Feb. 10, a sporting event that rocks my world–although barely touching the consciousness of the Ivy League–will take place: the Carolina/Duke basketball game.
Coming from North Carolina, I understand the singular importance this game has for the teams’ fans; I’ve seen the clash of the blues, light to dark; I’ve seen hopes shattered, bets lost, and tears shed because of the numbers on the scoreboard. I’ve had a taste of rivalries with the contention between Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill, but even with hatred of the Blue Devils in my heart, I can hardly claim that it’s been going on for a century.
The Harvard-Yale football game, “The Game,” originated in 1875; the Ivy League was throwing around insults before the invention of the car, before the Civil Rights Movement, before a World War. The Game is, in fact, the oldest continuing rivalry in sports and was ranked sixth in the Best Rivalries in College Athletics as selected by Sports Illustrated. Ever since the first meeting between the Crimson and the Bulldogs, the overall record stands in favor of Yale, at 65-53-8.
So perhaps as I watch the game on Sunday (and lament the fall of my beloved Tarheels), perhaps I won’t put as much meaning in the outcome–after all, it’s just a game, not The Game.

Debates over how best to enforce interhouse dining restrictions have resurfaced at Adams House (the favorite dining hall of all those weary of trekking to Quincy), where students have gotten involved in the crackdown against non-resident diners.
Adams-schmooze, the House e-mail list, erupted last night in an occasionally heated debate—well, all caps made an appearance, anyway—about eager students who have taken enforcement of the rules into their own hands.
According to last night's discussion, student vigilantes have taken to checking student IDs during community night dinners, sparking comparisons to airport security measures.
At least if the checks were random, one student mused, they might be justifiable.
Though he disputes the extent of the vigilante action, Adams resident Samuel B. Novey '11 said that the overflow of non-residents in the dining hall has spurred students to help Lucy, the embattled card swiper, to turn away non-residents (including this correspondent) who often try to talk their way into the servery.
Adams House has a history of creatively cracking down on undesirable non-residents: last semester, Adams resident Vincent M. Chiappini '09, perched atop a stolen lifeguard chair, used a bullhorn to call out non-residents in the dining hall.
That effort was sadly halted when the MAC had HUPD return their lifeguard chair. But fear not, for rumors abound that the chair may be making a return to Adams.
Colin A. Rees '12, who advocated over the House list for the use of "ninja tactics" against non-resident intruders, said that he plans to bring the chair back by at least the halfway point of the semester.
And the bullhorn?
"You'll have to wait and see," Rees said.
