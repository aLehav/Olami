After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 27 at 1:50 a.m.
“Alto’s Odyssey” is an endless runner mobile game about sandboarding, which—after a brief interlude of Googling—I can assure you is a real sport. But that’s a bit like saying “The Starry Night” is a painting of a village. It’s true, I guess, but not really what you notice.
What “Alto’s Odyssey” is really about is guiding a sandboarding avatar through a gorgeous two-dimensional desert, using a few touches of the screen to jump over obstacles and onto surfaces, and maybe doing a few midair flips and tricks along the way. It is difficult to overstate how visually striking the game is: Temples and mountains weave into canyons and dunes, which weave into jungles and waterfalls. The little sandboarder makes his or her way through villages, across vines, bridges, and balloons. Leave the music on if you can to help guide your mood from quiet appreciation to glee as you slide through one landscape and launch yourself across another.
The basic gameplay is very simple. You touch the screen to jump, holding on to perform backflips and other tricks. The game is divided into levels, with different goals suggested to progress to the next level—but you can explore the endless variety of “Odyssey” without ever accomplishing any of the goals, if you like. Collecting coins along the way allows you to purchase upgrades (some of which, like the single-use Helmet, seem to be a bit of a waste of money), while completing levels unlocks different playable characters with slightly different skillsets (for example, the second character, Maya, is slower but flips faster).
Endless runners can be stressful. Like many games, they require split-second decision-making. Something is almost always chasing the player, be it a monster, a natural disaster, or something a little more whimsical. And sooner or later, as certain as death or taxes, you will lose. Endless runners have no victory conditions, only longer runs before failure. Oftentimes, this can make a game get old pretty quickly (Sure, it was exciting the first few times, but before long the game is reduced to endless repetitions of the same level, hard to look away from but also no longer any fun).
“Alto’s Odyssey” avoids this pitfall of the genre. The terrain of the level changes slightly across each playthrough, even if one stays in the same biome. The game moves on a day/night cycle that persists across levels, so that if it was night when the last run ended, it will still be night when the next begins. Sandstorms and rainfall appear, last for a run or two, and disappear again. The gameplay and the world have a sedate, unhurried feel that makes ending a run feel less like a failure and more like a brief delay before getting to play some more.
That being said, I would strongly caution against playing for more than an hour or two at a time. If overplayed, “Odyssey” begins to lose its charm. Its level goals become frustratingly difficult objectives. Instead of a storm or nightfall being an interesting change to the world’s aesthetic, they become irritating impediments to one’s vision. The game remains as difficult to put down as ever—perhaps even more so—but one starts to wonder if this is really a valuable use of one’s time. At that point, you should put it down and come back to it later.
Another way to alleviate the frustrations of endless runners is to activate the game’s Zen Mode, which turns off the coins and trick scores the game uses to track your performance, and allows your little sandboarders to get back up each time they fall down instead of starting a new run. With a slower, more contemplative soundtrack, and more opportunities to appreciate the beautiful background and foreground art, Zen Mode is arguably the best way to enjoy “Odyssey.” It also allows you to move from biome to biome if you find yourself getting stuck in a rut.
A quick look at “Alto’s Odyssey” and the game which inspired it, “Journey,” will be enough to determine that the one owes a lot to the other. The art styles are very similar, and both games flow through a beautiful desert landscape, hauntingly empty at first look, but brimming with life on closer inspection. Both sport cloaked player avatars with trailing scarves, who hang in the air for just a little longer than we can in the everyday world. The bird of paradise companions that you can acquire on your sandboarding runs even seem to echo the cloth creatures of “Journey.”
Of course, the two games are also very different, and not just because they are in different genres. With its coins, run scores, equipment, and alternate avatars, “Alto’s Odyssey” does not have the same strict commitment to minimalism “Journey” did. “Journey” wanted to make statements about life, loneliness, and experience; “Alto’s Odyssey” wants you to have fun in five-minute bursts.
But even though “Odyssey” is fun to play, to write it off like that would be underselling it. “Alto’s Odyssey” succeeds with such beauty and grace, one forgets that what one is playing is “just” an endless runner, “just” a game for a phone or tablet. “Alto’s Odyssey” isn’t just the best of its genre—it’s better than its genre.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 27, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that "Journey" was the predecessor to "Alto's Odyssey." In fact, "Journey" inspired "Alto's Odyssey," but was not its predecessor.

Gutsy female athlete making risky—if questionable—life decisions to maintain power over her life seems to be the recurring theme of this season’s awards show darlings, from “I, Tonya” to “Molly’s Game.” For the #MeToo era, which has sparked a national dialogue on power and consent, the plot is fitting: A woman dares to exist in the world of men.
Now, “Red Sparrow,” a Russian spy thriller, joins that list. Director Francis Lawrence creates the trust-nobody paranoia synonymous with the lore of the Russian intelligence network, particularly topical amid real-life reports of Russian intervention in the U.S. presidential election.
Here, the gutsy female athlete is Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence, with a somewhat believable Slavic accent), a Russian prima ballerina who suffers a career-ending injury. Vanya (Matthias Schoenaerts), her unnervingly affectionate uncle and the head of the SVR, pressures her to protect her ailing mother. Dominika trains as a Sparrow, a professional femme fatale who uses sex and psychological manipulation to procure information for the government. But when Dominika falls in love with Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), an American target, she complicates her political allegiance and risks her own life. “Red Sparrow” boasts a dynamic female lead with acting prowess, but it’s not enough to keep it aloft. A convoluted plot and botched love story force the film to crash-land.
While initially simple, the film’s plot quickly devolves into an incomprehensible mesh of geopolitical turmoil. After the death of a U.S. senator, the chronology of events spirals into confusion, and it becomes unclear who’s on whose side and who’s spying on whom. There’s betrayal, deception, subterfuge—but why? And for whom? Perhaps it was too ambitious to convey all the details of the source material, Jason Matthews’s 2013 novel of the same name. At any rate, Justin Haythe’s screenplay leaves room for gratuitous gore, including several attempted rapes, brutal torture methods, and a particularly harrowing scene involving a skin-grafting blade.
While Dominika’s depth of emotion sometimes flattens into a hard stare, it’s heartening to see Lawrence play a more dimensional character than the one she played last September, in “mother!”—Darren Aronofsky’s pseudo-intellectual global warming allegory.  For an actress whose private photos were cruelly leaked four years ago, playing a seductress wielding her sexuality as a tool of power and manipulation represents a particularly brave (and symbolic) choice: a reclamation of bodily autonomy. From the moment that Dominika attacks the saboteurs responsible for her injury, to the film’s genuinely surprising, albeit torturously delayed twist ending, it’s increasingly obvious that Lawrence’s character calls all the shots. Dominika’s power spans the range of brute force (a ferocious retaliation with a broken shower faucet against an attempted rapist, a bloody knife fight to the death) to deception and strategizing as a double, then triple, then quadruple agent. And Lawrence, in an array of different cocktail dresses and cut-out swimsuits, masks Dominika’s ingenuity under ingenuousness, sometimes with frightening facility. In one scene, Dominika takes a picture with a predatory benefactor, the camera flash illuminating the vacancy of her glazed eyes: a blank canvas onto which men project their own desires and fantasies. “Every human being is a puzzle of need,” Matron (Charlotte Rampling), a teacher at Sparrow School, tells her. “You must become the missing piece, and they will tell you everything.”
Still, as the story unfolds, the sexual politics of Dominika’s career enter murky territory. It’s difficult to view uncritically as a feminist narrative, when a substantial portion of Dominika’s screen-time is spent on her torture and near-rape. It’s unclear whether her nudity implies objectification or self-ownership, whether she initiates sex because she desires it or because she needs it to achieve objectives that her uncle has effectively forced on her. Even the film’s title implies a fraught dichotomy: “red” signals violence, blood, and passion, but “sparrow” suggests meekness, flightiness.
It’s too bad that Edgerton can’t quite match her pace. Lawrence’s solo performance demotes the love story, supposedly central to the story, to a mere subplot—if that. The scenes between Edgerton and Lawrence lack chemistry, much less romance. As U.S. intelligence agent Nate Nash, Edgerton dodges a few bullets and fights a few bad guys, but his main storyline consists of swimming at the Hungarian YMCA and sitting in a hotel room waiting for Dominika to finish her mission. When he promises Dominika he’ll do “everything in [his] power” to protect her, it feels like not just an empty promise, but a pointless one. After all, what is his power next to hers?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, The Crimson reported that members of the Undergraduate Council said the body continues to struggle with a culture dominated by men and characterized by a lack of respect for female and non-binary representatives, 21 years after the election of the first female UC president. Though women were elected UC president in 2016 and 2017, members say institutional barriers persist, pointing to the lack of gender parity in the organization, which had 26 male, 17 female, and one non-binary representatives in 2017.
We are disheartened by the details of the report and revelations about the difficulties women and non-binary members of the UC face in establishing their voices in a majority-male group, but we are not surprised. Many extracurricular organizations at Harvard continue to struggle to increase gender parity and eliminate sexism—even The Crimson. This campus is by no means immune to these barriers to belonging; the vestiges of an antiquated, male-dominated Harvard still exist within many campus groups. We must do everything possible to make individuals of every gender feel at home in their Houses, classes, and clubs at Harvard.
We acknowledge that the UC has been taking action to increase gender parity and change its culture. The UC’s 2010 move to increase outreach to prospective female candidates represented a step in the right direction to ensure women feel included. Women have assumed more leadership roles in the UC this semester than in the past, and a woman has led the Council for the last two calendar years.
However, just because some women have been able to overcome institutional and organizational obstacles does not mean that it has been easy to do so, or that gender equality has been achieved. In fact, as Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said to The Crimson that women like her have assumed committee chairships in spite of barriers like the unofficial “grooming” process, whereby mostly male chairs select their favorite underclassmen—often male too—to succeed them once they have abdicated their spot.
Thus, it is unclear whether the UC’s efforts have been effective. The Crimson published a similar report about gender inequity in the UC in 2010.  The fact that the issue continues to persist in 2018 demonstrates that, at the very least, current efforts have been insufficient in achieving gender equality. Indeed, it shows that more and different action is needed to effectively address the issue.
Although running for a position in a male-dominated organization may feel like an uphill battle for women and non-binary students, we encourage non-male individuals to continue to run for the UC, as this is the most effective way to ensure that the organization’s culture changes. We believe the UC must continue to run outreach initiatives before and during elections to support these candidates as they run and enter the club. We further implore the UC to use all possible avenues to reach a more diverse pool of prospective candidates in an attempt to reverse its persistent gender inequality and at times exclusive organizational culture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I am beginning writing this, I have 445 days left until my DACA expires. 445 days left to be able to work in the United States. 445 days left of protection from deportation—although that is not guaranteed either.
The thing that bothers me about this number is that it doesn’t seem that bad at first. I have over a year left. A lot can happen in that time. But that’s exactly it: A lot can change. Each day that passes, 122 DACA recipients lose their status. My deadline is just a bit farther away. Right now, my DACA is set to expire as I take my finals next year. It will last me through my first three years at Harvard. But it is set to expire before I graduate. A lot can happen in that time. Graduation is not guaranteed. Permission to work after college is not guaranteed.
***
440 days are left as I start writing this again. I’ve been kept busy planning for the Collegiate Alliance for Immigration Reform Conference that we hosted at Harvard this weekend. I sit in the middle of this conference trying to get my words out in time for this to be published. Thoughts have been floating through my head and I’ve been surrounded by people who are part of my community. I feel guilty. My entire community is not here. This is only a small fraction of it. Most of the people here are the “Dreamers” that are often highlighted on the media.
I am one of them. And I feel guilty. I feel ashamed when people tokenize me only to throw the rest of my community under the bus. I feel ashamed when I take part in an interview to talk about my parents in order to shift this narrative, and they cut out everything I say about them. I am definitely at a disadvantage compared to documented students here at Harvard, but compared to my community, I have more than people could ever ask for. I have protection through the Harvard name. I have a place to sleep, access to unlimited food in the dining halls, health insurance, and an education. I have access to a work permit and a job in the admissions office where I receive a higher hourly wage than my parents.
This status has been separating me from the rest of my community. I straddle the line between documented and not because of DACA. I am close to being pushed off of it, but I know that I am a minority in the undocumented community. The majority of my community doesn’t have access to this line—the same way we don’t have access to the line in which people urge us to wait.
***
438. The number of days left for my DACA when this is published. This title was used to draw you in because I know DACA  gets the most attention in this community. It is not the people risking their lives on the border, day in and day out. It is not the people risking deportation by working to feed their families. It is not the people stuck in detention. It is not the people seeking asylum in a country they wrongfully thought would grant them freedom.
DACA gave me the comfort to get involved in activism. I had the courage to get involved and be public with my story because I was immune to deportation. I was able to find enough comfort in this temporary status. This temporary relief from deportation. This temporary peace of mind. Just enough to hold us over. Keep the “Dreamers” safe and they’ll back down. Because all our parents wanted was for us to have a better future. DACA was good enough for them—but not for us. Not for me.
Everyone in the community knows that DACA is a privilege, because in the country we live in, it is a privilege to be able to work to feed your family. It is a privilege to not fear that our families will be separated. It is a privilege to not fear deportation, day in and day out. It is a privilege to exist in peace. Yet, DACA should not be seen as a privilege. Every single one of us deserves these rights and we should not have to sell out the rest of our community in order to try to get these rights for ourselves.
Politicians have used us as pawns to keep us quiet—to keep us from fighting back by giving us crumbs. We should not be grateful for a program that only divides our community. Now that they’ve taken DACA from us, we must recognize that this country was never going to fight for us. We have lost everything at this point. It’s time to fight for our entire community again knowing we have nothing left to lose. We must make this loss worth it. It’s all or nothing.

Last summer I had the privilege of training with the 25th Composite Truck Company at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. Towards the end of my summer stay, our platoon was tasked with moving a company of infantrymen to a training site situated along Oahu’s central mountain range. Normally the platoon’s lieutenant would accompany our unit on such missions; however, his wife was about to give birth, leaving me with a salty platoon sergeant to oversee six or so vehicles.
Not that there was all that much for me to manage (or ruin) anyways. Our platoon sergeant—like any platoon sergeant—was an experienced soldier with multiple deployments under his belt. His voice was biblical, his orders were law, and his mind was as sharp as his tongue.
Unfortunately, as luck would have it, our company commander had already tasked our platoon sergeant with something else that afternoon. However, given our mission’s simplicity, our convoy was to go ahead as scheduled. After all, our route comprised a single dirt road, leaving no doubt as to which way to go but forward. And so, around 1530 on a beautiful August afternoon, a handful of sergeants, specialists, and privates—along with myself—set out to pick up our grunt cousins (an affectionate term for infantrymen).
Our steeds were a few old LMTVs (Light Medium Tactical Vehicles), steel trucks that are about as large as they are loud. Emblematic of my luck, my LMTV lacked air conditioning, leaving the driver, copilot, and me sweating away as our helmets baked our brains. The lead vehicles kicked up reddish dust and clay as they snaked through the Hawaiian hillside; it looked as though we were invading a Martian jungle.
We rolled down the windows so as not to suffocate in our stuffy LMTV, only to quickly discover that the dusty air wasn’t as fresh as it seemed. I turned to the driver and gave him a wide, Joker-esque smile; my teeth were caked in red dust. “You’re a fuckin’ weirdo, Harvard,” the copilot remarked, and we broke into laughter. As the terrain grew increasingly hilly, our speed was reduced to about five to ten miles per hour, providing me with plenty of time to enjoy every moment of our journey.
This is not to say that I enjoy long rides in stuffy trucks; like any rational person, I despise humidity. What made that Hawaiian ride so memorable—aside from the sweat—were the conversations I had. If you ask me to recount what was said, I couldn’t tell you exactly. We did not debate anything of political significance or discuss anything profound. Topics ranged from the differences between Druids and Wiccans to the age at which it is no longer socially acceptable to play Runescape. That’s what made the ride so beautiful; all we did was shoot the breeze, free from judgment and free from care.
The most outlandish (and enjoyable) conversations I’ve had in my life are those I’ve shared with those in uniform. I’ve heard cadets talk about blinding raccoons with strobe lights. I’ve heard soldiers debate the merits of lunar colonialism. I’ve heard a Marine explain his fantasy of one day adopting a robot son. Give me anyone in uniform and I’ll give you an unusual conversation.
Yet conversations with soldiers are oddly honest. Talk to a soldier, and you’ll quickly notice that we’re too damn tired, too damn hungry, and too damn sore to fake any of it. We’re simply too busy to deal with the nonsense of acting. Put a person under enough physical or psychological stress, and what you’ll get is something strangely human and entirely honest.
People often ask me what’s there to love about the Army. On a bad day, I’ll respond with my signature, creepy chuckle. But on good day, I’ll tell them how I love the frankness, the honesty, and the zero-tolerance for fakery and flakiness. I’ll tell them how the love between those in uniform is like a shot of whiskey: It’s strong, it’s hard, and it boasts a simultaneously pleasurable and displeasing burning sensation.
Having dropped off our knuckle-dragging peers (yet another endearing term for infantrymen) we began the lengthy process of turning the convoy around. The thin jungle road wasn’t designed for LMTVs, forcing us to spend half an hour making some of the most stressful three-point turns of my life. After a series of daring maneuvers, we finally got the trucks back on track and commenced our long ride back to Schofield Barracks. The stars rose, the sky darkened, and our hulking trucks cut a path through the darkness with their obnoxiously bright headlights. Perhaps we talked about Vikings. Perhaps we debated the significance of different lightsaber colors, or whether the Jedi are really all that good. Regardless of whatever we shared, the moment was honest, and that’s all a man can ask for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just hours before the publication of a Daily Mail article which would accuse him in detail of physically and emotionally abusing both of his ex-wives, former White House staff secretary Robert R. Porter ’02 reportedly offered a pair of explanations: His first wife had inadvertently managed to punch herself in the face during an argument over a glass vase. The second was simply a “fucking bitch.”
That sparse pair of excuses was apparently enough for Chief of Staff John Kelly, who then released a statement calling Porter “a man of true integrity and honor.” Likewise for Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who described Robert Porter as a man of “exemplary character.” In a satisfying twist, the Intercept subsequently tweeted photographic evidence of Porter’s violent streak, sending the White House into a graceless backpedal. Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah expressed regret, and Kelly voiced an evidently newfound commitment to take “matters of domestic violence very seriously.”
All of this can be read like an ordinary story from a chaotic White House. Porter’s dismissal was nowhere near the most dramatic or contentious firing of the young administration: Omarosa Manigault-Newman and Steve Bannon left with substantially greater pyrotechnics. The lies surrounding the Porter collapse were also less naked than previous fictions. This is, after all, the same president who repeatedly claimed that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the 2016 election, and invented from thin air an entire terrorist attack in Sweden. What makes Porter special is not the violence or the coverup, but the entitlement behind both his behavior and that of the Trump administration.
From the very beginning, Porter had pedigree. He is the eldest son of Kennedy School professor Roger B. Porter and the late Dunster Faculty Dean Ann R. Porter. Two of his three siblings would also attend Harvard. The oldest Porter shined in Cambridge, becoming president of the Republican Club and chair of Harvard Students for Bush. Just like his father, Porter capped his Harvard experience with a Rhodes Scholarship. And after the Rhodes, Porter returned to campus for his law degree. Porter is the ultimate Harvard man.
Porter then parlayed his academic prestige into a promising career and an inside track to political power. After stints with Senators Rob Portman, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, Porter was hired by Kelly and given direct access to the most powerful man on the planet. The president apparently raved about Porter’s academic triumphs, calling him “the smartest guy in the White House,” commenting on his multiple Harvard degrees, and noting that “even Gorsuch wasn’t a Rhodes Scholar.” The media was similarly enthusiastic about Porter’s resume. Even during his fall from grace, articles about Porter would routinely involve lines like “Porter is a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law, and in between, was a Rhodes Scholar.”
Much of the wildness of the Porter narrative is a product of this disjuncture, the tension between academic achievement and personal depravity. Many people believe that Harvard equals talent, and talent equals decency. This is untrue. Plenty of ethically rotten individuals have emerged from Harvard. Graduates of the Business School could be one example, as some have accused the school of playing an outsized role in promoting the avarice, hubris, and outright cruelty that resulted in the 2008 collapse of the world economic system. From their posts at Lehman Brothers, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and hedge funds the world over, Business School alumni did  more than their fair share to destabilize the world economy. In this sense, Harvard graduates have built a world in which greed is good. Much of the University’s knowledge is harnessed for evil.
The most heinous statements from Porter’s ex-wives have nothing to do with physical violence. They are instead concerned with emotional abuse, specifically Porter’s habit of constantly belittling his wives to make himself feel big. One of Porter’s ex-wives commented that Porter is “very intelligent,” and had a habit of taking her words and glibly refashioning them “in a way that it would confuse me as to what I meant.” It is hard not to see in this a Harvard law degree at work. Porter took Harvard's tools and used them to torment his wife. The University produced a man who lorded his intelligence and knowledge over his wife, demeaned and berated her ceaselessly, and—when that failed—at least once concluded an argument with a right cross to the orbital.
The official mission of Harvard College is “to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” In this respect, Porter is a striking success. Harvard turned an ambitious teenager into one of the most powerful people in America. But in fulfilling its mission, the University also lent skills and credibility to a sickening excuse for a man. In its academic and social culture, in its basic ethos, Harvard can no longer afford to treat kindness and decency as secondary considerations.
Perhaps Harvard did not turn Porter into an awful coward, but at the very least, whatever is in him festered here. Shame is appropriate. Best of luck to his replacement, Derek Lyons, a graduate of the Law School.

Some graduate members of Harvard’s final clubs are lobbying Congress to push for an amendment to Republican-backed legislation that would prevent Harvard from enforcing its penalties on members of single-gender social groups, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
Representative Virginia A. Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, recently proposed a sweeping new higher education law—titled the PROSPER Act—that would alter current financial aid programs as well as expand the routes to a college degree, among other measures. In December, the PROSPER act successfully passed the House’s education committee.
Final club alumni, though, are focused on just one section of the act: an amendment that seeks to forbid universities that have “a policy allowing for the official recognition of single-sex student organizations” from penalizing members of the groups. Because Harvard does not have a policy officially recognizing final clubs and Greek organizations, it is unlikely the legislation in its current form would apply to the College.
The final club graduates hope to change that. The alumni want to re-work the language of the law so it endangers the College’s social group penalties, which currently bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations—starting with the Class of 2021—from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
As part of this push, some final club alumni attended a fundraiser in Washington, D.C. two weeks ago to raise money for Foxx, according to the Wall Street Journal. Law firm Arnold & Porter hosted the fundraiser, the Journal reported.
Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78, graduate president of the Fly Club and an attendee at last week’s meeting, told the Journal he supports Foxx’s legislation because it would preserve the “free association” of Harvard students.
“We would like to see free speech and free association protected,” he said.
The Porcellian Club is also involved in the effort; some members recently sent emails asking other members to give $350 to $500 to support Foxx, the Journal reported.
The Crimson reported in Dec. 2017 that Representative Elise Stefanik ’06, a New York Republican and a Harvard alumna, has been advocating for the amendment related to single-gender social groups. Stefanik—through a spokesperson—said at the time she had been working on this legislation with colleagues for several months.
"Congresswoman Stefanik believes all schools should respect students' right to freely associate," Stefanik's communications director Tom Flanagin wrote in an emailed statement in December. "This amendment is not specific to Harvard and will protect Constitutional liberties across the country."
University President Drew G. Faust is also paying attention to the PROSPER Act, though she is focused more on provisions relating to student aid and college affordability. In a recent interview, Faust said she finds “a lot of elements” in the act “concerning.”
It is unclear what provisions will end up in the final version of the bill, which has yet to come before the full House or Senate for a vote.
“There’s a lot of stuff being put into this bill that may or may not survive, so we’d like to see how it unfolds,” Faust said.

In recent comment letters, several local residents and community groups criticized the Massachusetts Department of Transportation’s “incomplete” draft environmental report on the proposed I-90 realignment, asking the agency to prepare a more extensive analysis.
The realignment, known officially as the I-90 Interchange Improvement Project, will replace the aging Allston viaduct, simplifying and straightening the ramps at the end of the Massachusetts Turnpike. MassDOT released a Draft Environmental Impact Report on the $270 million project at the end of 2017, opening a public comment period on the proposal which closed in early February.
In her letter, Boston City Councilor At-Large Michelle Wu ’07 wrote that MassDOT’s current plan “does not reflect the needs of the community or commitments that the Commonwealth and the City have made regarding climate change and transportation.”
“The Commonwealth should prioritize making public transit-oriented, climate-ready, and equitable decision to seize this tremendous opportunity,” wrote Wu, who is also the chair of the city council’s Committee on Planning, Development and Transportation.
Nine community organizations and residents advising MassDOT on the I-90 project wrote a joint letter requesting that the agency further elaborate on the environmental impact of its plans in a supplemental DEIR.
“Despite its exhaustive length, MassDOT’s DEIR is an incomplete document requiring further study to bring to light the full impact of this $1 billion infrastructure initiative,” the letter reads.
"The Massachusetts Department of Transportation has been pleased to work closely with key stakeholders including Harvard University, area businesses, and members of the local community throughout the design process for the I-90 Allston Viaduct Project," MassDOT spokesperson Patrick Marvin wrote in an emailed statement.
"MassDOT held over 20 meetings with the I-90 Allston Task Force, 7 public information meetings, and numerous stakeholder briefings prior to publishing the Draft Environmental Impact Report in November 2017," he added.
Several of the letters sent to MassDOT also criticized delays to the construction of West Station, a proposed community rail station to connect Allston to downtown Boston. MassDOT originally scheduled a completion in 2025 for West Station, which will be built on land vacated by the I-90 realignment. Citing financial concerns, the department announced in late 2017 that it will instead begin construction in 2040.
Joshua Safer, chairman of the Brookline Transportation Board, wrote he hoped the station would be built sooner.
“The station is needed by current residents—including those in Brookline—not just future riders,” Safer wrote.
Safer also wrote that he believes MassDOT’s current plans prioritize vehicular transport.
“MassDOT’s default should be to provide for mass transit access from all possible directions in order to foster transit-focused rather than car-dependent development. To do otherwise is to ignore MassDOT’s responsibility,” he wrote.
Wu wrote in her letter that the delay of West Station construction is “unacceptable” and “counterproductive.”
City Councilors from Newton wrote that they felt skeptical about MassDOT’s traffic predictions, which the organization used to justify delaying the construction of West Station.
“The traffic model used by MassDOT makes several assumptions about transit ridership which are hard to reconcile with reality, and the result will likely be an automobile-centered development which increases traffic volume and congestion on the Turnpike,” the councilors wrote.
Marvin wrote that MassDOT is continuing to review public comments about the DEIR and "looks forward to considering all input that is related to this project."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students led by Act on a Dream hosted the eighth annual Collegiate Alliance for Immigration Reform conference this weekend, drawing a record crowd.
Two hundred and fifty students from schools across the country, Harvard professors, and local activists attended talks, observed panels, and participated in workshops that emphasized student advocacy and community building.
“This is the biggest the conference has ever been,” Ana Andrade ’19, co-director of Act on a Dream, said.
Act on a Dream is a Harvard student-run organization that advocates for both documented and undocumented immigrants. The group has lobbied for national legislation and worked with the Harvard administration on immigration-related issues.
This year’s theme was “Beyond Borders: Faces of Migration.” Discussion centered around intersectionality and the complexity of immigration advocacy.
Due to the Mar. 5 deadline for DACA renewal, organizers moved the conference date up to February from April, the time during which it was held last year at Pomona College. Anshi M. Moreno Jiminez ’19, co-chair of Harvard’s CAIR board, said that “logistically people wouldn’t have been able to fly in at that point.”
“There is a lot that’s out of our control,” Moreno Jiminez added.
The conference included an overview of recent immigration policy changes, entitled “A Brief on Current Legislation.”
“It’s all over the place,” Moreno Jiminez said.
Elmer Vivas Portillo ’20, the other co-chair, said the organizers chose events that would “give the attendees tools” to work locally in expanding advocacy, seeking institutional support, and creating community.
Vivas Portillo also highlighted the importance of building inter-collegiate networks.
“As much as this is about in a way putting on a response to what is happening nationally, it is also about connecting with one another,” Vivas Portillo said.
Conference attendee Uyun Nguyen, a sophomore at Davidson College in North Carolina, agreed. Nguyen said she was “amazed by the community and the support of this group” and praised the success of this year’s conference.
“Right now, under the current political climate we don’t have a lot of control over the federal policies, but at the same time, we have the power to mobilize in our communities,” Nguyen said. As a journalist and immigrant from Vietnam, Nguyen said she plans to use her platform to advocate for immigration reform.
The conference also highlighted the issue of divisions within the undocumented community.
Alex Navarrete, a senior at the University of Michigan, cautioned against drawing lines when it comes to advocating for immigration reform.
“The deserving immigrant and the undeserving immigrant, a lot of the time, is just an arbitrary distinction,” Navarrete said, referencing dividing binaries like that between documented and undocumented immigrants, between DREAMers and their parents, and between low-skill and high-skill workers.
“I want to show people that I’m worthy of being here,” Navarrete said. “Migration, especially for survival, should be a human right because nobody chooses where they are from and the circumstances that they are born into.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Sonya Kalara ’21 found out Harvard College Faith and Action had asked a student in a same-sex relationship to step down from a leadership position, her initial reaction was “visceral.”
“I’ve experienced homophobia in my life in a variety of circumstances,” Kalara said while sitting in Lamont Cafe Sunday. “And to know that, in the year 2018, at the college that I love, there is still this institutional backlash against queer people—it’s not surprising, but it’s still disappointing.”
Kalara was not alone: Brunching in residential Houses across campus Sunday, many undergraduates said they opposed HCFA’s move to demote the student as well as what they called the group’s negative stance toward BGLTQ Harvard affiliates. Others, though, said HCFA may not fully deserve probation—and some argued the group’s role on campus remains essential.
"I don't think that's right,” Carolina Quintero Arias ’20 said of HCFA’s dismissal of the student. “You can be LGBTQ and still be a Christian.”
“I’m definitely disappointed,” Elianna M. J. Shwayder ’18 said, pausing while eating in Eliot.
“The decision [HCFA] made was truly unacceptable,” Jackson C. Walker ’21 said.
The College placed HCFA on year-long “administrative probation” last week after “reviewing” the organization and concluding its behavior was “grossly inconsistent” with Harvard’s expectations for recognized student groups. The Crimson reported Thursday that the punishment was almost certainly tied to HCFA’s decision to force the resignation of the woman in the same-sex relationship.
The Harvard College Student Handbook bars recognized student groups from discriminating on the basis of “sexual orientation.”
Members of the board of Harvard College Queer Students & Allies, an affinity group for BGLTQ students, wrote in an emailed statement Sunday they agree with the College’s punishment.
“We condemn any and all discrimination against BGLTQ+ individuals, and appreciate that the University is taking this situation seriously,” Kirsi Anselmi-Stith ’18, the group’s co-chair, wrote.
Other students also supported the College’s decision to put HCFA on probation. Some said they think HCFA’s actions clearly go against Harvard’s nondiscrimination policies.
"What they did was a clear violation of the handbook," Elena D. Sokoloski ‘18 said, looking up from her Kirkland brunch.
Kalara said she thinks the probation was necessary given Harvard policy. She called the punishment “definitely justified.”
HCFA co-presidents Scott Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18 previously said they do not believe the group violated the College’s nondiscrimination policies.
“We reject any notion that we discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in our fellowship,” the co-presidents wrote in an email Wednesday. “Broadly speaking, the student in this case was removed because of an irreconcilable theological disagreement pertaining to our character standards.”
Ely and Richmond did not immediately respond to requests for comment on student criticisms Monday evening.
Still other students said they do not believe the situation was clear-cut. Some urged compassion for HCFA.
"[HCFA] might feel like they're being unfairly targeted for their religion," Sokoloski said.
Kent Toshima ’21 agreed, saying he thinks the College “should preserve individual liberty” in sensitive situations.
“I think, ultimately, the College shouldn't do something unless the group commits some kind of crime,” he said.
Nonetheless, students on both sides of the issue said they think HCFA serves a vital role on campus. Some undergraduates said they think it is important for students of faith to have representation in Cambridge.
"I think that the beauty of having a religious group is when it builds relationships between people," Shwayder said.
Walker, who represents Elm Yard on the Undergraduate Council, said he still believes HCFA forms a key part of Harvard.
“I know many people in HCFA that are strong in their faith and don’t support these decisions. Having groups like HCFA is really important on campus for people of faith,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams is advocating for more research on gun violence after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Fla. that left 17 students and teachers dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
Williams wrote a letter to School of Public Health affiliates Feb. 16 calling for an end to federal restrictions on funding for gun violence research.
“As public health leaders—and as concerned citizens—we must double down on our efforts to make it clear that gun violence prevention is a national crisis,” she wrote.
In an emailed statement, Williams wrote that the “profound sadness” she felt after the Parkland shooting motivated her to write the letter.
Research at the Harvard Injury Control Research Center has found that “the availability of more firearms leads to more homicides and more suicides,” Williams wrote in the letter.
The center’s mission, according to its website, is to “reduce the societal burden of injury and violence.”
In the wake of the Parkland shooting, David Hemenway, the center’s director, has called for stricter gun control measures in interviews with NBC, NPR, the Boston Herald, and The Atlantic.
In an interview Friday, Hemenway said most federal agencies currently dedicate little to no funding to gun violence research.
“This is an enormous problem in the United States, gun violence. And there’s very little federal funding for research,” he said.
Since 1996, federal law has required that “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.”
Advocates say this provision, known informally as the Dickey Amendment after the congressman who proposed it, prevents the CDC from funding research into gun violence.
Because federal funding is restricted in this manner, the burden falls on universities to foot the bill for this research, Hemenway said.
This research can reveal effective ways to mitigate gun violence, according to Hemenway. His center previously investigated  the correlation between bans on high-capacity magazines and the number of shootings in various states and found that these bans are linked to lower rates of mass shootings.
“The states with large-capacity magazine bans have done much better in terms of fewer gun massacres,” Hemenway said.
Williams also spoke at a press conference last week with Mass. Senator Edward J. Markey in Roxbury, the Herald News reported Wednesday.
“It is time to stand with the survivors of the Parkland, Florida shooting, those teenagers, those brave young children who are not afraid to share their outrage and to shame our nation’s leaders for their failure to act,” she said at the press conference.
Students who survived the shooting have begun to advocate for stricter gun control measures in the wake of their classmates’ deaths. Across more than 20 Florida high schools, students walked out of class last week in protest.
In response to the students' demonstrations, Florida Governor Rick Scott has proposed raising the minimum age required to buy a firearm from 18 to 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a grey weekend with only a few hints of sun, Class of 2019 parents descended on Harvard Yard for Junior Family Weekend to see their children and to learn more about the  “Harvard experience.”
This past Saturday and Sunday, that experience included an on-campus performance, lectures led by house deans, and regularly scheduled classes on topics ranging from intermediate macroeconomics to organic chemistry to the Hebrew Bible.
Marion E. Clemens and Thomas P. Clemens, parents to Rachel E. Clemens ’19, said they hoped to watch one of the campus productions during their visit.
“Normally we go to [HRO] concerts, so we’d like to do something different. There’s a play where you can only get two tickets per student, so we’re trying to figure that out—tomorrow’s a little up in the air,” Marion E. Clemens said.
Instead of rushing to clean his dorm room and wash laundry before his parents’ upcoming visit, Evan C. MacKay ’19 said he chose to coordinate meetings between his friends and parents to show them a small slice of regular life on campus.
“I tried to text friends and see whose parents were coming and weren’t coming. I wanted to make sure that those friends that I have get to meet my parents,” MacKay said. “I know that my parents would really want to be able to meet my friends whose parents couldn’t travel.”
His mother, Debbie J. MacKay, agreed with her son. She said the best part of the weekend was meeting Evan’s friends and their families.
“That’s the beauty of it: all of his friends are so diverse. Everybody’s making it their own, individualizing their experience,” she said.
Evan MacKay noted that this weekend’s visit isn’t like others: the value of coming to campus isn’t just about parents and child seeing each other for the first time in a while.
“It’s about opening up Harvard space to them. On this special day, they can go into the library, the dining halls—and they were able to go to the gym this morning, which they really liked,” he said.
The weekend’s activities can vary wildly, though, depending on the a student's hometown. For juniors who live near Cambridge, Mass., like Peter Z. Hartnett ’19, Junior Family Weekend is not as significant.
"I’m actually from fairly close, so it’s not too much of an ordeal for my parents. So it’s like an hour and a half. I do see them fairly often, more than just for parents’ weekend,” Hartnett said.
Though Jennifer Wang ’18-’19 said she plans to graduate in 2019, she said it did not make sense for her parents to make the trek from California. Wang is a “social senior” and said she plans to walk with her friends at Commencement in May.
“For me [the weekend] was not too different. All my roommates are seniors, so I didn’t actually see too, too many parents,” Wang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 26, 2018 at 2:38 p.m.
Harvard College Faith and Action will need to sever ties with parent group Christian Union in order to re-earn recognition from the College at the end of its year-long administrative probation, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
The College placed HCFA—the largest Christian fellowship on campus—on a “one year administrative probation” last week. The Crimson reported Thursday that Harvard’s decision to punish HCFA was almost certainly linked to the organization’s move to oust a female member of the student leadership from her position in Sept. 2017 following her decision to date a woman.
Christian Union—a national organization that supports religious groups at all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford—currently provides HCFA with resources, funding, and ministry fellows to lead Bible courses; on its website, HCFA refers to Christian Union as its “parent ministry.”
Asked whether HCFA plans to end relations with Christian Union, HCFA co-presidents Scott Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18 wrote in an email Sunday that they do not currently have an answer given the College has yet to clarify the terms of the group’s “probation.”
“Though we continue to consider how HCFA’s relationship with the College will evolve, we’re unable to say specifically how we plan to respond given that we have yet to receive any formal communication from the College regarding our status or the changes it might entail,” the co-presidents wrote.
Don Weiss, a ministry director at HCFA employed by Christian Union, did not directly respond when asked the same question. Instead, he wrote in an email that Christian Union staff have “deeply appreciated” the chance to serve as ministers to Harvard students for the past decade. HCFA formed in 2008.
The College placed HCFA on probation because the group had “conducted itself in a manner grossly inconsistent” with Harvard’s rules for recognized student groups, according to College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman. Goldman added that, if the religious student group wishes to regain recognition in a year’s time, it must prove compliance with the Harvard’s “local governance” policies.
The Harvard College Student Handbook mandates that all recognized student groups maintain “local autonomy,” meaning they must make “all policy decisions” without obligation to any parent group, chapter, or charter.
Repeating past assertions, Ely and Richmond wrote in an email Sunday that Christian Union provides “pastoral care and spiritual counseling” to HCFA, but does not dictate the group’s policies.
“Harvard College Faith and Action is entirely autonomous from Christian Union. Our student leadership makes all decisions about HCFA, its people and its policies,” Ely and Richmond wrote. “HCFA was first approved by the Office of Student Life on that basis, and our governance structure has remained fully in the hands of undergraduates ever since.”
Weiss also asserted that HCFA is governed entirely by its student leaders.
“We have also been diligent to respect the autonomy of HCFA’s student leaders, as is required by Harvard for the group to be recognized as a student organization,” Weiss wrote.
Issues of local governance are not the only factor at play, however. College administrators also asserted HCFA must come into compliance with Harvard’s “nondiscrimination” policies in order to regain recognized status. These policies include the stipulation that recognized student groups cannot discriminate on the basis of “sexual orientation.”
Nonetheless, Ely and Richmond deny HCFA ever fell out of compliance with the College’s nondiscrimination standards.
The two wrote in a previous statement that they “reject any notion that we discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.” Ely and Richmond attributed the Sept. 2017 dismissal of the student to an “irreconcilable theological disagreement.”
Asked to elaborate, Ely and Richmond specifically pointed to HCFA’s stance on extramarital sex. The co-presidents asserted the group believes those in leadership positions must remain celibate, adding HCFA applies this policy “regardless of sexual orientation.”
But the woman who was asked to step down wrote in an email to The Crimson Friday that she and her girlfriend had never engaged in “extramarital sex.” The woman spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
“We’ve been fairly open in our conversations within HCFA about our decision to not have sex until marriage since the beginning of our relationship,” the woman wrote in the email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 27, 2018 at 1:53 a.m.
Student organizations on campus have a new place to turn for guidance this semester—Harvard’s newest consulting group, Crimson Consulting Club.
CCC launched this spring, joining Harvard’s plethora of student organizations and the handful of already existent student-run consulting groups. The group maintains a unique focus, though.
Instead of serving outside companies and organizations, CCC will focus inward—on advising other campus student groups.
Joshua Hawkins ‘18 and Michael Reid ‘18, two of the co-founders of the group, said started planning in August 2018. Other co-founders include Tristan Threatt '18 and Abdurezak Shemsu '18.
“The idea was so good because there were no other organizations like this on campus,” Reid said.
Reid said his experience serving on the board of the Black Men’s Forum taught him the need for a student-focused consulting group on campus.
“There are always times that I’ve had, where as a leader, I didn’t totally know what my role was supposed to be,” Reid said. “By the time my tenure ended, I realized there were a lot of things I could have been doing with the months that I had.”
Beyond addressing the needs of various student organizations, CCC also aims to provide a more accessible space to learn about the consulting world. Hawkins said he hopes CCC can encourage a more entrepreneurial spirit on campus and foster more exploration of the business world.
“A lot of people on Harvard’s campus don’t necessarily know what consulting is,” Reid said. “Aside from helping Harvard as a whole function better, it is also helping the students get more experience and more exposure that they don’t have right now.”
The CCC co-founders are both seniors, though, so they will only be involved as students for one semester. Hawkins said the two are working on setting up the board to ensure a smooth transition into the fall.
Reid, who recently started his own company, said he plans to stay involved after graduation.
The two hope CCC will help every Harvard student have a better experience.
“Everybody can come be a part of it; it’s not exclusive,” Reid said. “It’s one of those things purely made to make Harvard a better experience for everybody.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid chants of “Jobs not jails!” and sporadic hailstorms, about 20 members of Harvard’s Phillips Brooks House Association joined hundreds of “Dreams of our Future” protesters for the annual Youth Jobs Rally in Boston last week.
The march, which started in the Old South Church in Copley Square and ended at the State House, had three main goals, according to participants. First, protesters demanded an increase in funding from the state for youth jobs in Massachusetts from $10 million to $14 million a year.
Protesters also argued for expungement, meaning the erasure of misdemeanors from juveniles’ records after a certain period of time, and for altering the age of juvenile court jurisdiction to include ages 12 to 18.
The “I Have a Future” youth jobs coalition—which organized the march—argues that a $4 million spending increase for the state’s YouthWorks program should be a financial priority for Massachusetts.
“Young people need to be employed, partially to support their families and partially because there are pretty significant levels of violence and all sorts of other things in the city,” PBHA President Anwar Omeish ’19 said. “What we’re saying is that this should be a funding priority. Ultimately budgeting is a question of what do you think is most important.”
Cora A. Neudeck ’19, PBHA’s Advocacy, Health, and Programming Group Officer, said the state’s increase in minimum wage affected the program.
“There was a period of time when they raised the minimum wage from eight dollars to $11, but they never raised the overall funding, so they were paying people more, but they were able to pay less people,” Neudeck said. “So there were around 870 teenagers who lost funding for their jobs.”
Neudeck said PBHA supported the rally because YouthWorks funds the salaries of high schoolers who serve as “junior counselors” in PBHA’s Summer Urban Program. Neudeck also said the protest broadly aligns with PBHA’s social justice initiatives.
“Our Summer Urban Program has 12 camps and serves 800 low-income kids across Boston and Cambridge,” Omeish said. “We employ 100 teens as part of the program, and if we didn’t have the funding for those 100 teens we would only be able to serve about half of that, which is 400 low-income kids in the community.”
Jose G. Coronado Flores ’19, a PBHA member and director of the Mission Hill summer program, said there are now fewer summer jobs available for local students, including those from Mission Hill.
After marching through downtown to shouts of “This is what democracy looks like!” and “What do we want? Youth justice! When do we want it? Now!”,  demonstrators entered the State House, where they met in small groups with state legislators.
At the State House, Z-Kiya C. Jant, a sophomore at the Community Academy of Science and Health, a public high school in Boston, said the issue of youth employment is important to her personally.
“Within the community that I live in, there’s a lot of people who have moved towards negative outlets to gain money within the community to try to be successful and provide for their families,” she said. “And me being part of this organization, that’s me trying to say, 'No, you don't need to do that.'”
Adiel M. Pollydore, who helped plan the rally, said she attended the protest because she wanted to help empower young people to make changes.
“Today, I felt a very strong solidarity with the young people who are organizing in Florida right now, and also young people who have been organizing. Young people have organized in Ferguson, in Baltimore, all over,” she said. “I think that young people aren't afraid, and you can feel that energy, that fire, and that hope. It’s infectious. So that's why I'm here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed a resolution denouncing the actions of religious group Harvard College Faith and Action and affirming its support for BGLTQ students and affiliates at its meeting Sunday.
The resolution comes after the College placed HCFA on administrative probation last week  for violating guidelines laid out in the Student Handbook, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of “sexual orientation.”
The College's move to put HCFA—the largest Christian fellowship on campus—on a “one year administrative probation” was almost certainly tied to the student group's choice to pressure a female assistant Bible course leader to resign her position in Sept. 2017 following her pursuit of a same-sex relationship, The Crimson reported Thursday.
The resolution also called on HCFA's student leaders to issue a “prompt, public, and unconditional apology to our shared community” and to the former assistant Bible course leader.
“The actions taken by HCFA represent not only a grave affront to this College’s standards of nondiscrimination, but also to our vision of a society,” the resolution reads. “We fully support the College’s decision to place HCFA on administrative probation for the aforementioned reasons.”
Additionally, Finance Committee Chair Henry S. Atkins ’20 said during the meeting that HCFA will be prohibited from receiving funding from the UC’s finance committee until their probationary status is lifted.
The funding prohibition necessarily follows from the College's decision to put HCFA on probation—in effect, revoking the religious group's recognized status. According to the Council’s finance committee grant guidelines, “only officially recognized student groups in good standing with the Office of Student Life may apply for UC grants.”
“As far as HCFA goes, they are not gonna be getting a dime from us until the OSL determines that they should be removed from probation,” Atkins said. “I do not intend for them to receive anything from us in the meantime.”
Over the past three years, HCFA has received over $1,000 in Finance Committee grants to fund events including a study break, a formal dinner, and recruitment events.
Despite broad support for the resolution—which passed 35-3-1—council members sparred over whether or not the UC should invite HCFA leaders to speak during “Community Time” at a future Council meeting.
The UC had considered inviting HCFA leaders and Office of Student Life representatives to Sunday’s meeting, according to Slack messages obtained by The Crimson.
“[UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19] & I have decided to invite both the co-presidents of HCFA and a representative from the OSL to speak at community time this Sunday,” UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 wrote in a message to the finance committee Thursday.  “I believe that the community time speakers from both sides combined with a statement of support and the automatic suspension of FiCom funding will adequately address the situation without another explicit funding ban...”
Ultimately, Council executives decided against inviting HCFA leaders to the meeting after discussions with “administrative advisors,” according to Boucher.
Rules Committee Chair Wilfried J. K. Zibell ’21—who co-sponsored the legislation—said he did not believe HCFA leaders deserved time at UC meetings.
“We think that the purpose of Community Time is not to privilege the voices of the powerful,” he said. “While we do think it would be appropriate for the executive to have a conversation, we don’t think that extending legitimacy through community time... would be productive and would reflect poorly on the UC.”
“Privileging their voices is going to do nothing to help solve this,” Crimson Yard representative Sonya Kalara ’21 said.
Ely and Richmond did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Council legislation and meeting Monday evening.
Not all members agreed, though. Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18—another co-sponsor of the legislation—said he would be “happy” to invite representatives from HCFA.
HCFA co-presidents Scott Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18 denied in statements last Wednesday that the religious group discriminated based on sexual orientation. According to Ely and Richmond, the decision to remove the former assistant Bible course leader stemmed from an “irreconcilable theological disagreement” related to other issues like the group’s policy against extramarital sex.
The former assistant Bible course leader—who spoke only on the condition of anonymity—wrote in an email to The Crimson Friday that she and her girlfriend never engaged in "extramarital sex."
Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller and Ely—a former UC committee chair—both attended portions of the Council meeting during which members discussed HCFA.
Oak Yard representative Luke J. Kenworthy ’21, one of three representatives who voted against the resolution, said after the meeting he would like to hear from HCFA leaders directly. He said he thinks the group was well within its rights to remove the former assistant Bible course leader from her position.
“I think HCFA has the right to do what they did,” he said. “And also the College is allowed to no longer fund them.”
Oak Yard representative Ivan Vasquez ’21 and Kirkland House representative Parth Thakker ’18 also voted against the legislation.
Hours after The Crimson reported on HCFA’s probationary status on Thursday, Atkins proposed a motion to bar the religious group from receiving any UC funding—in addition to the mandated loss of finance committee funding—until the “administrative probation” ends and until the group demonstrates “contrition” about the incident. Atkins called for an “urgent” vote over Slack to docket the motion at 6:00 p.m. that night, according to Slack messages.
Later that evening, the motion failed to pass with 5 votes against and 3 votes in favor.
Atkins said the vote failed over concerns that the finance committee did not have the authority to prevent a group from receiving all UC funding and that the legislation was redundant given the OSL mandate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Assistant professors Joscha Legewie from Yale and Ellis P. Monk Jr. from Princeton will join Harvard's Sociology department as tenure-track professors in fall 2018, the department announced late last week.
Department Chair Jason Beckfield emailed department colleagues to announce the new hires, calling the duo a “smashing team win.”
“I’m really excited about both of them,” Beckfield said in an interview. “They’re two just fantastic new faculty members who are going to be joining us.”
Legewie studies social inequality, education, and criminal justice and focuses on “big data.” Monk researches race and inequality in the United States and Brazil. The two said their research overlaps and they are excited about the possibility of collaborating while at Harvard, something they have discussed in the past.
Legewie’s current research focuses on the impacts of “zero-tolerance policing” on the educational success of minority male youth. He explores how aggressive policing can foster educational disparities and distrust towards state institutions among minority communities.
Legewie said he hopes to teach undergraduate courses on the sociology of education, examining how education reduces or increases social inequality. He also hopes to teach a data and methods course on the growing field of big data in sociology.
Monk’s current research contrasts racial inequality in the U.S. and Brazil. He focuses primarily on a sociological concept called “bodily capital,” which he described as the relationship between the physical body, social categories, identity, and inequality.
Monk said he plans to teach a course on conceptions of race around the world.
“The main idea behind the course is to understand how racial inequality works in the U.S.,” Monk said. “It’s important to put the U.S. in global comparative contexts, so then we can understand what’s truly unique about the U.S.”
Legewie and Monk both said they were drawn to Harvard by the size and intellectual diversity of the University’s research community, as well as the Sociology department.
Monk also stressed the opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration with graduate schools and the African and African-American Studies department, where he hopes to cross-list some of his courses.
“There’s so many connections; it is such an exciting opportunity for me,” he added.
Sociology Professor and chair of the faculty search committee Robert J. Sampson said the department chose Legewie and Monk from a pool of several hundred applicants. He said one of the committee’s priorities was selecting candidates who take teaching very seriously.
“These are rising stars in the discipline in our opinion, so we’re really thrilled that they’ve accepted the job,” Sampson said. “Harvard students will be lucky.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A number of gritty singles performances and comeback attempts were unable to carry the Harvard women’s tennis team to victory this weekend, as it dropped a pair of matches to tough opponents at the Murr Center.
After a hard-fought loss to Boston College (5-3, 0-2 ACC) on Saturday, the Crimson (4-7, 0-0 Ivy) was unable to rebound and fell to a high-flying Syracuse squad (8-1, 1-1 ACC) the following Sunday morning.
“We had some tough matches,” junior Erica Oosterhout said. “Even though the score said we lost 6-1, it was a lot closer than that. Everybody was fighting to the bitter end.”
SYRACUSE 6, HARVARD 1
Sophomore Natasha Gonzalez picked up the lone victory in singles as Harvard fell to 4-6 on the season on Sunday morning.
The Orange jumped ahead quickly, taking the first and second doubles by scores of 6-1. Senior Annika Ringblom and freshman Anna Li were unable to capture a point against the No. 19 ranked Syracuse doubles tandem of Gabriela Knutson and Miranda Ramirez.
The Crimson came back and put up a strong fight in the singles category. Gonzalez only needed two sets to take the fourth singles set 6-4, 7-6.
In first singles, Oosterhout showcased her talent in a strong performance against the No. 18 ranked singles player, Knutson. Oosterhout was able to force a tiebreaker game in the first set before falling 7-6. Knutson took control in the second set eventually taking the match 7-6, 6-1.
Ringblom would not go down without a fight in third singles. After losing the tiebreaker match and the first set 7-6, Ringblom rebounded with a second set win, 6-4. Syracuse freshman Sofya Golubovskaya proved too strong as Ringblom fell in the third set.
“I’m actually very proud of everyone,” Oosterhout said. “Tennis matches are so up and down all the time and even though a few of us lost the first set… we were all able to turn it around and I think it’s great.”
BOSTON COLLEGE 6, HARVARD 1
The score of 6-1 proved to be Harvard’s downfall again as it fell to the Eagles Friday afternoon. A late push by the Crimson showed the overall grit of the team.
“There’s a lot of fight and a lot of heart on all the courts,” Gonzalez said. “That will definitely help us moving forward…We have the heart. We just need to [continue to] train to get there.”
The heart of the team definitely showed in Friday’s match. Boston College jumped ahead with first and second doubles wins. Harvard’s doubles duo of junior Isabel Jasper and freshman Neha Gupta stagnated the Eagles’ doubles sweep attempt with a victory in third doubles.
The Crimson went on to drop third and fourth singles, but refused to go away. With the support of her teammates, Oosterhout completed a three-set comeback against BC senior Asiya Dair.
“A lot of that goes to the team’s support,” Oosterhout said, “We have a few injured players even though they really can’t be on the court with us they really support with the cheering and it gets us all pumped up.”
Oosterhout rode the encouragement well, taking the subsequent sets 6-3, 6-4, en route to a first singles victory.
Ringblom built her own comeback as well. After falling in the first set 6-1, Ringblom rebounded in the second set with a 7-5 victory. Eagles sophomore Kylie Wilcox stood strong, however, taking the final set 6-4.
In sixth singles, Jasper fell in the first set 6-3. She evened up the match with a 6-3 win in the second set before falling 6-3 in the third set.
“Getting that last ball and that last deuce point, that’s [always] a turning point,” said Oosterhout.
Despite a tough loss, Harvard remains positive looking forward to Ivy League play.
“I think this weekend was good overall,” Oosterhout said. “And I think if we keep improving on it we’ll do well in Ivies. I think we really just have to focus on our matches coming up, especially during Spring Break. I think if we keep improving we’ll be in a good place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard skiing team competed in its final team competition in Middlebury, Vt. The Crimson Nordic and Alpine teams traveled north to compete in the 95th Annual Middlebury Carnival, the final race of the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association carnival season. Over the duration of Friday and Saturday, Harvard compiled a score of 241 points, coming in 11th place.
Next weekend, after accumulating 92 individual qualifier points throughout the season, junior Nina Armstrong will compete at the 2018 NCAA Championship.
On Friday, Harvard earned 104 points in the nordic classic races. Junior Hannah Hardenbergh turned in the highest finishes, taking 15th in the 5K with a time of 14:42.9.  Sophomore Tegan Thorley was next for the women, crossing the finish line in 15:12.9 and placing 29th. Armstrong was three seconds behind her and took home 31st. In her final collegiate 5K, senior Charlotte Cole placed 41st, completing the course in 15:33.1.
On the men’s side, sophomore William Rhatigan was the first finisher, completing the 10k classic race course in  26:03.4 for 34th place. In his last collegiate carnival 10K race, Senior Connor Green skied to a personal best of 27:38.4, placing 47th. Rounding out the men, sophomore Mackinley FitzPatrick, freshman Christopher O'Brien, and senior Haakon Sigurslid skied in a pack, finishing in 52nd, 53rd and 54th, respectively. Like Green, Sigurslid also set a course personal record in his final 10K classic race at Middlebury with a time of 28:49.7.
In day one of the Alpine races, freshman Nellie Ide and senior Kelly Steeves continued to lead the way for the women. Ide was Harvard’s top finisher, placing 37th against one of the most competitive fields in the country. Steeves rattled off two strong runs as well, as she placed 45th in her last Giant Slalom carnival race of her career.
Robert Dorfman was the only scorer for the men, placing 58th, though a teammate nearly joined him.
“Carter Kendig was 31st after GS first run, an incredible feat with course conditions that were terrible,” coach Scott MacPherson said. “He was going for it second run, but missed a gate and didn’t finish.”
On Saturday, Hardenbergh and Rhatigan led the nordic team again with impressive finishes. For the men, Rhatigan placed 36th with a time of 50:49.4 in the 20K freestyle. For the second time in one weekend, FitzPatrick placed 52nd. This time it was Green who crossed the finish line right after, taking 53rd.
The women all skied close together, with Hardenbergh leading the pack in 28th with a time of 43:19.4, and Armstrong, Thorley and Cole, coming in 31st, 35th, and 40th, respectively. In her final collegiate race, Cole’s time of 45:06.6 was an event personal record.
In Saturday’s Slalom race, seven Harvard skiers qualified for second runs. Finishing up strong collegiate skiing careers, seniors Steeves and Pieter Weemaes led the way for the women and men, respectively. In their final races for Harvard, Steeves placed 50th and Weemaes 47th. Junior Dennis Bao scored for the first time in a Middlebury Carnival, placing 54th. Sophomores Dorfman, Hornberg and Kendig placed 56th, 57th and 58th respectively.
“We spotlighted our tremendous seniors all weekend,” MacPherson said. “Kelly and Pieter are truly great ambassadors for our sport, our team, and Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Baseball teams across the nation are itching to get back on the diamond after the break, and the time has finally come.
The Harvard baseball team kicked off its 2018 campaign with a four-game set at Samford last weekend in Birmingham, Ala. The Crimson looked to begin its quest to improve upon last year’s 19-23 season with a fast start, but the Bulldogs (5-3) took three of four games to temporarily slow Harvard (1-3) down.
“First of all, it was absolutely amazing to be out on the field after all the work we’ve put in in the fall and a couple weeks in the spring,” said sophomore pitcher Kieran Shaw, who made his first career start against Samford. “It was awesome just to be out there with the guys, playing baseball, just being at the field in that environment, throwing the baseball around outside in some nice weather.”
The two teams treated fans to copious helpings of extra baseball upon the Crimson’s arrival at Joe Lee Griffin Field on Friday afternoon. Not only was a doubleheader scheduled, but both games went extra innings, forcing the squads to eventually play 25 total innings of baseball in one day. The two teams split Friday’s doubleheader before a drained Harvard squad lost both of Saturday’s games to drop the series.
“The first weekend is always a readjustment and a ‘get-adjusted’ period for any team, especially when coming out of the Northeast and playing in the bubble,” Shaw said. “We learned a lot of things about ourselves.”
At the end of the 2017 season, Samford was ranked 102nd on the NCAA Div. I RPI rankings, while the Crimson was ranked 189th. This weekend marked the first-ever meetings between the two teams.
SAMFORD 3, HARVARD 1 (SEVEN INNINGS)
The tail end of Saturday’s double-header was originally scheduled for Sunday, but was stacked on top of Saturday’s game due to weather. As tired as both teams were, the contest went the way of the Bulldogs, as Samford’s pitching duo of sophomore Hamp Skinner and junior Connor Burns held Harvard’s offense to just three hits once again.
“The first day, we had a lot of energy, but that’s something we need to work on coming into the second day of the series, as our bodies are tired and we might not be mentally a sharp,” Shaw said. “We’ve got to be able to come back strong, both physically and mentally.”
The Crimson’s lone run came off the bat of junior catcher Devan Peterson, who singled to right center to plate freshman DH Buddy Hayward.
Junior pitcher Kevin Stone, who went 4-2 and pitched the second-most innings on the team last year, tossed six innings of three-run ball, giving up eight hits and three walks. Stone was credited with the loss.
Hayward, for his part, went 2-for-3 at the plate with a run scored.
SAMFORD 8, HARVARD 0
Game one of Saturday’s doubleheader gave Harvard a preview of the pitching dominance that rolled over into the last game of the series.
Sophomore third baseman Hunter Bigge and junior center fielder Trent Bryan were the only Crimson players who were able to collect hits against Samford freshman pitcher Samuel Strickland. Bigge went 2-for-2 with a walk and Bryan went 1-for-2, but it all went for naught as no other Harvard players reached base.
On the other hand, the Bulldogs offense banged out 12 hits and got RBIs from six different players. Most of the damage came late in the game—after holding onto a 2-0 lead through the sixth, Samford broke it wide open by posting six runs in the seventh inning against senior pitcher Garrett Rupp.
Shaw got his first start of his college career and posted a solid five-inning outing, giving up two runs, six hits, and three free passes while striking out five. The sophomore righty still, however, noted room for improvement.
“To be honest, I didn’t have my best stuff out there on the mound,” Shaw said. “It was a grind and battle day for me. I never got into that happy place where it’s just boom, boom, boom…I’m happy with where I got to, but I know that I can play way better, and I know our team can play way better in a series.”
HARVARD 5, SAMFORD 3 (15 INNINGS)
The highlight of the Crimson effort came in Friday’s nightcap, as the visitors simply outwilled the home team in a brutally long game lasting nearly seven hours.
Junior first baseman Patrick McColl, the team leader last year in RBIs, finally drove in the winning two runs in the top of the 15th inning with a double to left field. The winning hit came off of Bulldog junior pitcher Jack Rude and put Harvard in front, 5-3.
“Whatever team could stick together for the longest is the one that’s going to come out on top,” sophomore shortstop Chad Minato said. “We just really came together in a defining game for our team. I think it boosted everybody’s morale going forward.”
Bigge, also a pitcher, got the W with two innings of scoreless relief work in extras. Junior Simon Rosenblum-Larson got the no-decision but sizzled in his first start of 2018, striking out eleven in six innings and allowing no walks.
On the offensive side, the Crimson struck first in the top of the sixth, as senior second baseman Matt Rothenberg tripled home leadoff man junior Ben Skinner and sophomore right fielder Jake Suddleson. Two innings later, Suddleson hit the team’s only home run of the weekend, a solo shot down the left field line.
However, Samford was able to respond both times, knotting up the score at two and then three as the game headed to extras.
SAMFORD 6, HARVARD 5 (10 INNINGS)
Harvard held multiple late leads but was unable to bring home the W, as ninth- and tenth-inning rallies by the Bulldogs befell the Crimson in the season opener.
Rothenberg, McColl, and junior P.J. Robinson all had multiple-hit days as the 2-4 hitters for Harvard, and senior pitcher Noah Zavolas pitched went seven innings, keeping his team in the game.
A three-run eighth gave the Crimson a 4-3 lead, but Samford knotted the game up in the bottom of the ninth to force extras.
With runners on the corners and no outs in the top of the tenth, Harvard managed to drive in a run to take a 5-4 lead, but back-to-back RBI doubles gave the home team a walk-off 6-5 win in the bottom half of the tenth.
