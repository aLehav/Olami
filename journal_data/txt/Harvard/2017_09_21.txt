After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Kennedy School of Government Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf threw into question the only word inscribed on the shields of both the Kennedy School and Harvard College: Veritas. I don’t speak Latin, but I know it means truth. Elmendorf’s decision to rescind Chelsea E. Manning’s fellowship at the Institute of Politics, while Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski keep the title, risks opening a tragic rift between our school’s professed values and its practices. At its most troubling, it suggests a commitment to self-interest over public interest, fake news over real news, and blind allegiance to power over the courage to follow one’s conscience. I came to HKS as a graduate student eager to fix a broken government. It seems that first, we students and alumni must fight to fix a broken school.
Spicer and Lewandowski both built a wall around the truth. On his first day at work, Spicer stood before the American people and brazenly lied about the size of his boss’s inauguration crowd. His assaults against the public’s right to transparency persisted almost daily, and he became a national anti-journalism caricature.
Lewandowski was charged with physically assaulting a woman reporter, and in the same month was criticized after he grabbed a protester at a Trump campaign rally.
Why should these two keep their fellowships when they lied and cheated the public to get ahead? Maybe veritas is a typo.
On the other hand, Manning is the textbook definition of a whistleblower acting in conscience for the greater good. After being sentenced to 35 years in prison, she said of her motives, “Whenever we killed innocent civilians, instead of accepting responsibility for our conduct, we elected to hide behind the veil of national security and classified information in order to avoid any public accountability.” We may be wise to judge the crime she committed against the crimes she exposed.
Manning risked her freedom to defend the public’s right to transparency, for, “Sometimes you have to pay a heavy price to live in a free society.” As an intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army in Iraq, she stole and leaked more than 700,000 classified documents. News organizations worldwide recognized the value of those leaked documents for the public interest and reported widely on them. A Department of Defense report released this year found that her actions didn’t harm U.S. interests, and President Obama granted her a commutation.
Despite having faced conditions that some say amounted to torture, she continues to enhance the public interest. Manning’s personal sacrifices for the sake of revealing inconvenient truths of government wrongdoing stand in stark contrast with the conduct of the IOP fellows listed above.
Dean Elmendorf’s reasoning for selectively rescinding Manning’s fellowship was that since, “people view a Visiting Fellow title as an honorific... we should weigh, for each potential visitor, what members of the Kennedy School community could learn from that person’s visit against the extent to which that person’s conduct fulfills the values of public service to which we aspire.” However, his specific reasons for judging Manning’s unworthiness compared to other fellows remain totally opaque.
Like other students and alumni with whom I have spoken, this logic leaves me dumbfounded and dissatisfied. I was in the Forum hours before Elmendorf reversed his decision, waiting to hear Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo speak, when the dean announced at the last minute the talk was canceled. I agree with those who weighed the evidence and found that, despite the dean’s dizzying logic, the real reason why Manning’s fellowship was rescinded was that the CIA and other powerful actors that are committed to government secrecy applied enormous pressure to reverse his decision. Twice in two days, conservative forces apparently swayed Harvard to reject a new recruit. Again, it seems the truth was twisted.
There is deep distrust of government across our country and world today. The dean’s statement said we don’t have much to learn from Manning, but it seems her fellowship may have been axed for the opposite reason. Many of my fellow classmates will go on to work at high levels of government and finance. Manning’s moral leadership might inspire the next great whistleblower. It would not be surprising to learn that powerful Harvard donors fear this prospect, as well as beneficiaries like the CIA who expect obedient recruits.
As a school of government committed to the public interest, it’s time to value transparency and commit to exposing wrongdoing by our nation’s most powerful actors. What better place to start than here? In order to align our school’s values with its actions, I believe that all IOP fellowships should be immediately rescinded until a transparent process involving students and other stakeholders creates clear criteria for offering such fellowships. Students have started circulating a petition to this end. We should also develop a transparent process involving students in selecting the next director of the IOP. These steps can start empowering students to make government serve the public over the powerful, and help uphold Harvard’s most-proclaimed value: Veritas.

To the Editor:
In his article, “From Prison to Ph.D.,” published last week in the New York Times, Eli Hager argued that Harvard University did not give Michelle Jones a fair review, owing to her criminal record. 
Hager writes for the Marshall Project, an advocacy group that seeks to “create and sustain a sense of national urgency about the U.S. criminal justice system,” according to its website.
In developing his argument, Hager said that “top Harvard officials” rejected Jones’s admission “out of concern that her background would cause a backlash among rejected applicants, conservative news outlets, or parents of students.”
This is simply wrong.  It misrepresents what I emphasized in my interview, which was that Jones’s Ph.D. application garnered widespread support, including my own, despite concern about possible backlash.
Hager further suggested that the memo my colleague, Daniel Carpenter, and I circulated was a highly unusual procedure.  In fact it was standard procedure. In the past fifteen years, I have regularly contacted deans over questions I’ve had in admissions cases, and their feedback has been invaluable.  In Jones’s case, while Professor Carpenter and I continued to support her candidacy, we noted some discrepancies that merited additional investigation.
Unlike Chelsea Manning, whose visiting fellowship was rescinded, Michelle Jones never received an admissions offer from Harvard. Jones’s case became front-page news only because the Marshall Project, which encourages leaks, received some, and then distorted facts in the service of its advocacy goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After facing criticism for charging students exorbitant textbook fees, Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who teaches the most enrolled course at the College, Economics 10, announced that he would donate all royalties from his course materials to charity. While we support his decision to donate some of the profits from his popular textbook, this approach also seems to ignore the crux of student complaints about the notoriously high cost of enrolling in Ec10.
Unlike most Harvard courses, which allow students to purchase textbooks secondhand and thus reduce the costs associated with a given class, Ec10 requires all students to buy new books—priced at $131 each—in order to receive an access code to its online software, MindTap. As we have opined in the past, this requirement can put Ec10 out of reach for students.
The promise of Harvard College, and the liberal arts education it provides, is that students should have the ability to pursue any academic interest and enroll in any course. High textbook prices prevent students from having that academic freedom, placing those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds at a disadvantage. This is compounded by the fact that both Social Studies and Economics, two popular concentrations, require Ec10. Ironically, the price of the course materials place students under financial strain in order to learn basic economics.
Mankiw’s decision to donate the royalties from his textbook sales thus sidesteps the root cause of student complaints. The issue is not that Mankiw collects royalties from a textbook he wrote. The issue is that his course prohibits students from buying that book secondhand. The solution to this issue is exceptionally simple, and Mankiw’s continued reluctance to address it, and decision to instead donate his royalties, is a serious flaw in one of Harvard’s largest and most prominent courses.
Ec10 could remove MindTap—the problem set software—from its course requirements, thus enabling students to buy their books secondhand. MindTap had numerous glitches and errors last year, and it is hard to justify the cost of what is essentially a glorified multiple-choice quiz. Alternatively, or additionally, as Mankiw seems willing to give up his royalties from textbook sales, he could subsidize his textbook cost for students, opening the doors of Ec10 to those who might otherwise choose cheaper courses and fields of study.
This is a question of, as Ec10 would phrase it, marginal utility. Mankiw has done well enough for himself from his teaching and textbook sales that donating some of the proceeds is small burden to him. For students, who often struggle to afford basic learning materials, the marginal utility of saving $131 is much higher. We urge the Ec10 staff to make an effort to lower their costs—indeed remembering the very lessons taught in their course.
As we revisit the ongoing issue of Ec10 textbook prices, we are reminded of our appreciation for professors that make their classes financially accessible. Many Harvard course heads provide scans of texts or offer low-cost options, and we urge Mankiw to follow their example.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My freshman year, I lived in a triple. My roommates were not like me. One of them is famous for her warmth and hospitality—we all call her “mom.” She’s Muslim, ethnically Sudanese, and from Alabama. The other is a passionate libertarian and one of the most articulate people I know. She’s Catholic, ethnically Romanian, and from Kansas. And then me—sarcastic and excellent at Netflix bingeing. I am Muslim, ethnically Pakistani, and from Baltimore.
Our room was crowded, but we found enough space for each of us, whether that meant making time for a college football game, displaying the Constitution on the wall, or playing a Kanye album on repeat. Over the course of the year, I got used to the rhythm of Arabic every night and hour long “libertarian rants” almost as often. I got used to 2 a.m. conversations where we learned more about each other. We compared our mother tongues of Arabic, Romanian, and Urdu to find commonalities—some of which, like the word for “enemy,” proved helpful when we were around others. We went to Harvard-Yale together, and later in the month, attended the Harvard Islamic Society’s Fall Dinner.
Though I’ve lived in America my entire life, that room was the first time I experienced the oft-repeated American ideal of “diversity.” My triple was what America claims to be: a space in which people of all colors, cultures, and religions come together to grow and learn from each other. American diversity is defined by imagery—a man in a turban and a woman with blonde hair walking side by side on a New York City street; the President of the United States, bending as a child touches his hair.
However, when faced with the tangible reality of this country, these images fade away and the ideal of diversity is revealed to be a myth. In reality, American diversity is contingent upon assimilation and contortion. Unlike my triple, America is not a room in which Arabic, Romanian, and Urdu can be spoken side by side. It is a country where English is the dominant language and mother tongues are meant to be forgotten. America is not a place in which “foreign” cultures are recognized (other than on the streets of Chinatown or the racks of Forever 21). It is a place in which cultural and religious clothing on the bodies of brown people is seen as invitation for harassment or even assault.
It is not a place in which black and brown people can claim physical space, as evidenced by the many controversies over the construction or even the presence of mosques across the country. It is not a place in which people of color are seen as multi dimensional human beings. Instead, it is a country in which Trump supporters are humanized, while minorities who speak are told not to play identity politics. It is one in which representation of my identity, when present at all, is limited to watered down stereotypes.
American diversity ultimately seeks to uphold white supremacy both domestically and internationally. It does so by limiting the expression of other cultures so that whiteness remains the default within these borders. And it does so by using the presence of black and brown bodies in the United States to create the image of a free country that has the moral high ground to impart—or impose—this freedom internationally. It tokenizes minorities who support an agenda that harms their own people, while silencing voices that challenge it.
These tokenized minorities grant cross-cultural legitimacy to the campaign of white supremacy, and represent the interests of whiteness, not the communities they claim to represent. They include the first Indian governor, who said that “immigration without assimilation is an invasion.” They include a black president who institutionalized drone strikes that killed scores of civilians in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Contrarians are denied a voice, however mainstream they may be. As Linda Sarsour gains popular support, she has received backlash across political lines. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, in contrast, is honored by Harvard and Stanford despite her continual Islamophobic rhetoric. After Reza Aslan tweeted against Donald Trump, CNN dropped his show—the same network that gave Corey Lewandowski, who has been accused of sexual assault, a platform.
Ultimately, the promise of American diversity is contingent on assimilation to whiteness. It’s contingent on people of color contorting their identity and beliefs to fit this narrative. Those who push back are pushed out. And so, in this America, I speak English, I wear jeans, I eat hot dogs. In this America, I spent my childhood not wearing henna on Eid, because I didn’t want to field even more questions at school. In this America, I avoided cultural and religious affinity groups because I didn’t want to be that girl whose only friends are Muslims.
This America is so much bigger than that one room that housed three girls. Yet somehow, I had so much more space in that room. Outside of it, I have found my arms crossed, shoulders hunched, lips sealed. In this America, I force myself to write and to speak and to stand straight. I force myself to stop the contortions and quit the balancing act. I don’t always succeed. But I know that if I stop trying, I too will shrink.

Welcome to CS50. My name is Javid D. Malan, but if ‘Malan’ is too hard to pronounce, you can just call me your one-way, all-expense-paid trip on the choo-choo train to knowledge-town. It doesn’t take a man who can rip a Yellow Pages in half with his bare, muscular hands to know that CS50 saw quite a bit of Missy ‘Misdemeanor’ Elliot last semester. As a result, I’m afraid I’m going to have to pull out the big guns. Prepare your pickles, humble ne’er-do-wells, for my updated course policy.
Attendance
If you are enrolled in my class, you actually have to come to my lectures. No longer can you be in my class and not be in my class. This isn’t Schrödinger’s Class, Bubble Bass. This is CS50™. And don’t be too intimidated to show up. Last fall, of the 636 students who enrolled in CS50, an average of 3.4 students actually attended each lecture. Of those 3.4 students, at least two were confirmed by a questionable source to be paid Romanian actors. The other 1.4 were dead. Within that group of Romanian actors and legally dead people, 2.166 had zero prior coding experience. 
Grading
Problem sets, as always, are worth 45 percent of your grade. Exams, 30 percent of your grade. Containing some sort of ‘life essence’ as defined by Hans Driesch in his seminal 1899 work “Die Lokalisation morphogenetischer Vorgänge Ein Beweis vitalistischen Geschehens,” 10 percent. And of course, the final project is 15 percent of your grade. You may notice some slight changes from last year, notably that your exams are now collectively worth 30 percent of your grade instead of the usual 40 percent.
Collaboration
You may have heard that CS50 was home to a pretty widespread cheating scandal last semester. You won’t be hearing that anymore, or my name isn’t Javid D. Malan. Our new collaboration policy in CS50 is simple: be reasonable. Here are some examples. If you’re working on a problem set and you ask your best friend what his thought process is for question four, is that reasonable? I might be inclined to say so. If you’re working on that very same problem set and you ask your best friend to answer question four for you in its entirety, is that reasonable? Probably not. If you're working on a problem set and you lean in real close to your best friend, the dewy condensation from your just-Listerine’d breath speckling the nape of his neck, and whisper that you have his life’s destiny sitting neatly in the palm of your hand, ready to crack down on his every ambition like the expertly-painted teeth on a Turkish nutcracker doll during the Yuletide cheer preparing to shatter the once-durable shell of his walnut of self-worth, and that all of his troubles would disappear in a flash should he help you with question four—is that reasonable? Probably.

For some, the word “Leftist” might conjure up images of students in disarray, clutching back issues of “Jacobin” and volumes by Trotsky as they hurry between critical theory class, revolution planning, and meetings with shadowy unknowns.
Kevin English ’20 is a Leftist, but he’s a bit more low-key. He’s sitting pensively on an old grey chair in the Kirkland House courtyard, wearing a nondescript t-shirt and athletic shorts. He looks solemn. He wouldn’t strike you as the type of person who would start a Leftist Club.
English’s Leftist Club is a bi-monthly discussion group that will be an official club as soon as English collects the requisite 10 signatures. The club, open to anyone, will teach members about modern Leftism, hold conversations about forms of government, and serve as a general forum for all things politically and socially Left. Besides conversation, English plans to use the club as a platform for activism, outreach, and guest speakers.
English says the idea came to him and a friend when they took a deeper look into Harvard’s political clubs.
“The Dems weren’t left enough, and they have a group. Then there’s the Harvard Republicans, and they have a group. And there was no group for Leftists,” English says.
Harvard has had Leftist student clubs in the past, including American Youth for Democracy, the John Reed Club, and Students for a Democratic Society. Now adays, he says, neither the College Democrats nor the Student Labor Action Movement are explicitly Leftist in the way English wants his club to be.
English’s view is that America’s agitated relationship with Leftist politics has saddled them with a stigma that has not yet washed away. He thinks it explains why groups have been hesitant to align themselves with that label.
“It’s because of the stigma of viewing the Left as radicals who aren’t willing to work with anybody. And also the stigma of being labelled as a Leftist, potentially. If you want to pursue a career in politics, and you get labelled as a Leftist, that can ruin your career because people are like, ‘Oh, that’s not an American thing!’” English says.
At least on the campus level, English himself is pursuing a career in politics, too. He’s a newly elected Undergraduate Council representative for Kirkland House, though he says his campaign wasn’t based on a Leftist platform and is unrelated to his club initiative. He admits, however, that his campaign was “all about fighting for the people,” so maybe there is a common theme.
Through the Leftist Club, English hopes to alleviate the stigma around the concept of Leftism. Part of that is inviting Leftist “economists or political theorists or people who are actually in the government” in order to show students that Leftism is thriving.
“A lot of the Leftist stuff that’s out there is older political theory, like Marx and Lenin. That’s what most people read,” he says. “I think it’d be interesting to get more of a modern perspective on a lot of the stuff.”
The more he talks about Leftism, the more English’s voice adopts a spontaneous, improvisatory quality. He’s full of ideas for the future of the Leftist Club, and confident  that he can eventually pull them all off.
English still doesn’t seem like the type of person who would start a Leftist Club. But maybe that’s the point.

The highway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem stretched onward before me, as I sat once again on the late-night bus. Returning from a weekend of beaches and couch-surfing to my long-term hotel in West Jerusalem, I sat far in the back to avoid the other nocturnal travelers. I couldn’t see the pavement, and the dull streetlights hardly illuminated the cars, but I had done the drive enough times to know exactly where along the road I was. The solitude of the moment—listening to music that didn’t make me think, without anyone in the seat beside me to stop me from stretching my legs—was so meditative it was intoxicating. I should travel alone more often was the only substantial thought that crossed my mind during the hour-long ride.
A few weeks later, I arrived at the Haifa International Airport—a small, one-room terminal with a duty-free shop selling Snickers bars and microwaved pizza. Only one flight was scheduled to leave for the rest of the day: a small plane to Cyprus, an island a short distance across the Mediterranean from the Israeli coast. All summer I had been working on schemes to convince my parents that this was a trip I could do alone. I had, after all, done all the research possible by reading every website that popped up when I searched “female solo traveler Cyprus.” I was sure that, if it was just me, I could have the fulfilling cliché summer budget-travel experience I had read about in novels. Alas, my parents informed me that without at least one travel companion, the trip was out of the question.
I had acquired two travel buddies whom I barely knew—also American college students living and interning in Israel for the summer. Our early small talk went far deeper than any other introductory conversations I’d had. I was grateful that these two were willing to let me tag along for a trip they’d been planning long before I had invited myself to come. But I was still skeptical that this trip could really live up to my expectations.
I was convinced that traveling solo was the only way to see everything I wanted to see without making concessions to others. I wanted to spend as much time as possible in my beloved meditative bus-ride state, so I too could “find myself” like everyone else who’s travelled alone told me they had. I’ve always enjoyed the freedom to live by my own schedule, and so I wanted to prove, to nobody in particular, that I was grown up enough to do this on my own.
When we stepped off the bus from the airport to the coastal town of Limassol late at night, one of my fellow travelers found us a cab driver who spurted information about what to see during our few days on the island. Had I been alone, the ride would have been silent; I would have learned nothing. Deeper into the night, after strolling along the dark streets of the town to find prime Cypriot snack food, we stumbled upon some other young travelers who took us out drinking and dancing. When we returned to the hostel, one of my travel companions and I stayed up until 3 a.m. talking about life in a way that made me feel like I was back on the bus—tranquil and whole. Had I been alone, I would’ve gone to sleep the moment I arrived—an unfamiliar city late at night is no place I would have felt comfortable roaming on my own.
As heavy and mature as the idea of traveling alone made me feel, the days on the beaches, in the historic cities of the island, and in the company of others made me feel lighter, like a young whimsical traveler in the way I had wanted to feel. From my travel companions, both older than me, I learned about everything from making the most of college, to coping with struggles no one knows you have, to asking strangers for directions and car rides, to letting go of the idea that knowing exactly what you’re doing and where you’re going every second of every day is the only way to ensure you’ll be okay. I learned that I could be with others and still find the moments of solitude I was craving—nothing is better than stargazing silently while still having someone beside you to point out the shooting star you might’ve missed. I learned that even though I thought I had to be alone to figure out my thoughts, sometimes another person can help you sort them out.
There is nothing wrong with traveling solo—from everything I have heard and read about it, it seems like a truly fulfilling experience. As someone who has always prioritized my own sense of independence, I was certain there was no other way for me to see the world. But three days on a tiny island in a small sea on the other side of the world made me realize that the companionship I thought I didn’t want became something I could not possibly have gone without. I’ll still always love my silent bus rides with plenty of legroom, but from now on I’ll make sure I have a friend in the row behind me to join me when we step off together at our destination.

It was just a usual Saturday goodtime, nothing else. Cambridge glowed red before our eyes—the screaming 71 bus, gals cutting by, the hundreds occupying the emptiness of space—all reflected in blended neon colors on the window of the Crimson Cruiser.
It was Big Ed, Dean, Bull, and I bustling with our cigarettes and sunglasses leaping like jack-in-the-boxes at the Widener Gate. “Now we must run and jump and see the quad and the people and smell the world!” Bull yelled, his face shadowed by a three-day-old beard and an enormous black Panama hat concealing a flask of Jack. “Ah God! Life! Don’t worry ‘bout nothing,” Big Ed belted as he wobbled unstably and sucked at a joint, smoke rising in the goldenness of the afternoon of time.
The doors squealed open and we bounced in a jiffy onto the 5 p.m. Crimson Cruiser, pulling ole Bull in behind us just as everyone was tooting to go. Funny thing about Bull: He’s always rearing onto the next bender until he pulls out his horn and starts grooving like a Charlie-Parker-type cool cat. “The mere sound and serious exuberance of the music is all I care about,” he groaned as Dean grabbed his sweat-stained shirt. Ed snuck me some blow he got from this international cocaine set in Berlin, and we boogied to Bull’s hot licks as that mad shuttle roared down Mass Ave.
Dean pulled out his hot plate and started boiling down codeine cough syrup into a black mash, hooting like a maniac. He wore one of those Kentucky Derby hats, a vest with nothing underneath, and salmon shorts. Bull was sweating and hitching up his horn and writhing into it, and a tone just like Lester Young himself flew like a bird into the Crimson Cruiser. Ed hummed the Star-Spangled Banner, his face coated in a thick layer of mud from the Mississippi River, the lifeblood of America.
The sun slanted, the bugs flip-flopped, the pavement groaned under the weight of life which is the one true essence of mind. Dean screeched as he burned his tongue on the hot syrup.
As I watched Bull flip his Panama hat to get to the liquor, I remembered the first time I met the kid. It was First Chance Dance, a hootchy-kootchy little shindig with a little jazz and a whole lot of bebop. Things were simpler then. The gals, the good boys, the sweet digs, the children of tomorrow all looking out onto the shimmering essence of the Northwest Laboratory building. The Pfoho belltower is a much lonelier place. A single tear rolled down my face, forming an unpleasant paste with the cocaine that remained on my upper lip.
The Crimson Cruiser squealed to a halt, and the boys jumped out into the American night like mad beboppers out for a gig. But I stopped for a moment. As the sun was reddening, I realized this was one of those distinct times in my life, those strangest of moments, when I didn’t know who I was. I was far away from my home (Mather, what a trek), haunted and tired with travel, in a strange quad, hearing the shouts from the parties, and footsteps upstairs, and all the happy yet sad sounds, and I looked at the shuttle ceiling and really didn’t know who I was for about fifteen odd seconds. I wasn’t scared; I was just somebody else, some stranger, and my whole life was a haunted life, the life of a ghost.
“You grooving?” asked Ed, barely audible through the eight strips of Benzedrine he was chewing.
I thought for a moment—a cold moment.
“Skiddlyboop,” I said with a nod, and leapt ever forward into the night.

Randy Ricker, owner of Brattle Square Florist, clearly remembers his first Valentine’s Day in the shop. The store had more than 400 orders to be delivered to lovers across Cambridge, and no digital organizational system in place whatsoever. “Brattle Square Florist is run like it’s 1930,” Ricker says. Ricker is hardly exaggerating—he uses a computer for billing, but he and his staff write all other pertinent information on slips of paper that are tacked on a wall following some indistinguishable system of organization. The shop does have a “Rolodex,” as Ricker jokingly dubs a section of wall covered with business cards and phone numbers.
Ricker was doubtful that the shop would be able to handle the Valentine’s Day rush, but the shop’s haphazard system was up to the task, as it has been since 1917. He soon let go of any reservations he had about the shop’s analog operations. “I would wager a large sum of money that we have fewer errors than most modernly run shops,” Ricker says.
Brattle Square Florist shows few signs of changing with the times. It’s had 100 years to perfect its operations. The shop was originally run by three Greek brothers who cycled through a series of storefronts: produce, ice cream, and ultimately, the flower shop. For three generations, the business remained in the family, until it was sold to Ricker in early 2013.
When Ricker left his 20-year career in corporate staffing and recruiting five years ago to buy a business, he had a certain set of criteria: the business had to be well-established, with a small number of employees. In the case of the flower shop, that staff also needed to be full of “people who knew flowers, because I didn’t,” Ricker says with a laugh.
Though Ricker had to learn on the job, Brattle Square had no shortage of floral experts. The shop was previously run by Stephen Zedros, a third-generation Brattle florist who still works in the shop and has become something of a “legend of Harvard Square,” says Ricker. Zedros’ expertise, along with that of the other longtime employees of Brattle Square Florist, allowed Ricker to grow his knowledge of flowers and plants. “When you’re thrown in the water you learn how to swim,” Ricker says. After five years on the job he feels “90 percent [able] to handle anything that comes in.”
Perhaps that’s not surprising given the shop’s wide selection. The long and narrow space is chock-full of flowers sold by the stem and bundled in bouquets alongside a wide variety of potted plants. An impressive array of succulents is displayed near the store’s entrance; “they’re super trendy,” Ricker says, and they have “a great shelf life” which is essential in the plant business. “A lot of plants die on our watch,” Ricker says, due to the wide variety of water and sunlight requirements, so he likes “plants that hang tough.” In corners of the store, employees delicately arrange elegant floral centerpieces for weddings.
The flowers that Brattle sells come from all over the world. Before they get to Cambridge, though, they usually make a stop in Miami. Trucks then make the long haul up the east coast so that thousands of flowers can be delivered to the shop every morning. Initially, the stems lie lifeless, packed dozens to a box, but after the staff “gives them a drink,” as Ricker says, the flowers perk right up and are mixed into the storefront’s vibrant display.
The shop is an old-fashioned stronghold in Harvard Square’s tumultuous real estate environment. A number of buildings stretching along Brattle Street are up for sale by the family trust that owns them. If sold, that neighborhood of Harvard Square could change radically. Ricker emphasized that Cambridge’s zoning laws could allow the cozy storefronts to be turned into multi-story buildings.
Ricker says he doesn’t dwell too much on that possibility because he “can’t do anything about it.” Nestled in a rapidly-changing Harvard Square, Brattle Square Florist keeps a “multigenerational” clientele, Ricker says. There is no typical customer; patrons range “from the ritziest Brattle Street customers to a poor student who just needs a couple flowers in her dorm room,” Ricker says.
Kids, in particular, are captivated by the colorful array of plants and flowers. The shop’s youngest customers “get excited about coming into the store, and that carries through for their entire lives,” Ricker says. “It’s definitely part of the community.”

“Wanna try the new Grateful Burger?”
The HUDS employee at Quincy Grille smiles over a platter of cuboidal tidbits. “It’s a healthy and sustainable alternative to your traditional beef burger,” he says.
As a carnivore from Los Angeles, arguably the vegan capital of the world, I am not about to waste time nor calories on another quinoa, kale, kombucha, or beetroot concoction.
But the HUDS employee doesn’t give up. As I’m halfway out the door, he calls out: “USDA chuck and sirloin beef, portabellas, and [insert litany of spices he probably made up]!” I don’t know if I have ever done a quicker 180 in my life. That’s what meat can do to me, I guess.
So I let the vendor take his shot with this “Grateful Burger.” Boy, was I grateful.
I know this particular adjective is highly contentious and aurally displeasing, but there’s only one way to describe the new HUDS special: MOIST! After one bite, a flood of beef, mushroom, and spicy juices were flowing into my gullet. It looked moist and tasted moist; even the bun was like a moist sponge on a moist summer day.
Most importantly: Each burger saves our planet 250 gallons of water, as more than 1800 gallons are needed to grow a single pound of pure beef.
Mouth feeling a bit dry? Head to your house dhall and give the new moist Grateful Burger a try.

Despite its appearance and name, a Grateful Burger does not taste like a regular burger. It tastes like beef pumped with chalk, which I suppose is the idea.
The meat-to-mushroom ratio is so terrifyingly off—50% too much mushroom, to be precise—that the aftertaste demands you right the wrong. You need to pick up another burger, a real one, to chase it down. Grateful Burger’s cardinal sin is that it makes you want to eat more meat.
Still, you can also imagine Grateful Burger as a transitional vegetarian plot to abolish burgers forever. It starts with a 50-50 meat-to-mushroom ratio, which sounds almost reasonable. Next, it’s 25-75. You want to stop global warming, so you go for it. (Cattle flatulence releases 4.6 gigatonnes of methane a year.)
Then, it’s 10-90, but the livestock industry is dead, global warming is still marching on, and you have no source of meat besides Grateful Burger. And when the ratio hits 0-100, a giant shiitake cap is on your plate, wilting between two sad slices of bread, a ketchup smiley face. Some call it a burger. Others tell legends of the braver, more honorable, authentic burgers that once were.

At age 14, Alan M. Dershowitz was working in a New York deli, tying the knots between hot dogs as they came out of the machine. Thirty-five years later, after becoming the youngest full professor at Harvard Law School, Dershowitz decided to bring hearty kosher meats to Harvard Square.
The idea came about as a dare, made when Dershowitz and his friend, Boston lawyer Marcus S. Weiss, were vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard in the early 1980s. Weiss flipped through The New York Times, landed on an article about Jewish delis, and whined, “What I would give for a really good corned beef sandwich in the Boston area!”
Dershowitz, who also lamented the dearth of Boston-area delis, halfheartedly dared his friend to open one. Weiss wholeheartedly accepted the challenge.
The two were no strangers to the world of quality cold cuts. After the hot dog job, Dershowitz had taken jobs at another deli, eventually rising through the ranks to serve on their catering team. Weiss grew up working at his parents’ deli in Atlantic City.
The two spent several years after their Martha’s Vineyard agreement seeking partners, and eventually found 14 investors who were down for the cause.
In May 1988, Dershowitz and Weiss opened Mavens Kosher Court: a classic Jewish eatery complete with sturdy booths, framed photos of famous NY diners, and a corned beef sandwich for $6.95. The building was located at 95 Winthrop Street.
Weiss served as the general manager of the store, coming in before and after his work at the law firm and a few times at 3 a.m. to fix the store’s alarm. Dershowitz oversaw lunch hours. Their nephews, according to Weiss, were their most important support staff. “It was a labor of love,” Weiss says.
Mavens’ most popular sandwich was the Talmudic Dilemma: “If you can’t decide, on one hand get a half corned beef, and on the other get a half pastrami,” the menu says. But the Restricted Club sandwich (no bacon) carried the greatest significance: Maven’s opened in the former location of the now-defunct Pi Eta Speakers Club, an honor society which, Dershowitz says, was  closed to Jews.
During the warm summer months, lines would sometimes extend down the block. While customers waited, “we would serve them chopped liver on slices of rye,” Weiss recalls. 
But as the winter months came, customers were fewer   and farther between. Mavens originally closed on Friday nights and Saturdays, because they were trying to serve the Orthodox Jewish community. By November, due to a significant decrease in revenue, the owners decided to forgo strict kosher certification in order to keep the business afloat.
“I thought of myself as something of a deli maven. But I was obviously not a business maven,” Dershowitz says.
Reflecting, Dershowitz says that their original goal––to offer good food at a good price––was impossible, given the costs of importing premier deli ingredients from New York to Boston. “We could not maintain the quality we wanted to maintain at a price that students could afford,” Dershowitz says.
Despite having generous mentors—including operators of S&S deli in Inman Square and Abe Lebewohl of the famed 2nd Ave Deli in New York—Weiss says he made some costly rookie mistakes, such as buying brand new kitchen equipment when buying secondhand would have been a fraction of the cost. He also cites high turnover in the deli staff as a challenge.
Mavens Kosher Court closed eight months after it opened.
Though it may have been short-lived, the venture was what deli dreams are made of. From hosting Red Auerbach—the coach of their beloved Boston Celtics team—and musicians like Peter Wolf and Yo-Yo Ma, to striving for their mothers’ stamp of approval, Dershowitz and Weiss recall Mavens with a great fondness.
Weiss may consider a more humble endeavor when he retires. “As my father warned me,” Weiss says, “If you’re not going to be there full-time, you really can’t be a successful restaurateur.”

Mount Auburn Street is a case study in sensory overload. In the morning, the sidewalks overflow as students—heads down, phones up—spill out into the street, ignoring honking horns and raised middle fingers because that lecture aisle seat isn’t going to claim itself. Tour buses line the curb, fitting together like tall, sleek train cars as their passengers exit, eager and excited to form a train of their own. The Lowell House construction provides an unwelcome soundtrack for the scene, much like that guy who got his hands on the aux cord at the party. Just one song. No, no, this one is a jam. But you haven’t heard The Lumineers’ new stuff, man.
If you look down past your phone, you’ll see the sidewalk bricks play a game of reverse Whack-a-Mole, rising unevenly out of the ground to fight back against your steps. Even if you survive the cars and the middle fingers and the tourists and that tenth Lumineers song, they still seem to say, screw you. Your foot strikes a particularly raised brick. You stumble. You look around but shake it off. Surely no one saw. (Someone saw.) Some find this scene of urban chaos overwhelming. 
We like to use the word “overwhelming.” My workload is overwhelming. My extracurricular commitments are overwhelming. The controversy surrounding the 47th Annual Grammy Awards in 2005 when John Mayer’s “Daughters” beat Alicia Keys’ “If I Ain’t Got You” in the Song of the Year category even though Alicia fought, really fought, for a stunning sophomore album was overwhelming. 
But I couldn’t understand anyone being overwhelmed by Mount Auburn Street, because anyone could put in headphones or walk and talk with a friend or take a different path to the Yard or just be happy that the tourists are happy. And that’s okay. It’s okay that someone or something is doing their thing and you’re doing your thing. The other sidewalks have fewer raised bricks, anyway.
At night, Daytime Mount Auburn Street goes to bed early. After all, it has class and tours and construction in the morning. But the area doesn’t get much quieter. The sidewalks still overflow with students, either going to party at a final club or eat at El Jefe’s or to party at a final club then eat at El Jefe’s. Shivering figures replace the tour busses on the curb, all of them sporting the OOTN: short dresses, tall heels. The clanging of the Lowell construction has given way to a mix of Billboard 100 and 2010 house music, and its steady hot pulse escapes through open windows only to clash with the noise of a neighboring club. The sounds blend on Mount Auburn Street, right over my head.
And I keep walking. I’m off to an open party or to a bar or to a friend’s room or to a late-night food spot. Sometimes, my night has already wrapped up and I’m walking with friends back to Mather. Most times, I’m not wearing a short dress or tall heels or listening to 2010 house music.
We often fixate on what others are doing: refresh Friday evening Snapchat stories as quickly as we can, scroll through our newsfeed on Sunday afternoons to see all the cute pictures we weren’t invited to pose in. Some find it overwhelming. But after I’ve danced the night away with friends and we’ve made it back to my room, burritos in hands, to gossip and debrief the evening, I’m doing my thing. Back on Mount Auburn Street, someone else is doing theirs. And that’s okay. Alicia makes better music, anyway.

UPDATED: September 24, 2017 at 8:14 p.m.
It was 1947, and Williams College President James P. Baxter III, Harvard class of 1914, was thinking about fraternities. He picked up a pen, grabbed a sheet of lined paper, and recorded his musings in neat, looping cursive.
“Every college administrator at one time or another asks himself just what the social institutions on his campus are worth to their members and to the college as a whole,” he wrote. “The answers will vary, according to the quality of fraternity or club life on the particular campus and according to the point of view of the administrator.”
In his 1947 letter, Baxter (who belonged to a fraternity as an undergraduate) argued in favor of Greek life. But less than twenty years later, the Williams Board of Trustees accepted a recommendation to banish it. In the decades that followed, universities across New England followed Williams’s example.
Now it may be Harvard’s turn.
Seventy years after Baxter put pen to paper, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana is asking himself the exact question the Williams president did.
“Ultimately, all of these unrecognized single-gender social organizations are at odds with Harvard College’s educational philosophy and its commitment to a diverse living and learning experience,” Khurana wrote in a letter to students last year.
Today, Khurana and other Harvard administrators hope to limit the scope of the College’s Greek life and, more importantly, of its final clubs. In addition to a handful of fraternities and sororities, Harvard is home to eight traditionally all-male clubs and five historically all-female groups. While most female clubs do not own property, the male clubs—located in mansions in the heart of campus with access to generous budgets—now play an outsize role in undergraduate social life as some of the College’s major party sites. These groups have come under fire in the past few years for exclusive membership practices.
Administrators’ public efforts to reshape Harvard social life began in May 2016, when University President Drew G. Faust announced unprecedented penalties on members of single-gender final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. Under that policy, undergraduates—starting with the Class of 2021—who join these groups are barred from campus leadership positions, varsity team captaincies, and certain fellowships.
Recently, though, administrators decided the penalties are not enough: over the summer, a faculty committee recommended instead “phas[ing] out” all social groups from Harvard’s campus by May 2022 in hopes of “improving… the social lives” of Harvard students. Faust will make a final decision on the recommendation this fall.
In its report proposing the ban, the faculty committee specifically cited Williams—as well as Bowdoin College, which banned Greek life in 1997, and Amherst College, which abolished the organizations in 1984—as inspiration. The 22-page document reprinted extracts of the social group policies of Williams and Bowdoin.
“It is unlikely that Harvard can improve on the policies of these peer institutions,” the report reads.
But Harvard confronts challenges not faced by its “peer institutions,” including a far larger student body and a more combative Faculty. And despite vowing to imitate these schools, the College has taken an administrative approach radically different from that of Amherst, Bowdoin, and Williams. Almost every step of the way—in its stated justification for the social group ban, its consultation with constituents beforehand, and its efforts to supply students with alternative social spaces—Harvard has forged its own path.
Nevertheless, visiting Williams, Bowdoin, and Amherst and exploring their archives by day reveals how other schools have enacted a Greek life ban. Wandering the three campuses at night offers a glimpse into life without social groups.
Unlike on Mt. Auburn St., students rove freely in and out of parties. No one stops you at the door, or checks to see if your name is on a list. Students do, sometimes, jockey for a place in line—but only for a donut-eating contest in Bowdoin’s Reed House, or a turn as DJ in Amherst’s Mayo-Smith House.
Is this kind of Friday night the future? At the very least, it offers a glimpse into what might be: Harvard, 2022.  
A ‘MISSED OPPORTUNITY’
It is not hard to find fraternity row in Williamstown. Green lawn after green lawn stretch up to meet one white-columned, red-brick mansion after another.
Walk closer, though, and you realize the buildings are denuded of Greek letters. Still closer, and you see the small signs, stuck in the ground or painted on glass doors. Some of these former fraternity houses have been converted to administrative offices: Beta Theta Pi, for instance, is now the “Williams College Office of Admission.” The majority have become undergraduate residential houses, complete with large venues for parties.
These buildings, the only remnants of Greek life on Williams’s campus, bear testament to the time, money, and resources the school devoted to ensuring the continuation of undergraduate social life post-fraternity.  If Harvard does enact a ban, administrators will face a similar challenge in filling the social void left by final clubs, fraternities, and sororities.
Williams’s path to banning fraternities began when President Laurence B. Nielsen appointed a committee to “investigate discrimination… in regard to fraternity selection.” Two months later, in a damning document known as the Phillips’ Report, the committee revealed that at least two fraternities had secret “unwritten agreements” with their national chapters to prevent the admission of Jewish students, and at least three fraternities did the same with respect to black students.
That finding ultimately led to the elimination of Greek life. The final 1962 report recommending a fraternity ban referred to the Phillips’ Report, obliquely, as “the handwriting of impending trouble… become visible on the Williams wall.”
Soon after Williams’s trustees accepted the 1962 report, then-President John E. Sawyer formed a new committee and charged it with designing an entirely new residential and social system.
The committee’s first order of business: convincing fraternity alumni to transfer ownership of their houses to the college.
Over the next few months, all but one of Williams’s 15 fraternities agreed to hand over their properties. At Bowdoin, too, administrators took swift action—within two months of its decision to eliminate fraternities, the school purchased the vast majority of its former frat houses.
At Harvard, administrators have made no public plans to buy any of the eight mansions owned by the eight traditionally all-male final clubs—and final club graduate leaders may not be eager to sell. The total assessed value of these properties, located on plots of land in the heart of campus, sums to over $31 million.
Policymakers at Bowdoin and Williams saw the purchase of former fraternity properties—and the immediate establishment of alternative social spaces—as essential to the success of the Greek life ban. In public remarks over dinner in October 1962, Jay B. Angevine, the chairman of the Williams committee that recommended eliminating fraternities, dismissed attendees’ financial concerns.
“Of course it will cost money,” he said. “Of course it cannot be accomplished overnight, but… if it is good for Williams, it ought to be done.”

And in a 1997 Bowdoin “Report of the Dean of Student Affairs,” then-dean Craig W. Bradley listed the “new house system” as the first reason why the school’s fraternity ban, which “has left a number of other campuses angry and shattered,” became “a different sort of thing” at Bowdoin.
Harvard has recently stepped up efforts to create new campus social spaces and revitalize existing ones. In an April 2017 interview, Khurana pointed in particular to the construction of new student gathering spots in the Cabot Science Library and the Smith Campus Center. He also mentioned a program allowing freshmen to rent out dormitory common rooms for parties.
A committee tasked with recommending how to implement Harvard’s sanctions had another idea, too—forming “inter-House dining societies” of roughly 40 students who could eat weekly meals in the dining halls. At these gatherings, the committee suggested in a March 2017 report, students might “eat in elegant attire” and “read Chaucer out loud.”
Some students remain unconvinced.
“It’s not sufficient,” Jessica R. Fournier ’17 says. “I think Harvard should do more and should take over [the final club properties]—that would certainly be a statement about what the values and priorities of the institution are, beyond reports and emails about Chaucer.”
In the same March report, the implementation committee itself seemed to acknowledge Harvard’s attempts to provide new social spaces might be insufficient.
The report’s authors noted that the institutions that have been most successful at limiting the impact of single-gender social groups took “bold steps”—combining strict social group policies with “significant investment in alternatives,” including the reorganization of residential systems. Those that “took half measures,” though, realized less “positive change” in the undergraduate social experience.
In its later report proposing a social group ban, the faculty committee was even more blunt.
“Amherst, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Williams… coupled [their] restrictions with their new development of residential housing,” committee members wrote. “In hindsight, Harvard missed that opportunity when the residential housing system was established in 1930.” 
LEGAL RUMBLINGS
The party in Bowdoin’s Reed House—once home to the Alpha Eta of Chi Psi fraternity, now one of the college’s eight sophomore-only residential houses—is picking up. Even though it’s late, already past 1 a.m., people keep coming in.
It’s the first weekend out for the freshman class, and the party hosts are determined to impress. One sophomore in a white T-shirt reading “MURICA” suddenly runs into the middle of a quiet living room area, slings an old-fashioned boombox onto the floor, and yells, “Dance party!”
He twirls a laughing girl in a white mini-skirt while freshmen, lining the walls with red Solo cups in hand, watch and laugh too. Many of them say they didn’t know Reed used to be a frat house. They say they’re pretty happy with Bowdoin parties so far—they seem surprised to be asked.
At Bowdoin, students don’t fuss too much about social life, sophomore Dylan Hayton-Ruffner explains. If undergraduates do have a complaint, it’s that things on the leafy 207-acre campus in southern Maine can be “too sleepy.”
Bowdoin offers a version of the future Harvard seems unlikely to share, at least for the next few years. Widespread discontent among final club and fraternity alumni—along with threats of a retaliatory lawsuit—almost certainly shove “sleepiness” out of the picture.
If the University ultimately decides to ban or sanction single-gender social organizations, lawyers predict at least one of the affected groups—whether a final club, a fraternity, or a sorority—will sue. Tim M. Burke, an attorney whose firm serves as general counsel for the National Panhellenic Conference, says he thinks a suit might have a good chance of succeeding.
There have been legal rumblings since Faust debuted the sanctions in May 2016. Half a year later, the all-male Fly Club hired a group of lawyers to explore potential ways to defy the policy. National Greek organizations including the North American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Conference have repeatedly refused to rule out legal action.
After the faculty committee proposed upgrading Harvard’s sanctions to an all-out ban in July 2017, club leaders, too, stepped up their rhetoric. At the time, Fly Club graduate president Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 said he thought “things seem headed” in the direction of litigation, while former Fox Club graduate president Douglas W. Sears ’69 said he thought anything resembling a social group ban would be “heavily litigated in the courts.”
Burke says he has been “in discussion” with some of Harvard’s social groups since the announcement of the penalties and that the talks “are not over.” He declines to specify further.
Efforts to sue private universities for fraternity bans are often unsuccessful, Burke explains, because the Federal Civil Rights Act—which protects students’ right to freedom of association under the First Amendment—only applies to “state actors.” Because Harvard is not a public institution, “that is not a likely attack,” he says.
But he says he thinks Harvard might be more susceptible to legal action than other private universities like Bowdoin or Williams. In particular, Burke says lawyers could try to use the College’s route to its social group policy—marked by top-down administrative strictures, retroactive appeasement, and turmoil among the Faculty—against Harvard in court.
Khurana spent months meeting with final club leaders behind closed doors before Faust announced the sanctions; he also canvassed the subject with other administrators. And he examined hundreds of private student responses to College-administered surveys collected over the past few years.
Computer Science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, probably the most vocal faculty critic of the College’s penalties, has long charged that Harvard’s attempts to govern undergraduate social life encroach on Faculty authority and go against University statutes. Lewis has filed two separate faculty motions, both explicitly designed to kill the sanctions.
FAS Dean Smith formed the faculty committee that recommended the social group ban in part to mollify those who, like Lewis, demanded a greater level of faculty involvement. Nevertheless, no part of the College’s social group policy has ever been voted on by the full faculty.
Burke says he thinks pointing out “all of these strange machinations” will be a key argument in “any litigation” going forward. Greg F. Hauser, an attorney who has often worked with Greek organizations, goes one step further.
“Showing that Harvard violated something in its policies or its procedures is probably the most clear-cut way to knock this out,” he says.
Both lawyers note Amherst and Williams made continual attempts to consult students, faculty, and alumni as they debated and developed their respective social group bans. Between 1925 and 1961 (the year before it abolished Greek life), Williams formed at least eight different committees to study social life. It also held one faculty vote, three undergraduate polls, and one student vote on the subject.
Burke and Hauser also say Harvard’s shifting rationale for its attempts to regulate undergraduate social life could prove a legal liability. Harvard has twice revised its stated motivation for proposing its own ban, shifting the focus of the sanctions away from sexual assault prevention towards the elimination of gender discrimination, and then towards preventing all forms of discrimination.
Like Williams, Harvard initially based its social group recommendations on the troublesome findings of a committee—in the University’s case, the March 2016 report of the Task Force on Sexual Assault Prevention. The task force found that nearly half of surveyed female members of the Class of 2015 who participated in the final clubs—whether as members or partygoers—said they had experienced sexual assault.
In the same March report, the task force called on the College to develop a “plan to address the problems presented” by final clubs. Two months later, Faust announced the sanctions.
But administrators soon began backpedaling away from the idea that sexual harassment at final clubs sparked the College’s social group policy. A set of recommendations for implementing the penalties released in March 2017 declared that sexual assault was “not the sole nor even the primary reason for the policy.” Instead, administrators said the sanctions were meant to combat gender discrimination inherent in the clubs’ membership policies. In an interview from that time, Khurana said he thought the penalties had been “rooted” in eliminating gender discrimination “since the beginning.”
Not three months later, the faculty committee contributed its two cents, broadening the scope of the sanctions to address all forms of discrimination: “Our main reservation about the stated goal of the policy was whether the focus on ending gender segregation and discrimination is too narrow,” members wrote in a July 2017 report. “The committee also has concerns about broader issues in these organizations related to exclusion and conduct… not addressed by the May 2016 policy.”
Burke says these inconsistencies will “absolutely” be a factor in court, should one of Harvard’s affected social groups choose to sue the University.
“Without having a solid explanation—and they don’t, because they keep changing it—that, I think, increases the likelihood that a court would look very askew at efforts by Harvard,” he says. 
CLOSED DOORS
The sun is streaming through the windows of Tunnel City Coffee in Williamstown, and senior varsity cross country runner Katie G. Flaharty—a blue gem-studded high school class ring glittering on her finger—is trying to explain Williams nightlife.
She’s struggling to convey what it’s like to go to a school where the parties are open to everyone, and everyone knows about pretty much every party. “If you hear about it, you can come,” Flaharty says. “Rarely do people not allow people to get in.”
Does it ever happen? Flaharty sighs.

“Well, some girl had a birthday party [recently] and she didn’t want it to get out of hand, so she put two football players at the door and said, ‘If you don’t know them, don’t let them in,’” Flaharty says. “That caused a bit of drama for the whole campus because they were all like, ‘She’s such a bitch! Why isn’t she letting us in?’”
It’s a saying common to students at Amherst, Bowdoin, and Williams that, for every person who wants to “do something” on a Friday or Saturday night, there is always “something to do.” Undergraduates today attribute this in part to the schools’ small size, meaning what works in Williamstown and Brunswick might not go over as well in Cambridge.
Williams has just over 2,000 students; Amherst and and Bowdoin both have slightly over 1,800. Harvard has more than three times that: roughly 6,700 undergraduates.
Only a small portion of College students actually join final clubs. In The Crimson’s annual survey of graduating seniors, 6.8 percent of surveyed members of the Class of 2016 said they belonged to an all-male club, while 8.3 percent of surveyed seniors reported belonging to an all-female group.
Social life carries on outside the clubs, too. Harvard’s 12 residential houses host formal parties throughout the year, and students often register and hold parties in dormitory common spaces.
But students at the three smaller schools say the absence of Greek life has opened the social scene in a way almost unimaginable at Harvard. On any given weekend, there is almost always a party in one of the college-owned former fraternity houses, repurposed as social spaces open to all. Brightly lit and filled with people on a Friday night, Amherst’s Mayo-Smith House—once home to Delta Chi Psi—offers a typical example.
Undergraduates pass in and out at will. Those who stay dance, drink beer, and chat with friends, though no one seems to stay for very long. The fluorescent lights and constant movement vaguely recall a train station.
In Cambridge, things are different. Closed doors are one of the most prominent features of undergraduate social life. The final clubs are the main sites of after-hours parties on the weekends, and members are selective about who they let in.
By 2022, there may be no clubs left to guard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Days after suffering a major neck injury, Harvard freshman Ben Abercrombie has undergone surgery and is recovering at a Rhode Island hospital.
The defensive back sustained the injury last Saturday in a game at Rhode Island. With 13 minutes left in the second quarter, Abercrombie collided with a Rams wide receiver and remained motionless on the ground. Medical personnel rushed him to the hospital.
Later neck vertebrae surgery went successfully, according to Abercrombie’s high school baseball coach, Adam Moseley. In a Twitter update, he explained that the freshman’s spinal cord had remained intact.
“The doctor is now waiting for the neck swelling and pressure and trauma to subside [so] Ben can regain feeling in his arms and legs,” Moseley wrote. “The doctor is hopeful that this will happen over the next several days.”
Earlier this week, Abercrombie required assistance breathing, but doctors were optimistic that he would regain this function by Sunday.
In the days since the injury, support has flooded social media. Friends, coaches, and rival teams have posted messages under the hashtag #prayforBen. Harvard football has fielded scores of calls.
On Tuesday, the Harvard Athletics Department emailed all student-athletes to notify them of Abercrombie’s situation. The email—cosigned by Director of Athletics Bob Scalise and football coach Tim Murphy—mentioned the “serious cervical injury” and encouraged players to seek out mental health resources if needed.
“Our hearts go out to Ben and his family right now, and they have our full support,” the email stated. “We are doing all that we can in aiding in his recovery.”
Internally, Murphy has held conversations with the football team. On Saturday, after Abercrombie left the field, the coach asked players whether they wanted to continue the game or head home. They decided to continue.
“Our kids are deeply affected by the injury and Ben being in the hospital right now,” Murphy said. “We’ve done our best to deal with that in terms of talking to our players [and] giving guidance.”
A native of Hoover, Ala., Abercrombie was playing in his first college contest on Saturday. He had risen to the top of the depth chart despite a contingent of veteran defensive backs.
At Hoover High School, Abercrombie had starred for the football and baseball programs. In May 2017, the Buccaneers won a state title in baseball for the first time since 2008.
Abercrombie also captured state crowns as part of the football team in 2014 and 2016. He started at safety and earned a spot on the All-Alabama first team.
“Hoover [is] one of the top programs in the country, year in and year out,” Murphy said. “It doesn’t get any bigger than that at the high school stage.”
Abercrombie’s accomplishments extended beyond the field. In high school, he earned a spot in the National Honor Society and a Finley Character Award, which recognizes exceptional students at Hoover.
Crimson recruiters noticed. Despite competition from Yale and Dartmouth, among other schools, Harvard extended an offer to Abercrombie in June 2016, and he confirmed the spot in the winter.
“Every kid we recruit has to pass three acid tests—great character, great student, and great athlete,” Murphy said. “He was a special player [at Hoover].”
The injury occurred on a typical sideline route, with Abercrombie colliding with the wide receiver from behind. Game action stopped immediately, as medics gathered to check vital functions.
Abercrombie’s exit overshadowed the rest of the afternoon. In the postgame press conference, both Murphy and the Rhode Island coach started their remarks with discussions of Abercrombie’s condition.
“Our most prevalent thoughts are for Ben Abercrombie, who sustained a significant injury today,” Rams coach Jim Fleming said. “Our thoughts and prayers today are with him and his family for a speedy recovery.”
This week, the Crimson football team faces the dilemma of keeping in mind Abercrombie while readying for nine more games. On Saturday, Harvard will play another Rhode Island opponent, Brown, at home.
On the minds of players, and many in the stands, will be Abercrombie’s health.
“We’re doing everything in our power to support Ben and his family,” Murphy said. “If we’re going to play, I think the best way to honor him is by playing our best and playing for him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 150 professors are calling for the University to include “criminal history” in its non-discrimination policy, condemning Harvard’s decisions to deny Ph.D. program admission to ex-inmate Michelle Jones and rescind a fellowship offer to Chelsea Manning.
“With both decisions, Harvard has prioritized political expediency over scholarly values,” the petition, entitled “We are Educators Not Prosecutors,” reads. “The decisions in these cases have been made not by following standardized procedure, but by reacting in an ad hoc manner to a climate of anxiety and intimidation.”
The petition also demands Harvard support research into prison reform and requests the University extend an invitation to Manning to speak on BGLTQ issues in a public forum.
 Jones’ case garnered national attention last week when The Marshall Project, a news outlet that reports on criminal justice issues, published an article about her application to Harvard's graduate history program. Jones established herself as a promising historian while serving a 50-year prison sentence for murder and, according to the article, was favored for acceptance into Harvard’s highly-competitive History Ph.D program. However, according to The Marshall Project, University leaders overrode her acceptance after two professors brought her application to their attention.
A University spokesperson declined to comment.
Three History professors quoted in the article that supported Jones’s candidacy—Alison F. Johnson, Walter Johnson, and Elizabeth K. Hinton—are among the petition’s signatories.
Also last week, Harvard appointed Manning—a former Army soldier who went to prison for leaking classified military documents to WikiLeaks—to a fellowship at the Institute of Politics. Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf soon rescinded the offer, however, after CIA Director Mike Pompeo pulled out of a scheduled speaking appearance at the IOP and Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA, resigned from his Belfer Center fellowship in protest.
The revocation of Manning’s fellowship generated outcry on campus and in the national media.
In numerous op-eds, writers from major publications have linked the two highly-publicized incidents—both involving women with past criminal convictions—and alleged that they are indicative of larger problems within the University. In the petition, authored by History professor Joyce E. Chaplin, Sociology Professor Jason Beckfield, and Kennedy School professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad, the faculty members took a similar stance.
“In each case, the administration appears to have allowed the fear of public opinion and political interference to determine its actions,” the petition reads. “But we are educators committed to the open, critical exchange of ideas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Executive Chair of the World Economic Forum Klaus M. Schwab predicted a future in which individuals are guaranteed a universal basic income at the Institute of Politics Wednesday.
The event, held annually to discuss developments in the world economy, was moderated by Kennedy School Professor David Gergen. Schwab was also honored by Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf for what Elmendorf called his lifelong commitment to public service. Schwab graduated from the Kennedy School 50 years ago.
Yo-Yo Ma ’76, who serves on the board of the World Economic Forum, opened Wednesday’s event with a performance of “Song of the Birds,” a traditional Catalan folk song. Ma said he selected the song because of its history as a symbol of opposition to authoritarian rule.
Thanking Ma for his performance, Schwab said that music and art enable humans to differentiate themselves from artificial intelligence. Throughout the event, Schwab offered solutions for policy makers to address the issue of job loss caused by artificial intelligence, citing Singapore and Germany as economic success stories.
“Culture [and the] language of sound, is an essential element of humanity,” Schwab said about Ma’s performance. “The piece you played...reminded us that we should not only speak about economics, but what makes us different.”
Schwab went on to present an optimistic view of what he termed the “fourth industrial revolution,” adding that he predicts a coming renaissance prompted by technological advances and rapid economic and social changes.
Schwab also emphasized the need for more agile governments to keep pace with rapidly developing technology to ensure that it serves human needs.
Asked by Gergen about his advice for young leaders, Schwab also emphasized the qualities essential to leadership in the 21st century.
“You have to be a professional: you have to be the best at what your doing or at least amongst the best—brains. But you have to have values, that’s the soul,” Schwab said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pete Souza, the official photographer of the Reagan and Obama administrations, discussed his new book and shared some of the iconic images of his time at the White House at the Institute of Politics Wednesday.
Souza shot nearly two million photographs of the Obama administration, capturing events from the President Barack Obama’s 2008 inauguration to his visit to Newtown, Conn. following the 2012 school shooting there. At the IOP, Souza displayed a slideshow of featured photographs, offering commentary on the intimate moments behind them.
“I wanted it to be the best archive that we ever had of a President,” Souza said of his collection.
The event attracted students from several of Harvard’s schools due to Souza’s large following on Instagram, a platform which he uses now to post his old photos and political commentary on the current administration. Souza, who said he was once skeptical of Instagram, has since garnered 1.5 million followers and admitted his “unruliness” that is now a token of his page.
He showcased entire days spent in the White House, including the day the Affordable Care Act passed in Congress and the moments leading up to and following the 2016 election. For some students, like Aleesha Shaik, a student at the School of Public Health, the talk was a “coping mechanism for all of us as we [watch] the current administration.”
Souza said he often went to great lengths to secure the best photos of Obama both in and outside of the Oval Office. He recounted the memory of sleeping in his office during the “Snowmaggedon” blizzard of 2010 because he knew the young President and his daughters would eventually come out to play in the snow.
Although Souza claimed not to be the “greatest photographer in the world,” Daniel J. Balz—a 2017 fall fellow at the Institute of Politics and chief correspondent for The Washington Post—disagreed.
“I think anyone who ascends to be a White House photographer is a great photographer,” Balz said after the event. “You can see it in those shots...He has an artist’s eye in addition to having a documentarian’s sense of how you record the life of a presidency. I think he is a terrific photographer.”
Bahariah Bahadom, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said she was an avid follower of Souza’s photography. “His pictures spell human,” Bahadom said. “He humanized all the pictures of the White House, and that for me spelled hope.”

This is part I in a six-part series on Harvard's next president. Part II can be read here, part III can be read here, part IV can be read here, part V can be read here, and part VI can be read here.
Over the course of four centuries, Harvard has seen presidents of many stripes. They’ve been clergymen and classicists, ambassadors and governors, chemists and botanists, and secretaries of State and the Treasury.
Their training and trades may have varied—but to date, all have been white. And, until current University President Drew G. Faust, male.
With the search for Harvard’s 29th president in “information gathering” mode, several alumni groups are hoping the next face of Harvard will look a bit different. The Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance, the Harvard Business School Latino Alumni Association, the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, and the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance each submitted letters to the search committee, urging members to prioritize candidates who come from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds and demonstrate a commitment to building upon Faust’s diversity initiatives.
Presidential searches are moments of institutional soul-searching, as Harvard’s stewards select a leader who will chart the school’s course for years to come. And the alumni affinity groups—which collectively represent thousands of Harvard graduates across the world—want support for the University’s traditionally underrepresented populations to be front and center in this new era.
Harvard’s next president, regardless of their identity, will face no shortage of challenges as the University’s efforts to become a more inclusive and diverse campus have come into the center of national and campus discourse.
In July, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into Harvard’s affirmative action policies. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump said he will end a program for undocumented youth that benefited several dozen Harvard students. And this summer a committee of faculty recommended that Harvard ban membership in social groups, citing their exclusive and discriminatory nature.
“We very much hope that the search committee maintains the ideals of diversity and inclusion and belonging front of mind as they search for candidates for the job,” said Jeannie Park ’83, First Vice President of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance and co-founder of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard. “It would be really a tragedy if Harvard were to take steps backward in those areas.”
When Faust was selected as the University’s 28th—and first woman—president in 2007, students and faculty heralded the historic appointment.
In her first public comments after the announcement, Faust famously said, "I'm not the woman president of Harvard. I'm the president of Harvard." 
Ten years later, some would like to see Harvard make history yet again.
“The school has made wonderful strides with respect to the student population,” Law professor and Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald Sullivan said. “There’s still work to be done with respect to the faculty, and there’s even more work that needs to be done with respect to the top levels of administrators at the University.”
When Corporation senior fellow and search committee chair William F. Lee ’72 sent a mass email to Harvard affiliates over the summer soliciting input on the search, alumni began to make their case.
“It was a pleasant surprise to see that level of engagement from the search committee upfront and at that level of the process,”  Shirley V. Cardona ’06, co-president of the HBS Latino Alumni Association, said. “We’re very eager to partner with the search committee in general on this effort.”
The HBS Latino Alumni Association, Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance, and Coalition for a Diverse Harvard letters all implore the committee to cull candidates from a variety of underrepresented groups.
Doing so would have a symbolic impact that would generate ripple effects throughout the world of higher education, according to the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an umbrella organization with over 1,000 alumni supporters.
“Given that Harvard’s selection of its President will have an immense impact and influence in international academia for years to come, we hope you will exhaustively seek to identify, recruit, and consider candidates from diverse backgrounds,” their letter to the search committee reads.
The HBS Latino Alumni Association submitted biographies of eight prominent Latinos they think the search committee should consider for the job—including California Supreme Court Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar ’93, President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Council of La Raza Janet Murguía, and Louis E. Caldera, an alumnus of the Law School and Business School who is the former president of the University of New Mexico and a former adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton.
“I do think that this is an important time to recognize that there are Latinos that fit the criteria,” Cardona said. “We’ve outlined how they might meet that criteria—we just hope that they’re considered.”
But the composition of the body charged with vetting presidential hopefuls has raised eyebrows among Latino alumni.
With four non-white members and six women, the 15-member search committee—consisting of 12 Corporation members and three Overseers—is slightly more diverse than it was in searches past. But Latinos are still absent from the group.
“We would like to express our deep disappointment that the Selection Committee does not include Latino representation,” the HBS Latino Alumni Association letter to the search committee reads.
Since August, the search committee has appointed faculty, staff, and student advisory bodies containing several Latino members. But the HBS Latino Alumni Association letter calls for the creation of a separate Latino advisory group to “facilitate a dialogue with the Latino community, summarize key considerations for the Search Committee, and help bring an increased level of awareness to the University’s diversity initiatives.”
Several Latino groups have endorsed the letter, and  Cardona said she and representatives from the Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance have corresponded with Lee about scheduling a meeting with search committee members to discuss their proposals in October.
Lee declined to comment for this article.
A University-wide Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging is slated to release its recommendations by the end of the fall, and Faust’s successor will be charged with implementing them.
Between a renewed examination of Harvard’s connections to slavery, a push for an ethnic studies academic program, and calls for a more diverse Faculty, many alumni and students hope Harvard’s next president will continue and build on Faust’s efforts.
“We’d love to see a Latino president of Harvard University, no doubt about it,” Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance president Debra Sanchez Reed said. “But what we’re asking for is that as the search is done, the qualities include what we’re looking for— and that’s openness to diversity, a willingness to support the minority populations at Harvard, and a willingness to be open to some of the ideas that have been put forward over the years that have not come to fruition.”
Alumni largely praise Faust’s efforts to promote diversity and inclusion at the University. During her decade-long tenure, Faust has expanded financial aid, advocated for undocumented students, and presided over processes to grapple with—and publicly acknowledge—Harvard’s historic ties to slavery. She has defended the University’s race-conscious admissions practices and appointed the University-wide Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, which is slated to complete its work before Faust departs.
Lee’s comments in an interview with the University-owned Harvard Gazette indicate that the search committee will prize a similar focus. Lee lauded Faust’s “ability to listen to a wide range of voices and perspectives from a diverse set of constituencies,” adding, “We hope the new president will have those qualities because they are critical to effective leadership.”
But even as they heralded Faust’s progress, the alumni groups urged the search committee to choose a successor who will go even further than Faust in elevating minority communities on campus.
Sanchez Reed said that while Harvard’s Latino population has grown in recent years, Latino students need additional support. Specifically, the Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance letter calls for a Latino cultural center on campus and a Latino studies program—both entreaties that Latino groups on campus have made to University administrators for years, to no avail.
William Yao '90, the president of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, wrote to the search committee that the group hopes the next president will pay more attention to Asian Americans.
“Asian Americans are the fastest growing ethnic or racial group in the U.S.—a fact that is certain to continue to shape the demographics of Harvard—and yet we are frequently left out of conversations and decisions around race at the University,” he wrote.
And several groups pointedly requested that the search committee choose a successor who will support establishing an ethnic studies program. Groups of Harvard affiliates have lobbied the University for over four decades to create such a program.
“In a time when concerned citizens grapple daily with issues of race, ethnicity and immigration, the absence of serious and focused Harvard scholarship in areas of race beyond African American Studies is a glaring gap,” Yao wrote.
Affirmative action is another charged issue next president will have to navigate—particularly as a lawsuit and Justice Department probe scrutinize Harvard’s race-conscious admissions practices. Faust has repeatedly and forcefully defended Harvard’s approach to affirmative action as the federal government, some alumni, and several advocacy groups have argued that it may discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
“We feel very strongly that the incoming president needs to understand why these measures have been put into place, and how they have enabled our university to come to the place we are now,” said Cardona, who worked for the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program while a student at the College.
But Asian-American alumni are troubled by the accusations of bias against Asian Americans that the lawsuit has raised.
“Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, we expect that the new president will do whatever necessary to ensure that the admissions process is free of any and all bias against applicants of Asian heritage and will be able to refute conclusively any assertions to the contrary,” Yao’s letter reads.
The affirmative action debate points to the challenge Harvard’s leaders face in balancing the interests of the University’s many constituencies.
It is a challenge Lee himself identified in the Gazette interview as one the next president will need to be prepared to take on.
“There is the question of how universities can best serve a diverse population of faculty, students, and staff,” he said. “

The Harvard Map Collection’s exhibit on ink-drawn-maps will come to a close next week, ending a display of antique maps that has been open to the public in the Pusey Library since May.
The “Manuscript Maps: Hand-Drawn Treasures of the Harvard Map Collection” exhibit has been open to both Harvard affiliates and the general public free of charge. The maps are centuries old—in one case dating back to 1620.
“We wanted to highlight some of the unique maps,” said David E. Weimer, Librarian for Cartographic Collections and Learning. “A lot of the times the focus of the exhibition is on the content of maps, so we wanted to have an exhibition that focused on the process.”
The oldest work in the collection, a portolan chart made in Marseille, is a richly colored example of a style of maps rarely seen today. The chart was drawn on vellum parchment with lapis lazuli, toasted lead, verdigris, and gold to produce bold colors that have endured four centuries.
Another one of of the highlights of the collection is “Massachusetts,” a multi-layer map of the state from the mid-nineteenth century. While the original copy is kept behind glass, there is an uncovered reproduction on display. Visitors may lift the map’s layers to reveal an abandoned draft beneath.
“It definitely shows the craftsmanship and care that goes into [the maps],” Jake Y. Tilton ’19 commented . “They’re also just cool to look at aesthetically, and also very informative.” Tilton also remarked that for him, the most salient feature of the exhibit was the “variety of different maps and different styles.”
This diversity in geography and time was carefully considered by the curators of the exhibit.
“It’s always a matter of figuring out the kind of story you want to tell,” Weimer said.
The Map Collection boasts more than 400,000 maps, meaning that selecting individual maps to display for the exhibit could be complicated.
“It was [a matter of] balancing some of the unique personal stories that each of the maps has, against how striking they were visually, versus some geographical range,” Weimer said.
This exhibit will be on view in the Map Gallery Hall on the first floor of Pusey Library from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m from Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday through Sept. 27.
The Map Collection has also made an online version of the exhibit available. The Map Collection offers print reproductions for $2 per square foot for University students, faculty members, and staff.

In his annual endowment report Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. Narvekar didn’t equivocate about the “deep structural problems” at the firm. What was less clear, though, was exactly what comprises the investment portfolio that Narvekar seeks to overhaul.
In a departure from tradition, notably absent from the annual endowment report HMC released Tuesday was a dissection of the assets that comprise its portfolio. The absence of quantitative details may further obscure the composition of the firm’s portfolio, exacerbating long-standing concerns that HMC is not transparent enough.
Also missing from the endowment report was a discussion of the investment benchmarks the firm hit or missed in fiscal year 2017. A 2015 McKinsey and Company review of HMC blamed easily attainable benchmarks—which it labeled  “‘slow rabbits’”—for creating a complacent culture at the firm.
HMC spokesperson Emily Guadagnoli wrote in an email Tuesday that there is “no additional data to provide” on the status of the endowment beyond Narvekar’s letter, which reported that the endowment posted “disappointing” 8.1 percent returns.
Narvekar offered an explanation for the change, writing that HMC would be shifting from traditional “asset allocation” and towards a “risk allocation strategy.” The shift in terminology is consistent with Narvekar’s approach to the endowment, which aims to manage risk across the fund instead of dividing assets into categories.
Narvekar argued the move towards a risk allocation model will allow HMC to better understand how exposed the endowment is to market fluctuations. It will also help the firm make long-term assumptions about its investments, rather than responding to day-to-day market moves or short-term returns on certain assets, he wrote.
In the two letters he’s released to the public since the start of his tenure last December, Narvekar has written extensively about the firm’s ongoing project to identify an appropriate level of risk for Harvard, repeatedly cautioning against making hasty comparisons between Harvard and other universities.
“Comparisons to other peers are natural, but not productive,” Narvekar wrote. “A more sophisticated lens will always focus first upon risk appetites rather than simply returns.”
According to financial headhunter Charles A. Skorina, who regularly writes on the performance of top institutional investors, the shift toward this risk model is not unusual.
“A number of big endowments are going towards a different type of allocation terminology. Instead of equities, debt, private equity, etc, they’re going for classifications like ‘high-earning assets’, risk-mitigation assets, and so on,” he said. “Some of the literature says that it helps people understand how their portfolio’s going to react in a recession, for instance, or in a bull market.”
Harvard’s fiscal year 2017 returns pulled the firm back into the black, after it returned negative 2 percent the year prior. Still, Harvard continues to lag behind its peers: Dartmouth, the other Ivy League whose investment returns have been reported, yielded 14.6 percent in fiscal year 2017 amid strong public markets.

After an unusually large freshmen class crowded into Harvard Yard this fall, Harvard College will accept fewer students into the Class of 2022 in hopes of admitting more students off the waitlist, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview this week.
Due to the unusually large class size for the Class of 2021, twenty-eight freshmen are living in DeWolfe, overflow housing typically reserved for upperclassmen. Fitzsimmons said the Admissions Office is aiming to accept “40 to 50 to maybe 100 people” off the waitlist—last year, Harvard did not take anyone off the waitlist after a record number of admitted students matriculated. Fitzsimmons said the class was unusually large because fewer students deferred admission.
That change is one of several Fitzsimmons outlined for the upcoming admissions cycle in an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday. Because of a series of national disasters around the country and world, Fitzsimmons said his office will grant extensions for some early applications and take more time to deliberate on acceptances.
Though the Admissions Office plans to send admissions notifications via email to early applicants on Dec. 12 this year, Fitzsimmons said that it is possible that they will continue considering early admissions cases into early January for applicants from the affected areas.
“We could be in for a very different kind of calendar sitting in front of us this year, because we want to be fair to these students and give them the most complete hearing we can give them,” Fitzsimmons said.
The Admissions Office’s website currently indicates that extensions may be granted for the Nov. 1 early application deadline and to teachers and counselors who need to submit letters of recommendation, transcripts, and secondary school reports.
Additionally, the website reminds students that application fee waivers are available for cases of financial need and that November testing may be used for early applications. Despite the support, Fitzsimmons is uncertain how much of an impact the disruptions may have.
“There were testing sites that were shut. It’s hard to say what will happen,” Fitzsimmons said in an interview on Tuesday. “We’ll see how quickly schools get back together, but it can have a major effect.”
Fitzsimmons said that all students needed to do was reach out to the Admissions Office to receive an extension and that “the jury is still out” on how many students will request assistance. He credited the office’s immediacy in updating the website for the lack of phone calls from prospective students and families in the aftermath of the disasters.
Traditionally, Florida, the main state affected by Hurricane Irma, has sent the sixth most students to Harvard compared to other states, and Georgia, which was also affected by Irma, has been a “very big producer of students,” according to Fitzsimmons. Texas, which was hit by Hurricane Harvey, has become Harvard’s fourth most popular home state.
Though the Admissions Office hopes that the natural disasters won’t change high school students’ decision to apply to Harvard, Fitzsimmons acknowledged that it is expected for some affected students to prefer to choose a college closer to home.
“There’s no way to tell how this will work out,” Fitzsimmons said, “especially if they don’t have the kind of face time with their counselors that they normally would have had.”

The Trader Joe’s on 748 Memorial Drive—frequented by Harvard undergraduates—will cease alcohol sales on Oct. 1.
But students need not worry, as the Trader Joe’s location slated to open in Allston mid-October will offer beer, wine, and spirits.
The company began a process of transferring its liquor license to Salt and Olive—a gourmet food store near campus—at a Cambridge License Commission hearing last Wednesday.
Trader Joe’s currently has 19 Massachusetts locations, seven of which sell alcohol. Massachusetts state law forbids any one company from holding more than seven liquor licenses within the state, so as to not monopolize liquor sales.
In February, Trader Joe’s received the green light from the Boston Licensing Board to sell alcohol at its Allston location in the Continuum complex, near the Harvard Stadium and iLab.
The new Trader Joe’s will open at the intersection of North Harvard St and Western Ave traditionally known as Barry’s Corner, along with restaurant Our Father’s Deli. Down the street on Western Avenue from Barry’s Corner, Harvard’s Science and Engineering Complex is growing by the day.
In order to abide by state limits, the company decided to transfer the liquor license of the Memorial Drive location. This transfer is still awaiting approval.

Nearly a year ago, Harvard’s dining workers traded in their serving utensils for picket signs in a 22-day strike that handicapped the University’s food-service operation.
Now, as the anniversary of that strike looms in October, the union that represents Harvard’s dining workers is mounting for a strike at Northeastern University, it also represents approximately 300 workers. As organizing at Northeastern has progressed, the union's success at Harvard has served as an inspiration.
Those workers have been embroiled in contract negotiations with Northeastern’s food vendor, Chartwells, since April. Their contract was set to expire at the end of August, but was extended until the end of September.
In a press release, Tiffany Ten Eyck—the spokesperson for UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union representing Harvard and Northeastern dining workers—announced the workers will hold a vote to authorize a strike on October 4.
She specifically invoked Harvard’s dining workers strike in the release. It reads, “Inspired by last October’s strike at Harvard University, food service workers at Northeastern University will announce preparations for a potential strike of their own.”
The dining workers at Northeastern, a mid-sized research university not far from Harvard’s campus, “are making the same demands that led to a 22-day strike at Harvard University,” the release reads.
Those demands include an effective $35,000 salary for full-time employees and “affordable” health care. At Harvard, dining workers reached an agreement that covers copayments, and does not feature increases in cost.
Matthew McDonald, a spokesperson for Northeastern, wrote in a statement that the school “looks forward to the union and the employer reaching an amicable agreement.”
For Thomas Gross, a dining worker at Northeastern, the stakes of this round of contract negotiations are high. A Roxbury resident, Gross is the main provider in a large household, and has a seven-year old daughter whose safety he fears for in Roxbury.
“There’s a lot of violence in Roxbury. I have a seven year old daughter. It’s hard to take her to the park. $35,000 a year will be good leverage for me to move to a better environment,” he said.
Gross currently makes $15 per hour for a schedule that he says fluctuates weekly. He said he is hoping for a more stable routine and a higher salary so he and his family can move to a different neighborhood.
Shante McCorvey, another Northeastern worker, said she cannot afford academic programs for her 11-year-old daughter, who shares a room with her two sisters.
“We live in low-income housing and every day is a struggle,” McCorvey said.
At an event Wednesday afternoon, the workers formally announced strike preparations and unveiled a 30-foot-long mural emblazoned with the photographs of hundreds of workers who have already committed to striking if they cannot reach an accord with Chartwells. If the vote swings in favor of a strike, the union’s bargaining committee will be able to call one to order at any point.
If the Northeastern dining workers do go on strike, they may borrow tactics Local 26 employed during Harvard’s strike. Large rallies, food strikes, and coalition-building across several campuses and Boston unions might punctuate an organized labor action that could stretch on for nearly a month, barring an immediate solution.
Gross said the workers at Northeastern have been motivated by the Harvard strike.
“It was inspirational seeing all the workers united there,” Gross said. “We deserve better, and we’re going to do anything and everything to get it.”

A full week off between games might just be the cure that the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-3-1) needs after a tough 1-0 loss at BU’s Nickerson Field last Saturday.
Tuesday’s game at Rhode Island was canceled due to inclement weather, giving the Crimson a full week to prepare for Sunday night’s home clash against Albany. As of now, the URI game has not been rescheduled.
“Obviously we’re disappointed we didn’t get to play,” senior midfielder Christian Sady said. “But the week off gives us a chance to get healthy…. It will give us time to work on the things we deem necessary.”
This will be Harvard’s first ever matchup against the Great Danes, continuing this year’s trend of facing off against unfamiliar foes. Albany (5-2-0) enters the week having won five of its last six games, but is just 1-2 on the road.
Harvard enters play this week 1-1-1 over its past three games, squeaking out a big victory on the road against Providence, thanks to an 84th minute goal from freshman midfielder/forward Paolo Belloni-Urso. The Crimson played to a hard-fought 1-1 double-overtime tie in the following game against crosstown rival Northeastern at home. Then came Saturday’s loss at BU, and the team is now hoping to rebound at home this weekend and get back in the win column.
Harvard’s stifling defense, anchored by co-captains Eric Gylling and Justin Crichlow, has been the team’s greatest strength over the past three games, allowing only three goals over that span.
Senior goalie Kyle Parks has also played well of late, allowing just one goal in the Crimson’s win over the Friars. Against the Huskies, Parks made a career-high seven saves, including a tremendous tip over the crossbar in the dying minutes of double overtime to preserve the 1-1 tie.
Following Parks’ lead, freshman goalkeeper Matt Freese had a strong debut between the posts against BU in his first career start, allowing only one goal and making a pair of saves. Harvard’s defense only allowed three shots on target, but the Terriers’ lone goal was enough to prevail over the Crimson on Saturday.
“The goalkeeping has been fantastic,” remarked Crichlow, one of the keystones of the defense. “Whether Matt or Kyle is in goal, the team has full confidence in both of them.”
While Harvard has struggled to score in bunches, the visiting Great Danes have had no problem racking up goals, scoring 15 goals over the first six games of the season, outscoring opponents by an impressive 13-2 margin in four home games.
Albany’s offense is paced by upperclassmen Alfonso Pinheiro and Carlos Clark, who have scored four goals apiece. Redshirt freshman forward Owen Fingar has also chipped in with three goals for the Great Danes.
Fingar, who has yet to start a game but has been substituted into six of Albany’s seven games, was just named Rookie of the Week for the America East conference. The forward has scored his three goals on a mere six shots, easily the best shooting percentage on the Great Danes’ roster.
The stout Albany defense is helmed by upperclassmen Moosah Khanat, Nico Solabarrieta, and Daniel Krutzen, who have started all seven games of the season. The defensive unit has allowed only six goals across the season, and only three in the past six games.
In goal, the Great Danes have employed a two-goalkeeper rotation, with senior Lucas Vallilo and redshirt junior Danny Vitiello each starting three games. Vallilo and Vitiello have recorded a clean sheet each.
Harvard will have its work cut out for it but is hoping that the full week of preparation coupled with playing at the friendly confines of Jordan Field will be enough to keep the Great Danes at bay.
“There have been spurts of excellence from our team,” said Crichlow. “But we have not put together a full 90 minutes yet.”
With Ivy League opening up on the road in New Haven against rival Yale next weekend, Crichlow and the Crimson hope to sustain that excellence for the full 90 minutes this Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How does it feel to support the Cleveland Browns? Let me explain.
Imagine that you’re on a frozen highway. Suddenly, an 18-wheeler runs you over. Both your legs break, but you decide to wait out the recovery. Ice melts. Raccoons scavenge. Then, 10 weeks to the day, the same 18-wheeler runs you over again.
Replace “18-wheeler” with “Pittsburgh Steelers,” and you get the idea.
Alternatively, imagine that you buy a lottery ticket. It’s an expensive purchase ($5.3 million), but you like your odds. One day, you turn on the television and see your number. Congratulations! For 14 weeks, you make grand plans. Eventually, you turn on the television again and see that your ticket is worthless.
Replace “lottery ticket” with “Josh Gordon,” and you understand.
Traditionally, Harvard football has treated fans more kindly. The Crimson has lost five games in the past four years and won three Ivy titles.
Last Saturday, however, Harvard took a step toward Cleveland. The Crimson dropped its season opener to Rhode Island, a program that last topped .500 in 2001—meaning the most recent season in which one Browns quarterback started 16 games.
Harvard won’t lose as much as Cleveland. This I promise.
GEORGETOWN AT COLUMBIA
The last time that Columbia won an outright league title, I was laughing at a Lampoon article. In other words, the Lions have never won an outright league title.
Neither has Georgetown—partly because the Hoyas don’t play in the Ivy League. However, the Hoyas did beat Columbia last year, in a football game that doubled as improv comedy. Georgetown proceeded to drop the next eight contests of the season.
This year’s edition of “The Dumpster Fire on Grass” has little to offer. Basically, only masochists should watch.
Pick: Columbia 17, Georgetown 10.
CORNELL AT YALE
Exactly two states didn’t ratify the 18th Amendment. One was Rhode Island, which doesn’t count for the same reason that Pluto doesn’t count as a planet. One was Connecticut. The obvious explanation, evident from my visits to the Constitution State, is that Connecticut residents couldn’t survive without booze.
New Haven isn’t a city so much as a massive toilet. And Yale isn’t a school so much as a massive zoo.
However, Connecticut may finally have a winner. Last weekend, the Bulldogs demolished Lehigh, 56-28. Yale students, gone are the days of Smirnoff and Genesee. You have a new savior now. His name is Kurt Rawlings (sophomore quarterback), and on Saturday, he completed 20 of 26 passes for 308 yards.
The prudent among us may wonder about the Big Red. Won’t Cornell provide resistance?
Dear reader: Can penguins fly? Is water dry? Has anyone ever left Ithaca and said, “Gee, I can’t wait to go back”?
Pick: Yale 38, Cornell 17
HOLY CROSS AT DARTMOUTH
Recently, a spate of scam calls has bedeviled the Dartmouth campus. Hucksters phone and pose as the Hanover Police Department. They demand $5,000 and threaten an arrest warrant if the person hangs up.
I tell this story to suggest that local students have learned to separate the real from the ersatz. Which makes Big Green football all the more perplexing.
Last Saturday, Dartmouth destroyed Stetson the same way that the Harvard Management Company destroyed the endowment. Holy Cross will provide a tougher test. Senior quarterback Peter Pujals has led the Crusaders for a millenia, and the team sits at No. 25 in FCS rankings.
Besides Columbia-Georgetown, which no one cares about, this contest holds the most intrigue. I tend towards Holy Cross because an experienced quarterback means the world. Plus, Dartmouth may forfeit when the Hanover Police Department calls and demands a loss.
Pick: Holy Cross 31, Dartmouth 30
PENN AT LEHIGH
I’m convinced that Penn wide receiver Justin Watson is a terminator.
As a high school senior, he led his team to a 16-0 record. In 2016, he posted 10 or more catches in the last five games, including contests against first-place Princeton (12 catches for 82 yards) and Harvard (10 catches for 120 yards).
“I think I’d start on any FBS team in the country,” he told The Philadelphia Inquirer.
“You’re a futuristic machine sent back to destroy humanity,” I reply.
Preseason pundits projected Watson as a first-team All-American, and I heartily agree. He’s the most explosive player I’ve watched. Good luck to anyone not named Sarah Connor.
Pick: Penn 31, Lehigh 24
LAFAYETTE AT PRINCETON
It’s ironic that “Lafayette” sounds so much like “Laughingstock” because Lafayette is a laughingstock.
Not the school—I’m sure that the classes are enriching and the campus as beautiful as Easton, Penn., can be. No, I’m talking about the football team.
Last week, the Leopards lost 59-0 to Villanova. I couldn’t lose 59-0 if I trotted out 11 preschoolers. Which begs the question: How would Lafayette fare against the local elementary school?
Princeton students are not six years old. They’ve already learned advanced topics like multiplication and apostrophes. On Saturday, the Tigers will scratch out the Leopards. After all, Princeton boasts a terminator of its own—senior quarterback John Lovett, who led the FCS with 20 rushing touchdowns last year. He may score 20 more this weekend.
Pick: Princeton 45, Lafayette 7
BROWN AT HARVARD
Rhode Island is home to several historic sites, including the nation’s first circus (1774) and oldest suspended-horse carousel (1876). However, nothing compares to the monstrosity that flanks Interstate 95.
Near Providence, R.I., visitors can admire the world’s largest bug. It’s a blue termite made of fiberglass and steel that stretches 58 feet. Locals call it “Big Blue Bug.” I’m not kidding.
On Saturday, Brown football will battle Big Blue Bug for the world title. Visiting a reeling Harvard team, the Bears will moonlight as the world’s largest pest.
Last year, Brown stomached a 32-22 defeat. In 2017, though, the Bears are riding a 28-23 win over Bryant. The victory came despite the Bulldogs gaining 485 yards versus 312 for Brown.
The Bears may seem like a trendy upset pick. I say otherwise. Harvard knows how to deal with gnats.
Pick: Harvard 30, Brown 13

So, you live in the Quad. By now you’ve probably discovered the many pros to Quad housing (n+1 life), but what if we said you could get your fave Square staples nearby too? Here’s Flyby’s comprehensive list of Quad alternatives for the regular go-tos.
The Basics
Let’s be honest, we wouldn’t survive without easy access to literally everything at CVS. Good news: there’s a Rite Aid just five minutes away from the Quad. Unfortunately, it’s not 24-hour like our beloved CVS, but you can’t have everything.
Coffee + Pastry Goodness
If there’s one thing the Quad can definitely get you, it’s your morning caffeine fix. Instead of Tatte or Crema, try Hi-Rise or Simon’s Coffee Shop, both only a short walk away from the Quad. If you prefer something a little more basic than those fancy options, Shepard St. has a Starbucks just like the Square too. Too broke? No worries. Cabot Café, located in the basement of Cabot’s E entryway, accepts BoardPlus and Crimson Cash., so say goodbye to Barker and LamCaf!
Get Fancy
Want an actual sit-down restaurant to take a date or your parents to? Instead of heading to Toscano for Italian, try Giulia on Mass Ave (beware, it’s bursting with people on Saturday nights). If you’re looking for a Henrietta’s Table alternative, check out Forage. And if you want a loud, friendly pub atmosphere à la Russell House, head to Cambridge Common instead (not the park).
Friday Night Bites
Miss Sinclair's cool atmosphere and bangin tunes? Check out the equally hipster Lizard Lounge, opened until 2 p.m. on the weekends. This intimately-cozy club in the basement of the aforementioned Cambridge Common hosts an eclectic mix of musicians and poets and offers a wide variety of boozy drinks and greasy fried food (perfect for combating the morning effects of the former). If you’ve pregamed so hard you didn’t even make it out of the quadrangle, the Quad Grille in Pfoho is your last chance to get some drunk chow (while also saving you real cash).
Go Green
If you have a questionable taste in food, favoring Sweetgreen over the more *ahem* palatable options, there’s a great Quad alternative that’ll satisfy all of your vegetation cravings (and we’re not talking about the Quad lawn). Poké City is a Hawaiian mix-and-match salad place right along Mass Ave. The best part is that they also do deliveries!
Can’t Go on Without Kong?
Lucky for you, there are two similar restaurants near the Quad that offer pseudo-Chinese food that’s definitely healthier than the Kong’s signature Scorpion Bowl or oily crab rangoon. One of the first Chinese restaurants in Cambridge, Changsho offers more traditional dishes, while Mix It specializes in fusion cuisine.
Dessert
You no longer have to venture to JP Licks to satisfy your sweet tooth when Honeycomb Creamery is right around the corner from the Quad. It’s a small parlor offering small-batch ice cream artisanally crafted with local ingredients and touting some unique flavors like “Apple Cider Donut” and “Honey Lavender.” Thank god our Canada Goose Jackets will soon conceal our waistlines!
Now that we’ve armed Quadlings with these amazing recommendations, you’re rarely going to see residents of Currier, Cabot and Pfoho in the Square. Good luck not gaining that Sophomore 20!
