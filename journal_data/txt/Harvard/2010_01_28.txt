After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Supreme Court recently voted 5-4 in favor of giving corporations and unions freedom to run campaign ads directly supporting candidates for public office. The reasoning behind the decision is that the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech extends to corporations and unions, meaning they should be able to use their resources at will to support their politician of choice. However, we believe that this decision is a blow to democracy, as the voice of corporations will continue to become unfairly loud in the political realm, drowning out the voices of individual citizens.
We believe that the intent of the First Amendment is to protect everyday citizens, not corporations or unions. While free speech is integral to our democracy, this decision permits corporations and unions to use the media as a battleground for their own interests. “May the best man win” may as well read, “May the organization with the most money to give to their man win.” Smaller voices not linked to power hitters will likely be muted, and there will be a disproportionate effect on minor political issues where special interests can easily dominate. The power of name-brand loyalty and corporate marketing skills in the American media should not be underestimated when it comes to influencing elections.
Furthermore, there are huge potential conflicts of interest, as corporations and unions can use their financial power as leverage to influence votes. When unions and corporations campaign for judges, the impartiality of the legal system will be no more than a distant memory.
Moreover, this decision underscores the need for major campaign finance reform, perhaps in the form of a constitutional amendment. Without even the slightest of ceilings on corporate and union spending, elections could well turn into auctions—with televisions as auctioneers, corporations and unions as bidders, homes as arenas, and American voters as the prize. Although the McCain-Feingold Act of 2002 still stands in certain respects, such that corporations and unions cannot finance candidates directly without limit, this decision could transform elections as we know them.
Now, the best way to cope with the potential ramifications is to mandate more transparency. If there is to be no ceiling on spending, then voters should claim the right to know which organizations are giving the most money and have the biggest influence. Transparency can grow through more widespread publishing of all groups who donate, forcing those who donate above a certain threshold to announce it in commercials. Just as voters have the right to know which groups have lobbyists in Congress, they should have the right to know who is indirectly financing candidates and to what degree.
This decision is a red flag not only for campaign finance laws but also for the Supreme Court itself. It is one of a growing number of decisions that overlook individual rights in favor of corporations. In 2007, the Supreme Court overturned a lower court’s decision to award Lilly Ledbetter discrimination compensation  because she filed her claims outside the 180-day statutory period. Apparently timeliness mattered more than the fact that Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, her employer of nearly 20 years, had been paying her less than every one of her male colleagues. Additionally, in 2008 the Supreme Court voted to reduce the amount Exxon Mobil had to pay for an oil spill from $2.5 billion to $500 million, covering the cost of the economic losses while disregarding thousands of Alaskans whose livelihoods were destroyed by 11 million pounds of oil. After this most recent decision, we hope that the tide of the Supreme Court’s decisions can be turned before individual rights are completely lost in a sea of corporate interests.

On his final episode as host of The Tonight Show, Conan O’Brien ’85 used some of his last few moments to comfort his disaffected fans. “All I ask,” he said, is to “not be cynical. I hate cynicism…it’s my least favorite quality. It doesn’t lead anywhere.” Indeed, although Conan had many reasons to be cynical that night, his ratings weren’t one of them. Conan’s farewell not only eclipsed Letterman that evening but every program in primetime as well.
What makes his final show’s numbers so extraordinary is that they’re the climax of a hot streak. In the two weeks preceding NBC’s removal of Conan from the 11:35 p.m. slot due to his disappointing ratings (and the failure of The Jay Leno Show), Conan’s average ratings were never higher. Two Fridays ago, Conan’s viewership was fifty percent larger than it had been the entire season. As the New York Times noted, “if even a small fraction of the…viewers who flocked to Mr. O’Brien’s show last week had turned up regularly in his earlier ratings results, he would almost surely still be hosting.”
How did this happen? Part of the credit, to be sure, lies with the efforts of “Team Coco,” a zealous faction of fans who protested in support of the late-night host throughout the country. But even more, Conan’s show underwent a substantive change. Simply put, he stopped being nice. It was only when he injected his jokes with venom and directed them at a relevant target that his ratings soared.
In Conan’s last few weeks, because of his fury at NBC, his jokes were bursting with the cynicism that he cautioned his followers to avoid. For example, he recently explained that as part of his severance agreement he had to “return the Etch-a-Sketch [his] contract was written on.” He also informed his viewers that they should believe NBC’s pledge to end this fiasco before the Winter Olympics because “when NBC says something, you can take that to the bank.” Furthermore, because Conan’s name was always in the news, his strikes at NBC were always topical. This type of humor stood in contrast to his usually irreverent and irrelevant style, such as firing wax replicas of movie stars out of cannons and knocking over a domino stack of Domino’s pizza employees.
The country’s extremely positive reception to these relevant and subversive bits indicates why Conan only lasted for seven months. The late-night shows that air right after the 11 p.m. news (The Tonight Show, The Late Show, and Saturday Night Live) have long served the role of ridiculing the public figures and news headlines. People flock to these programs not only for their silly sketches but also for their ability to verbalize the discontent of the American people through humor. Leno first overtook Letterman in the ratings when he famously asked Hugh Grant, who had been recently arrested for propositioning a prostitute, “what the hell were you thinking?” Letterman scored big with his controversial joke about Sarah Palin’s daughter.
Conan, however, was far too polite to attack public figures. His absurd and non sequitur humor worked exceedingly well at 12:35 p.m., but by refusing to change his style for 11:35 p.m., he implicitly rejected the late-night tradition. But hopefully, with a contract barring his return to television until September, Conan will use the time to pick up the pieces of his franchise and muster up the confidence to arm his jests next time with the caustic social commentary that America has always looked to late night to provide.

There is a world out there, beyond the ivy-covered professors in ivy-covered halls. A world many college students instinctively fear. A world which we have practically no exposure to before being thrust headfirst into it after graduation. Even those who dodge its grasp by retreating into the haven of grad school cannot elude it forever. I discovered this world last year by forcibly inserting myself into it. Yes, I am one of those who voluntarily burst my Harvard bubble and sought what lay beyond: the real world.
The Harvard College admissions website currently boasts that, “60 percent of Harvard students integrate international experience into their undergraduate careers.” While this is more than Yale, it is only about the same percentage as Dartmouth and other schools. Indeed, Harvard has only recently begun actively encouraging students to step outside Johnston gate and generally only encourages time off before one’s freshman year. Luckily, the Office of International Programs has been expanding its resources (the $100 million gift from David Rockefeller ’36 has been a great help), and now even has a special link on its website with resources for those interested in gap years. This expansion reflects a huge shift in dogma from years past, when the prevailing view of study abroad was, “You’re at Harvard. Why would you want to be anywhere else?”
I wanted to be somewhere else to see if I could survive somewhere else; to gain some perspective on Harvard and life. Being immersed in an institution full of incredible people, you can easily forget that you are also a smart, capable person who probably has a bright future ahead of them.
I had lost this perspective. I needed to regain it. Yes, I would be behind my class and would graduate a year late. Yes, I would miss all my activities and friends. But after experiencing repeated depressive episodes and existential crises, I decided it was useless to wonder what I was doing with my life. I needed to decide what I was doing with my life.
When the plane touched down at Malpensa airport outside Milan, I froze in my seat. I was spending a year here? In a country where I barely spoke the language and didn’t know anyone? And not even getting credit for it? What did I think I was doing?
The answers to these questions soon became clear. I was there, in the cheesiest but truest of terms, to find myself. I had adventures that one can’t replicate and met people that I never would have on this side of Massachusetts Ave. I saw Europe rejoice more fervently than America at the election of President Obama. I learned a new language more efficiently than any intensive course could have taught me. I learned to cook. I ate too much gelato. In the end, one year was just not enough.
Milan was my fairy godmother. She taught me independence, resourcefulness, and how to not feel inferior to the person in my section who won Jeopardy at age 15, is a concertizing pianist, and speaks seven languages. So, countless irreplaceable and life-changing experiences later, I decided that I was ready to be a college student again.
Taking time off is something Harvard does not easily let you do. Given the Sisyphean stress-cycle on which this college keeps us pedaling, it’s hard to do anything but focus but on the next midterm and to try not to get sick. Even once you make the difficult decision to leave, jumping through all the relevant bureaucratic hoops is an Olympic feat. I was still getting emails deep into October from various offices telling me that I still owed some amount on my term bill.
And taking time off is not for everyone. There is a definite stigma associated with gap years in the middle of college. People look at you thinking “Was there something wrong with her?” or “Couldn’t handle the pressure, huh?” Then when you clarify the reasons for your decision, you immediately become “gutsy” and “impressive” and they are “so jealous of such a wonderful opportunity.” Potential employers will look at you differently as well. This is not a bad thing—you may also look differently at potential employers.
Even if you don’t want to be out of step with your class, there is no Foreign Cultures class at Harvard that can match living in an actual foreign culture. It’s okay to go outside the Harvard bubble. My time away from Harvard gave me an invaluable perspective on how Harvard, the world, and my life fit together. It changed me as a person and left me better able to face the real world when it comes. It could do the same for you.

To the editors:
The Dec. 14th opinion piece “Make Like a Democrat,” cites a figure of 47 million uninsured Americans. This oft-quoted statistic is actually a gross overestimation of the problem—recent research suggests that the number of Americans who cannot currently afford health insurance is much lower.
A new study by Dr. June O’Neill, who served as Director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1995-1999, shows that nearly half of those uninsured Americans could likely afford to purchase health coverage. The average “voluntarily uninsured” household makes $65,000 per year.
We should not rush into the creation of a new, expensive healthcare system without a better understanding of the uninsured population. As long as we continue basing our arguments on inaccurate numbers, it’s hard to see how we can make effective policy decisions.

To the editors:
It was with great dismay that I opened The Crimson this morning to read Adbelnasser A. Rashid’s op-ed “Defending the Indefensible.” It is not that I find his opinions to be without merit, but rather that I found his expression of them as hyperbolic and needlessly demagogic as the ones against which he argues.
Having been raised in a Reform Jewish household, I grew up with a sense of personal connection to the state of Israel. As a young adult, I was troubled by various policies and practices of the Israeli government that came to my attention, such as those to which Mr. Rashid referred, yet constantly aware of the innocent Israeli lives lost through terrorist actions. I realized that this issue, like most, cannot be viewed as black and white.
In the popular imagination, there seem to be only two ways of viewing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One—that which Mr. Rashid espouses in his article—portrays Israel as an oppressive force that brutally persecutes the Palestinian people. The other, the one I was raised with, describes Israel as a peaceful place constantly under attack by terrorist groups dedicated to its utter annihilation. However, as a rational person, I can understand that neither of these discourses accurately describes the situation. Yet one-sided voices like Mr. Rashid’s (and certainly a plethora of others that are ideologically opposed, yet equally uncompromising) do nothing to help solve the conflict, and instead serve to embitter and further polarize people—as evidenced by inflammatory comments from readers on both sides of the issue posted on the Crimson’s online version of the story—over what is possibly the most pressing issue of our time.

To the editors:
In the Dec. 14 op-ed “Defending the Indefensible,” Adbelnasser A. Rashid’s rash criticism of Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren’s visit to Harvard is based on the false pretenses of the Goldstone report—a report that has been called misleading and inimical to peace by such mainstream publications as the Economist and public officials such as Susan Rice, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mr. Rashid’s unquestioning acceptance of this report reveals his anti-Israel bias. While no one would deny that collateral damage occurred on both sides as a result of the Gaza War, Mr. Rashid’s intimation that Israel targeted these civilians out of pure malice is troubling. It has been well established that Israel fired upon Hamas operatives who cynically used civilian entities as cover.
But for Mr. Rashid to claim that Israel, in defending itself against this foe, was “deliberate[ly] targeting” civilians, he would, no doubt, have to equally condemn America’s deliberate “targeting” of any civilians killed in World War II in its fight against the Japanese and Nazis. This logic is clearly skewed, as it requires a sovereign nation defending its citizens—while simultaneously adhering to the highest standards of ethical warfare (including, in Israel’s case, the sending of text messages and dropping of warning leaflets with evacuation instructions for residents before targeting an area)—to face the frightful prospect that it will be accused of war crimes (by the indignant likes of Mr. Rashid) if unfortunate civilian deaths occur. Even more troubling is Mr. Rashid’s silence when it comes to Hamas, which has stolen foreign aid and committed violence against its own people.
More comical still is Mr. Rashid’s attempt to paint Israel’s Ambassador Michael Oren as a radical war sympathizer. In fact, Mr. Oren has been on the center-left of the Israeli political spectrum, and once even advocated for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank! During his Kennedy school visit, Mr. Oren was simply defending Israel’s right to defend itself (a right Mr. Rashid would likely want stripped from Jewish state). Unlike Mr. Rashid, Mr. Oren is one of the foremost scholars on the Israeli-Arab conflict, and his account of the Six-Day War has been praised as erudite and even-handed by the New York Times and other leading publications. Yet, instead of embracing Mr. Oren and his largely moderate views, Rashid rips into him purely for his affiliation with the Jewish state of Israel—a state Mr. Rashid clearly abhors.

Cambridge lawyer Dennis A. Benzan declared his candidacy this week for the Mass. Senate seat vacated by recently imprisoned Anthony D. Galluccio.
Benzan is now one of a half-dozen candidates vying for the seat in the special election, which is scheduled for May 11. The primary for the special election is slated for April 13.
Benzan, a Democrat, told The Crimson that he made the decision to run last week, after Republican Scott P. Brown handily won the U.S. Senate seat that had been occupied by Democrat Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 since 1962.
“That night I felt so much frustration,” Benzan said regarding the election upset. “I had already been considering running, and that’s what made me decide.”
Benzan said he plans to highlight economic concerns that he said Martha Coakley, Brown’s Democratic opponent, neglected in her campaign. He added that he wants to reach out to Democrats who did not go to the polls for Coakley, and said that he will emphasize his personal background throughout the campaign.
“I grew up in Cambridge. I don’t know one individual in my neighborhood who went to Harvard or MIT,” Benzan said. “I know plenty of my peers who went to prison and became addicted to drugs.”
“I’m an example to children of what they’re capable of accomplishing. In the process of doing this campaign, I will inspire younger people to feel again that they can participate in the political process,” he added.
Brian McNiff, a spokesperson for Mass. Secretary of State William F. Galvin, told The Crimson that six candidates—Michael J. Albano, Andrew Bertinalli, Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, Daniel C. Hill, Timothy Flaherty, and Benzan—have filed the necessary paperwork to run in the Democratic primary. McNiff added that one Republican, Diane Carell, and one Independent, John Cesan, have also declared their intent to run.
Despite the long list of competitors, Benzan told The Crimson, “I’m the candidate to watch.”
Benzan ran for the state House of Representatives in 1996 and 1998. In 1998 he lost to Jarrett T. Barrios ’90, who went on to hold the Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex state Senate seat before Galluccio was elected.
Galluccio himself was sent to the state Senate by special election, after Barrios stepped down to run a health care company in 2007.
Galluccio resigned the seat earlier this month after he was sentenced to a year in jail for failing a series of breathalyzer tests less than three days after he was put on probation for an October hit-and-run accident in Cambridge. He plans to appeal his jail sentence and will be represented by Harvard Law School Professor Charles J. Ogletree, according to the Boston Globe.
The candidate elected to succeed Galluccio will represent parts of Cambridge and several surrounding towns in the state Senate.

When the financial crisis hit last year, some seniors who had signed with finance or consulting firms suddenly found themselves in limbo, as several shell-shocked companies rescinded offers.
Despite last year’s disappointing recruiting season, Harvard students have continued to flock to careers in finance and consulting during this recruiting cycle—which will reach its peak in the coming weeks—according to Robin E. Mount, director of the Office of Career Services.
But instead of scaring students away from careers in finance and consulting, last year’s job hunt woes have inspired a degree of creativity among applicants and strengthened their resolve to break into these industries, Mount said.
“Harvard students like a good challenge,” she said, adding that while exact figures are not yet available, she has seen consistent student interest in consulting and finance positions this year, along with a strong return of finance and consulting companies to campus.
Yolande Daeninck, a spokesperson at the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, corroborated Mount’s observation.
“The overall number of consultants McKinsey will recruit this year will be higher than last year,” Daeninck said.
Given the uncertainty inspired by last year’s hiring cycle, students have become more entrepreneurial in their job search than in the past, Mount said.
One senior who was hired by the investment banking arm at Goldman Sachs only received his offer only after aggressively pursuing the firm, he told The Crimson. He and other students interviewed for this article asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve their relationships with firms and because hiring decisions are a sensitive topic in the student body.
After receiving job offers from a host of other banks, but not from Goldman, the senior called recruiters at the bank and asked that they reconsider his application—an effort that eventually landed him a job at the bank.
One junior who will be interviewing for positions at financial firms next week said that while he has secured several interviews, he has only been successful with firms with which he had networked beforehand by sending follow up e-mails, making phone calls to employees at the firms, and going to firm “meet and greet” information sessions.
According to Mount, the energy seen among Harvard’s applicants is lacking at many peer institutions, where students have been discouraged by last year’s recruiting cycle.
At a job fair hosted by Harvard and MIT, for example, Mount said that recruiters commented on how Harvard students largely outnumbered their peers from MIT.

The College will reinstate the Student Life Fund after a semester-long absence, but the College administration will now have greater control of the fund’s distribution.
For the spring semester, $50,000 will be available to finance domestic travel for student organizations and to supplement funding for House Committee-sponsored events, according to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
The College administration alone will review travel funding applications from student groups and distribute the supplemental funds to HoCos—two tasks originally entrusted to the UC when the fund was initiated.
“In reviewing the success of [the Student Life Fund], Dean Hammonds determined that the College, which is making the funds available, should also be responsible for awarding those funds,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mailed statement.
At the peak of the University’s budgetary crisis last spring, Hammonds temporarily deactivated the fund pending further review of its use and purpose, according to Assistant Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin.
When Hammonds created the fund at the beginning of the 2008-2009 academic year, it amounted to $75,000 drawn from her discretionary funds, and was jointly administered by the UC and the College administration.
According to former UC Treasurer Anthony R. Britt ’10, the UC had allocated $30,000 of last year’s fund to HoCos for House formals, and the remaining $45,000—of which the UC had doled out $19,000 by the time the fund was suspended—was to be distributed for travel opportunities based on criteria established by the UC.
College administrators said they will use criteria similar to last year’s when reviewing applications for domestic travel. Those criteria provided funds for “one-time, novel” travel opportunities, Neal said.
Though UC leaders lauded the return of the Student Life Fund, some said that they have mixed feelings about the administrative changes.
“I think it is unquestionably good that it is back,” UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said. “Obviously I would prefer that the UC would control the allocation of the fund.”
But Hysen added that the removal of the UC as a middleman could “eliminate a layer of bureaucracy” and simplify the application process for students.
Despite the College administration’s new control over the fund, Hysen said the UC still hopes to have a role in its disbursement.

While other Harvard students watched last night’s State of the Union address on TVs across campus, Janell J. Holloway ’13 had a much closer seat—in First Lady Michelle Obama’s personal box.
Holloway, a D.C. native, was offered the opportunity after her involvement in the D.C. Scholars Program, a program President Barack Obama and the First Lady started last year to award White House internships to D.C. public school students.
Holloway said that a representative from the White House called her last Tuesday to offer her the opportunity to attend the State of the Union as a special guest of Michelle Obama.
“At first I think I thought it was a joke,” Holloway said. “Then as she started telling me more details, I was really excited. My heart started pounding. It was a really amazing feeling.”
As part of the first class of D.C. Scholars, Holloway spent last summer researching local issues, particularly child abuse, with the White House Domestic Policy Council. Holloway joined one of her eight D.C. Scholars classmates, Clayton Armstrong of the University of Arizona, at the Capitol last night.
Although Holloway had met the Obamas during her internship, she said she was overwhelmed by the invitation.
“I don’t know if I said anything at first—I kind of lost my words,” she said. “I’m not really able yet to appreciate how important this will be for history. Right now I’m just in the moment.”
Holloway’s parents echoed their daughter’s sentiments.
“Considering the historic nature of the address, we’re just very excited and honored to be a part of history,” her father, James R. Holloway, said.
While Holloway said that the White House did not give specific reasons as to why they selected her from among the other D.C. Scholars, she thought that her commitment to community service played a role in the decision.
Holloway, who was home in D.C. from Tuesday night until this morning, was told to keep the opportunity a secret until the White House released the information yesterday.
“She was, like, ‘I’m going home for a couple of days,’” her roommate, Cameron E. Niven ’13, said. “When I asked her, she just said it was for an event.”
Holloway was part of a delegation of 15 guests of Michelle Obama.

On Sunday night, nearly 150 patrons crowded into the ground floor of OM Restaurant and Lounge—but unlike any other night, jazz emanated from the lounge, as customers gathered to support earthquake victims in Haiti.
Though the Harvard Square Business Association has not formally organized a fundraising campaign, individual businesses around the Square—such as OM—have started their own fundraising projects to support the devastated nation.
The event at OM raised $6,300 through a $20 cover charge and donated proceeds from select menu items, according to Rahim B. Kanani, a research associate at the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations.
In a similar effort, Upstairs on the Square—located across from OM—made between $25,000 and $28,000 during its day-long fundraiser on Monday. Proceeds from breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the restaurant were donated to Partners in Health, a Harvard-affiliated nonprofit that operates community-based clinics in Haiti and eight other countries, according to owner Mary-Catherine Deibel.
The fundraising event at Upstairs—which attracted about 500 people throughout the day—was held in place of the restaurant’s post-holiday staff party.
But local restaurants were not the only businesses to raise money for Haiti. The José Mateo Ballet Theatre held “Dance for World Community: a benefit for earthquake relief in Haiti” last Saturday, raising $8,000 for the Haiti Fund at the Boston Foundation, which will match that amount for a total of $16,000.
And while folk music venue Club Passim has plans to hold a benefit concert next Tuesday, Rick Fogarty, owner of Plan B Cut and Color Boutique, said he is matching 20 percent of all pledges for Haiti made through his salon’s Facebook fans.
In addition to businesses hosting single-day events, The Charles Hotel, Qdoba, Via Vai, and ALO have all pledged longer-term fundraising campaigns.
At the Charles Hotel and its outlets—which include Henrietta’s Table, Rialto, Noir, and the Regattabar—customers have been given the option of adding a one-time donation to their checks. Customers have so far donated more than $12,000, according to Rebecca H. Fetner, Rialto’s public relations and marketing manager.
Aside from encouraging patrons to donate, Rialto is also donating all of its proceeds from vegetable side dishes to PIH. Rialto’s diners have been purchasing more vegetable side dishes than usual, Fetner said, adding that the restaurant has netted more than $1,500 in donations from vegetable side dishes.
Proceeds from soda sales at Qdoba will go to Haiti relief efforts. For the entire month of January, the restaurant will donate one dollar to the International Red Cross for every large soda purchased.

CORRECTION: January 28, 2010 
 
An earlier version of the Jan. 28 news article "Square Businesses Support Haiti" stated that the special event at OM Restaurant and Lounge was held on Saturday. In fact, it occurred on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Reverend Peter J. Gomes’ study is the essence of old Harvard: dimly lit, the room is an optical tangle of varied fabrics and award ribbons, anonymous busts along the walls, and countless books. The den of earthy colors lies in the depth of a building Gomes has called home since 1974.
But perhaps not for long. The Plummer Professor of Christian Morals is now in his 40th year at Harvard and anticipating his 68th birthday. Gomes chuckled as he reflected on the days when he had “mojo” in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. He is in preparation for the denouement of his tenure at the University.
Gomes said that he had always planned to retire once reaching the age of 70—and he will reach that benchmark in time to retire in 2012. Fortuitously, Gomes’ desired time for departure corresponds neatly with a retirement plan for faculty announced in early December.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Divinity School—with which Gomes is affiliated—were among the five Harvard schools that announced last year the first retirement plan for faculty since federal law did away with mandatory retirement in 1994.
At the time of the announcement, administrators said that the plan—which offers one-, three-, and four-year plans—would serve the needs of ageing faculty, as well as provide a flexible method of controlling the size of the faculty.
Gomes said that he does not yet know whether he will accept the package—but he is certainly considering the option: “I’m keeping all my options open,” he said yesterday.
Gomes, who underwent heart pacemaker surgery in October, said he still has a legacy to build in the years he has left at Harvard. He said that he is in the best position to garner funding for the renovation of Memorial Church—an edifice that Gomes deeply associates with his time at the University.
Gomes views himself as an upholder of “one of these ancient institutions of mother Harvard,” said Scott H. Dickison, a former student of Gomes at the Divinity school. “So much of what it is today, it is because of him.”
Since Gomes’ arrival on campus in 1970, the religious climate at Harvard has seen significant changes. When Harvard stopped requiring students to attend chapel daily in 1886, the University earned the moniker “Godless Harvard” from counterparts Yale and Princeton Universities. Yale stopped the requirement in 1926, while Princeton ceased the practice in 1960.
The notion of a “Godless” campus persisted even when Gomes arrived less than a century later. But now Gomes said that the religious communities on campus are decidedly more active than they had been in previous decades.
“Increasingly, [I see] religious people who aren’t ashamed,” Gomes said. “There is a sense that religion may have an answer or two that we haven’t figured out yet.”
Gomes affirmed the rumors that he has been working on his memoir. Smiling at the idea, the author of two best-selling theology books said that he has tried his hand at autobiographical writing but ultimately decided to wait until he leaves Harvard.
“If you’re too candid while you’re still in service—well, you can get in a lot of trouble,” said Gomes, a consistent presence at Faculty meetings who has garnered a reputation for speaking his mind.
But reticence may not be the only virtue holding him back from pursuing an autobiographical project: “I haven’t figured out the genius of organizing it yet,” Gomes said, adding that 67 years have afforded him a bevy of experiences—swearing in Presidents Ronald W. Reagan and George H.W. Bush, no less—that would intensify the challenge of documenting his life.
Gomes—who has until June 30 to accept or decline the package—is just one example among professors throughout FAS who are eligible for the retirement plan. But Gomes said that he won’t be bought off the pulpit that easily.
“You give your life to Harvard,” he said of the days when he first took the position. He added that he has maintained a long-term vision of his service to Harvard.
“People are here for the work. I don’t think it’s going to be a brain drain,” Gomes said. “To try to buy out the faculty is a very costly measure. I’ll wait till my time comes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Campus Democrats and Republicans found common ground in their praise for President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last night, with students of both political leanings hailing the speech for its bipartisan rhetoric.
“I did see it as a start on a redefined focus,” said Luis A. Martinez ’12, a Harvard Republican Club vice president who helped host a Republican Club viewing event in Winthrop House. “It was effective in communicating a fuller platform toward reenergizing America.”
Students said they saw the address as an effort to bolster the Democratic Party’s momentum, which took a hit after Republican Scott P. Brown won a historically Democratic seat in the Mass. senatorial election last week. Brown will be the 41st Republican Senator, giving his party filibuster power that could derail the Democrats’ plans for health care reform.
“This really was a call to action,” said Harvard Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, who watched the speech at a Dems-organized event in a Leverett House common room. “As the Obama administration sets the pace, we as an organization will definitely respond.”
Obama’s pledge yesterday to abolish the federal policy of barring openly gay members from the military this year struck a chord of approval among students. Obama promised during his presidential campaign to work to reform the 1993 “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy but has not yet taken concrete action.
“Historically, the military has been one of the first segments of America to integrate, whether it is by gender or race or any other factor,” said Harvard ROTC Association President Karl J. Kmiecik ’10. “The president as commander in chief has made a decision that falls within the proud traditions of our country.”
Currently, Harvard does not recognize ROTC for what the administration considers to be discriminatory policies, and the Dems and Republicans have joined in past years to campaign for ROTC’s return.
Other viewing parties offered lighter, less partisan atmospheres for attendees.
At Adams House, House Committee organizers invited a government tutor and the Adams Brewing Club to host their own apolitical viewing of the speech. Members of the Brewing Club brought a festive tone to the event—though drinking each time to the word “job” proved infeasible. Attendees were nonetheless anxious to hear from Obama, Samuel B. Novey ’11 said.
“The country is at a very perilous moment,” said Novey, adding that he appreciated the timeliness of Obama’s motivational message. “He said, ‘We don’t quit.’”
Novey, who was involved in the Obama campaign, said that he and other supporters had grown “a little concerned and disappointed” in recent months, as the administration struggled to deliver on its ambitious plans. But he said that the speech resonated with his frustrations, particularly in moments when Obama exhorted Republicans to commit to reaching across the aisle.
Novey also applauded Obama’s promise to support students’ tuition, which he described as “one of the most exciting and overlooked issues.” He noted that Obama’s plan to forgive loans for students entering public service careers was especially relevant and said he personally planned to take advantage of such a program.
But the positive responses to Obama’s speech may simply reflect the high proportion of self-described liberals on campus.
“Anything coming out of Barack Obama’s mouth has to be high up there,” Berkenfeld said, rating the speech as a nine out of 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chief executive officer, management consultant, and software engineer are at the very top of the list of popular careers for Harvard graduates.  On the opposite end, with a total of one graduate, is professional football player for the LNFA.
The LNFA is the Liga Nacional de Futbol Americano, Spain’s American football league, and the one graduate is ’09 Crimson football captain Carl Ehrlich.
Ehrlich, who graduated from Harvard in December 2009, arrived in Spain last Thursday to play for the Valencia Firebats, a professional football team in Valencia.
How did Ehrlich find himself on the Mediterranean gridiron? As he relates on his blog, Ehrlich had little idea in December what lay ahead for him.  Minutes after his last exam, however, a recruiter for the Firebats e-mailed him with an offer, and Ehrlich had a solution.
“I always wanted to travel, and I never got to travel with football,” Ehrlich explains. “This was basically a chance to go abroad, and get paid to do it.”
“It came as a shock initially…I thought he was going into consulting,” says senior teammate Cheng Ho. “But I think it was a pretty sweet opportunity to see another culture.  It’ll be a lot of fun for him.”
The transition into Spanish lifestyle has been smooth. With about a month between the end of Harvard and his departure for Valencia, Ehrlich had time to refine his Spanish skills, which he last used his freshman year in Spanish Aa.
“The kids on the team have been pleasantly surprised with how much Spanish I speak,” Ehrlich notes.
Ehrlich is making time to see the sights of Valencia, Spain’s third largest city, during his time, and he also devotes some hours to participate in the Spanish custom of siesta.
“Naps are huge here,” Ehrlich says. “On the average day…they work until 2:00 and then everything shuts down.”
On the athletic side, Ehrlich is playing both ways for Valencia, as an offensive guard, defensive lineman, and linebacker.
As one of the three “imports,” or foreigners, allowed on every LNFA team, Ehrlich is expected to excel.
“There’s a clear difference between the imports and the Spanish players,” Ehrlich explains. “The competition [in the LNFA] is not up to Harvard’s level. It’s a much simplified game.”
Football is not played at any Spanish high school, so the Spaniards who play have picked it up just for fun—to play the sport they see on TV.
Most of the Spanish players have day jobs (practices take place at night) and, for them, multi-tasking is a must.  Ehrlich relates that the first night he was there, the team sent a man named Paco to fix his bed.  Paco, it turned out, was also the Firebats’ starting defensive end.
“He was out in the hall buzz-sawing this random piece of wood…He fixed the bed perfectly,” Ehrlich says. “And I saw him at practice two hours later.”
And as might be expected, American football is nowhere near as popular as in the United States.  Games attract only a couple hundred fans.
“When you say football, they think soccer,” Ehrlich explains.
In his first game, a 14-6 victory over the Badalona Dracs on Saturday, Ehrlich was ejected after unintentionally clotheslining a Badalona player.
“It was an accident,” Ehrlich insists. “The refs run a very tight ship around here.”
Ehrlich attempted to say “It’s not my fault” in Spanish but instead said “I don’t understand.”
“Everyone was yelling at me,” Ehrlich recounts. “I was like ‘Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento!’ [but] as soon as it happened I got the hook.”
Ehrlich will be forced to sit out next week’s game.
And, you may wonder, what is a firebat? Ehrlich classifies these mysterious creatures on his blog as “Iberian, heat-seeking, airborne rodent[s].”  But the animals carry great meaning in the city as well.  Valencia is famous for the festival of Las Falles, or “the fires,” a wild, five-day celebration of St. Joseph.  Bats, on the other hand, are a part of Valencia folklore, because, according to Ehrlich, they would fly off and warn the city when an enemy was approaching.
The season ends in June, and Ehrlich may stick around for some time to see Spain and Europe.  As for a career in Spanish football, he doesn’t think so.
“Maybe I’ll stay for an extra month,” Ehrlich laughs. “But I’m not ready to commit to being an ex-pat just yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having already taken down five Ancient Eight opponents this season, the Crimson women’s swimming team will try to leave its final two Ivy opponents in its wake this weekend.
Harvard (5-0, 5-0 Ivy) will take on Princeton (4-0, 4-0 Ivy) and Yale (6-1, 4-0 Ivy) Saturday at the annual HYP meet at DeNuzio Pool in Princeton, NJ.
The match-up is the Crimson’s last dual meet of the season, but it presents the first serious threat to Harvard’s undefeated record.
“This is absolutely our biggest meet so far,” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said. “We haven’t been really challenged by any of the other teams yet, so we’re excited.”
The Harvard team is coming off a blowout 177-66 victory at home last Saturday against Brown. In the meet, the Crimson claimed first place in all 13 events and had four swimmers, including co-captain Alexandra Clarke and juniors Katy Hinkle and Kate Mills, who were a factor in at least two wins or more.
“We have a very, very strong group where everyone can contribute,” senior freestlyer Christine Kaufmann said.
The Harvard swimmers will have to work together in order to defeat a strong Yale squad and the home team, Princeton, this weekend. The meet, which will consist of 16 events, requires nine victories to secure the overall win.
The Tigers, who have also remained unbeaten this season, are coming off of a big win against Dartmouth last Sunday. At that meet, Princeton beat the Big Green in 12 swimming events and placed no lower than second in any of the others.
The Bulldogs had a five-match winning streak of their own until falling to Navy last weekend in a 151-149 decision that was determined by the last race of the day.
At last year’s HYP showdown, the three teams battled it out at Blodgett Pool, resulting in split results for the Crimson. Harvard pummeled Yale 232-87 but lost to the Tigers 170.5-148.5.
“Last year when we competed against Princeton, their swimmers were rested and they got us in key areas,” Morawski said. “We didn’t win the meet, but on the events that we didn’t win, we went second, third, and fourth.”
In the dual meet format, the Crimson’s consistency and widespread talent wasn’t enough to get two wins, but it did bring to bear Harvard’s most powerful asset.
“The strength of our team truly lies in our depth,” Kaufmann said. “[Our opponents] have a few standout competitors that are very fast, but even if we’re not able to win every event, hopefully we’ll be able to get in there and get second, third, fourth again.”
Harvard’s depth will become especially important next month when it competes to defend its Ivy League title, and the Crimson will use Saturday’s meet to perfect its technique before the big end-of-season tournaments.
“We’re expecting to have some great races,” Morawski said. “Hopefully we’ll be fast, but we really hope that all the little things we’ve been working on all year will pay off: making sure that we’re holding our streamlines in the water, working our kicks off the wall, and those kinds of things.”
Harvard is looking to bring together a season of hard work before the ECAC and Ivy League Championships at the end of February.
“This is a great time to race some of the top swimmers in the league and see how we match up,” Kaufmann said.
Coach Morawski agreed that the HYP meet will be useful in seeing how the Crimson’s athletes can compete head-to-head against their opponents, but emphasized that the competition will rely on a cohesive effort by the entire roster.
“I expect my captains and my seniors to lead, of course, but we try to have every single person on the team have a role to step up and do something,” Morawski said. “If we win, it could be just because someone said something inspirational to someone else just before they got in the pool. Even if [a team member] doesn’t even swim in the event, they could help us win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I feel like I’ve seen six seasons of Harvard men’s hockey the past three years. What do I mean by that?
What I mean is that over the past three seasons, the Crimson has played the part of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to perfection.
The story has been the same each year. Early in the season, Harvard looks completely defeated. Then about a month before playoffs, the team begins to look like an ECAC Championship caliber team.
The 2009-2010 season has gone like this: Harvard endured a 10-game winless streak in November and December, but now has emerged and is unbeaten in its past five ECAC contests. The team has moved up to a respectable 5-5-3 in league and is pulling off quite the season turnaround.
Normally, I’d be surprised by this type of comeback, but for Harvard hockey, seasonal ups and downs are expected. This trend of extended losing streaks followed by a late-season resurgence has become an oddly common phenomenon.
In 2007-2008, the Crimson suffered a nine-game winless streak in December and January, only to finish the year with an 11-4-1 run. Last year, a five-game unbeaten streak followed 13 games without a victory.
Why has Harvard been prone to these streaks? It really is impossible to answer that question with any accuracy. I could try to put my finger on something like pre-season preparation, confidence, the academic schedule, or some other cause, but the truth may be that these streaks of really bad and really good are just coincidences.
Whatever the reason for the streakiness, the Crimson is enjoying the latest ride.
“For the most part, our team has been doing a lot better,” captain Alex Biega said. “It’s very nice to have the winning culture back in the locker room.”
Over the past five games, in which Harvard has taken down No. 5 Yale and No. 13 Union, improved performance has come on both ends of the ice. Offensively, the Crimson has notched at least three goals in its past five ECAC games.  Defensively, the improvement is even more pronounced. Harvard has given up 1.6 goals per game in its last five ECAC contests compared to 3.9 goals per game for the rest of the ECAC season.
There is something I want to say, though, about the Crimson’s current hot streak. If the team is going to keep its momentum, it has to avoid reverting to the poor third period performance that plagued the early parts of the season.
Over the course of this year, the Crimson has been outscored 29-16 in the third period, while outscoring opponents 34-32 in the first two frames. Against Colgate and Clarkson in November, the Crimson let two-goal leads slip away in the final minutes. Struggling in crunch time could end up being a backbreaker for a revitalized team.
Fitness, focus, strategy—whatever the third period problem was—it does look like Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 may have found a solution. In its five-game ECAC unbeaten streak, the Crimson has given up just three of its eight goals in the final period.
What’s an even better sign is that Harvard put together a third period comeback of its own against RPI last weekend. With three goals in the third, the Crimson clawed back and tied the game with just seconds on the clock.
With the hot-and-cold Harvard hockey team, anything can happen for the rest of the year.
“We’re capable of ending up anywhere from first to eighth place in our league,” Biega said.
Maybe we’ll see a run to the ECAC Championship game like in 2007-2008, or maybe we’ll see the squad get upset in the first round of playoffs like last season.  I guess it just depends on who shows up: Jekyll or Hyde.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The early indoor track season can seem monotonous. Countless meets and invitationals take place each weekend, while competitors look far ahead to conference championships. But Harvard track captain Jack Brady has found a way to keep the season interesting—just reach a few milestones.
The senior shot putter and weight thrower has improved dramatically over the course of the season, as evidenced by his performance at the Harvard Select Meet last Saturday. The Crimson standout not only won both weight events in the same competition for the first time in his career, but also set personal bests in each. Brady’s heave of 16.53 meters in the shot put once again put him well over the IC4A qualifying mark, as did his throw of 18.20 meters with the hammer.
Although Brady remains almost a meter off the NCAA provisional mark in both events, his strong efforts early in the season bode well for further improvement. His coach is grateful not just for the boost in points that Brady provides each week, but also for the good example his captain has set, with or without a weight in his hand.
“[Brady] has been a great leader both as a captain and as a role model for being a dedicated student-athlete,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “He wants to put his best foot forward, and for him to have this kind of season as a senior, I’m really happy for him.”
Fortunately for Brady and the Crimson, it seems that the senior’s best has yet to come. With over a month until IC4A’s, the captain has plenty of chances to improve on his personal mark.

It used to be that people could just show up to a Harvard men’s basketball game. Now the market for tickets is as competitive as the summer job market.
Take this weekend: both of the Crimson’s games in New York have sold out—a Friday night contest at Columbia, and Saturday night’s game at Cornell, the first of two highly touted match-ups against the league’s two-time defending champions.
The Cornell game looked to be a attraction early on because the two are arguably the best and certainly the most visible teams in the Ivy League, with both having challenged top Division I programs so far this season, including Cornell’s 5-point loss to Kansas.
Columbia, meanwhile, has recent history with the Crimson, having beaten Harvard last season at home on a last-second jumper by current senior Kevin Bulger. Lions fans seem to be rushing to Levien Gym in hopes of seeing similar action. Harvard has emerged victorious only once in its last six trips to Levien Gym.
But it’s not just New York that’s going crazy for the Crimson. Tickets for Harvard’s home contests against the Killer P’s—Penn and Princeton—went up for sale today at 3 pm and are disappearing quickly.
According to senior running back Cheng Ho, who has been in contact with the Athletic Department, the 400 tickets allotted for undergraduate students have all been taken for the Princeton game, and the tickets for Penn are going fast.
Whether in the Big Apple, Ithaca, or Cambridge, Harvard basketball seems to be, for the time being, the biggest show in town.

Ever find yourself wondering what Professor Michael J. Sandel is up to when he isn't teaching philosophy on TV? Well this past weekend, he was at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, performing a variation from "The Sleeping Beauty" in anticipation of its New York City Ballet opening.
Okay we're totally kidding, but he did share the stage at the Guggenheim with some of ballet’s biggest stars—namely Damian Woetzel, a former principal dancer at the New York City Ballet and recent Kennedy School grad who was nominated by Obama to serve on the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities.
Sandel, best known around Harvard for teaching Moral Reasoning 22: “Justice,” was also featured with current New York City Ballet principals Tiler Peck, Joaquin de Luz and Robert Fairchild as part of the Guggenheim’s Works and Process outreach series, according to a Wall Street Journal blog post.
At the Guggenheim event, Woetzel led audience members through the opening passage of one of George Balanchine's most famous ballets, "Serenade," and then Sandel spoke of the importance of engaging students in philosophy by using real-world applications. The overall message was that both ballet and philosophy require direct audience engagement.
The evening marked another of Woetzel’s attempts to engage his audience in the arts—last year’s event at Memorial Church, “Witness,” had him showcasing the far-reaching effects of art on humanity alongside Yo-Yo Ma and Toni Morrison in a tribute to human reason, conscience and dignity.

Hit  the beach, or hit the books?  Reality TV, or res ipsa loquitur?
Vinny Guadagnino, a cast member on MTV’s "Jersey Shore," says he faced  this decision, and for him, the choice was clear.
Guadagnino,  21, told Us magazine that he took the LSAT and had considered  applying to Harvard or Yale Law School—before he found a job that  entailed living, working, and partying in a house on the beach all summer  with seven other young people, all on national TV.
“I  had a plan that if my [LSAT] score was really well, then I might  of just went to Yale or Harvard....  But it was just mediocre,” he  said.
“To  tell you the truth, man, [being a] lawyer isn’t something I wanted  to do,” he added.  “Nobody wants to be a lawyer—it’s  hard work.”
Well,  that’s the first time we’ve heard of Harvard Law as a backup plan.

In a season when men’s basketball  tickets are hot commodities and game results are followed nationally, it  may be no surprise that school spirit at Harvard has picked up substantially. But  who’s the Crimson’s biggest fan?
That would be David B. Faux, Harvard's manager  of software development, who (we assume) unknowingly registered  for about 800 men's basketball tickets this afternoon. When students  logged on to my.Harvard to purchase tickets for Penn or Princeton games, they found themselves registering  under the name “David Faux.”
A quick call to the Harvard Ticket  Office gave us this information:
“Hello and thank you for calling the Harvard Athletic Department Ticket Office. We are aware of the situation with online registration for Harvard undergrads for basketball tickets. We’re working to rectify that situation with our IT department. Please, when you log in, please go ahead and make the submission request for the ticket even if the name that appears on the site is different than yours. You will receive instructions over the next day or two as to what to do next. Thank you.”
Most students would not have realized the universality of issue had it not been for the frequent Facebook event messages from Kai-Cheng Ho ’10, a senior running back for the football team.
Ho said that the IT workers had been using a random name to check out the system during an experimental phase. “They forgot to take it out when the system was running," he said. "‘David Faux’ is just a little error; it’s not something to worry  about.”
According to Ho, students who registered  for a ticket under the name David Faux should have few problems picking  up their tickets.
“The way you register is by providing  your ID and password,” Ho said. “That information is kept; you show [your] ID to match your ID number and pick up your ticket.”
For Ho, the technology glitch is a  sign of increasing school spirit, something he’s been working closely  with the athletic department to promote.
Cheng told us that the tickets for the Princeton were sold out in less than an hour and a half. "It was more traffic than  they could imagine," he said. "It’s a great problem to have.”
And if the men’s basketball team  keeps winning, it may be a problem that could continue for a while.

A wise man we made up once said that the best class is the class you don't have to go to. Who knew Harvard would take his advice and let professors videotape courses and post them online? Not that we're complaining.
Before we get to our list, here's what happened today. In Science A-35: "The Energetic Universe," we heard the professor unleashed his wrath blowtorch-style—that's right, he lit up a blowtorch. We also heard that Professor Steven E. Ozment handed out copies of his book Protestants: The Birth of a Revolution to those shopping his class. Sure, it's no blowtorch, but getting a book for free instead of doling out hundreds of dollars at the Coop is certainly good enough news for us.
And now for the videos—er, we mean classes.
1. Statistics 104: "Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics"
Means, medians, graphs, variances, tests, and a whole bunch of Greek letters—both in person and on video. | M., W., F.  11 or 1. Link.
2. English 173: "Southern Literature and Culture in the United States"
Gone With the Wind is a movie. This class has movies. | M., W. 11. Link.
3. Government 1295: "Comparative Politics in Latin America"
Why you wouldn't want to go to a lecture by Professor Steven R. Levitsky beats us, but if your weekday afternoons are booked, this course offers you a mobile option. | M., W. 1-2:30. Link.
4. Life Sciences 1b: "An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution"
Thank you, Harvard, for video taping one of the largest classes here. We like, recognize, and appreciate. | Tu., Th. 10-11:30. Link.
5. Science of Living Systems 20: "Psychological Science"
Okay, we're cheating. There's only one lecture on video, but if you didn't get enough psychology on the screen when watching "Hannibal," you can watch that video again and again. | M., W. 1-2:30. Link.
