After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Contrary to administrators’ previous statements, Winthrop House residents will not live in swing housing next year to accommodate House renewal plans.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith previously said administrators were considering placing some Winthrop students in swing space next year as the College begins construction on Winthrop East, a planned five-story addition to Winthrop House’s Gore Hall. The House will undergo full renovation as part of Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project in 2016-2017.
However, administrators have revised renewal plans in response to feedback. While minor House pre-construction renovations will still begin in June, construction will now halt in August to allow Winthrop residents to live in the House next year, according to Winthrop House Masters Ronald S. Sullivan and Stephanie Robinson, who informed Winthrop residents of the change in plans in an email Friday.
This timeline means that, as previously planned, next academic year will represent a one-year break in House renewal construction. All Winthrop residents will move into swing housing for 2016-2017 after construction on the House resumes in June 2016.
Administrators adopted the revised timeline, which now requires Winthrop residents to live in swing housing for only one year, rather than two, in “an effort to minimize disruption to the Winthrop community,” Sullivan and Robinson wrote in a separate email to The Crimson.
They also noted that one year of swing follows the model of previous House renewal projects. Students from Quincy, Leverett, and Dunster—Houses that were previously renovated or are currently being renovated—each lived in swing housing for only one year during construction.
According to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, Winthrop students participated in three meetings about Winthrop’s renewal in February, and he and other administrators continue to discuss renewal plans in weekly meetings. Winthrop residents will have additional opportunities to work with architects and voice concerns in the coming months, Sullivan and Robinson wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SOUTH BEND, Ind.—With wins over No. 11/11 Quinnipiac and No. 18/- Colgate in the final two rounds of the ECAC tournament last weekend, the No. 10/8 Harvard men’s ice hockey team (21-12-3, 11-8-3) clinched its first trip back to the NCAA tournament in nine years. Moving up to ninth in the PairWise rankings in the process, the Crimson earned the third seed in the Midwest region, setting up Harvard for a date with No. 9/9 Nebraska-Omaha Saturday night at the Compton Family Ice Arena.
THE ROAD TO SOUTH BEND
The Mavericks (18-12-6, 12-8-4-3 NCHC) finished third in the eight-team National Collegiate Hockey Conference this season before suffering an early exit in the conference tournament, where it dropped two straight home games to No. 13/13 St. Cloud State. But Omaha, who got out to a 16-7-3 start before slipping later on, received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, making the Mavericks the sixth team from their conference to receive an invite to this year’s Big Dance.
Omaha rattled off a number of big conference wins over the first half of the year, including a three-goal comeback against then-No. 10/10 Denver and road victories over then-No. 2 North Dakota (in a shootout) and No. 4/5 Miami. Then in January, the Mavericks earned their biggest win of the season, knocking off North Dakota, who had climbed to first in the country, in overtime by a score of 3-2. The win enabled Omaha to climb as high as fourth in the polls.
But the home stretch was not kind to the Mavericks. Following the win over North Dakota, Omaha closed out the regular season with just two regulation wins in its final nine games before dropping its two postseason contests to the Huskies. Nonetheless, because of their early exit, the Mavericks head into their matchup with Harvard with two weeks of rest under their belts.
“I don’t know if [the extra rest] will be an advantage—I just know at the time, that we needed the rest,” Omaha coach Dean Blais said at a press conference on Friday. “When we were down at the tournament and we watched the teams come in, there was a lot of exhaustion on their faces. It’s just that tough to travel and play and compete at the level that we did, especially for the last month.”
SUITING UP
Composed of underclassmen, the Mavericks’ top line will have its hands full keeping up with the Crimson forward combination of Jimmy Vesey, Kyle Criscuolo, and Alex Kerfoot, which has combined for 134 points on the year.
Leading Omaha in points this season with 35 is sophomore center Jake Guentzel, while classmate forward Austin Ortega is right behind with 32. Ortega has recorded a team-high 19 goals on the year, 11 of which have been game-winners—an NCAA record—including the overtime dagger against top-ranked North Dakota on Jan. 30.
The Maverick’s top line could also get an added boost from co-captain forward Dominic Zombo, who skated with the team on Friday and is aiming to return from an undisclosed injury that has kept him sidelined for the last 10 games. The senior acknowledged earlier this year that the injury will require surgery at the end of the season.
“Zombo will probably play,” Blais revealed. “We’ll have to make that decision tomorrow. If there’s anything wrong with him, he won’t play.”
Another Omaha veteran looking to return to the ice on Saturday who could have the biggest impact of all is senior goaltender Ryan Massa. Massa ranks third in the country with a .934 save percentage, trailing only Alex Lyon and Kyle Hayton from Yale and St. Lawrence of the ECAC, respectively.
Despite hurting his left knee prior to the Mavericks’ final matchup of the regular season, Massa returned one week later for his team’s playoff opener against St. Cloud State. But the senior would make just seven saves in what proved to be a shortened return, as a collision in the crease led Massa to exit after less than 16 minutes of play. Nonetheless, Massa practiced with the team on Friday and is expected to man the crease on Saturday.
BEHIND THE BENCH
In the middle of his inaugural season with the Boston Bruins back in 1992, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 suited up for the United States men’s ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics in France. Serving as an assistant on the coaching staff that made the decision to select the former forward was Blais.
Since calling it quits on his playing career, which included four years at the University of Minnesota and a few more with the Chicago Blackhawks’ developmental team, Blais has spent nearly all of his time coaching. The skipper has coached at the high school, college, and international levels, highlighted by his experience with the U.S. Olympic team and two national championships as North Dakota’s head coach in 1997 and 2000.
Blais has coached Omaha since 2009, carrying the Mavericks to two NCAA tournament appearances over his tenure (2011, 2015). After his first trip to the Big Dance proved unsuccessful—a 3-2 loss to Michigan in St. Louis—Blais will look to secure his first tournament win with the Mavericks against an opponent he knows very well.
“[Donato] was a real tough competitor, and I think his teams are a reflection of his personality,” Blais said. “He was definitely one of the top players that I ever coached.”
Donato, meanwhile, will be searching for his first win in the national tournament in his 11 seasons coaching the Crimson. Donato-coached teams lost in the first rounds of the 2005 and 2006 tournaments.
“I have a tremendous amount of respect for [Blais]—first and foremost as a person; second, for his ability to coach and develop hockey players,” Donato said. “But [I] can’t say I’m rooting very hard for him tomorrow night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 29, 2015, at 9:40 p.m.
SOUTH BEND, Ind.—An awkward rebound, a last-second 5-on-3, and two empty-netters.
For the Nebraska-Omaha men’s ice hockey team, it wasn’t much, but it was enough.
Saturday at Compton Family Ice Arena, the Mavericks unceremoniously defeated Harvard, 4-1, in the Midwest Regional semifinals. Omaha freshman forward Avery Peterson produced what proved to be the game-winner with 1.4 seconds left in the first period on a two-man advantage, as the Mavericks held on with two empty-net goals in the final minute of their program’s first-ever NCAA tournament win.
The ECAC champions, meanwhile, were left still waiting for their first win in the Big Dance since 1994.
“I think we put ourselves in some spots where we made it difficult for ourselves,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought our discipline all year has been great; I just think we made a couple of poor decisions.”
Jimmy Vesey scored the Crimson’s lone goal less than four minutes into the third to cut the Mavericks’ lead in half but finished the night fighting back tears.
The junior forward battled all night, stringing together consecutive shifts as time ran out on what could be his last collegiate contest.
“You’ve got to give Harvard credit—they are an excellent hockey team, and Vesey is for real,” Omaha coach Dean Blais said. “I don’t know if there is anyone in our league that’s better.”
The second-seeded Mavericks (19-12-6, 12-8-4-3 NCHC) forced the third-seeded Crimson (21-13-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) on its heels early with the game’s first goal at 1:59 in the first period. Harvard goaltender Steve Michalek (25 saves) got his pad on a shot from the top of the slot by Petersen, but freshman forward Grant Gallo pushed the puck over the line before Michalek could freeze it.
The goal stood after video review.
With 1:30 left in the frame, a boarding minor by fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell put the Crimson on an extended 5-on-3 kill. Harvard almost escaped the period down one, but Peterson slipped a wrister from the left faceoff circle past Michalek’s glove with just over a second remaining.
In a scoreless second period, Harvard struggled to get attempts on target and forced Omaha senior goaltender Ryan Massa (33 saves) to make only six stops. Yet the Crimson’s sticks came alive in the third period, as Vesey’s strike highlighted 19 Harvard shots on goal in the final frame.
“The team never showed any sign of quitting all year, certainly not tonight,” Vesey said. "We played hard until the final buzzer.”
Vesey’s 32nd and final goal of the season came on the left side of the crease, where the Nashville Predators prospect put back a rebound from junior defenseman Desmond Bergin.
Vesey finishes the year tied for eighth on the Crimson’s all-time single-season goal list, having recorded the most goals by a Harvard player since the 1990-1991 season. He will consider in the coming days his option to turn professional.
“Moving on, I think I’m going to sit down with Coach Donato and my family, as well, and just weigh my options and see where I’m at,” Vesey said.
Harvard threatened to equalize for most of the remainder of the frame but felt the burn of another untimely penalty as sophomore forward Luke Esposito boarded freshman forward Tyler Vesel with 2:30 to play.
Vesel capitalized a minute later, sliding in the first insurance marker of the night at 19:24 as Harvard skated 5-on-5 with an empty net. Sophomore forward Jake Guentzel put in another one from the neutral zone with four seconds left.
With the loss, Harvard concludes a season in which the team battled back from injuries to win its first conference championship since 2006.
“I couldn’t be prouder of this group—the perseverance and the toughness of just staying with it,” Donato said.
The Crimson enters the offseason with uncertainty. In addition to questions surrounding Vesey, it is unclear whether fourth-year players Patrick McNally, Max Everson, Blackwell, and Michalek will return next season.
Omaha, meanwhile, can look ahead to a bright future. Three freshmen scored for the Mavericks on Saturday in a landmark victory for the school.
“It’s a huge step for our program, but we’re not satisfied yet,” said Omaha co-captain defenseman Brian O’Rourke. “We are looking toward tomorrow, and the future, and the rest of the season as long as we can.”
The Mavericks will face the Rochester Institute of Technology tomorrow in the regional final. RIT became the first 16-seed to win an NCAA tournament game on Saturday, knocking off top-seeded Minnesota State, 2-1, in the first game of the day at Compton Family Ice Arena.

Since spring appears to be just around the corner on Harvard’s campus (read: it snowed so recently, but it may approach a whopping fifty degrees in the next few days so it might as well be summer), it is time to start looking forward to the events that will brighten up these last weeks of school. We have no more official breaks, but that’s no matter– a tradition shared by many Ivy League colleges are spring concerts, during which the student body works to bring big names to campus for a day of (very sober) fun. As we look forward to Jessie J at this year’s Yardfest on Friday, April 24th, let’s take a look at who’ll be performing around the other Ivies.
Columbia’s Bacchanal: April 4, 2015 
This year’s spring concert, themed, “I Don’t Bacch With You!” will take place on April 4th and will be headlined by Big Sean. The announcement had some mixed responses, but the concert is normally huge, and although it will be capped this year, has already distributed 4,000 tickets, with 2,400 promised to be on the way. Columbia also has a fall concert (hey, at least we have Harvard-Yale), which was cancelled by the administrators this school year. We like the theme, but it seems like Columbia may be headed for some Tyga-esque controversy this April.
Brown’s Spring Weekend: April 17-18, 2015 
Not bad, Brown! Modest Mouse, Waka Flocka Flame, and Pusha T are among the list of names that will be performing at Brown. Downside: you can’t bring guests unless the tickets don’t sell out (and they usually do), and even then you’ll have to buy them the day before on April 16.
Penn’s Spring Fling: April 17-18, 2015 
This year, Penn's lineup will feature Kesha and Kygo. Kygo is a Norwegian DJ who is probably best known for his remix of “I See Fire” by Ed Sheeran. Kesha used to spell her name with a $ sign but appears to have dropped the $ in favor of a regular “S.” You should remember her from “wake up in the morning feeling like P-Diddy” aka the best song ever, which was released SIX YEARS AGO (did that make you feel old?). It’s going down, we’re yelling timberrrrr!
Yale’s Spring Fling: April 25, 2015 
After bringing Diplo, Chance the Rapper, and Betty Who last year, Yale brought their A-game with a killer release video and a lineup of St. Lucia, Klingande, and Jessie J for their 2015 Spring Fling event. For those who are less familiar with the names, Klingande is a French electronic artist well-known for his single “Jubel,” (think of him as a calmer Avicii), St. Lucia is a indie/alternative/synth-pop artist known for “Elevate” (think of him as a #cool #hipster who sings to #chill #beats), and Jessie J is, well, you should probably know Jessie J since she’s performing here first, but she sings “Price Tag” and the “Bang Bang” song that is probably stuck in your head.
Cornell’s Slope Day: May 7, 2015
This year, the Ivy whose winter was probably even worse than ours is holding their Slope Day on May 7, 2015. Although this year’s performer has not yet been released, headliners in the past have been top-notch: Cornell welcomed Drake in 2010, Nelly, The Cool Kids (before they were even that cool!), and Ra Ra Riot in 2011, Taio Cruz AND the Neon Trees in 2012, and Kendrick Lamar and Hoodie Allen in 2013. Even though you’ve probably never considered journeying to central New York prior to this time, this year looks like it may just be worth the trip.
Dartmouth’s Green Key Weekend: May 14-16, 2015
Dartmouth has an entire weekend of events for its Spring Concert series, complete with lots of free food! The event begins on May 14th featuring many lesser-known bands like Etna Old Time Association, Reckless Breakfast, Joe Marson, and Tallahassee and continues into Friday and Saturday, with Saturday’s final main-stage act, Biscuits & Gravy. Friday will feature Lupe Fiasco and Gold Coast, and the weekend is well known for its drunken piano-smashing traditions.
Princeton’s End-of-the-Year Performances
As previous Crimson posts have reported, Princeton has an annual three-day-long music festival held at the very end of the year in May. Many of the school’s eating clubs open up during the weekend and hire entertainment on their front lawns, so students can enjoy a series of lawn parties after a day of musical performances that has featured Wiz Khalifa and B.O.B. in the past. Free lawn parties for all? Sounds fun! This spring’s line-up has not yet been announced, but the Princeton Undergraduate Student Government Facebook page offers a trade: “PSA: If the Princeton USG Facebook Page hits 2,000 likes, we ~may~ announce the Lawnparties act a bit earlier...Spread the word!”

This year, Yardfest, Harvard’s annual outdoor music concert, is scheduled for Friday, April 24th. Visitas, the annual weekend for admitted students, is scheduled to begin on Saturday, April 25th. You read that right: bright and early Saturday morning, the prospective students of the Class of 2019 are expected to arrive on Harvard’s campus hoping to catch an accurate glimpse of the #bestfouryearsofyourlife. We really do hope you’ll enjoy your stay and decide to join us next fall, but in light of the fact that Visitas takes place the same weekend as Yardfest, we’d like to provide a little disclaimer first, based on the letter sent to prospective students from the Dean of Admissions:
We congratulate you on your acceptance and warmly invite you to the April celebration of newly admitted students! Seriously. We’ve heard that the Class of 2019 Facebook page is already bumpin’, and we look forward to glorifying your fame in Flyby posts of the future. As Dean Fitzsimmons writes, this is "a chance for you to try Harvard on for size." Butttttt we’d also like to put a little precaution in front of his claim: “this weekend will be representative of a typical weekend at Harvard.”
Don’t get us wrong, life at college IS “dynamic, busy, diverse, and full of exciting opportunities.” We ARE happy to offer accommodations for you, we’re just not promising that we’re going to be in the best state of mind should you choose to arrive on campus, say, Friday night instead of Saturday. And we DO want to show you what this school is like, but know that Jessie J isn’t normally visiting our campus and generally we don’t get a school-wide music celebration after a round of midterms. We normally just get more midterms and snow.
There’s pretty much two weekends of the school year that are like this: Harvard-Yale and Yardfest. But with all that said, we really can’t wait to meet you, and we hope you choose to come– even if Saturday morning is rougher for some of us than it is for others.

Last Thursday, Harvard celebrated a “historic moment”—University students, faculty, staff, and HUDS workers (bless them) endured the snowiest Boston winter on record—with s’mores and hot chocolate.
Never failing to miss an opportunity to eat free s’mores (read: any food whatsoever), I headed to the Science Center per an invitation from University President Drew Faust emailed to the entire Harvard community. While enjoying my “well-deserved hot chocolate,” I carefully turned my marshmallows over wind-whipped flames to achieve a perfect golden brown and pondered: how does Harvard’s leader like her s’mores?
Though Drew Faust admitted she did not attend this celebration of spring’s calendar arrival (we all know it may be months before we say a final goodbye to melted mounds of sullied snow), she gave Flyby the exclusive on her s’mores preferences.
“I like burnt things a lot,” Faust said. “I like burnt toast. I’m always worried that I’m going to end up with the fire department at Elmwood because I burn my toast, so I assume I’d like burnt s’mores.”
To accompany her crisp, black marshmallow between sweet squares of graham crackers, Faust prefers dark chocolate.
“I always like dark chocolate better than milk,” she said.
Faust, who could not recall the last time she enjoyed a s’more, said she remembered the campfire delicacy from her girl scout days.
“My greatest s’mores experience was girl scouts,” Faust said. “There’s a picture of me in a girl scout uniform when I was nine years old. It’s pretty ridiculous.”
And we found it—the 1950s were certainly good to the University’s president.
The Crimson’s central administration reporters reserve the final question in their monthly interview with Drew Faust for Flyby. Please email mariel.klein@thecrimson.com to make a suggestion.
