After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The lead single from Taylor Swift’s upcoming album, “Reputation,” is nothing short of an audacious piece of ambitious art. To any listener with ears, of course, it is an exercise in atonality. But don’t let that deter you! However, to a listener with eyes, its music video asks the undeniably important question: Why don’t we take Swift seriously as an artist?
The video’s thesis is as straightforward as its research question. Swift clinically argues that the lack of criticality of her audience, and the unrivaled profit that they can offer her, have produced music whose enjoyment is the sonic equivalent of enjoying your own lobotomy. We do not take her seriously because she is no longer producing, as the video carefully shows, serious art.
Thus, the “what” in the proverbial question of the song’s title is, quite simply, the creation of this sonic trauma. The “you” is a direct reference to her financial backers—known in common nomenclature as her “fans”: You made her do this.
Wealth—specifically the unencumbered waste of money on the multiplicity of scenes in the music video—is a proxy for the heaps of cash that she’s acquired over her career from less wealthy individuals (yes: I mean you and me). It’s robbery. The video astutely notes this by depicting a literal robbery carried out by Taylor and her team of four cat-masked women.
In the background, on an overhead ticker, we can see the words “Stream Co.”—subtle, isn’t she?—plastered above her head. This could not possibly be, I assure you, an allusion to her fight to acquire a larger percentage of revenue from streaming companies for all artists.
Instead, as the employees of “Stream Co.” lie ineffectively on the ground, Swift and Co. give up on trying to find a way to move the large pallets of cash from the vault. Perhaps the robbery was a failure. But then, cleverly, Swift decides to painstakingly steal from each individual safety deposit box that line the walls—she is, quite literally, stealing from the individual. It is a subtle depiction of her theft from her listeners. She’s just using “Stream Co.” as a proxy.
One of the opening shots of the video represents these thematic underpinnings of Swift’s musical evolution. Swift lies in a tastefully arranged tub of jewels. Despite her apparently limitless wealth, to her right is a singular dollar bill. The choice is strange at first, until one realizes that this is but another component of her running commentary on the culpability of her fans in the creation of her most unfortunate musical decisions. That lone dollar bill represents the decision to purchase the single. It could not possibly be, I assure you, a reference to her victory in a sexual assault trial over the summer in which she won a singular dollar.
Tangentially and seriously, that victory marked a shockingly successful use of Taylor’s fame and social stature to call attention to problematic societal views on the hegemony of men over women’s bodies—yet, with that said, it is an odd choice to reference it in a music video about revenge and the emergence of “bad” Taylor. What’s the message here? Not to be glibly reductionist, but do you have to be “bad” Taylor to stand up against sexual assault? “Good” Taylor—2009-VMA-Taylor or “Teardrops on my Guitar”-Taylor (as depicted in the video)—wouldn’t?

The opulence that surrounds Swift, the jewels lying under that lone dollar bill, represent the financial power of the totality of her fans. The product of the song, in all of its unpleasant glory, represents what that power has produced.
That power is less concerned with desiring good music than acquiring music from a known name. In fact, Swift doesn’t have to make good music anymore—because she knows that you’ll spend your hard-earned dollar bills on her regardless of the quality of her music. Mid-robbery, Swift sits on an unmoved pallet of bills holding a flaming stack of cash. It is a self-conscious illustration of this premise. You made her do this.
As Swift crashes her car, a Grammy in hand, the totality of the video’s thesis snaps into place. It is not only her fans that have allowed “Look What You Made Me Do” to exist. It is the complacent music industry—a music industry that is too concerned with giving big names awards (big names that crash their cars and are photographed by the paparazzi—as Swift does in her stylized scene), rather than giving Grammys to artists who are still trying to make something with some aesthetic merit or artists that take themselves seriously enough to actually try. Why don’t we take Taylor seriously? Because as the single shows, she doesn’t take herself seriously enough to make good music. She doesn’t take herself seriously because, when you blindly purchase her single with one dollar, you don’t demand that she does.
This music video indicts a complacent music industry—it’s an indictment of the system. The same system that enriched Swift. The same system you pay into when you purchase her music, pay for her concerts, and stream her songs.
Like it or not, you are the system. You made her do this.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know that the old Taylor is dead. Old Taylor is so dead that her corpse makes a guest appearance at the beginning of Taylor Swift’s new music video, “Look What You Made Me Do.” It’s exactly like another famous Taylor music video, “You Belong with Me,” but instead of pining after a cute boy, she’s plotting his murder and instead of pajamas, she’s wearing leather and fishnet stockings.
The general message—from the countless tight black outfits to the numerous references to her reputation—is that Taylor Swift is now the bad girl that her critics always said she was. The biggest problem with that is that no one who listened to her country love songs and girly pop ballads has ever seen her as a bad girl. She’s that one innocent friend in your blocking group that goes to a party once and claims she is now a wild college kid. It’s cute that Taylor thinks she’s bad, but this writer is not convinced it’s actually true.

Early on, it is clear that this new reputation is a farce. As she sits in a bathtub filled with diamonds, it’s almost hard not to laugh as she makes a gun with her fingers or ferociously bites a necklace. Despite the video’s best efforts, the Taylor clad in tight black clothes seems more artificial than the 2009-VMA-Taylor or “Teardrops on my Guitar”-Taylor, even though both are accused of being fake in the video’s final moments.
New Taylor robs a bank while wielding a bat in true Harley Quinn style. This would be cool if it was last Halloween, but that costume is so last year. It’s a good thing that there are ten other sets. The video has a total of eleven sets ranging from a graveyard to a Victorian drawing room to a dark alley. It seems that new Taylor isn’t interested in hanging out on the bleachers or in her bedroom anymore.
Even if you’re still not quite sure what Taylor did, by now you should know that she’s done it and it’s your fault.

Paul McGuigan’s 2006 thriller “Lucky Number Slevin” elicited a binary response from its critics. There were those who enjoyed it immensely—I belong to this group—and those that condemned it for trying to be too clever and having a convoluted story. Frankly, I find it hard to summarize the film’s plot. That, however, is not because “Lucky Number Slevin” is a convoluted film that one has to wrestle with in order to fully understand what is going on. I simply do not want to give away the breathtaking twist that awaits the viewer.
This much I can say for its premise: Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett) has just arrived in New York City where he is staying in his friend Nick’s apartment. Nick himself, however, is nowhere to be found. Cue a knock on the door—who’s there? Two gofers sent by “The Boss” (Morgan Freeman), a local kingpin and big-time creditor of the not-to-be-found Nick. Slevin is not the first person to assert that he is not the man that the gofers are looking for. Consequently, they take him to the Boss, who offers Slevin a quick way to pay off “his” debt: killing the son of rival kingpin “The Rabbi” (Sir Ben Kingsley). Soon thereafter, another knock on the door—who’s there? Two gofers sent by The Rabbi. As it turns out, Nick also owes this man a substantial amount of money.
“Lucky Number Slevin” is a highly stylized film. The set design is eccentric, and so are the characters. McGuigan has gone out on a limb to create a unique film that is in part defined through its peculiar dialogue. (Slevin: “You’re not as tall as I thought you’d be.” His soon-to-be girlfriend, Lindsey: “Well, I’m short for my height.”) Clearly, this makes the film a matter of humor and taste. I find this to be hysterical and dazzling—others may diagnose it as “trying to be too clever.” Of course, this is the risk that every filmmaker who tries to do things differently runs.
However, what is not open to debate is the sheer genius with which the film’s unpredictable and exquisite plot twist is set up and executed. There are not many films that play with the viewer like “Lucky Number Slevin” does. In fact, we are told what the twist’s structure is going to be right in the beginning by assassin “Mr. Goodkat” (Bruce Willis): “A Kansas City Shuffle is when everybody looks right, you go left [...] This particular one has been over twenty years in the making [...] It starts with a horse.” Yet we cannot see it coming.
That alone would make for a great twist, but “Lucky Number Slevin” goes a step further. Throughout the first two thirds of its runtime, the viewer is often left questioning the veracity of what they have seen. The overall narrative seems convincing, yet there is an abundance of details that do not quite seem to fit: How did Slevin get into Nick’s apartment? What are the real intentions of Mr. Goodkat? And what is the significance of this fixed horse race from two decades ago?
While all of these questions do not take much away from the enjoyment of the film’s first two thirds, they set up a twist that creates a true moment of empathy: All it takes is one tilt up of the camera to reveal the identity of a certain character and suddenly everything falls into place. This one movement answers all the questions that the film has subtly introduced, it unravels the knot that has formed in the attentive viewer’s head and makes him gasp a silent (or not-so-silent) “No!” as he realizes how elaborately he has been played with.

When the afternoon darkens you can see them, the people by the river. Sometimes they curl on the browning grass, trouser cuffs brushing clumps of goose dung. More often they lean back on benches, hands folded, eyes closed. They sit, each alone, and face the water.
In warm months I run along the curving trails, following the line the river cuts through the jagged geography of the city. Always I look for them, my silent, still companions, the watchers of the Charles. Most seem weary. Many have just left work; their business attire, so carefully chosen in the fresh-pressed morning, now wilts, growing wrinkled and worn. Others have been at the river a long time. All have come for a reprieve, a reverie, a pause.
Soon some 400,000 spectators will throng around the banks of the Charles for the 53rd Head of the Charles Regatta. The weekend generates tens of millions in revenue for local businesses and is, as the Cambridge Boat Club says, the largest two-day rowing event in the world.
Around the time of the regatta, it is easy to appreciate the Charles afresh, to see the river as the center of our community. What we might forget is that the river is always the liquid heart of Boston and Cambridge. The Charles serves us not just during regatta weekend but every day. It hosts massive events, yes, but also welcomes loners and wanderers with equal placidity. It is the most distinctive physical feature of a geographically disjointed area and an emblem of our city’s civic attitudes.
Two hundred years ago, writes the urban planner Karl Haglund in his history of the Charles River, more than two miles of open water separated Cambridge and Boston, a length three times the present distance. Later the river’s shallow basin was dammed for mills and filled for commercial and residential projects. By the late 19th century, the Charles had become a public health calamity. At low tide the urban belt of the river would distort into a stretch of mudflats that reeked of sewage and slaughterhouse offal.
The Charles as we know it was born in the first decade of the 20th century out of a vision of the river as a great public space, one that would improve the health and lift the spirits of impoverished tenement-dwelling Bostonians and wealthy metropolitans alike. Instead of mud and sewage, the city would enjoy the sheen of fresh water.
Charles W. Eliot, a member of the Class of 1853 and the then-president of Harvard University, testified in favor of damming the river and putting the riverfront into the public domain. Anyone who “believes that cities exist and that commonwealths exist to promote the well-being of the people,” Eliot declared to a local commission, would support basin improvements: One need only to look at “the sight of the people gathered on the Charlesbank” to be convinced of the river’s civic importance.
Since the 1890s, city planners and community leaders have envisioned the Charles as a place for the people and a measure of how cities can work for the happiness of their citizens. Urban planners across Europe and America, Haglund notes, took note of Boston’s example: The Paris Exposition of 1900, for example, featured exhibits on Boston’s metropolitan park system, of which the Charles was the focal point.
Today the river—at last clean after more than half a century of “dirty water”—is not merely a feat of urban planning and conservation. It is also a symbol of the community and a haven for residents looking for a spell of peace. One of my students told me that as a lonely freshman at Harvard, he would walk to the bank of the Charles and spit into the water. By mingling with the river he would feel, for a moment, as if he belonged.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote meditatively of the Charles: “Thou hast taught me, Silent River! / Many a lesson, deep and long.”
Let us follow Longfellow’s example and celebrate the Charles not only for the events it hosts and the money it brings but for the private discoveries that take place there each day, for the gleaming mirror it holds up to the city.
You can go and see them, the river-watchers. You can walk where they haunt the banks. They sit by the river, breathing softly, eyes pressed tight—lost in the depths of reflection, trembling between the waters that lie before them and the waters that lie within.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year after the departure of his predecessor, Dean Roland S. Davis has officially begun to serve in his capacity as the College’s associate dean for diversity and inclusion. In this role, Davis will be in charge of overseeing the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Harvard College Women’s Center.
The past few months, during which his position was vacant, have been politically turbulent and increasingly difficult for the groups of students Davis’s position is meant to serve. It is against this tumultuous backdrop that we congratulate him on on his appointment and welcome him warmly to campus. We wish him the best as embarks on his journey to make the College more equitable and inclusive for all students.
In addition to well wishes, we urge Davis to prioritize taking concrete steps in making campus more inclusive. The first step towards this goal should be to build relationships with members of diverse students groups, including those involved with affinity groups. But in addition to simply meeting with students, Davis must ensure that these relationships lead to concrete changes led by the offices he oversees. Very often, students find that administrators grant them face time, but fail to take actionable steps to address the issues students highlight. Students should feel supported by Davis and the offices he oversees, not just heard by them.
Harvard still struggles with its legacy as an institution that only served the most privileged. It is only through concrete steps that the institution will transform from an exclusive space into one where all students, including those who are the most marginalized, will feel included.
In thinking critically about how to chip away at feelings of exclusivity at the College, Davis must seriously contend with the role social groups, including final clubs, play. As we’ve previously opined, addressing the exclusivity of final clubs is paramount to ensuring inclusivity on campus.
We understand that it may be premature for Dean Davis to take a public stance on this debate, given that he’s only been on the job for slightly more than two weeks. But even if he refrains from taking a public stance on the social group policy, it’s critical that Davis contend with one of the most significant proposed changes in undergraduate social life.
When consider other actions to take, we encourage Davis to consider basing his policy or programming initiatives on the guiding principles recommended by the Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging. While the draft of the report does not contain specific policy suggestions, it offers a framework and goals towards which all of Harvard’s schools should strive. Davis can help ensure these principles are enshrined at the College.
One particular policy change that can be implemented immediately is the formalization of the process by which the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion makes money available to members of marginalized groups. The office has funds that student groups can access, but it is done very informally and not all student groups realize that these funds are available. To address this, a formalized grant process should be created where affinity groups can apply for money to help them better support their  respective communities. Streamlined financial support could be the first of the many concrete changes we hope to see from Davis’s tenure.
Students seek to feel supported by the University administration, and we are hopeful that Davis will be able to ensure this support through tangible, concrete actions.

Mogadishu is new, yet ancient. Continuously inhabited since 200 B.C.E., it is the tenth oldest city in all of Northern Africa. Today, it is the capital of Somalia. Set in the cradle of the Indian Ocean, it is a coastal city marked by prominent minarets and large mosques that accommodate thousands of worshippers. The city is loud and bustling, filled with universities and stadiums, markets and ports. Over one million people call it home.
This past Saturday, Mogadishu was wracked with a massive truck bomb that detonated in the district of Hodan. The bomb killed more than 300 people, and injured over 500 others. That’s far more than the death toll of attacks in Boston, Fort Hood, San Bernandino, Quebec, Paris, London, Manchester, and Barcelona combined. Even now, scores remain missing. The bomb caused a hotel to collapse, demolished nearby buildings, and crushed vehicles that were parked on the street. It was followed by the sirens of ambulances, international pleas for help, and a death toll that kept on rising. It was met with several perfunctory news articles, a smattering of tweets, and a hailstorm of images that were difficult to look at.
And then, silence.
There were no hashtags. There was no filter or check in on Facebook. There were no articles written about the residents of the city. There was no national outcry, no presidential condemnation, no halting of the news cycle. There was no outrage.
Amidst this silence, there have been some expressions of frustration with the disregard. Somalis have started fundraising campaigns and have found ways to help find missing persons. But America’s overwhelming response to the horrifying tragedy in Somalia has been silence. It has been turning away and moving on. And this silence screams lack of empathy. In a global society, such lack of empathy is absolutely unjustifiable. It serves only to divide. It dehumanizes people of color who are thousands of miles away, and it dehumanizes people of color who are right next door.
Those of us who are other understand this. We know the dichotomy of tragedy exists, and we see it constantly. We see it in the outcry, the pain, the concerts, the support that is afforded to London and Paris and Barcelona. And then we see it in the cold shoulder, the curt statements, the silence that is granted to Somalia and Myanmar and Kashmir.
We see it in how the tragedy is depicted. On one hand, there is the warmth of candlelight vigils, the hurt of crying parents embracing, and the power of people coming together. And on the other is the rubble of buildings and the piling of bodies. We see the commodification and dehumanization of brown bodies in the aftermath of tragedy. The image of a child, face down in the sand, is sold for shock value as his life is forgotten. In some countries (those ones, the ones far away) violence is a fact, a truth, not something to resist, but something to shrug at and then move on. Something to mention as a passing note, if at all, and then—silence.
We see it in what the facts are. We watch as black and brown people who die at the hands of militant groups go ignored. After all, how can the Muslim be the victim when he is so obviously the attacker? We see that our media’s depiction of violence is not even true to the facts of the matter. And we watch as the media ignores the attacks that do not fit the narrative.
We see it here at home too. We watch as the victims of police brutality, who are children and women and all innocents are brutalized in life and vilified in death. And we understand that the the same fate does not befall even white men who go on shooting rampages.
And so we know that America does not value black and brown lives in the same way that it values white lives.
It is horrific that we are forced to compare tragedy. Any life lost is a life worth mourning, remembering, and fighting for. But this lack of empathy has to be acknowledged, because it has very real consequences. It distorts facts and breeds ignorance. It makes us less empathetic to those who are different, and that makes it harder for us to know one another. And so we slide farther back into our silos instead of growing emotional understanding.
Because even though the average American might not look like the average Somali, that does not mean that the average American should not care for the average Somali. And there is so much more to America than the “average American.” Whitewashing America erases millions in this country, and it erases the struggle for pluralism that American society is constantly engaged in. If we can only understand and feel and advocate for those who are like us, we are destined to remain separate from those in our classes and in our workplaces, in our neighborhoods and in our cities, who look nothing like us.
Lack of empathy drives us further and further apart, both globally and locally. To achieve change, and to achieve unity, we must achieve empathy first. Now, it is our responsibility to reject silence in favor of speaking up and reaching out. Because the silence in the wake of this attack in Somalia echoes in America. You can hear it, can’t you?

I’m sorry that I divorced you.
I’m still not sure exactly how you came to be. In truth, I had forgotten that you existed until a few years ago, when Mom pulled out an old picture of me from kindergarten. I’m standing by the family minivan with my favorite baby doll Kylie—our biological daughter—and Kylie’s miniature car seat. My chubby finger, covered in peanut butter and jelly, is pointing at some out-of-frame entity. My face, similarly chubby but a little cleaner, is contorted into the type of grimace that only an annoyed toddler can make. By my mother’s account, I was yelling at you.
For an imaginary husband, you had an uncanny ability to put yourself in my crosshairs. Even as a child, I didn’t know the definition of inside voice. You stayed at work too long. You always left the toilet seat up. You paid more attention to the TV than to me. I wasn’t a beleaguered housewife, but I played one.
Yes, it was extra work, but I still somehow found it within my capacity to set a place at the dinner table for you every spaghetti night, reminding you to hang up your coat on the coat rack when you came in the front door. Not content to slurp my pasta, I silently glared at you until you gave Kylie a kiss hello in her Cabbage Patch crib. It was unacceptable for a father to ignore his only child after work. She only saw you once a day.
Every time you would sigh, I would roll my eyes at my mother, expecting her to empathize with my predicament. She offered little sympathy—neither she nor my father were completely certain what had inspired this elaborate charade. To my parents, as I recently found out, my fake husband was a source of significant concern.
But intervention never came. Before my parents could even formalize a scheme, I divorced you. I was standing by the family minivan, waiting for you to open the door like I always had to remind you to do, but you weren’t listening. I told you again, pitch deepening to match my reddening chubby cheeks.  But still nothing. In a final attempt to really let you have it, I dropped Kylie and yanked on my own door. As best I could I slammed the motorized minivan door shut. Just before it closed I yelled, “We’re done, Michael!”
That night, my dad came home and asked if Michael would be joining us for spaghetti dinner. I informed him of our divorce and continued eating.
In the following years, I forgot about you in favor of middle school crushes I chased around the jungle gym and the junior high jocks I giggled about at the lunch table. I only recently remembered our divorce, years after it was probably repressed to some far away corner of my mind where all eerie and absurd childhood things lurk. Although I don’t care to explore the rest of those memories, I write this letter today to say thank you, and that I’m sorry it ended that way.

Envision a world in which companies only employ the most educated sliver of the population, while artificially intelligent machines have filled everyone else’s jobs. Humans are powerless in a world controlled by algorithms and those who code them.
Members of the Kennedy School student organization AI Initiative worry about that very future. Earlier this fall, the organization hosted a panel discussion that hoped to answer a foreboding question: Will you still have a job when the robots arrive?
The answer, as it turns out, is maybe. In the job market at large, automation is most likely to put pressure on low wage jobs, according to Jason Furman, Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. According to Furman, jobs earning less than $20 per hour are 83 percent more likely to be automated by 2050, while jobs earning over $40 per hour are only 4 percent more likely to be automated.
As the job-reach of robots expands into the distant future, these percentages will only grow. Recent exponential increases in computational capacity, coupled with the plummeting costs of hardware, have meant companies can deploy AI in a wider range of tasks. These tasks include the navigation of “more real-life scenarios,” as Francesca Rossi, AI Ethics Global Leader at IBM Research, put it.
This technology can have interesting implications in fields like law: Every year, AI learns how to perform 2 percent of the nation’s legal work, but many hurdles lie ahead. A robot still “can’t get up in a courtroom and argue a case,” Furman said.
So there’s still some hope for the future of human employment. IBM’s strategy is “not to replace humans, but to augment their cognitive capabilities,” Rossi said.
Rossi also emphasized AI’s ability to improve the usability and sustainability of existing products. Machine learning, for example, has enabled Google to cut its energy emissions in data centers by 40 percent. “Beyond a cool translate app, think about the impact this technology could have on energy and climate,” White said.
Nevertheless, real-life obstacles lie in the way of AI’s deployment, most notably government regulation and public trust. Many large technology firms currently exist within a regulatory limbo because their research lies in uncharted territory.
And it remains to be seen whether artificial intelligences can be trusted with evaluative questions. If a machine makes a decision on hiring someone, do we trust their decision entirely or fall back on human intervention? Could AI exacerbate or reduce extant race and gender biases? For consumers, “it is imperative those who use AI trust the decisions that AI give them” Rossi said.
Events like these are one way that AI enthusiasts hope to make the technology more palatable not only to the public, but to politicians, who may react to AI unthinkingly, or without fully understanding the technology.
Questions remain, but some students left the panel optimistic.
“Instead of necessarily looking to a future when people are jobless, AI will open doors for people in the future,” said Abdelaziz N. Buhnasy ’21. “That is something great to think about.”

In the past four decades, Dr. George M. Church, a Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, has revolutionized genome sequencing techniques and helped develop the DNA-editing technology CRISPR. Over the last 10 years, he has launched 15 bioengineering startups and published a book called “Regenesis.” His lab encoded the text of the book into DNA molecules in what was at the time the largest amount of information data stored in DNA. Since 2015, he has been working to resurrect the woolly mammoth.
His de-extinction project aims to genetically introduce woolly mammoth traits—subcutaneous fat, thick hair, and hemoglobin adapted to the cold—into the genome of the Asian Elephant, which already shares 99.96 percent of woolly mammoth DNA. The end goal is to repopulate the north Eurasian tundra with mammoth-like animals. Researchers predict that the grazing activities of these large animals can help restore the tundra to an arctic grassland, thereby preserving the earth’s permafrost and preventing the dangerous release of greenhouse gases. Plus, there will be mammoths.
FM caught up with Church on an early Friday morning.
Editor’s note: This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
FM: De-extinction seems like one of the more complex, multi-step approaches to fighting climate change. What makes pursuing this project worthwhile?
GC: What’s at risk is about 1,400 gigatons of carbon in the soil, and then a similar amount in methane, sort of on the edges of the ocean. To put that in perspective, either one of those being released is equivalent to burning all the forests twice, and that’s all comparable to the amount of carbon that’s already in the air. We’ve got a bunch of proposals for slowing things down: solar panels, windmills. But what we need is a way of reversal. That’s kind of similar to the message of reversal of species. It’s hard to get the team motivated [by saying], “We’re going to lose, it’s just a matter of whether we’re going to lose tomorrow or the next day.” But if you say, “Look, everything that we’re up against can be reversed,” then that’s a completely different story.
FM: How much progress have you made? When does your lab expect to repopulate the tundra?
GC: People like to ask the question that has the hardest answer, which is timeline. With the mammoth, the two genes that have been fully de-extincted are hemoglobin and TRPV3. It is just turning the crank, in a way—once you’ve shown you can do it for two genes, just turn the crank for the rest.
FM: What obstacles have you encountered?
GC: One thing that we don’t think we need but we want is the ability to grow mammalian embryos outside the body of the mother. We’d like to do that for the elephant because we don’t want to interfere with the reproduction of an endangered species. That’s the real hold-up right now.
FM: What ethical issues do you face?
GC: One is, “Is this going to distract us from existing species?” This is really all about existing species. This is about making a tundra that is compatible with the kind of ecology that we humans want. Another is, “Aren’t the mammoths going to be lonely?” Well, they’re nearly identical genetically to Asian elephants so they can be raised with Asian elephants, but I think the biggest issue I’m continuing to worry about is the socialization.
FM: How do you think the romantic, sci-fi appeal of this project has influenced its course?
GC: I didn’t really expect that this project, which is honestly one percent of my lab, would get more attention than the rest put together, which is fine. You want to engage the public on whatever aspect of science they won’t deny.
FM: If you could see one species besides the woolly mammoth walking the earth again, what would it be?
GC: I would love to see the oceans full of whales again. There were many, many more whales than there are now. That’s not de-extinction necessarily, but de-extinction is more about genes than it is about species. And it could be that there are certain genes we need to bring back to make them healthier, or maybe the system needs to be engineered slightly to make them healthier. I would love to see the ocean full of these giant, intelligent animals. We keep looking for intelligent life in the universe; what we really should be doing is talking to what’s around us.

The year is 1997. It’s 8 p.m. on a Tuesday night. The Crimson Sanctum buzzes with eager writers and editors of the newly-branded Fifteen Minutes Magazine. Diddy’s “I’ll Be Missing You,” is playing, and although it’s at the top of the charts, it’s really throwing off the vibe right now. Everyone is wearing flannel and has terrible skinny eyebrows.
“Okay, guys, I’ve got it: a Venn Diagram of ‘Black Friday sales’ and ‘the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.’”
“Too soon?”
“Definitely too soon.”
Everyone in the room adjusts their choker necklaces uncomfortably.
“What about ‘a line of blow’ and ‘the recent breakup of Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow’?”
“Again, maybe a little soon. Although Gwyneth is looking great these days—I wish I knew what she eats, and how she takes care of her skin and body.”
“It’s a shame that we’ll never know. I’ve got all these jade eggs lying around.”
The song changes: Chumbawamba’s “Tubthumping.”
“Maybe ‘orgasmic grunting’ and ‘Good Will Hunting’? It’s that movie that’s coming out soon, with that guy who dropped out of Harvard a few years ago.”
“Right, Ben Affleck’s friend.”
“Miramax has been on fire at the box offices lately.”
“I know, something about it almost doesn’t feel right.”
“‘Men in Black’ and ‘being good in the sack.’”
“‘Widespread moral panic’ and “the steamy window scene in Titanic.”
“Guys, are you serious? Are we going to waste our page space with totally vulgar Venn Diagrams? Is that the Fifteen Minutes Magazine we want to leave to posterity? How will FM writers look back on this, ten, twenty years from now?”
“Well, surely they’ll be tired of this Venn Diagram bullshit by then.”

Professor of English Steph Burt ’94 teaches “English 182: Science Fiction.” FM talked to her about how the genre both imagines the future and impacts the present.
Editor’s note: This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
FM: A lot of people end up outgrowing science fiction after a certain age, or lose interest. Why do you continue to come back to science fiction?
SB: In the recent past, it has been stigmatized. It's been uncool to be visibly into SF. I think that has receded because of Silicon Valley and geeks taking over the money world, but it's still there to some extent, and people feel pushed away from it because it's very good at addressing the concerns of children: How does the world work? How can people grow and change and become really different?
It has historically been written with an imagined audience that is straight and white and cis-male. That has changed radically over the past 20 to 30 years. Otherwise, I wouldn't be teaching this course.
FM: Do you feel like there's academic value to the genre and if so, what is it?
Part of my course is about how that changed and why it changed, and why non-realist genres—in particular science fiction—are uniquely useful. We need ways to imagine a future that is different from the present, because the present isn't really working out all that well and because we would like the future to be different. That is what science fiction is uniquely good at and that's why we need it.
FM: Do you think that science fiction is an escape or a call to action in reality? Or both?
Burt: My favorite works of science fiction are both—and they're self-conscious about being both. It's pretty easy to find works of science fiction that are calls to action with very, very limited potential for escape or solace or resolution. And it's of course easy to find science fiction that works quite well as escape, as fun, and it's not especially a call to action. But the best science fiction is at once an alternative to the real world and a way of thinking about the real world.
FM: Based on your work, can you predict the future?
Burt: I can envision a lot of futures that could happen. I can easily imagine the end of civilization coming from a nuclear exchange between the United States and North Korea. I can also imagine a future in which the southeasternmost part of the United States is underwater, but the northeastern, midwestern, and northwestern parts have a society much like the one that we have today… with single-payer health-care and much more equity in access to education and a more welcoming climate for queer and trans people. That's absolutely plausible.
FM: Can science fiction influence the future?
It depends. It's pretty easy to find works of science fiction that made the future they envisioned more likely. It's also easy to find works of science fiction that tried very hard to have the opposite effect. “1984” is a warning to English language audiences about what totalitarianism was and is and how to recognize it before it's too late. It's hard to measure its effect, but two things happened after November of last year. One is “1984” flew off the shelves. Another is a lot of people filed to run for local office. One might argue that those two things are related.

The sky above the Yard was the color of a crumpled problem set, marked down and thrown in a bin.
“It’s not like I’m at Lamont,” I heard someone say. “It’s like my body’s developed this massive Lamont deficiency.” It was a freshman voice and a freshman joke. The Queen’s Head was a pub for professional liberal artists; you could drink there for a week and learn about anything you wanted to, except how to fix the air conditioner that had been sitting dormant in the corner for weeks.
The bartender slid my sushi across the counter. It tasted like it had been sitting out for days. As I forced down the first bite I sensed someone big fill the spot just behind me. A heavy paw fell on my shoulder. “What’s this, then?” I asked, reaching for another piece.
“You’re under arrest,” the voice growled behind me.
I rolled my eyes. “He says you’re under arrest,” the bartender parroted.
“I’m eating,” I said, stuffing another bite into my mouth.
“Captain Catalano gave the order himself,” the voice said, its hand tightening.
“Catalano, eh?” I sighed, and pushed the sushi away. Alright, let’s see what the man has to say.
***
The chief gave me an ear to ear grin as I walked in. I always hated his smile. “Catalano,” I tipped my head.
“You wouldn’t have come if I’d just asked you to,” the chief shrugged. I lingered. “Come on, don’t be an asshole. I’ve got an assignment from the President themself.” I sat. The President? That was big. It had been a tumultuous and scandalous 10 years, after Faust had given the reins to—wait, you know the story. I’ll stop boring you. The chief poured us both a whiskey. “Son of one of our major donors, and I mean major, just failed a class.”
“Embarrassing.” I knocked mine back.
“No, not embarrassing, because no one’s ever going to find out. You’re hacking into my.harvard.edu before midnight tonight and changing the grade.”
“I don’t work here anymore.” I stood up to leave. The whiskey had been nice, but this was a waste of my time.
“Stop right where you are!” The chief boomed. “You know the score, pal? If you’re not HUPD, you’re a student.”
I stopped. “No choice, huh?”
“No choice, pal.” That smile again. I drank the other whiskey.
***
If I was going to make a run on my.harvard.edu I was going to need backup. I stopped by one of the 12 CVS’s in the square, made a few purchases, and headed to the Science Center. Just in time for Hackathon 2029: Fix The Flickering Light In SC106. They had given up a long time ago on trying to solve world hunger or war or disease or anything of relevance. Of course, this was their third year working on the lightbulb in 106, so they weren’t much more effective on the small scale.
A lean startup-type was blocking my way into the building, but I slipped him a few Five Hour Energies from CVS and he let me by, eyes wide with excitement. How else are they gonna waste their entire night trying to code a robot that can both fix a lightbulb and have a soul? I pushed through the crowd of fold-up tables to their leader, who was lording over them from a cheap podium. David J. Malan, Professor of Overproduction. Or something like him, anyway. The real Malan had been killed after an errant vinyl had slipped free of its turntable and ricocheted about Sanders. Luckily they had already uploaded his consciousness to a USB stick, so he could live on. He taught CS5000 these days. It’s like CS50, but with more inflation and less coding.
“Hey, Davie,” I smiled, sliding up next to him. His USB stick was stuck into a cheap bust with a speaker grille instead of a mouth and a Burger King cardboard crown on top.
The grille spat static. I assumed it was a deep sigh. “What do you want?”
“I’m gearing up for a run on my.harvard. Gotta change some preppy’s grade before papa finds out. You in?”
“You know I would, but I’ve gotta make sure things are running smoothly around here. We’ve got some great ideas bouncing around! That team over there is proposing cutting power to the whole building. No more flickering then!”
“Alright, hold on, Davie.” I walked to the other side of the room, kicked a coder out of his chair, and stood on it to get at the fixture. I pulled the other CVS purchase out of my bag–a new bulb—and swapped it in.
Malan spat disapproving static. “You know your problem? No imagination.”
I unplugged him and dropped him in my bag. “You sound just like my mother.”
***
Back in my room I plugged Malan into my iPhone 24. The iPhone kept getting bigger and the MacBook smaller, until they switched roles sometime in the mid 2020s. I settled into my chair, placed the electrodes on my forehead, and jacked in. There’s nothing quite like cyberspace. My.harvard.edu spread out around me, columns of data towering over me like skyscrapers, the cheap glow of Canvas sites beneath me, and high above, the smooth data-spheres of the transcripts.
“That you, cowboy? 11:50 p.m., we gotta hurry if we’re gonna get this done before midnight.” Malan’s disembodied voice came from somewhere over my shoulder. “What’s the class and who’s the kid?”
I checked the assignment. “Tanner Dustin Bailey III, Hebrew Bible.”
“Which one, hotshot?”
“Good question.” I punched over to the class logs and checked for our boy Bailey III. He wasn’t in Hebrew Bible, Hebrew Bible 2: “2 Hebrew 2 Bible,” or Hebrew Bible 3: “Jerusalem Drift.” I found his name in Hebrew Bible 4: “This One’s For Athletes, Get It?” “Four,” I told the construct. “Get us in.”
I felt Malan smile, and then cyberspace blurred as we sped upwards towards the transcripts. My iPhone 24 was loaded with a Mumps virus, a nasty piece of technology I had bought off a member of the PSK last fall. With Malan at the wheel, it made short work of the HUIT defenses. A digital Khurana was HUIT’s last stand, waving a pixilated copy of the Honor Code at us before Malan gleefully cut it in half with the sharp end of the Mump.
I checked the clock. 11:58 p.m. Cutting it close, but we had done it. I punched over to Hebrew Bible 4, and accessed the transcript.
My vision filled with the Harvard crest. “Choose an authentication method,” a tranquil voice intoned.
“Son of a bitch!” I yelled. Two-Step! Those HUIT bastards!
Malan crackled over my shoulder. “Use Duo-Push! It’s recommended!”
“Christ, I know! Duo-Push! Send the damn thing!” I screamed at Two-Step.
“Pushed a login request to your device…” Two-Step sang, cheerfully.
I jacked out and ripped the ‘trodes off my head. 11:59 p.m. I spun around my room. Where the hell was my MacBook? I dove under a pile of dirty laundry, searching. There, in the pocket of my jeans! I pulled it out, my hands shaking as Duo Mobile loaded. Then, there, yes! Approve! I sprinted back to my desk, slapped the ‘trodes on, and jacked back in.
Two-Step was gone, but here was another page. “There are several known kinds of login errors—” I stopped reading. It had been over a decade! How had they not fixed this?
“Hit refresh!” The construct screeched.
I growled, and did as he said. my.harvard froze, then went white, then reloaded. I had done it! I was past HUIT. Now to change the trans—
“Midnight, hotshot,” Malan said. I blinked. my.harvard was empty. The transcripts were gone, whisked away to admin. We had been too slow. “Oh well, guess you weren’t good enough.”
“You’re a great teacher, anyone ever tell you that?” I jacked out and unplugged Malan.
***
It all worked out for the best. The chief was on my ass for a few weeks, but eased up when Papa Bailey donated something to the University in the tune of millions of dollars to get the grade changed the ol’ fashioned way. Malan went back to his Hackathons. I hear they’re gonna fix the basement water fountain next year. Lofty goal, but maybe they’ll pull it off. And me? I learned a valuable lesson. Never tussle with Two-Step: it’s not a dance you can win.

The Harvard Biorobotics Lab wants to revolutionize robots, although their lab—decked out with a ping pong table, a whiteboard covered in doodles, and Baxter, a decorative robot wearing a graduation cap—might not seem serious. Researchers at the lab are developing robots that can autonomously navigate their environments, from kitchens to warehouses to arteries inside the human body.
Founded in 1990 by engineering professor Robert D. Howe, the Biorobotics Lab develops robots that can both sense and operate in dynamic, unpredictable environments. Currently, the researchers are working on projects in medical imaging and modelling, robotic surgery, robotic hands, and soft robotics, with the goal of “figuring out what makes things function intelligently,” as Howe said in a 2014 video interview produced by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Currently, the lab is focused on developing robotic hands.
“Our goal is to have something that can actually manipulate the world. The challenge is that the world is full of objects of different sizes and shapes” Qian Wen, a graduate student in the lab, says.
These claw-like hands, made up of three rotating fingers powered by four motors, face the challenge of operating in so-called “unstructured environments.” While robotics have long been used in structured environments such as factories and assembly lines, researchers are still working to figure out how to use them in more unpredictable settings, whether domestic (like kitchens and grocery stores) or dangerous (like nuclear sites and search-and-rescue operations.)
To that end, Qian and others in the lab work to extract information about the hands’ surroundings through embedded sensors. Using data from the sensors, the robots can get a sense of whether “the thing is about to drop out of their hand, or if they have a good grip,” Qian says. This task is difficult, because sensors durable enough for a real-world setting tend to produce limited data.
“The sensors are not that great right now, so the information [we] get is confounded in too many ways to really know what to do with it,” she says. The task for researchers then, Qian says, is to figure out what they can do with this limited data.
“In 50 years, maybe even less, I would hope to see robotic hands used for menial tasks in all these unstructured environments,” Qian says. “But we’re certainly not aiming to take over humanity.”
Similar challenges exist in smaller-scale unstructured environments. Researchers in the Biorobotics Lab are currently working on tubes that can move autonomously within the human heart.
“This is really challenging because, as the heart is beating, you have all these valves flapping inside the heart at high speeds,” Alperen Degirmenci, a PhD candidate in the lab, says. “If you want to operate on any of these moving parts, you have to compensate for the motion.”
Degirmenci’s work focuses on getting these tubes—intracardiac echocardiography catheters, or ICE catheters—to move while taking 4D scans of the heart. Degirmenci is also trying to automate the steering of these catheters, to minimize human error and make the procedure less invasive. In doing so, ICE catheters can reduce recovery times from weeks to days.
In a 2016 animal test, the Biorobotics Lab performed the first successful automated steering of ICE catheters in the world. Now, the lab is working to integrate them with embedded ultrasound probes, which enable the catheter to take cross sections of the heart that can form a “three dimensional map of the heart that’s beating in time, so [the surgeon] can see both the motion of the heart and the structure,” Degirmenci says.
Though the path to commercialization will be difficult, Degirmenci believes that the ICE catheter could be in human use in as soon as a decade, and that robots will be automating the “boring” parts of surgery, such as suturing, within 50 years.
And in 100 years? He smiles. “I think we will have robotic surgeons,” he says. But by then, he counters, “hopefully you can actually catch some of those diseases before they require surgery. You might not require a surgery at all.”

Rupi Kaur calls from the departures terminal of an unknown airport. She is about to board a flight to Boston where she will address a sold-out Memorial Church audience. Amid the murmur of conversations around her, announcements about various flight delays, and the laughter of her manager and other members of her team, Kaur takes a few minutes to chat before her flight.
Kaur, a 25 year-old, Punjabi-Canadian poet has become an overnight sensation. Kaur’s first book, “Milk and Honey,” is a simple black-covered paperback filled with short poems and Kaur’s sketches. According to The Boston Globe, the compilation has sold 1.1 million copies and is currently the best-selling adult non-fiction book of the year. It’s sold in most bookstores and on Amazon, as well as in Urban Outfitters. Kaur’s second book, entitled “The Sun and Her Flowers,” was released two weeks ago.
“I guess the major themes are loss—sorry, there are so many people around me,” Kaur says, giggling to someone near her. “I guess the major themes are loss, and then self-abandonment is Chapter Two, and then Three is displacement of people—migration, immigration, ancestry. Chapter Four is more poetry. And Chapter Five is self-expression, empowerment, I guess those are also quite political.”
Indeed, Kaur has established herself as a very political figure. She often writes about the immigrant experience and current events, but has also stirred controversy writing about experiences that are not entirely her own. Her work has received some scathing reviews, like The Guardian’s “Rupi Kaur: The Inevitable Backlash against Instagram’s Favorite Poet” and a 5,000 word Buzzfeed review entitled “The Problem with Rupi Kaur’s Poetry,” which says Kaur has “been accused of plagiarism and criticized for blurring individual and collective trauma in her quest to depict the quintessential South Asian female experience.”
But Kaur defends the blend of experiences represented in her work. “[There was] a lot of focus in the first book about my own life, and what is around me, and ‘The Sun and Her Flowers’ is also about that, but then I write poems about lives that I don’t—you know, things that might be happening in the world,” she says. “Like one example is a poem in Chapter Three called ‘Boat’ and that one is about the Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.”
Kaur has also garnered criticism for her prolific social media presence, which has prompted multiple news outlets to dub her “The Instagram Poet.” After all, Kaur has 1.7 million followers on Instagram, with a feed that includes her own poems curated artfully with her sketches. She follows zero people.
“I used social media because it was the first thing—it was the only thing—that three years ago, when I was writing, that I had access to. I wasn’t going to get published like anybody else. I wasn’t in anthology journals, magazines,” she says. “But social media was very accessible for me to build my own little world.
Kaur attributes her activity on social media to this accessibility, in that it allows anybody to read her poems. “For me, it goes back to accessibility and who at the end of the day I’m writing for, and it’s all these communities—I think about who I was at the age of 16 or 20 or 21, when I wouldn’t have access to certain things and I want to make sure that there are people, really young readers who might not be able to afford books,” she says. “And so that’s the reason I continue to share all of my new poetry there, and will be sharing ‘The Sun and Her Flowers’ there as well.”
As for being dubbed “The Instagram Poet”? “It’s not something that I like or dislike,” Kaur says. “I think that when somebody says it, it’s like they say, ‘Oh you’re not a poet; you’re an Instagram poet.’”
And with that reply, the line goes dead. I call Kaur back, but she says that the plane is about to take off and she can no longer be on her phone. She did land, though, posting an Instagram upon her presumed arrival. It’s a sketch of her in a Red Sox jersey, accompanied by the words, “Boston It’s a Date.” She geotagged Memorial Church—it’s Instagram, after all.

Though the store is only a mile and a half away from Harvard’s campus, I had my friend order me a Lyft Line, which felt reasonable at the time. Phoneless, I worried that it’d be difficult for me to find the store once I was dropped off.
I shouldn’t have worried.
Amazon’s logo swoops across the window of its new package depot in giant letters, advertising the location of the store and reminding passers-by that yes, the digital company can open brick-and-mortar locations, too. Seeing Amazon outside of a phone or computer screen is mildly unsettling, like looking at a slightly off-kilter hanging photo frame that you just can’t level.
Earlier this semester, Amazon opened the fully-staffed pickup location on Commonwealth Ave. in Boston, the first store of its kind in the area. Blandly dubbed  “Amazon@Boston,” the store is situated in a modern-looking strip mall with other similarly hyper-capitalist institutions: a ski shop chain location to its left, a Starbucks and a Chipotle to its right. Train tracks run directly in front of the strip mall, creating a barrier between these stores and their neighbors across the street: the Boston University College of Fine Arts and the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra. Symbolism? You tell me.
Much has been written about Amazon’s seemingly-contradictory foray into the brick-and-mortar book store business. The online-ish retail giant currently operates 12 locations across the United States, and three more—including its first in Washington, D.C.— are in the works, an online-to-real-world transformation reminiscent of some of the Disney Channel’s worst original movie plotlines. Some of the stores, including the one in Dedham, Mass., even have coffee shops. Welcome back, Borders.
But less has been written about these Amazon Pickup Points, locations that give customers the option to eschew traditional two or one-day home delivery in favor of picking up their packages in person. These locations come in two varieties: Unstaffed Amazon Lockers are located within third-party establishments (think Whole Foods, 7-Eleven, Doubletree Suites), and are relatively common, while Amazon@ locations, owned and fully-staffed by Amazon, are less so.
In addition to traditional pickups, Amazon@ depots also offer package return services and the option to pick up drinks and snacks within minutes of ordering, positioning themselves as stern competitors to local convenience stores. Most Amazon@ stores are on college campuses, where they offer students easy access to everything from required textbooks to potato chips (until 9 p.m., at least.) In other words, a lot like a store.
My trek across the river to the Amazon@Boston location was motivated by a desire to avoid the seemingly interminable delay between Amazon delivering packages and Harvard University Mail Services actually getting them to the Mather building manager’s office. I had ordered a new phone, and hoped to have it in hand before leaving campus for a trip two days later. Off I went.
The store uses minimalism to project modernity in the way that every store like that uses minimalism to project modernity. It is empty save for three kiosks in the center of the room (where you check in), a sleek white wall of lockers (where you get your packages), and a customer service desk off to the left (where you return them). You could host a party in the available floor space (cc: Rakesh). To the right are large movie posters advertising some Amazon Prime original movie, which seems to be motivated more by a desire to fill the emptiness than to actually advertise anything, given that there are two of them and they are spaced incredibly far apart. New Age industrial lights set the ambience as P!nk’s latest hit plays softly in the background.
There is only one other customer in the store, who seems to be waiting for an Amazon staff member to appear behind the counter. He turns, we make eye contact, and he looks back at his phone. Neither of us went to an Amazon pick-up location to interact with other people.
I approach the kiosk, which prompts me to enter the code I received in my confirmation email. I do so, and one of the lockers on the wall springs open, lights shining to illuminate a small package inside. It’s a gimmick, but it works: I’m excited. The small screen on the front of the locker directs me to take my package and close the door. I do this, too, and then look around for a staff member to see if I need to do anything else. Maybe they’ll say “You’re all set!” or something. But they are nowhere to be seen.
So I leave, asking myself where they were and how my package had gotten into that locker in the first place. I wonder if I should feel odd about having such an automated, impersonal in-store experience.
I hop into another Lyft Line. Then, I gush to my driver and fellow passenger about how the locker door had swung open all by itself.

The year was 1999, the Harvard-Radcliffe merger had just been finalized, Mambo No. 5 was at the top of the charts, and the tabloids said we were doomed.
Experts were concerned about the Y2K bug, a problem in computerized systems expected to cause chaos around the world at the turn of the millennium. From the 1960s to the 1990s, programmers had used a two-digit system to represent years—but they worried that when ’00 came around, programs wouldn’t realized that one hundred years had passed. In their confused state, the computers might think, for example, a newborn baby was turning 100. A plane scheduled to leave Jan. 1, 2000 might be rerouted for the year 1900.
“And that can mess things up,” Scott O. Bradner, a coordinator of the Year 2000 project, says. Bradner was part of an effort to secure University systems before the turn of the millennium. “There was a huge human cry on it worldwide that went on from about 1995 through to the end of the century. People were saying that the IT world would end. Planes would crash. All kinds of stuff would happen.”
Or maybe not. As Harvard prepared for the turn of the millennium, many aspects of campus life remained utterly normal: In late 1999, President Bill Clinton went on TV to issue a public service announcement in conjunction with the Harvard School of Public Health. He did not caution against the perils of Y2K, but rather about the dangers of drunk driving.
That’s not to say that Harvard didn’t take the threat of IT malfunctions seriously. In fact, Harvard had already felt some of the effects of Y2K—on their freshman move-in day in 1996, the class of 2000 briefly couldn’t access their dorms because University systems thought they had graduated in 1900.
In December 1997, Harvard’s Committee on Inspection, which deals with risk management, requested that the University take action to address potential issues. Bradner and Elizabeth Eagan, the project’s other coordinator, spent two years preparing the University’s software systems.
Bradner explains that the general ledger application, which recorded transactions related to the University’s assets, revenue, and expenses, was not Y2K-proof. “Things like that—software that was designed to do bookkeeping—would be in significant trouble,” he says. “There was definitely real reason to worry.” Bradner and Eagan spent New Year’s Eve of 1999 in the basement of the Science Center, waiting to see how computer systems would react to the date change.
“We were sitting there, stroke of midnight, watching it progress across the world,” Bradner says.
Elsewhere on Harvard’s campus, the mood was less apocalyptic. Geoffrey B. Mainland ’00 was one of the few students on campus at the turn of the millennium. After a brief visit home to Ohio for the holidays, Mainland returned before the new year to work on a Computer Science independent study project. It was a mild December with little snow. From his dorm in Cabot, the atmosphere felt quiet and lonely.
“Especially up at the Quad,” Mainland says. “Nobody was around.”
Mainland attended a friend’s New Year’s party in Dorchester. The partygoers, in his memory, were unconcerned with the Y2K bug. “We were all pretty oblivious to that,” he says.
Mainland remembers a long walk to catch the train back to campus. He called a few friends on the West Coast, three time zones behind, to wish them a happy New Year’s from the other side of the millennium.
Further festivities cropped up in swankier locales. The Harvard Faculty Club planned a “Millennium Celebration” with food, drink, and dancing. Cost for entrance was $99 per person.
Houghton Library launched an exhibit called “TEOTWAWKI: Futuristic Visions in Houghton’s Collections.” The clunky acronym was ‘90s internet forum jargon for The End Of The World As We Know It, and on display were historical writers’ and artists’ visions of radically unfamiliar futures. The works, among them Dante’s “Inferno,” H. B. Welles’’ “The War of the Worlds,” and T.S. Eliot’s “The Wasteland,” were accompanied by apocalyptic imagery.
“The closing date of the exhibition is hypothetical at this point depending on what transpires when the clock turns on January 1,” Karen Nipps, the exhibit’s curator, told the Harvard Gazette in Dec. 1999.
This tongue-in-cheek attitude was not necessarily an indicator that the risks of Y2K were a fluke, but a testament to years of preparation. The City of Cambridge assured that both public infrastructure and private businesses were Y2K-compliant months in advance. The medical and dental schools planned to have representatives from each department, as well as engineers and police officers, working on New Year’s Eve. Staff would monitor equipment and walk the buildings in teams at midnight to identify whether any malfunctions had arisen.
“We were concerned, but not worried. We thought we’d done a pretty good job. And we knew that none of the major systems were going to fail,” Bradner says.
His prediction was correct. Life went on. The class of 2000 graduated in the spring.
“At the end,” Bradner says, “it was pretty anticlimactic.”

Earlier this year, researchers at Harvard Medical School and MIT created a revolutionary kind of tattoo: one that reads and displays information about the wearer’s body. The research project, called DermalAbyss, uses biosensors that change color according to pH and sodium levels and blood glucose content, opening up new doors for medical research and body modification.
FM sat down with MIT graduate Xin Liu, one of the lead researchers at DermalAbyss, and Felicity A. Lufkin, a professor of Folklore and Mythology who has taught FOLKMYTH 176: Tattoos: History and Practices, to talk about the past and future of tattooing.
Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Fifteen Minutes: Why did you create DermalAbyss?
Xin Liu: We were very interested in the idea of health monitoring, but we were trying to reconnect the person with their own body, instead of showing the data on a dehumanized device. You want to know more about yourself, but nowadays the common solution is seeing the data on a phone or a screen, which is actually distancing the person from the information they want to see. Instead of doing that, we’re trying to use the human body to present the data.
FM: What’s the most exciting part of the project for you?
XL: I think a very exciting part for us is the attention. We developed this technology from a more human-computer interaction, but because the project is getting so much attention right now, there are people from a more medical and pharmaceutical perspective thinking, “Oh, that actually is interesting.” People want to be able to understand themselves by just looking at their bodies, rather than stabbing a needle somewhere or having to wear a device all the time.
FM: What are some other recent advances in the world of tattoos?
XL: There is a lot of research about electronics and how we can make electronics soft and flexible, as if they are temporary tattoos that we can apply on top of the skin. But in using or truly following the form factor of the ink, I think our project is relatively unique.
***
FM: What do you think about the DermalAbyss project?
Felicity A. Lufkin: When I first heard of it, I thought it could be a little creepy because of the idea that you could be tracked, identified or categorized through a tattoo. We have enough issues with privacy already. [But] I’ve talked to some of the people who have some of the health conditions that [DermalAbyss] would be useful for, and they said, “No, it’s not creepy, that would be great.”
FM: How have tattoos been useful in the past?
FL: Practices of tattooing are found in practically every known culture, at practically every known point in human history. I think if we’re looking at modern western tattooing, a lot of it has to do with in-group/out-group classification… Many of the indigenous North and South American tattooing practices apparently have a medicinal component, which was also true in Europe. You’ve heard of Otzi the Iceman, the mummified corpse that was found in the Alps. He’s tattooed. The markings are just little dots on the joints, and when they looked at they found that they all look like they’re arthritic, and the belief is that the tattoos were meant as a treatment for the arthritis.
FM: How will tattoos be valuable in the future?
XL: We’re in the middle of the tattoo renaissance, which really started in the mid-1960s as an outgrowth of people asking questions about individual agency, and having this romantic sense of wanting to get in touch with the primitive, and picking up this practice that has been done by so many different cultures over time. People often articulate their desire of getting tattooed as reclaiming parts of their own bodies and creating themselves as individuals. If we think of it as an increasingly automated industrialized society, that appeal may continue. It may be something like, “I often feel like I’m a cog in the wheel, but my tattoos make me feel different and special.”
FM: Do you think that the DermalAbyss project reflects the future of tattooing?
XL: I think that it could be part of the future of tattooing, but I doubt that it will ever be the whole future of tattooing. It sounds like the kind of thing that could be important to people, but could also be marginal to what I think of as the history of decorative and expressive tattooing. People get tattoos currently as medical tattoos. When you need radiation, you get little tattoos to position the radiation. Women who’ve had breast reconstructive surgery often get their nipples tattooed back on. In a certain sense, tattooing is just a technology.

Ever wonder when the buttermilk chicken will be served again? Or why there’s cottage cheese every morning, but strawberries only a few times each week? Harvard University Dining Services has answers to these questions. It’s a fairly high-tech process: HUDS tracks which foods are eaten and when, analyzes the popularity data for each dish, performs inventory, purchases ingredients, and monitors the expenditures of every dining hall.
Of all the ways HUDS uses technology, students are the most familiar with the swipe system: College students must swipe their Harvard ID every time they eat in a dining hall. This system allows HUDS to “cook to the next 15 minutes”––project how many people are about to arrive, then cook to feed that number.
“There aren’t a lot of types of foods that are made all at once, because then it just sits in a warmer. We want food that is served at its freshest,” Crista Martin, Director of Strategic Initiative and Communications at HUDS, says.
This data collected by the swipe system goes into a database called FoodPro. In addition to storing swipe data, FoodPro retains all 5000 or so recipes and all of the required ingredients, which are also linked to their various vendors. Whenever HUDS creates a new recipe, they add the ingredients to the system.
FoodPro also tracks “acceptability factors,” which are notes on dish popularity.
“There’s a sort of common misperception—we often get feedback from a student that says ‘nobody likes x.’ But we wouldn’t serve it if nobody liked it!” Martin says. “We do in fact have this computer keeping track of it, so maybe you particular student don’t like it, but there’s always someone who likes it.”
When HUDS serves a dish for the first time, the number of servings prepared is based on HUDS’ best guess. But each time it is served thereafter, the system projects how much of the dish should be prepared based on how much was consumed the last few times it was served.
Every week, the chefs get together and review this data. “Everyone [HUDS staff, management, the chefs, and so on] has a role in what’s happening,” Martin explains. “FoodPro is how we order, inventory, and prepare, so everyone is engaged with it at some level.”
For example, HUDS partners with the company Red’s Best, a Boston-based seafood wholesaler that works with approximately 1,000 local fisherman to supply fish that is fresh and in season. Even though HUDS never knows exactly what type of fish they’re going to get, they usually  have a rough idea of how much they need. HUDS logs the number of pounds of fish they use each time this fish is served, and FoodPro processes this data.
In 2015, when HUDS first initiated this partnership, Red’s Best fish was only served in the dining halls on Fridays at lunch. Now, because of its popularity, it’s served Wednesdays at dinner as well.
Controlling numbers is also important when it comes to grill orders. Here, the issue is with abandoned orders. Before the 2016-2017 school year, all grill orders were done on paper slips. “The issue with the paper slips was that people forgot about their grill order. They’d order something off the grill, and then get food elsewhere, and not come back,” Martin says.
Now, students in the upper class houses can order customized food on iPads and a mobile application. This new system, first piloted at the Quad dining halls and then introduced in all houses last year, has greatly reduced the number of abandoned orders by sending students a notification when their food is ready.
Grill data also gives insight on other menu items. “We look at this data. When the grill is busy it might mean that the main entree was not a hit, so sometimes we make adjustments based on that,” Martin says.
Additionally, for the first time this year, HUDS has incorporated texting into their feedback channels, which had already consisted of cards in the dining hall, emails, and social media outlets. Students can text a five-digit number (55744) with a comment that includes specific location keyword (for example, “Berg” for Annenberg) and are guaranteed to receive a reply within twenty-four hours.
Martin believes that while students are more likely to use email to say what they don’t like, they tend to talk more about what they do like through text because of its relative ease.
“Texting is so easy and so instantaneous and you can jump on your phone when you’re right there on the table, so we’re getting more about the good stuff, and not just a few one-off comments about something that someone didn’t like,” she says. “So that’s been awesome, because it gives more information on what your tastes are.”

Someone tells you they’ve been catcalled. What do you do?
1. You ask them to see it from both sides—maybe the catcaller thought he was complimenting them!
2. You cackle from your hellish abode: It is I, Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies, symbol of the Scarab!
You accidentally misgender someone. How do you proceed?
1. You continue to misgender them, wondering aloud whether gender dysmorphia actually affirms the binary. If  the distinction between men and women is constructed, shouldn’t pronouns not matter at all?
2. You continue to misgender them, whispering “Through me you pass into the city of woe:/ Through me you pass into eternal pain:/ Through me among the people lost for aye./ Justice the founder of my fabric moved:/ To rear me was the task of power divine,/ Supremest wisdom and primeval love./ Before me things create were none, save things/ Eternal, and eternal I shall endure./ All hope abandon, ye who enter here.”
What do you see in the mirror each morning?
1. A nice, open-minded boy, certain there are “many sides” to the debate.
2. “An enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung the to the earth. The dragon stood in front of a woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. She gave birth to a son, a male child, who ‘will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.’ And her child was snatched up to God and his throne. The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days. Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth and his angels with him. Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: ‘Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death. Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.’ When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. The woman was given the two wings of a wild eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like to a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river the dragon had spewed out his mouth. Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring––those who keep God’s commands and hold fast to their testimony about Jesus.” Revelations 12.1-17.
Who is your Harvard campus speaker dream team?
1. Richard Spencer, Milo Yiannopoulos, Charles Murray (again).
2. David Duke, Harvey Weinstein, Sammael the Hebrew “venom of God,” also known as Shemyaza and Hel’el Ben Shacar, and whoever thought up GoGo In-Flight WiFi.
What is the difference between hate and free speech?
1. Hurt feelings.
2. No difference. Neither will protect you from my meathead son, Ragnarok, the coming submersion of the world in water and the end of the human way of life as you know it.
If you answered mostly 1’s...
You’re a dick.
If you answered mostly 2’s…
You’re the actual devil.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 18, 2017 at 11:25 p.m.
Harvard will rescind the 2014 W.E.B Du Bois medal awarded to Harvey Weinstein, a movie executive whom more than 40 women have recently accused of sexual harassment and abuse.
The Executive Committee of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, a group of five professors that unanimously voted to award Weinstein the medal three years ago, voted Tuesday night to rescind the honor in the wake of the reporting detailing Weinstein’s behavior, according to Hutchins Center Executive Director Abby Wolf.
“We have voted unanimously to rescind the Du Bois Medal awarded to Mr. Weinstein in 2014. We stand with the women who have courageously come forward to fight for themselves and indeed for all of those who have experienced similar abuse,” the group wrote in a statement.
The Du Bois medal is Harvard’s highest honor for contributions to African and African-American culture. Previous winners include Oprah Winfrey, Muhammad Ali, and Maya Angelou.
More than 40 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment since the New York Times reported  in early October that Weinstein had reached a series of settlements with women who said he sexually harassed them over the course of several decades.
Over the course of his influential career as a film producer, Weinstein made dozens of films, including “Pulp Fiction,” “Shakespeare in Love,” and “Life is Beautiful.”
Harvard joins several institutions that have cut ties with Weinstein since the New York Times reported the accusations. Weinstein was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and forced out of his own firm, the Weinstein Company. French President Emmanuel Macron said he would look into stripping Weinstein of his Legion of Honour award, France’s highest civilian award.
The five members of the Executive Committee—director Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Lawrence D. Bobo, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, William Julius Wilson, and Emmanuel Akyeampong—could not be reached Wednesday for comment.
In the aftermath of the accusations being leveled at Weinstein, several institutions and political figures that accepted donations from Weinstein have been pressured to retroactively reject the money. Several politicians have said they would give Weinstein’s money to charity.
While Weinstein has never donated to Harvard, he did have financial ties to Harvard’s American Repertory Theater through his role as producer of the musical “Finding Neverland.” In an agreement with the A.R.T., Weinstein agreed to provide funding to develop the production.
According to the New York Times, Weinstein chaired a 2015 gala event in Cannes for the non-profit AIDS organization amfAR, but the auction had one stipulation: $600,000 of the money raised would go to the A.R.T. The A.R.T. had agreed to reimburse Weinstein and others if they arranged for third-party donations by June 1, 2015, according to the Huffington Post.
An A.R.T. spokesperson confirmed that the Institute received $600,000 in 2015 through an amfAR event, and that “proceeds from some auction items were earmarked for the A.R.T.”
“It is standard practice to not disclose the specific terms of agreements,” the spokesperson wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust is among a group of politicians, business leaders, and other prominent figures to found the “Dream Coalition” Monday, an organization pushing for legislation to protect undocumented students.
Besides Faust, the coalition boasts a distinguished list of founding members—including Apple CEO Tim Cook, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio—many of whom have spoken out individually against President Donald Trump’s repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The program, which protects undocumented young people from deportation, allows hundreds of thousands of students—including several dozen at Harvard—to work and study in the United States.
The Dream Coalition is urging Congress to pass legislation, like the bipartisan Dream Act, to return protections to these students. “Collectively, we, the Dream Coalition, are committed to using our voices as business, civic, and government leaders to amplify the overwhelming American support for protecting Dreamers,” reads the organization’s mission statement.
Faust has been a vocal advocate for undocumented students over the past year, bringing in legal experts to consult with students in the wake of the 2016 election and stressing that undocumented students are safe on Harvard’s campus. After Trump terminated DACA in September, Faust denounced the decision and reaffirmed her support for undocumented students in a letter to Harvard affiliates.
While this isn’t the first time that American education leaders have come together to lobby for the rights of undocumented students, the organization’s founders hope that the Dream Coalition will unite leaders from both parties in protecting the rights of these students.
“This is not a partisan or political issue. It is in our social, economic, security, and moral interests to enable Dreamers to earn their full place in America. We will do everything we can to ensure that legislation authorizing them to do so passes this year,” the Coalition’s website reads.

Harvard Medical School’s Diversity Task Force unveiled the school’s new diversity statement and announced the creation of diversity subcommittees at a panel Wednesday morning.
In January, Medical School Dean George Q. Daley announced he would create a Diversity Task Force with the ultimate goal of increasing diversity among the school’s students and faculty. Following months of closed-door meetings, the task force’s 40 members presented a statement to a crowd of hundreds at the Armenise Auditorium.
The statement reaffirmed the school’s commitment to “convening and nurturing a diverse community of individuals dedicated to promoting excellence and leadership in medicine and science through education, research, clinical care and service.”
“Our unique perspectives, talents, experiences and contributions as HMS students, trainees, faculty, staff and administrators are the foundation and drivers of our excellence,” the statement reads.
In her speech punctuated by applause, Joan Y. Reede, Medical School Dean for Diversity and Community Partnership and the task force’s chair, said that the group has conducted a “deeper investigation” of diversity issues at the Medical School.
“The work of advancing diversity and inclusion is not just to do good but to hold each other accountable on being better,” Reede said. “The diversity statement was launched with all of us in mind.”
Reede also announced the creation of five subcommittees which will tackle diversity in five areas including residency training, faculty development and retention, and community engagement.
In February 2016, a group of Medical School students submitted a petition to University President Drew G. Faust calling for more diversity on the Longwood campus and asking that the school hire a diversity dean from an underrepresented background.
On Wednesday, Daley thanked the task force for its work, adding that diversity and inclusion are especially important given that they are “in many cases under siege in the national stage.”
“We have to find a way for those who are educated in Harvard Medical School that our community reflects the same diversity of the community that we are serving,” Daley said.
Daley also said that he expects the Medical School’s general mission statement to be “revised slightly” following recommendations from the Diversity Task Force.
During the panel, task force members presented pieces of the diversity statement and shared stories reflecting on why the mission statement was important to them. The presentation was followed by an open forum where audience members submitted feedback to the task force, which was projected onto the auditorium screen.
The task force will deliver a set of recommendations to Daley in the coming months.

Confusion about an amendment to a "Dorm-Rooms to Table" pilot program has prompted members of the Undergraduate Council to clarify rules about the body's retroactive voting policy.
After the UC passed an amendment from Henry S. Atkins ’20 barring fellow members from partaking in the new dining program, UC members were under the impression that they could change their vote in the 24 hours following its passage. By Monday night, it seemed as though the amendment would fail after some representatives changed their votes. But the amendment will pass, as members cannot retroactively change their votes on legislation or legislative amendments.
UC Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said the confusion might have sprung from a rule in the Council’s constitution and bylaws allowing members to change their vote on amendments to the body’s governing documents by the next time the body convenes.
 “You cannot change your vote after all the votes have been tallied on standard legislation that is not a bylaws or a constitutional amendment. And you can’t change your vote retroactively on an amendment to any larger legislation ever under any circumstances,” he said.
UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said the Council is more closely following its governing documents following Sunday’s meeting.
“We know we all are operating a bit better by the rules. When you operate under [UC parliamentary procedure], there are just so many complexities. And often times, those things don’t get brought out into the way that our everyday meetings run, because a lot of it is pretty regular and pretty standard order,” he said.
“But sometimes these unique rules come out and they make you think a bit more about the process,” he added.

James E. Ryan, dean of the Graduate School of Education, says good leaders must continually ask themselves two questions: “What truly matters?” and “How can I help?”
In an interview Wednesday at the School of Public Health, Ryan—who is departing the Ed School to become the president of the University of Virginia—discussed the importance of asking these crucial questions, reiterating themes from his viral commencement address in May.
“The question of what truly matters is a really useful way to stay focused on what you are trying to accomplish...and is as important to structuring your day as it is to setting long-term goals,” Ryan said. “The other question, which is actually related, is ‘how can I help?’ I tend to think of leadership as a form of service.”
Michelle A. Williams, Dean of the School of Public Health, interviewed Ryan as part of the school’s “Voices in Leadership” speaker series. In the discussion, Ryan focused on the importance of overcoming the hesitation that may hold people back from asking questions in the first place.
“You see all the time, ironically often in academia, that people are worried about asking questions. They’re worried that they’re going to be embarrassed or that they’re going to ask a dumb question,” Ryan said.
Before becoming dean of the Ed School, Ryan previously served on the faculty of the University of Virginia Law School; he will return to UVA as its president at the end of the academic year.
“Going from being a faculty member to being a dean reminded me most of going from having no children to having one child. It fundamentally changed my life,” he said. “I feel like going from dean to president is like going from having one child to having thirteen or fourteen children. It’s the same idea, but there are just many more children in your family.”
Asked how white supremacist riots near the UVA campus had weighed on him as he prepares to take the helm as president, Ryan said that in the wake of the riots, he recalled a speech by University President Drew G. Faust that she delivered shortly after the Boston Marathon bombings. In that speech, Faust cited the various first responders, runners, and spectators who ran to the aid of those injured, calling upon students to “run toward” unknown challenges.
“I hadn’t yet decided to take the job, and that clinched it for me, to be honest,” he said. “Her speech was running through my mind, and I thought this is the moment to run toward.”
The next Voices in Leadership event will take place on November 9 and feature Donna Shalala, Board Member and former President and CEO of the Clinton Foundation.

Actor, screenwriter, and political activist Woody Harrelson spoke to a group of students at Kirkland House Wednesday evening about his personal inspirations, the current political climate, and his new upcoming film, “LBJ.”
The event was part of the Conversations at Harvard series sponsored by the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard College Black Students Association, Concilio Latino, and the Harvard Business School Entertainment and Media Club. Afterwards, Harrelson hosted a screening of the film at the Brattle Theater.
In “LBJ,” Harrelson plays the titular character, former President Lyndon B. Johnson, as he ascends to the presidency and ultimately passes the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
At the event’s onset, Peter V. Emerson, founder of the Conversations at Harvard series and a Harvard Medical School affiliate, commended Harrelson’s work in the film, even noting that “the president’s daughter said, ‘the man I saw on the screen, is my father.’”
“It’s about the most uplifting, optimistic time in America where you could actually get something done,” Emerson added.
After some brief words from College Democrats Vice President W. Tanner Gildea ’19, Harrelson spent the rest of the evening taking questions from the audience.
Harrelson emphasized that his path to success was not always easy, and he spoke of times where he faced rejection and failure. He urged students to do what they love.
“People are going to try to distract you from your passions, from your dreams, and so I just hope that you don’t let that happen,” Harrelson said.
The conversation eventually turned to Harrelson’s thoughts on President Donald Trump, with whom Harrelson has had dinner,
“It was brutal... to sit there and have to endure the most narcissistic man I have ever met.” Harrelson continued, “I mean, he doesn’t care. He’s like, I’m talking about me and I’m not gonna stop talking about me until the end of the dinner. And then, halfway through it, I had to get up, walk outside and smoke a joint, just because.”
Harrelson also briefly commented on recent sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, calling the film producer  a “scumbag” and saying “I don’t think that’s indicative of Hollywood at-large.”
At the end of the talk at Kirkland, Emerson concluded: “Let me suggest that all the guests we’ve had since 2002, including the president of an African country, actors, Olympic gold medal winners, politicians, media, journalists, alike, this is the most honest conversation we’ve ever had.”
“In your case you infuse it with just excitement and the fact that you are so honestly candid and that makes all the difference to me.”

Questions over the taxation of multinational corporations are putting strain on the relationship between the United States and the European Union, experts said at a Center for European Studies event Wednesday.
This lecture follows a tax dispute between Apple and the European Union, which ensued last year after the EU required Ireland to go after the billions of euros in taxes that Apple had dodged through Irish subsidiaries. The EU argued that this amounted to illegal state aid, while the United States contended that the EU investigation could hurt Apple’s profits.
According to José Manuel Martínez Sierra, a faculty affiliate at the Center for European Studies, multinational corporations like Apple are posing new questions for entities that seek to regulate them.
“The traditional approach that it was really easy to tackle a frame or an individual person regardless of where they are living or located is not useful anymore, because of course they can have their headquarters in one country but they might have their social headquarters in a another country,” Sierra said.
The future of dialogue between the United States and the EU on tax issues has become more fraught in the wake of new international policies promoted by President Donald Trump’s administration, according to Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at the Law School.
“I think there is a lot of room for dialogue and for improving U.S. tax relations, but I’m not sure that the current administration is particularly interested in investing a lot of time and energy doing it,” Shay said.
Trump’s election coincided with the introduction of new EU tax reform policies, which João Félix Pinto Nogueira, the Adjunct Academic Chairman of IBFD, highlighted in his presentation. These policies take a firmer stance on taxation of multinational corporations like Apple, a step Nogueira said should involve both the EU and the United States.
However, the disconnect between the EU and United States is only widening, according to Sierra.
“That is where have the problem: that the big players, particularly the U.S., are not willing to commit to rules that will be fair enough for everybody,” Sierra said.
As tax policies continue to change with rising international integration, Sierra emphasized, “we need a global solution and not individual ones.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former white nationalist activist R. Derek Black and Kennedy School Professor Khalil G. Muhammad discussed how white nationalists have become more confident under President Donald Trump an Institute of Politics panel on Wednesday.
Elle Reeve, a correspondent for VICE News who led the website’s coverage of white nationalist protests in Charlottesville, moderated the discussion, which began with playing footage of the August protests.
Black condemned the ideology and spoke about his process of renouncing his former beliefs. He grew up in a white nationalist household—his father, Don Black, is a former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan—and said he had held white nationalist beliefs for most of his life. In Wednesday’s discussion, Black explained the realities of white nationalism and other racist ideologies.
Black attempted to highlight common misconceptions about the white nationalist movement, especially the misconception that most white nationalists are poor southerners.
“I think there’s this strange misconception that the white nationalist movement is a movement of impoverished people, or a trailer park movement,” he said. “It’s not a wealthy movement, it’s generally upper middle class people, lawyers or bankers, people who have jobs, and the ability to participate in something like this.”
He then discussed the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally, where neo-Nazi and white supremacist demonstrators clashed with counter protesters in an event that left many injured and one woman dead. Black said the protests were “crazier” and “more chaotic” than he anticipated.
“It spiralled much more than I had expected,” he said.
Muhammad, who studies history, race, and public policy, said he thought the protest marked a shift in people’s expectation of what a white nationalist looks like.
“I thought, these are everyday people who are animated by a kind of racism that is very much subterranean in the country,” Muhammad said. “On some level I was viscerally horrified by it, on another level I was strangely appreciative of being able to see the collapsing of the stereotypical image of a white supremacist.”
Black and Muhammad discussed origins of the modern white nationalist movement, as well as some of the tactics and ideas that Black had tried to spread while he was a prominent figure of the movement.
He discussed these strategies in the context of the Charlottesville protest, specifically arguing that President Donald Trump’s reaction to the event—in which he condemned “hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides” —as a win for white supremacists. He added that this group typically considers any publicity as good, and automatically assume that public officials will denounce them.
“The one thing that white nationalists are confident in, is that anybody in any position of power is going to condemn them. It’s so easy. Mayors, people who don’t have power, mosquito commissioners, will condemn the white nationalist rally because it’s just so easy,” Black said.
Black added that the Charlottesville rally made white nationalists more confident of their activism.
“If the point of Charlottesville was to show that they could have a big rally. The political climate now supported their message more now than it ever had, there’s nothing that could have been more encouraging than that,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Naomi Oreskes, professor of history of science and affiliated professor of earth and planetary sciences, discussed corporate efforts to intentionally spread false information about products throughout the twentieth century during a forum hosted by the Mahindra Center of Humanities on Wednesday evening.
Her lecture, titled “Giant Power: Technology, Energy, and the History of Post-Truth America,” marked the second year of the annual Environmental Forum. In 2010, Oreskes co-authored the book “Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming” on the same subject.
She argued that these corporations appealed to notions of free market capitalism and freedom to preserve deregulated industries.
“Who can possibly be against freedom?” Oreskes asked.
Oreskes focused on the example of the National Electric Light Association, which embarked on a public advertising campaign against the public provision of electricity in the 1930s. She added that NELA used several “front” organizations to fund a campaign to use the education system to promote values of free enterprise.
Oreskes claimed that NELA funded the alteration of syllabi taught in high schools and higher education institutions across the United States and paid textbook authors to update their books to indoctrinate the public against any sort of government regulation. She said “[NELA] pressured institutions to drop textbooks which they considered objectionable” adding that that terms such as “reasonable rates,” “public utility,” and “stock bordering” were terms that NELA sought to exclude.
“I think it is pretty obvious that there are awful lot of similarities to recent events,” Oreskes said, noting the resemblance between the NELA advertising campaign and the public relations company The Advancement of Sound Science Center, founded by cigarette-producer Philip Morris. She explained how both NELA and TASSC use the “merchant of doubt strategy” to sway public opinion.
Oreskes ended her lecture by stressing the importance of academia in drawing attention to such issues. She said that not enough academic research exists presently to counter the intentional spread of inaccurate information by corporations.
Eric D. Grunebaum ’84 said he was struck by Oreskes’s insightfulness: “I think that the fact that [Oreskes] is willing to say that there are objective facts and that there are not equivalences to both sides of every issue sets her apart.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students from schools across Harvard spent two hours debating the ideal qualities and priorities of the University’s next president at a forum hosted by the presidential search student advisory committee Wednesday evening.
Several students said they hope the successor to University President Drew G. Faust—who announced plans to step down over the summer—is a person of color. Others requested a 29th president who understands the definition of a “safe space.”
But the roughly 30 attendees spent the majority of the event, held in Boylston Hall, critiquing Harvard. Students denounced the University for items ranging from its recent decision to rescind a visiting fellowship for Chelsea Manning to its lack of a comprehensive ethnic studies program.
Members of the student advisory committee—the 18 graduates and undergraduates who will advise Harvard’s official presidential search committee—encouraged the critical conversation. At the beginning of the session, committee members distributed notecards and instructed attendees to write down ways they want the University to change, as well as things they want to stay the same.
The committee also used the forum to outline its ongoing projects and schedule. Members told the audience that, over the next few weeks, the group plans to host office hours at each of Harvard’s 12 degree-granting schools, hold “focus groups” across campus, and send an online survey to all students requesting input on the next president.
In the long-term, the committee plans to  compile and send a report to the official search committee, composed of all twelve members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers, according to committee chair and Law School student Jyoti Jasrasaria ’12. Jasrasaria said the group hopes to file its report by the end of 2017.
The student committee’s formation and slated role in this year’s presidential search marks the second time in recent history that students have formally helped seek a Harvard president. The 2006 search committee formed the first student advisory body after undergraduate outrage over their lack of involvement in the 2000 search.
Jasrasaria opened the forum Wednesday by reflecting on what she called the “historic” nature of the moment.
“We are the second-ever student advisory committee, and it’s the first time we’ve ever done an event like this in Harvard’s history,” Jasrasaria said, referring to the committee’s decision to hold a public town hall to gather student perspectives on the search.
She explained that the committee will broadly divide its work into four categories going forward: “Civic Engagement and Leadership,” “Teaching and Training,” “Diversity and Inclusion,” and “One Harvard.” One Harvard refers to a long-running administrative push to institutionalize collaboration across the University’s 12 schools.
Roughly midway through Wednesday’s meeting, committee members ceded the microphone and asked students to raise areas of concern in each of the four categories successively. As members busily scribbled notes, attendees canvassed a wide range of issues.
Many focused in particular on how Harvard treats its employees: They mentioned the 2016 dining workers’ strike and the ongoing battle over graduate student unionization as examples of where the University must do better.
The committee plans to start hosting focus groups on Oct. 24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Law School student government will conduct a mental health survey in early November as part of a broader effort to address mental health issues on campus.
Amanda Lee, the Law School student government vice president, said that University Health Services and the Law School’s Student Mental Health Association are also working on the survey. The Student Mental Health Association will also host a series of information sessions.
“The survey will focus kind of on three different topics: helping individual students diagnose incidents, and also measuring adequacy of services and whether they’re accessible or not on campus...and also the culture of mental health and stigma at the Law School,” Lee said.
The Law School survey follows a similar study conducted at Yale Law School in 2014. That survey revealed that 70 percent of the 296 students in the sample group struggled with mental health at some point during their time in law school. Of the 80 percent of these students that said they considered getting help, only 50 percent did.
While the data at Yale is indicative of mental illness concerns with many law students, Lee said the Law School’s larger size underscores the importance of collecting school-specific data.
“We wanted to have some baseline data for our community as well and Harvard’s quite different from a lot of schools because we’re just so large,” Lee said. “Having that information is really important for advocating for better services.”
Lee said that character and fitness questions on the Bar exam, the professional test for those entering the legal profession, often deter people from seeking mental health resources they might otherwise benefit from. The Student Mental Health Association’s president Terry M. Spinelli said the group is working to plan events about the Bar exam questions to give students more concrete information regarding the test’s expectations.
“People are afraid that either talking about their struggles with mental health issues, or creating a record of having sought treatment for mental health issues might then lead them to have to select answers on that portion of the Bar that will then make it difficult for them to pass, or even sit for the Bar,” Spinelli said.
Student Government is also partnering with Parody, a comedy musical production company at the Law School, to film a series of videos addressing mental health issues and resources on campus, according to Adrian D. Perkins, the president of the Law School’s student government. He also said he thinks that the legal profession faces significant mental health issues, even beyond law school.
“There’s a lot of literature and studies that have been done, especially in the corporate world, that people struggle with mental health when you think about the pressures of all the billable hours we have to meet and various factors,” Perkins said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden called it, “the battle of the unbeatens” will take place this Saturday at Berylson Field. The No. 13 Harvard field hockey team (10-3, 4-0 Ivy League) will take on No. 14 Princeton (8-6, 4-0) in a pivotal, high-stakes matchup of the Ancient Eight’s two remaining unbeaten teams.
Harvard is coming off a nail-biting 4-3 overtime victory against Cornell, in which freshman Mimi Tarrant scored twice, including the game-winner in overtime. Tarrant earned both Ivy League Player and Rookie of the Week honors for her performance. The first-year leads Ivy League freshmen in points with 22 (eight goals, six assists). Princeton is also entering the contest after a victory in its last contest, in which it defeated Northeastern, 3-0.
“We powered through and even though it wasn’t the prettiest hockey, we learned that we could still show such determination, and I think this game this weekend is going to be about who wants it more,” senior midfielder Hannah Wellington said. “We showed in the Cornell game that we can make that decision and that we can really power through a game and have that grit and determination through our play.”
Both Harvard and Princeton have topped Yale and Brown on the season. The Crimson also has secured victories over Penn and Cornell while the Tigers have bested Dartmouth and Columbia.
“We’ve built a lot of momentum as the season has gone on, so we’ve been excited after each game," senior goalkeeper Olivia Startup said. We know how important this game against Princeton is, and, if anything, that just makes it more exciting, regardless of all our results in the past.”
Last year, Harvard bested Princeton in a 3-2 overtime thriller. Then-sophomore Kathleen Young powered the Crimson offense, scoring two goals, including the game-winner just 59 seconds into overtime. Last year’s win snapped Harvard’s 22-game losing streak against Princeton, a streak that began in 1994. Young will be absent on the field in this year’s matchup after she tore her ACL against Brown earlier this season.
Although the Tigers boast a high-powered offensive attack, Harvard is focused on preparing for its own game to counteract Princeton.
“We call it double-defense, so you have one job, but you’re also there to help someone out if maybe they get beat or you’re going into a double team,” Wellington said. “It’s about selfless play and making sure you’re doing everything to not only help yourself do well but also help your teammates do their best job by aiding in every way you can. So, we’re definitely working on that and just making sure that we’re always doing our role, which is helping each other throughout the entire game.”
Both teams feature high-octane offenses. Princeton’s offense will be led by Ryan McCarthy, who has notched 12 goals on the season. The Crimson has scored at a torrid pace as well, averaging 4.1 goals per game on the year.
“We will be working hard in practice this week to come up with a plan to take away those threats and also be able to play our game as well,” van Herwaarden said. “These are two teams that are very evenly matched on a player-to-player basis, so I think coming up with a good, solid plan and making sure the small, little details fall more in our favor than in theirs will be the difference in the outcome.”
For Harvard to emerge victorious, all facets of the game must come together against the talented Tiger squad.
“If you look at our season so far, the majority of games, we’ve been able to find the goal fairly easy, which is great,” van Herwaarden said. “I think we’ve also shown that we are really capable of playing really good and solid defense. I think the combination of those two will have to be in place to get ourselves the best shot against a very good team. I think the team will be ready to reach their full potential to be ready for this game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, fans will descend upon Ivy League football stadiums in droves, filling every available seat and pushing the limits of the standing-room-only sections. Traffic will be a nightmare in Ithaca, Philadelphia, Hanover, and Cambridge as Ancient Eight supporters clog each and every road leading to the big games—alright, maybe not so much over in Ithaca.
Hours before the official start times, the tension and anticipation will be palpable. Tailgates will dominate the schools’ other athletic fields, and the smoke from the grills will blanket the surrounding areas. As the opening kickoffs sail through the air, the roar of the crowds will be heard for miles in every direction.
Maybe I’m hyperbolizing just a little bit. After all, this isn’t the SEC or the Big Ten. I guess we can only dream.
But why am I so fired up this week? Because it’s the start of the second half, baby. From here on out, only Ivy League matchups remain. Every game counts, and some teams will fight to stave off elimination starting this very weekend.
Here. We. Go.
YALE AT PENN
In the words of Markelle Fultz, Yale will be excited to head to (City) and face off against (Team Name) this Saturday.
The 76ers rookie muffed an Instagram post after being drafted first overall this past June, but he eventually corrected himself and made his appreciation for the city of Philadelphia known. Like Fultz, Yale will also appreciate a trip to the City of Brotherly Love. The Quakers have faltered the past three weeks, losing consecutive games to Dartmouth, Central Connecticut State, and Columbia.
The two Ivy defeats came in excruciating fashion. On the last play of the game against the Big Green, quarterback Jared Gerbino scored as time expired to secure the 16-13 victory for Dartmouth. A week after being doubled up by Central Connecticut State, 42-21, the Quakers took a red-hot Columbia squad to overtime when receiver Justin Watson caught a 17-yard touchdown pass. Penn even took the lead in overtime with a field goal, but on Columbia’s last-chance drive, quarterback Anders Hill tossed a 24-yard pass to secure the 34-31 win.
For all of Penn’s woes, Yale has had a polar opposite season. Most recently, the Bulldogs hosted Holy Cross and picked the Crusaders apart in a 32-0 drubbing.Yale has lost just once, and it was on one of Dartmouth’s miraculous nail-biter wins.
Look for Penn to lose a close league matchup once again.
Pick: Yale 24, Penn 21
COLUMBIA AT DARTMOUTH
Looking at this game from a football perspective, it’s hard to pick against either school. Columbia is a perfect 5-0, and it has defeated Ivy mainstays Princeton and Penn. Dartmouth also sits at 5-0 and 2-0 in the Ancient Eight, and it has defeated Penn and Yale.
The Lions do not have any outstanding rushers, but the combination of quarterback Anders Hill and receivers Ronald Smith II and Josh Wainwright give coach Al Bagnoli more than enough firepower. The Big Green has a more varied run game and receiving corps, with no true standout performers, but it still puts up 27.6 points per game.
However, using mascot logic, Dartmouth has this game in the books.
Dartmouth varsity sports’ nicknames are the Big Green, which I guess is supposed to represent that the entire region of New England is nothing but deciduous and coniferous north of Lowell, Mass. The Lions are, well, lions.
Lions are obviously more comfortable in warmer climates on the savannah. There is no possible, feasible way for a lion to defeat an entire forest. Advantage, Dartmouth.
Pick: Dartmouth 20, Columbia 17
BROWN AT CORNELL
Yikes.
Before the 2017 season started, few people (if any) had this game circled on their calendars. These two teams were projected to be bottom-feeders, and so far they have somewhat lived up to that reputation.
Brown’s first half has been rough to say the least. The Bears are being outscored by over 13 points per game on average. One major factor in this scoring disparity was last week’s rout at the hands of Princeton: the Tigers dominated Brown, 53-0, and held the Bears to just 170 yards.
However, Brown did beat Rhode Island, 24-21. Rhode Island upset the Crimson, 17-10, in week one. So is Brown technically better than Harvard by the transitive property?
The answer is no. But Cornell actually beat the Crimson head-to-head, and the Big Red has looked like an improved team over the past two weeks. Cornell is one of four Ivy teams tied at 1-1 in league record.
If this game disappoints in terms of quality football, at least Ithaca has good bagels. I am a huge proponent of halftime press box spreads, but when Harvard visited Cornell, the local bagel shop blew the Cornell buffet of subs and chips out of the water.
Pick: Cornell 34, Brown 10
PRINCETON AT HARVARD
Dartmouth’s bout with Columbia may be the main event this weekend, but this game will surely be the most entertaining.
Defensively, Harvard has the advantage. The entire defense has battled injuries, but recently key performers such as Charlie Walker, DJ Bailey, and Stone Hart have returned and have solidified the Crimson’s pass rush and run prevention, especially following a difficult loss to Cornell.
Offensively, look for Princeton to gain the edge. Quarterback Chad Kanoff is one of the best, if not the best, signal caller in the Ivy League, and he boasts a whopping 73.9 completion percentage. Running back Charlie Volker averages 94.8 yards per game on the ground.
Making this game all the more interesting, each team sits at 1-1 in conference play. Who will move up to 2-1, and who will suffer a crucial second defeat?
Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, has an affinity for shutting things down. For instance, in 2013 in a scandal known as “Bridgegate,” his staff was suspected to have shut down lanes on the George Washington Bridge to intentionally create traffic problems. Will Christie attempt to shut down Harvard’s running lanes in a similar fashion this weekend? Since the contest is in Massachusetts, far out of his grasp, I’ll bet on the Crimson.
Pick: Harvard 35, Princeton 34
