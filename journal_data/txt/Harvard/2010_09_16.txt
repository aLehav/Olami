After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Martin H. Peretz, the current editor-in-chief of The New Republic, recently generated a small media firestorm for comments he made in a Sept. 4 online editorial. Two particular sentences were the root of the controversy: “But, frankly, Muslim life is cheap, most notably to Muslims… So, yes, I wonder whether I need honor these people and pretend that they are worthy of the privileges of the First Amendment which I have in my gut the sense that they will abuse.” Peretz later issued an apology denouncing the extreme extent of his second sentence, but held that his assertion regarding the cheapness of Muslim life was valid.
Separate from this incident, Peretz’s family and friends have proposed to announce a new research fellowship in his name, stirring much debate. We strongly believe that Harvard should accept this research fund in Peretz’s name, for a number of reasons.
First, Peretz taught and studied at Harvard, and the university should welcome the donation, which would allow undergraduates to pursue academic research. As long as there is no discriminatory mechanism built into the research fund and everyone has equal access to it, the donor is of less importance than the educational opportunities it will promote.
Second, it is worth noting that Harvard has received donations from controversial figures in the past and used the money for good ends. For example, Taubman Hall at the Harvard Kennedy School was donated by a man who served 10 months in jail for anti-trust convictions. Moreover, Harvard named a professorship in Yiddish Literature for Martin Peretz in 1993—a professorship that we also believe should not be revoked.
Though we support the university accepting the fellowship, we do not support Peretz’s blog post. His statement that, “Muslim life is cheap, most notably to Muslims” is an oversimplification; his point may have begun with a kernel of truth but has been generalized to the point where it is not true. For this reason, we believe that Harvard should appropriately distance itself from Peretz’s controversial statements—denouncing them if need be. And we strongly condemn his original statement questioning whether Muslims are worthy of the First Amendment. The fact that he apologized is insufficient, especially because the apology came only after people responded angrily. Yet we feel strongly that Harvard can adequately separate the fellowship from his comments, resulting in a fellowship that will help students.
Lots of good can come from this donation, however controversial the figure behind it may be. It would be a shame to discount Peretz’s entire body of work and intellectual contributions due to two unfortunate sentences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an incendiary blog post earlier this month, Martin H. Peretz, editor-in-chief of The New Republic, wrote that “Frankly, Muslim life is cheap, most notably to Muslims.” He further questioned whether Muslim-Americans deserve the “privileges of the First Amendment.” Peretz has been criticized, most notably by Nicholas D. Kristof ’82, for his willingness to promote crude stereotypes and anti-Muslim sentiments.
This controversy has erupted at the same time that Harvard University is planning to create the “Martin Peretz Undergraduate Research Fund,” endowed by his friends and colleagues. On Sept. 25, the university will honor Peretz, a former Harvard lecturer. Some commentators have suggested that Harvard should not laud Peretz in light of his recent comments. They are correct; the university must lend a strong voice of opposition to Peretz’s remarks by requiring that the research fund be named after somebody else.
This situation calls to mind earlier controversies regarding public figures who have made bigoted comments. In 1987, Al Campanis, then general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, remarked on Nightline that African-Americans lack “the necessities to be…a field manager or a general manager.” At a 2005 academic conference, former Harvard president Lawrence H. Summers notoriously suggested that women might lack innate ability in science and mathematics.
In both cases, the national media roundly vilified the subject for his comments. Despite rapid apologies, both men were forced to resign from their positions. Peretz’s blog post is equally offensive; the fact that he has not faced a comparable media firestorm reflects the current anti-Muslim hysteria in America. But Harvard, as a global center of tolerance and knowledge, should look to the Campanis and Summers controversies as a guide to its response.
Peretz’s supporters claim that his blog post was misguided and does not reflect his true opinions. But those who wish to give Peretz a “mulligan” forget that this is far from the first time he has publicly expressed disdain for Muslims. He has called Arab society “hidebound and backward,” and described Arabs as “murderous and grotesque.” He has even suggested that American Muslims are supporters of Hezbollah. This established pattern of racist remarks makes his recent half-hearted “apology,” in which he actually affirms his prior statement about the low value of Muslim life, ring rather hollow. One could easily imagine Peretz making similar offensive public comments again in the future.
At a time when Muslims’ right to build a community center is questioned and a delusional “pastor” can become a national figure for threatening to torch Korans, Harvard has a responsibility to promote tolerance and dissociate itself from those who do not share its laudable values. The university should condemn Peretz’s remark and request that his friends name the fund in a different person’s honor. Should they refuse, as is likely, Harvard should turn down the donation. Harvard sets the highest standards for its students; it should do the same for its benefactors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whenever someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, what I wanted to study in college, or now what I want to do after I graduate, my only reply was “I have no idea.” I came to Harvard fully expecting to have an “a-ha” moment, one of those times when you discover something you’re truly passionate about or your calling in life. My relatives, teachers, and guidance counselors all assured me that this would be the case. Every career day and academic panel I attended seemed to reinforce this notion. People tell stories left and right about their own a-ha moments. There is the environmental lawyer who grew up next to wetlands. He used to explore them every weekend with his father until they were destroyed to make room for a shopping mall. Don’t forget the English professor who felt so accomplished after working her way through “Ulysses” that she is now dedicated to the study of literature.
When I bring up the uncertainty of my future career, many times people will attempt to diffuse my concern by emphasizing the unpredictable nature of their own moments of realization. Maybe the anthropologist spent his entire childhood doing math problems for fun, but one National Geographic television special he watched in college completely changed his plans, alerting him to previously dormant passions that he is now pursuing whole-heartedly.
With each passing year, I became more certain that my moment was right around the corner. Surely tomorrow I would rescue a turtle from the middle of the road, look deep into its eyes, and dedicate the rest of my life to my budding career as a reptilian veterinarian on the spot. Unfortunately, my life is still largely turtle-free.
At the start of this school year, however, I did come to a realization. Maybe I will just never have one of those moments that I’ve heard described so fondly, where my entire future trajectory is decided in an instant. Our vocations don’t have to be the product of overpowering and instantaneous emotions; it is not disingenuous or disappointing to over time make rational career choices that are based on careful consideration and self-reflection.
Additionally, if we take time to analyze the different reasons we like certain classes or hobbies rather than waiting for one of those “moments,” we can come to smaller understandings that will then help guide our lives. And these realizations are every bit as valuable as that of the math aficionado watching that life-changing National Geographic program. Of course we should always be open to new passions as they materialize, but we shouldn’t allow them to restrict us by giving them so much weight.
By this token, I’ve now had my a-ha moment in that I have realized I need to stop waiting for one. We should all have faith in our ability to make rational decisions when the time comes to steer our futures.
And if at the end of this process it turns out that practicing medicine on reptiles is my true calling, then so be it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am pleased to say that science and cooking are coming ever closer together.
To that end, the joint effort by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Alícia Foundation to create a course “Science of the Physical Universe 27: Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter” is a crucial step forward.
By uniting some of the world’s most creative chefs with one of the world’s leading research and teaching universities, we are building a bridge to connect the culinary arts with the liberal arts.
Not so long ago, the fields of science and cooking were largely unrelated. Even though cooking is essentially a technological activity, the majority of chefs have shown little desire to use scientific knowledge to enhance culinary creativity. In the past decade in particular, however, that has begun to change.
Members of the culinary world have demonstrated a growing interest in deepening the knowledge base of their profession. To do so, cooks have integrated research methods similar to what scientists rely on in the laboratory as a key element to help advance cuisine.
Such an approach has helped to spur a creative revolution in cooking, from the introduction of foams to the use of encapsulation. For example, in my native Catalan, the marriage of haute cuisine and modern science has played a critical role in fostering culinary research and innovation. This has led to the region’s growing international reputation as an epicenter for next generation cooking. It is not by luck alone that six of the chefs who are guest lecturers in the course are from Catalan.
Of course, recent breakthroughs in preparing food, stemming from all parts of the world, should not be limited just to trained chefs or to high-end restaurants. Traditional cooking also needs the support of scientific knowledge so that any home cook can better understand, and thus, better master techniques and processes. In other words, research and knowledge can be translated to the everyday kitchen, ensuring that indispensable culinary classics will be preserved—with the necessary precision and delicacy—and continue to be an essential part of our food heritage.
In fact, in 2006, as part of a synthesis of our cooking techniques at elBulli, we stated: “As has happened throughout history in the majority of the stages of human evolution, the new technologies act as a support for the progress of cookery.” And by that, we mean all types of cooking by all types of people.
It turns out that food and cooking are fantastic tools to help disseminate knowledge to a broad audience. Many scientific phenomena are extraordinarily difficult to explain. From the phases of matter to viscosity to the nature of gels and emulsions, cooking has shown itself to be a fantastic vehicle for illuminating tough concepts. As nearly 700 students lined up for a chance to take the new course—an applied physics course, mind you—I think we have proved our point.
Moreover, there are now new works that explain cooking in scientific terms, such as the “Scientific and Gastronomic Lexicon” (published by Alícia Foundation and elBullitaller). The ultimate aim is to make the principles of science more accessible to cooks. Getting out of the kitchen now and again may be the best possible advice for aspiring and established chefs.
This brings to mind another point in our manifesto: “Knowledge and/or collaboration with experts in the different fields (gastronomic culture, history, industrial design, etc.) is of prime importance for the advancement of cookery. In particular, cooperation with the food industry and science has provided a fundamental boost. The sharing of knowledge among professional chefs has contributed to this development.”
The Alícia Foundation set up a research center devoted to doing just this: promoting technological innovation in food and cooking. Cooks and research scientists work side-by-side developing culinary knowledge with exacting precision.
The fruits from this relationship have been many. I was awarded the degree honoris causa from the University of Barcelona through their Chemistry School. I also received the degree honoris causa from the Technical University of Valencia, among others. The awards are less about my own accomplishments and more about how cooking is increasingly viewed in a similar light to traditional academic fields, rather than simply as a trade.
I consider the course a natural next step in the extension of our practical cooking philosophy. The ingredients—both the literal and metaphoric ones—we work with in the kitchen will now be taken into Harvard’s classrooms. And from there, I hope that we can tackle issues such sustainability and world hunger and find other ways that culinary science can help improve our society.
Sept. 7, the first day of the course, was a very special day for me and for my calling. It marks a true “before and after moment” in the evolution of cooking.
Ultimately, my fellow chefs and I all feel privileged to be part of such an extraordinary educational opportunity. While we are in awe of teaching at Harvard, we are thrilled to share what we know with all of you.
Ferran Adrià is the Chef at elBulli and President of the Advisory Board of Alícia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few things get Harvard students riled up quite like discussions about final clubs. Every year it seems—especially in the fall—the inevitable debates come around again: whether they are good or bad, whether they are exclusive bastions of privilege left over from another time, or whether they are necessary component of Harvard’s limited social scene.
Most recently, the idea of creating more “openness” in the final clubs and similar organizations has taken center stage. Last spring, the Hasty Pudding Club held its first semi-open punch and former Crimson editorial chair Daniel E. Herz-Roiphe ’10 wrote a much-talked-about Fifteen Minutes Scrutiny on why Harvard’s all-male clubs should move toward gender equality and go co-ed. This fall, the Bee Club, an all-female final club, announced that it would be conducting a new punch process in which invitees would be allowed to bring one friend to punch events with them, ostensibly to widen the net of potential new club members.
These moves toward what could be termed “inclusivity” are a baffling development when you consider that the idea of a social club is inherently exclusive any way you look at it. In fact, efforts to democratize the punch process or diversify the membership of social clubs are a perversion of the clubs’ purpose.
Of course, the obvious counterargument is that Harvard itself used to function like a macro version of a final club, an institution that was the preserve of rich, well-connected men of Anglo-Saxon stock. If Harvard is so much better for its increased socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, why shouldn’t social clubs take a step in that direction as well?
For one thing, Harvard has a higher purpose—education—and if it is still “exclusive” today, it is because there are vastly more qualified high school seniors who want to partake of Harvard’s impressive resources than the institution can support.
Similarly, there are plenty of other organizations at Harvard that could be termed “exclusive” in some sense. Most publications require new members to go through a “comp” process, and advanced Russian skills might make one feel more comfortable at a Russian Club meeting. However, these organizations are distinct from final clubs because their members share common interests or a common purpose.
As far as I can tell, neither male nor female final clubs are defined by any common interest—unless it’s being male or being female. If nothing else then, exclusivity is what makes final clubs what they are. And exclusivity is what separates final clubs from sororities and fraternities. No one that I know from high school has ever gone through rush without getting a bid, though it may not have been from his or her first-choice group.
This is by no means an attack on final clubs, nor is it a judgment on final clubs for being exclusive or elitist. I would merely say that final club members tend to come from similar social circles, and that allowing punches to bring friends to punch events or allowing women who already frequent male final club parties to become members doesn’t really change anything.
I do not pretend to know anything about how final clubs go about selecting new members, but I would guess that it is a mix of personality, connections, and luck that separates the invitees from the rejected. The result is that there are many great people who are in final clubs and many who aren’t. Unless the entire school gets punched into these clubs, I expect that this will always be the case. Final club members should therefore just enjoy their good fortune and stop pretending that the minor reforms they make are steps toward the advancement of civil rights.

Satisfying a nagging addiction to homemade pasta after your summer in Tuscany, pursuing a passion for fresh goat cheese after working on a farm in Alaska, or satiating a craving for stone-ground chocolate after a month in Guatemala—interesting food experiences don’t have to end when summer does. With three local farmers markets to choose from, all three of these foods—and a wide variety of other fresh, locally produced products—are within walking distance of any Harvard dorm.
In addition to the two Harvard-run farmers markets—the Tuesday market outside the Science Center and the Allston market by the football stadium—locals and members of the Harvard community also have a third option: The Charles Square Farmers Market, which operates on Fridays and Sundays outside the Charles Hotel.
“It’s a societal piece we’ve been missing,” says farmer Andy H. Pollock, who harvests and sells his own produce from Silverbrook Farms in Dartmouth, Mass. “For 10,000 years, markets have been where you meet your community and exchange information.”
And as these three local markets show, farmers markets are indeed just as much about embodying and enriching their specific neighborhoods as they are about selling produce and crafts. Here’s FM’s roundup of your fresh local food destinations:
Allston Market
Every Friday, the Allston market transforms a vacant parking lot beyond the stadium from a colorless asphalt surface into a virtual country fair ground. From June to October, the market features fresh produce, baked goods, coffee, tea, pasta, soap, herbs, flowers, and hot sauce. With the most space of the three, the market is also able to host live music performances, set up tables with free samples, and host community events including scavenger hunts for children and food demos for senior citizens.
Robert F. Breslin, a n Allston resident, laments the brevity of the farmers market season, truncated by the arrival of inhospitable and persistent Massachusetts winters. “I can shop here without turning on the car, and it gets me experimenting,” he says. “I’ll buy things like striped pasta and blue potatoes that I’ve never heard of before.”
Harvard Market
While the Allston market primarily serves members of the Allston community, the business school, and the athletics department, the Harvard market is mostly frequented by the wider Harvard community. According to Dara B. Olmsted ’00, manager of the Allston and Harvard markets and project coordinator for Harvard’s Food Literacy Project, the Harvard market sees more circulation because of its location just outside the northern gates of Harvard Yard. Students, staff, faculty, and locals can pass through and buy fresh produce, cheese, eggs, chocolate, crafts, flowers, and fresh fish.
“The markets bring the community together,” says Olmsted. “You can meet the farmers—the same farmers who supply the dining hall with local produce—and ask them about the squash you’re buying.”
As part of the Food Literacy Project’s mission to educate the Harvard community on food, the Tuesday market also features cooking demonstrations by professional chefs every week at 12:30 pm, including a yearly demonstration by famed chef Mollie Katzen.
Charles Square Market
For herbs, pastries, jams, crafts, pickles, pies, chocolate, and of course, fresh produce, check out the Charles Square market. Roger P. Allan, who owns and runs a “one man farm” in West Brookfield, Mass., explains that the products he sells at the Charles Square market have been picked either the morning of the market or the night before. “People come for the quality. The taste is so much different,” he says. “It’s all organic, it’s a lot of work, and I love doing it.”
According to Amanda R. Mallen, who runs the Taza Chocolate stand at several local markets, the Charles Square market is set apart from its neighbors by the demand it sees for specialty products. “Because of the location, we get a lot of leisurely tourists looking for gifts, guests at the hotel, or people from the neighborhood who are entertaining and want something special,” she says.
Mallen has observed that because of the importance of their surrounding neighborhoods, each market tends to reflect different social and economic realities. At the other location for the Taza Chocolate stand in Central Square, the market is more produce-based, and Mallen sees a more frequent usage of food stamps.
Bordering the low-income Charles View apartments, the Allston market also accepts food stamps through a program called Boston Bounty Bucks, cosponsored by the city of Boston and the Food Project based in Boston, which allows participants to get half off their purchase of up to $20 made at Boston farmers markets.
“It’s incentive for people to come who are out of the habit. You don’t find health food in low-income neighborhoods; you find lots of fast food restaurants,” says Campbell Watts, director of community programs at the Food Project. “If we can build the habit of eating healthy, fresh food, then stores in the area will be more likely to follow,”

At Harvard, competition is cutthroat, but lotteries are bloodbaths.
Promising an all-star roster of guest speakers that reinvented cooking, Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science” was a class that could exist only at Harvard. While deep pockets and institutional clout drew the talent to fuel the intellectual burners—including world-renowned chefs Ferran Adrià and José Andrés—only pure chance would fill Science Center C’s 300 seats.
No senior standing. No preference for students looking to fulfill a General Education requirement. And no special treatment for food bloggers. Any one of those would’ve helped me.
And with 700 students vying for 300 spots, I already felt that I’d be barred from the class. The lottery was random. My unbridled, self-serving agony wasn’t.
After I attended three brilliant lectures, the supposedly random number generator put me on the waitlist. I immediately interpreted it as a rejection.
So far, I’ve been rejected from a female social club, a nonfiction creative writing class (twice), an Anthropology reading seminar, two blocking groups, and various final clubs parties. And like everyone else seeking a future after Harvard, I’ve fumbled interviews, seen e-mails bounce back, and checked my voice mail to find calls unanswered.
Now I was in the “top third” of the list of outsiders. I thought back to lectures I had attended, barely holding my anxiety in check. With culinary rock star Ferran Adrià (responsible for the rise of molecular gastronomy) and food science writer Harold McGee teaching, the line began forming an hour beforehand. This at a school where everyone is proudly seven minutes late to everything. Ferran spoke in his native Catalan about cooking from a theoretical angle, asking us to rethink water and the experience of eating itself. Then, with the help of some assistants, he used solutions of calcium chloride and alginate to turn olive oil into a sphere with transparent jellied skin. The audience broke into gasps, then applause.
The chosen few would not have to settle for mere lectures, either; they would be immersed in a culinary world. In labs, they would concoct noodles made entirely of shrimp and apply science chops to molten chocolate cake. And this year’s precise lineup—which encompassed wd~50’s Wylie Dufresne and mini bar’s José Andrés—wasn’t easily replicated.
I wasn’t alone. Almost all of my friends and members of the Harvard Culinary Society also were waitlisted or flat out rejected. Running the Culinary Society means that I’m lucky enough to work with some of the most passionate student chefs and eaters on campus. People who had cooked professionally, attended culinary school in Italy, and brewed their own beer in student kitchens. They were hardcore, and many were seniors who wouldn’t have the opportunity again.
This entirely impersonal rejection made me think about Harvard’s many gatekeepers. The school is like an exclusive club containing a million smaller, more exclusive clubs—a world that thrives on its own inaccessibility. Still, people will generally accept a grueling application process. The judges are human, sure, but more frightening than low acceptance rates is open enrollment.
This process, in contrast, was infuriatingly impersonal. There was no judge—professional or social—only a random number generator.  And perhaps that was my lucky break. Because 24 hours after my first rejection, I got an e-mail the next night telling me, equally impersonally, that I had been taken off the waitlist. Several of my friends had as well.
So that’s how I found myself fumbling SPU 27’s first lab experiment with a pressure cooker and six egg custards. By the raising the pressure, I was allowing the food to cook faster at higher temperatures. The science was simple. My path there had been simple. And strangely, I was sad that for once, my entry hadn’t depended on impressing a biased and flawed judge.

Most people are a little uncertain of what to expect when they enter the Garage and approach the colorful counter of Chutney’s—the more exotic replacement for Flat Patties. In a Square fast-food scene long dominated by pizza and burritos, the concept of Indian food to-go is rather novel. But for those who don’t know their vindaloo from their palak paneer, the friendly staff will gladly offer samples and explanations to aid in the selection process.
Take away the South Asian substance, and Chutney’s looks just like the average Qdoba or Chipotle. Customers choose their bread or wrap from options like naan and paratha, which is like a burrito wrap. Possible fillings include tofu, chicken, lamb, and vegetables. Finally, customers pick from a range of intriguing sauces, with flavors like mango, pineapple, mint, and yogurt. And if you’re still in doubt about Chutney’s cred as a fast-food venue, check out the value meal, which includes two additional samosas or momos and a fountain drink.
Despite the deviations from a more authentic, traditional Indian cuisine (they don’t actually serve anything called a “nanini” in India, and momos are technically more Tibetan), the food is fresh and includes a lot of the spicy flavors for which Indian food is known. Chutney’s also offers several authentic Indian drinks like lassi, chai, and a soda called Thums Up, which received a mention in Elizabeth Gilbert’s “Eat Pray Love.”
It looks like Chutney’s might just be the next “it” place for Harvard students to grab a quick meal. Manager Ujjwal Dhaubhadel calls his style “kind of a mix-and-match.” The eclectic offerings seem to be meeting an unanswered demand—as one customer comments, “I can only eat Subway for so many days.”

When home, lunch is a comfortable, casual, well-rehearsed affair. I walk the carpeted hall to my kitchen, open the fridge door, and pull out some pre-sliced turkey, pre-sliced cheese, the jar of honey mustard, and maybe some grapes if I’m in the mood. In a few minutes, when the goods have been added to a base of whole wheat bread, I have a sandwich.
A friend’s mom likes to look at people’s cereal collections because she thinks it says something about the family—those with Lucky Charms tend to be a different sort from those who have only All Bran. Those with both have strong faith in their self-control.
But at school, kitchens and food sources are no longer personal. I don’t have a fridge; I have a dining hall, which, though lovely, isn’t quite as known or as inherently mine as the kitchen that stocked my baby food. And there is something about the predictable quality of my kitchen and the fridge’s contents that I miss.
On Tuesday, I missed it especially. Having allotted too little time to get from my room to Maxwell Dworkin to shop a class, I decided to forgo lunch. But when I got there, I was so hungry; hungry with the sort of hunger that would have prevented my absorbing anything Daniel Schrag, one of Obama’s climate change experts, was about to teach. So instead of moseying in to claim a seat, I entered a personal relay race—I passed my bag to a friend also heading to the lecture and ran toward a white truck pulled up to the curb. It smelled like the perfect grease of lo mein.
Generally the idea of Chinese food cooked on wheels would gross me out, but I was hungry and the food was there so I got in line. A few minutes later—enough later to have undermined my attempt at timeliness—I was handed a plastic bag containing a plastic fork, a Styrofoam box, and 50 cents in change. With that I ran to class.
In some lectures, eating can be a stealthy act. Kids or desks or chairs block the food from the professor’s direct line of vision, and multiple open containers can mask the direction of the food-smell’s origin. But not this class. It was silent, seats were evenly spaced, and the professor, to his credit, made nearly invasive eye contact with everyone in the lecture hall. It was no place to open up a container of chicken teriyaki. As such, my food sat uneaten, and I sat thinking about it.
Until I left the class. I walked out of the lecture to sit alone on a red bench in Maxwell Dworkin’s hallway in order to eat cold skewers of chicken teriyaki from a Styrofoam container. I had not yet seen the food, and when I opened the perspiring lid, I was less than pleased with my purchase. The chicken looked like it had been painted brown, and the veggies were of dubious freshness; they reminded me more of the Styrofoam box than of something that grows from the ground.
But within minutes, the chicken was gone, the rice deemed unworthy of its caloric value and my grumbling stomach quieted. I went on with my day and didn’t think about the unpleasant lunch again. Which is good, because it was just lunch.
But that is not to say that all eating experiences on campus need to be sweaty Chinese food from a truck, or refried beans in a pewter pot, or yesterday’s leftovers plus tofu, all stir-fried. Food here can be good.
The day after my Chinese food experience was Rosh Hashana—the Jewish New Year. While services are one feature of the day, another tradition is for celebrators to eat apples and honey in hopes for sweetness in the coming year. At home, the day involves sitting around a big wooden table with family. On campus, it involves a less formal but equally thoughtful gathering. A smattering of girls in Harvard’s middle years met by Leverett just after sunset and walked to the river. We first tried sitting on the steps of Weeks Footbridge but realized that like we, the bugs had been drawn to the light. We moved to the grass, and around a flowery sheet-turned-picnic-blanket/cutting-board, we sliced apples.
As is tradition, we each grabbed a piece, squeezed on some plastic-bear honey, and went around the circle and stated our goals for the coming year—timely, because even though the Jewish New Year may be abstract, the beginning of a new academic year is quite immediate.
That meal, which wasn’t even a meal, could not have been more different from my solitary Chinese food lunch. This time, I sat in a circle with friends, some in dresses, some in shorts and t-shirts, and me in my gym clothes, along the Charles just after sunset. We were all totally comfortable there, partaking in a tradition that we knew well. The Chinese food meal had been one of convenience and necessity, but the apples and honey were about more, and they were much sweeter because of it.

While kids may not read Confucius or Kant, according to a study of child vegetarians, they are still quite capable of making ethical decisions. According to Paul L. Harris, a professor at the Graduate School of Education, children from meat-eating homes who choose to go vegetarian do so on moral grounds.
Harris explained that participants, who ranged from 6 to 12 years old, cited concerns related to animal welfare as reasons for their vegetarianism, and that TV shows and movies such as “Finding Nemo” didn’t really influence their decisions.
“My impression was that, for whatever reason, they were less likely to compartmentalize their knowledge and feelings about animals and animal well-being and suffering from what you could put on their plate,” Harris said.
Margaret E. Crane ’14, who has been a vegetarian since the age of 7 and is a member of Vegitas, Harvard College’s vegetarian society, echoes the sentiment of the study’s participants.
“I didn’t think it was right to eat animals for my own enjoyment,” she said. “When I eat a hamburger, I think of a cow. Most people think of it as meat.”
What most surprised Harris was that although the children he studied were basing their decisions on the rights of animals, they were not judgmental of other meat-eaters.
“I expected these children to be more evangelical or zealous in their attitudes,” he said.
Of course, there are exceptions to these tendencies.
Mary C. Davies ’13, another Vegitas member who has been a vegetarian since she was 3 or 4, said that she first stopped eating meat simply because she didn’t like the taste or texture of it.
“It really was just a habit,” she said. “When I got older I started thinking more critically about it.”

Jonathan Safran Foer, the critically acclaimed author of “Everything is Illuminated” and “Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close” has turned his creative eye to a radically different subject—vegetarianism. Safran Foer has said that his interest in the topic was sparked by the birth of his child, and being confronted with how he wanted to raise him. Safran Foer visited Harvard on Tuesday to give a speech about his new book, “Eating Animals.” The author spoke with FM about his influences, the meat dish he misses most, and the most important lesson he learned from Joyce Carol Oates.
1.
Fifteen Minutes: Your newest book is a work of nonfiction. What do you think it has in common with your first two novels, if anything?
Jonathan Safran Foer: They have similar concerns in a certain way, like what is passed along, what we do with where we come from. But in more ways they’re different. The novels have nowhere to go, they are done for their own sake. I just felt like I was pursuing my imagination. With this book, I was referring to the world, and I was always concerned by a certain kind of story that I was telling. I knew what I was going to be working on.
2.
FM: Your books tend to be highly personal and emotional. How would you describe the experience of writing the book?
JSF: Not emotional. It was very personal, but to me it was more analytical. It was trying to find a way to take a huge amount of information and make it accessible, digestible, and persuasive.
3.
FM: Could you imagine “Eating Animals” being turned into a movie à la “An Inconvenient Truth”?
JSF: I guess so. I don’t know. It seems like it lends itself in a lot of ways. In certain ways, images can be more powerful than words. They can also be almost impossible to look at.
4.
FM: What do you view as the biggest challenge facing vegetarians?
JSF: I guess I would say its consistency, which I don’t even think is necessarily the greatest goal. We’d be much better to think of ourselves as people who try to reduce meat as much as possible, and maybe down to zero.
5.
FM: Your concerns about eating meat seem to be primarily environmental. However, many vegetarians forgo meat for ethical reasons. Do you think the two are mutually exclusive or not?
JSF: There are a lot of different reasons not to eat meat. I’ve never heard of a reason to eat it. I’ve never heard anyone say here’s why you should eat more factory-farmed meat. You can approach it from environmental reasons, from animal rights reasons...and all of those lead to the same conclusion—that this is a very destructive and broken system.
6.
FM: What cultural factors do you think are working in favor of vegetarianism?
JSF: 18 percent of college students describe themselves as vegetarians. There are more vegetarians than Catholics in college. In college campuses, it is so unremarkable to be a vegetarian. It’s a kind of aspirational identity. That’s the reason to be most hopeful.
7.
FM: Which type of meat or non-vegetarian dish do you miss the most?
JSF: Sushi. That’s pretty easy to answer.
8.
FM: What is your favorite meat substitute or meat-free dish?
JSF: I don’t really get into meat substitutes all that much. In terms of a meat-free dish, there are a million things. It depends on what kind of mood I’m in. There are certain times I would trade everything for a bowl of popcorn. Food requires context. My favorite food when I’m eating with my son is different than my favorite food when I’m eating in a hotel room, which is different than my favorite food when I’m celebrating the Fourth of July with friends. It’s very difficult to remove food from context.
9.
FM: One of the reasons you thought seriously about vegetarianism was the birth of your children. How would you feel if 15 years from now your children decided to begin eating meat?
JSF: It depends on what kind of world we’re living in at that point. Maybe the world will have changed, and there will be no factory farming and it will all be small farms. My goal is not to have them reach the same conclusions that I have, but to act on their values. They will be their own people. I’m not going to impose my ideas on them.
10.
FM: You’ve spoken out about the Kosher Certification process. What was your biggest objection, and how has your criticism been received?
JSF: Who disagrees that we need a better system? It’s been very well-documented, and Agriproccessors, the biggest company, has gone out of business, though for other reasons. I did a video, “If This Is Kosher,” and it’s on YouTube, and I can’t imagine anyone thinking it’s wrong. I have heard from a lot of rabbis asking how we can find an alternative.
11.
FM: Being Jewish has had a profound influence on your writing. In what way do you think Judaism influences your position on vegetarianism?
JSF: I think not much actually. Maybe not at all. I think they are values that most Americans share. 96 percent of Americans think that animals deserve legal protection. And it’s hard to think of anything that 96 percent of Americans would agree on. I don’t think being Jewish or Christian or atheist, black or white, old or young, matters.
12.
FM: You’re only 33, but your career has already been incredibly successful. Where do you see yourself in another 15 years? Will you still be writing?
JSF: I have no idea. I don’t think I would have known I would be writing 15 years ago. Really, I just don’t know, and I don’t like making predictions because it’s nice to be surprised.
13.
FM: While you were an undergrad at Princeton, you took your first creative writing class. What was the most valuable lesson you learned?
JSF: Joyce Carol Oates was a professor of mine and she had said that the most important quality for a writer was “energy,” and I thought that that turned out to be very true. Energy on the sentence level, the paragraph level, the book level, between books...It’s an exhausting thing to face a blank page day after day. More than any technical thing or question of craft, I think that was the most important thing.
14.
FM: What advice would you have for aspiring Harvard authors?
JSF: I don’t think I would offer any. Everyone does it his own way or her own way. I don’t know anything that they don’t know.
15.
FM: Any chance you could be convinced to teach a creative writing course at Harvard, as you have at Yale and NYU?
JSF: They wouldn’t even take me as a student. It’s true!

The school year is back in full swing, and that means one thing: cheap alcohol. And while you’re free to drink away the glory days of college with Natty and Banker’s, you might start yearning for something...different. Something better, but just as economic. So here’s FM’s guide to the best booze you may or may not have heard of, most costing less than a scorp bowl.
Beer
Vodka
Bitch Drink
Gin
Rum
Red Wine
White Wine
Champagne
Sections
For this one, FM is buying fresh, buying local. The box declares, “If you’re not drinking Narragansett beer, you’re not from New England.” And with that in-your-face Ocean State attitude comes a load of actual, rich flavor in what can only be described as the Hyundai Sonata of beer. Also, don’t forget to refer to it as just ’Gansett, unless you like being told to go back to New York.

Cheap vodka generally smells more like paint stripper than something you would willfully allow into your body. Not the case with The Wolf. The taste is surprisingly smooth, making shots less than dreadful. Freshmen, pour out that Rubinoff (or put it with your other household cleaners), and give your taste buds a treat.

Seagram’s is the brand that had Bruce Willis drunkenly crooning, “It’s wet and it’s dry,” on ’80s TV commercials.  It’s certainly wet, deliciously so. But we think it’s the second component that matters most. To quote a certain YouTube starlet, “How dry do you want it?” When you pour a nice cup of tonic, Seagram’s makes it so dry for you. It’ll be like a desert in your mouth. Now how much teeth do you like?

This royal rum-ble wasn’t much of a contest, with Burnett’s the clear winner. Brugal was, frankly, brutal. Pending chemical analysis, we suspect that Brugal may actually be Rubinoff with Pine-Sol in it.  Or Pine-Sol with Rubinoff in it. Drinking Brugal is like waking up next to the person that Brugal brought you to bed with, and then doing Brugal body shots off of their Brugal-sticky chest. Brugal.

. . . del Piani Penuzzo Montebruno d’Abrazzi Regazzi Allontanata San Gimignano Amalfi.  Long name, short aftertaste; this cheap wine is the Roman equivalent of a trip to Siena for the Palio, stopping to see the David, the aesthetic beauty of the Pietà, and the coldness factor of a free Tuscan fountain, on a wine tour, in the country. Full-bodied, decently fruity, nice and pretentious.

La Fiera is light, aromatic, and the ring name of Arturo Hernández, the 1981 NWA Welterweight Champion luchador and son of the wrestler known as “The Hercules from Pueblo”.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three former White House spokespersons recounted their experiences at the center of the media frenzy surrounding presidents and their families at the Institute of Politics last night.
In a discussion moderated by Harvard Kennedy School Professor David R. Gergen, the three spokespersons—whose tenures in the White House ranged from the beginning of the Clinton administration to this August—agreed that the Internet fundamentally changed the news cycle.
Dee Dee Myers, former President Bill Clinton’s press secretary from 1993 to 1994, lamented the end of the news cycle with the rise of the Internet and, along with it, the constant chatter of the blogosphere.
“When the daily papers went to bed the news cycle would end,” she said, describing her time managing media relations for the Oval Office. “Now, there is no news cycle...It is completely trivializing. It’s ADD.”
But Ari Fleischer, who worked for former President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2003, disagreed with Myers about the negative impact of technological advancements. Even though “the technology moved at light speed,” Fleischer said, the president could still influence Congress to pass his legislative priorities.
The three press officers also discussed dealing with immediate media concerns as compared to promoting a press strategy with a longer time horizon, and various administrations’ approaches to this balance.
Camille Johnston, Michelle Obama’s Director of Communications from 2009 to this August, explained the distinction between the long term and the short term in Obama’s White House and described them as “two very separate processes” discussed in different meetings.
“The long term planning is a luxury on the West Wing side of things. It is done on an entirely separate track,” she said. “There’s so much going on, you can only have an impact on certain things.”
Myers said she admired the Obama campaign’s willingness to think about the longer-term goals, sometimes at the expense of winning the daily news cycle—unlike the Clinton administration’s approach.
“I think in the Clinton White House, we got in to too much of trying to win the news cycle at the expense of longer-term goals,” Myers said.
But the demands of the shortened news cycle and the need to “put out fires,” as Fleischer described the daily crisis management process, made it near-impossible for the press secretary to think about long-term concerns—which fell instead under the purview of the communications director and other top aides.
“As press secretary, my definition of long term was getting through today,” Fleischer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gary Shteyngart—the author of critically acclaimed novels “The Russian Debutante’s Handbook” and “Absurdistan”—came to Currier House yesterday afternoon to discuss his heritage, his writing process, and his latest book, “Super Sad True Love Story.”
With the immigrant experience a major theme in his latest novel, Shteyngart explained the literary and cultural influences behind its two main characters—Lenny Abramov, the 39-year-old Russian-Jewish son of a janitor, and Eunice Park, a 24-year-old Korean woman who majors in “Images” and minors in “Assertiveness.”
Though all of Shteyngart’s novels prominently display certain autobiographical aspects of his experiences as a Russian-Jewish immigrant in the United States, he explained that the character of Eunice emerged out of his fascination with Korean culture.
While attending New York City’s Stuyvesant High School, Shteyngart said, he was surrounded by Korean students. Today, he still counts many Koreans as his friends and the award-winning Korean author Chang Rae Lee as his mentor.
But what ultimately draws Lenny and Eunice together, Shteyngart said, are the odd similarities between the Korean and Soviet Jewish cultures.
“Koreans were colonized by Japan, and Soviet Jews also often perceive themselves as surrounded by enemies, real or imagined,” he said. “And then there’s also the shared love of cabbage. Koreans, though, have taken it to the ultimate level by adding garlic and chili peppers.”
Shteyngart told the audience that three separate literary traditions have shaped his work—the Russian tradition of Turgenev and Chekov, the American Jewish tradition of Bellow and Roth, and the immigrant tradition of Chang Rae Lee and Junot Diaz.
Shteyngart said he was “thrust into Hebrew School in Queens in 1980 when being a Russian was the worst thing you could be.”
“In Hebrew School, I pretended I was born in East Berlin,” he said. “I had to pretend to be a German in Hebrew School to give you an idea about how bad it was to be a Russian in 1980.”
From the “pressure cooker” of Stuyvesant, Shteyngart attended Oberlin College, where, he said, he “had the biggest bong on campus—Big Blue, we called it.”
Shteyngart said that each of his novels is “like a giant cuckoo clock with all these gears,” referring to the many elements—political, historical, or, in the case of “Super Sad True Love Story,” scientific—that appear in nearly all of his fiction.
“The key is just to concentrate on the characters,” he said, “on the idea that there are two or three human beings whose lives are at stake.”
Jacky Kwong ’11, who attended the event, said that the event might prompt him to read Shteyngart’s latest book.
“I’m always interested in reading immigrant fiction,” Kwong said, “as a child that grew up in an immigrant family.”

Boston Medical Center announced in a statement released Monday that it would lay off 119 staff members in order to make up for a projected $175 million loss due to “dramatic changes in Medicaid reimbursements.”
“The layoff is one necessary element of addressing the hospital’s financial situation,” said Thomas Traylor, BMC’s vice president of federal, state and local programs, according to Monday’s press release.
The proposed layoff—scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1—involves 30 members of management, 44 nurses, and a variety of other administrative positions.
In addition to the layoffs, BMC said it also planned to reduce the hours of another 40 employees.
The layoffs and reduced hours will save an estimated $8 million, and are just two of many efforts BMC is making to reduce costs, according to the Boston Globe.
In July, BMC closed down an emergency department, saving approximately $2.5 million per year.
Last year BMC filed a lawsuit against the Mass. state government, accusing officials of illegally cutting payments to the hospital for thousands of poverty-stricken patients.
According to the Globe, BMC is “hopeful” that it will benefit from a Mass. petition to the federal government for increased Medicaid payments—which, if approved, could amount to $90 million a year for two years.
BMC had projected a budget hole of $134 million for the current fiscal year, but additional costs and slower-than-expected revenue growth resulted in the larger deficit, BMC Chief Executive Kate Walsh told the Globe. She attributed the increase in losses to an unexpectedly high number of Medicaid patients and insufficient government reimbursement.
“In order to save the hospital, the state must present a solution to the funding crisis and BMC management must include its staff in forming a real plan for the hospital’s future,” wrote Veronica Turner, executive vice president of the 1199 Service Employees International Union and a former BMC employee, in a statement.
BMC, a teaching affiliate of Boston University School of Medicine, currently employs close to 6000 people, of whom more than 1500 are nurses, according to the announcement by BMC.
In 2008, BMC laid off 250 workers, saving $10.5 million, the Associated Press reported.
Boston Medical Center declined to comment.

Leverett House Master and Physics Professor Howard M. Georgi ’68, known to his House as “Chief,” will now serve as chief of the docket committee that sets the agenda for monthly House Master meetings. Those meetings—which are typically attended by all House Masters—have previously centered on dining services and the winter break. Currently, the Masters are focusing on the upcoming Harvard-Yale football game in November. In his new position, Georgi replaces Sandra F. Naddaff ’75, who stepped down last year after serving as Mather House Master for 18 years alongside her husband Leigh G. Hafrey ’73. Naddaff’s and Hafrey’s departures left the Leverett House Masters Georgi and Ann B. Georgi, and the Lowell House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin, as the most senior Masters, with 12 years of service each. “The Masters are a fabulous group and we’re very close,” Georgi said. “They don’t really need anybody to lead them, but I’ve been around for a while.” The docket committee consists of a small group of House Masters and administrators, including Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson. Other Masters currently on the committee include Quincy Master Lee Gehrke and Adams Master Judith S. Palfrey ’67. The committee is primarily in charge of planning the Masters’ monthly meeting and selecting discussion topics.  “We like to have some sort of plan so we don’t waste everyone’s time,” Georgi said. In the past, guest speakers at the Masters’ meetings have included University President Drew G. Faust and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, according to Eck.

The Social Studies department plans to honor former Harvard Professor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz through the launching of an undergraduate research fund in his name, despite controversy surrounding one of Peretz’s recent blog posts in which he wrote that Muslims did not deserve protection from the First Amendment, and that “Muslim life is cheap, especially for Muslims.”
The research fund—which will support thesis research and other student projects—will be announced at the Social Studies Department’s fiftieth anniversary celebration, to the strong disapproval of multiple ethnic and religious groups on campus.
Peretz apologized for and retracted his Sept. 4 blog post stating that Muslims did not have the right to use the First Amendment, but reaffirmed his statement on the “cheap[ness]” of Muslim life. Peretz’s post intended to respond to the continuing debate on the construction of Park51, a New York City Muslim religious center planned to be built a few blocks from Ground Zero. The student research fund in honor of Peretz has upset many undergraduate students and faculty members, many of whom feel that the honor sends a signal that the College has chosen to overlook his insensitive remarks, according to several student group members.
In an article published in Foreign Policy magazine, Kennedy School Professor Stephen M. Walt expressed disgust towards Peretz’s remarks.
“If he had said similar things about Catholics or African Americans, there would be an outcry and most people at Harvard would be appalled,” Walt said.
Walt added that he did not believe Peretz’s apology was sufficient, and expressed concern that Peretz was still being honored at the Social Studies anniversary celebration.
“In the absence of a more heartfelt apology than he has made thus far, I think it’s unfortunate that he would be honored in this way,” Walt said. “If he is going to speak [at the celebration], that would be an ideal opportunity for him to make a sincere apology for what he wrote last week and what he has said on many occasions in the past.”
Students too have expressed their outrage.
“As a community, we’re certainly not happy about this happening—it’s not appropriate to recognize someone making such hurtful remarks,” said Rashid M. Yasin ’12, the Islamic Society’s director of external relations. “A couple of students—myself included—have been trying to reach with Social Studies to address this issue.”
The Harvard Islamic Society, along with several other student groups, hopes to draft a private letter to the Social Studies department, voicing disapproval, according to Yasin.
In a written statement in response to the Peretz research fund controversy, the University has said that Harvard is an institution that proposes equal opportunities and respect for all people despite their backgrounds.
“The recent assertions by Dr. Peretz are therefore distressing to many members of our community, and understandably so,” the University stated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A crowd of roughly fifteen locals gathered to protest the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s appearance last night at Harvard Square’s First Parish Cambridge Church, a scene that a passerby said resembled “The Ghost Writer.”
Wearing Palestinian flags, banging on pots and pans, and brandishing signs that advertised a “peace-loving Iran,” the protesters heckled the hundreds of people lined up for blocks to hear Blair discuss his new book, “Journey: My Political Life,” with noted British journalist Tina Brown.
“Prosecute Tony Blair for genocide! He’s a mass murderer!” protestors yelled.
“Americans, Brits, Iraqis died! Could it be because Tony lied?” they screamed.
“Hey people, use your noodle—don’t waste a dime on Bush’s poodle!” they shrieked.
“It’s an interesting statement, stopping war on peace-loving Iran,” said Kevin M. McKenna, who was waiting in line outside the church to hear Blair speak.
Inside the church, Brown confronted Blair about his decisions regarding the war in Iraq.
“In the book, you say that Iraq is not a regret and that if you were to do it again, you would. But I get the sense that you aren’t still at peace with it,” she said. “You were teasing out your point a little too much. I think you were still a bit uncertain.”
Blair responded saying that it is “inhuman” not to “consider your actions” ex post facto, “in light of what happens.” Even still, he maintained, “these risks are incredibly difficult to judge.”
On Iran, Blair’s views were clear.
“If I was a decision-maker today, I wouldn’t take the risk of Iran with a nuclear weapon, even acknowledging the risks of a Pandora’s Box.”
Outside, sentiments on Iran did not exactly mirror those of the former Prime Minister.
“I like Ahmadinejad,” said Elaine C. Antonia of Stoughton, Mass., adding that his Holocaust denial was “irrelevant.” “He was duly elected by his people. Every one of those protests we see on CNN was probably funded by the State Department.”
Halfway through the speech, the protestors attempted to move around the church to the side exit, where Blair’s convoy awaited his return, but Massachusetts police officers told them to clear the sidewalk.
“Did you ever hear of free speech?” said Mary Corcoran. “They clearly don’t believe in free speech. I think it’s disgraceful.”
In an interview after the event, Brown said that she thought Blair’s talk had gone well.
“I thought he was most interesting on how partisan ideology is over for the 21st century,” she added.
For her part, Antonia said she hoped she would be able to catch the attention of just a few.
I’m disappointed in Harvard,” she said. “During Vietnam this school was a hot bed. Now there’s people my age out on the street, and the students don’t even support us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether caught in the frenzy of on-campus recruiting or the whirlwind of graduate school and fellowship deadlines, many seniors this fall are beginning to feel the pressures of planning life after graduation and making career choices. According to the Office of Career Services, the most popular employment sector for students entering the workforce following graduation is financial services—over 20 percent of seniors accept jobs in finance.
Perhaps surprisingly, the second most popular sector is education, at 16 percent, according to the most recent data from OCS. But as programs in education, such as Teach for America and the College’s own Undergraduate Teacher Education Program­ (UTEP), gain popularity on campus, seniors who choose teaching—and in particular teaching in Cambridge and Boston area schools—are not as few and far between.
THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED
Native Bostonian Emily L. Melton ’09 jumped straight into the teaching world after graduation. Melton, now teaching history at the Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, said she had always known she wanted to pursue a career in teaching.
Melton’s placement in a Boston-area school is part of the Boston Residency Program (BTR), a post-graduate program that enrolls students in an accelerated one-year masters program and a year of co-teaching, in addition to a three-year commitment to teaching within the Boston public school system.
Melton said that as an undergraduate, she sometimes felt “discouraged” from pursuing this interest at Harvard.
“I felt that there was a lack of civil duty; you don’t find a lot of people that go into public service,” she said.
Pia P. Dandiya ’09, a teacher at Garfield Middle School Revere as part of Teach For America’s Boston corps, said that choosing a more common path in finance was tempting.
“I think that there is an imbalance of Harvard students going into jobs that pay well, rather than going into jobs that serve less fortunate communities,” she said.
Dandiya said that though she had always been considering finance and consulting careers, she was more and more enticed by TFA’s mission.
“By the end of my junior year, I was trying to be interested in finance and consulting, but the more I found out about Teach for America, the more I was wrapped,” she said.
For Melton, public service felt like both a privilege and an obligation.
“I believe it is important for those who have had the good fortune of an excellent education to give back to society,” she said.
TEACHING THE TEACHERS
Teaching and teacher training programs such as BTR have in recent years risen in popularity among undergraduates in part due to extensive recruiting among students with an interest in public service.
According to Carolyn Chen, a recruiter for BTR, the program recruits primarily from specific organizations such as the Philips Brooks House Association, in order to encourage students who have already shown dedication to public service to pursue careers in urban teaching. Chen said she hopes recruiting at Harvard will expand.
“We’re still building a community at Harvard,” she said.
Other organizations, namely the national non-profit teacher-placement program TFA, have already built solid platforms to recruit widely on Harvard’s campus. TFA, for instance, has begun to align its recruitment with the corporate recruiting schedule.
Students accepted to TFA commit to a two-year teaching post in lower-income American communities. TFA’s arrival in Boston in 2009 initially sparked anger among the Boston Teachers Union, which argued that TFA corps members were replacing laid-off teachers. Nevertheless, Harvard seniors seem to be flocking to TFA: 293 seniors from the class of 2010 applied to the program.
Anasstassia Baichorova, a TFA recruiter for Harvard and Brown and a 2006 corps member in New York City, said that its teachers are “providing critical leadership...to ensure all children have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.”
Growing encouragement from the College itself is also allowing students to take up the teaching challenge earlier.
Harvard’s UTEP, through which undergraduates can become certified teachers, requires enrolled students to engage in intensive teaching practice while taking foundational pedagogy courses. The program can be concurrent with an undergraduate degree or the student teaching can be completed during a semester after graduation.
“The main commitment of the program is to prepare passionate and highly trained students to education,” UTEP Director Megin H. Charner-Laird said.
While only eight students were enrolled in the program when she assumed directorship three years ago, UTEP enrollment has risen over the years. Currently, 22 UTEP students are student teaching in schools, while another 10 have yet to be placed in the field.
“Students come from all different areas of the college…[but] we get more folks interested in Social Studies, Government, History,” Charner-Laird said. “[UTEP is] a really exciting opportunity for undergraduates that they cannot find in their coursework.”
EDUCATION FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
A common criticism of the relatively short two-year contracts of programs like TFA is that it still leads to a shortage of long-term teachers. But some TFA teachers are finding permanent niches in the world of education.
Hana C. Merkle ’08, who herself attended a Boston public school, first served as a San Francisco Bay Area corps member and is now the Program Director for TFA’s Greater Boston corps. She serves as an instructional coach for other TFA corps members.
“I was eager to have the opportunity beyond my 137 sixth graders and work with other teachers who have incredible skills as teachers and as explorers,” Merkle said.
“My experience in the classroom really confirmed for me my interest and my passion for working in education and for working with students,” she added.
Teachers like Dandiya agreed that her job was lucrative in ways other than salary.
“It was the most challenging experience of my life. I learned so much. I see how differently I can do things,” she said.
For Melton, inspiring not just her students, but also a next generation of teachers, motivates her to remain working in education.
“My sense of civic duty stems from an amazing high school history teacher I had,” she said. “[The teacher] helped me define what I believe is an American, and that has led me to become a public school teacher.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A bill that would grant amnesty to qualified undocumented youth may reach the floor of the U.S. Senate next week, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid of Nev. announced on Tuesday.
While some Senate Republicans have claimed that the announcement is a ploy for political gain, proponents of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act—which would provide qualified undocumented youth with a six-year-long conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service—are still hopeful of the bill’s potential realization.
Harvard College Act on a Dream, the campus organization that engages students in ensuring equality for all immigrants, was contacted by U.S. Senator Barbara L. Boxer of Calif. on Tuesday. Boxer requested the testimonies of undocumented students that the organization had been collecting, according to Act on a Dream Co-Director Melissa V. Perez ’13.
“What we’ve been advocating for is for the DREAM Act to pass as a bill separate from a bill for comprehensive immigration reform,” Perez said. “If it does pass, it will be a very large step toward comprehensive immigration reform.”
Though the issue of immigration reform had been on the national agenda for several years, the case of Harvard sophomore Eric Balderas ’13 brought the question directly to campus this summer.
Balderas, who illegally immigrated to the United States from Mexico with his family at the age of 4, was detained by immigration authorities on June 7 when he tried to use his Harvard identification to board a plane from his hometown of San Antonio, Texas to Boston.
Two weeks later, Balderas was granted permission to stay in the United States indefinitely. While U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement can still revoke the deferral, as of now, Balderas may continue studying at Harvard without facing the threat of deportation.
Yesterday afternoon, University President Drew G. Faust and Balderas thanked U.S. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Ill., who helped Balderas attain his deferred action status during a brief meeting in Washington, D.C.
“These young men and women are working hard in school and are dedicated to a future living in and contributing to our communities or serving in the military,” said Faust in the released statement. “I believe it is in our best interest to educate all students to their full potential.”
Faust has repeatedly expressed support for the DREAM Act, while the University’s admissions process has remained blind to citizenship because it accepts students from all over the world.
But those who oppose the DREAM Act contend that the broad amnesty policy will not fix the problems the legislation intends to solve.
Roy H. Beck, president of NumbersUSA, an immigration reduction group, said that the DREAM Act is not written “to deal with people that they claim it’s for,” and will not solve the problem of companies hiring illegal immigrants.
“It creates a panic, wide amnesty instead of a narrow amnesty,” Beck said. “If it were limited to people like Eric, and did away with the jobs magnet, then it would pass easily, but it’s not going to pass.”
But according to Mario Rodas, a Harvard Extension School student who immigrated to the United States illegally but was granted permanent resident status, Balderas’ story directly illustrates an issue that deserves attention.
“There are many students like Eric that have the potential to go to all these great schools,” said Rodas. “The problem is that once they graduate, they will not be able to use their degrees. I feel that is very frustrating.”
Reflecting on the events of the summer, Balderas said they demonstrated young immigrants’ merits.
“It showed what kind of people we are, and [that] as young immigrants we strived,” Balderas said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Obama will appoint Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren as a special adviser to the new Bureau of Consumer Protection later this week, according to media reports last night.
The position could give Elizabeth Warren significant influence in the process of setting up the Bureau—charged with monitoring consumer financial products and services, including mortgages and credit cards—while avoiding a lengthy Senate confirmation process.
As a special adviser, Warren will be able to begin laying the groundwork for the Bureau immediately until she or another permanent director is announced. She would report jointly to Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, according to the New York Times.
Though the advisory role will allow Warren to sidestep Senate confirmation, it is likely to anger Republicans who may view the appointment as a maneuver intended to dodge conservative approval. It is also possible that Obama may nominate her as director of the agency later on, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The selection has not been officially announced, but ABC News first reported the upcoming appointment yesterday.
Warren, who was the original architect of the agency, is considered a natural choice to serve as inaugural director by most liberals. Following the financial crisis, Warren chaired the Congressional Oversight Panel and oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which rescued banks by purchasing assets and injecting equity to shore up troubled balance sheets.
But many on Wall Street are wary of Warren’s fierce advocacy for consumer rights and her tough stance on the regulation of financial institutions. Appointing Warren as director would likely ignite a fiery debate in Washington that Democrats fear could result in a Republican filibuster.
The Bureau, which falls under the aegis of the Federal Reserve Board, was signed into law in July as part of the financial reform and consumer protection act. The Bureau will also have the authority to issue subpoenas and to preside over investigations that could result in legal action in court, similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Law School declined to comment on the unofficial appointment.

In the world of Ivy League athletics, some things never change: Princeton dominates preppy women’s sports like lacrosse and field hockey; Brown manages to squander winning opportunities; and former basketball players find homes in obscure professional leagues overseas. This past week was no exception to the norm as the No. 4 Princeton field hockey team kept its undefeated streak alive, the Brown men’s soccer team won only one game despite three shutouts from its goalkeeper, and two former Columbia basketball players signed contracts to play in the English Basketball League.
Brown goalkeeper Paul Grandstrand had a week to remember. In three games and 310 minutes of play, Grandstrand did not let a single ball find the back of the net, knocking away all 13 shots he faced. Grandstrand was named Ivy League and ECAC Defensive Player of the Week for his efforts. But despite its keeper’s stingy defense, Brown managed only one victory on the week, a 1-0 win over South Carolina. In the Bears’ other matchups against Providence and Hofstra, neither team scored, resulting in two 0-0 deadlocks.
Brown could pick up a few offensive pointers from Princeton field hockey player Kathleen Sharkey. In two games last weekend, Sharkey notched a whopping seven goals and one assist. For some perspective, Sharkey’s seven tallies are more than the combined scoring total of the entire Harvard, Brown, and Cornell field hockey teams from the weekend. Sharkey got off to a hot start on Friday, finishing with six goals—a Princeton single game record—in the Tiger’s 7-1 win over Richmond. On Sunday, Sharkey recorded a goal and an assist in a 3-1 victory against Virginia Commonwealth.
The number of Ivy League graduates from the class of 2010 with professional basketball contracts reached a grand total of eight this week when former Columbia players Kevin Bulger and Niko Scott signed with English clubs. Bulger joins the Durham Wildcats while Scott joins the Reading Rockets, both members of the English Basketball League, the country’s second-tier conference. As seniors, Bulger and Scott averaged 3.8 and 9.3 points per game, respectively.
In much less usual Ivy League sporting news, the New York Times wrote Monday that a brain autopsy of Owen Thomas—a Penn football player who hanged himself in April—revealed that Thomas suffered from early stages of chronic traumatic encephalopathy—a disease has been linked to depression and impulse control in NFL players.

The Harvard field hockey team suffered a loss to the University of New Hampshire Wildcats at New Hampshire’s Memorial field last night. The Wildcats were a strong opponent, having won all four previous home games played this season, and last night’s contest proved no different, as New Hampshire (5-2) emerged with a 3-1 victory. The Crimson (2-3) went in knowing that it would be a tough matchup facing an active Wildcat squad.
“They are very aggressive, similar to our style of play,” said sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos. “It was nice to match up against them and see how we would adjust.”
New Hampshire demonstrated that aggression and took the lead for the first time in the 14th minute of the first half thanks to a goal by Hayley Rausch assisted by Whitney Frates.
Ten minutes later, freshman Rachael Rosenfeld tied the game for the Crimson, burying a shot in the back of the net off a pass by senior Chloe Keating. For the second time this season, Rosenfeld found the first-half equalizer for her team, this time with a solid shot from the right side that beat New Hampshire goaltender Katherine Nagengast. For the remainder of the half, the two teams continued to battle for the lead.
“We were pretty evenly matched for the first half,” Tassopoulos said. “Our press was working well, and we were able to intercept the ball a lot. They were a good team.”
The Wildcats returned to the second half strong and began with a goal within the first five minutes. Having already assisted on the first score, Frates tallied one of her own to give New Hampshire the lead.
The aggressive team mindset benefited the Wildcats as they controlled the second half with a significant advantage in shots—firing 10 versus Harvard’s two. The few shots taken demonstrate the difference in the tone of the second half compared to the first, in which the Crimson took three times as many. On the other hand, The Wildcats’ shots began to find their mark more often. In about the same number of shots, New Hampshire scored twice as many goals in the second frame.
“I would say that when they scored each goal they gained momentum that was hard to overcome” sophomore Molly Stansik said. “We kind of found ourselves recovering and playing more defensively than we were hoping for.”
That momentum carried the Wildcats, and during the 52nd minute of the game, their lead was solidified when New Hampshire’s Megan Bozek, assisted by Kendall Deck and Hayley Rausch, scored the third and final goal of the game. This goal resulted from a penalty corner, another advantage that the Wildcats earned during the second half. Although Tassopoulos worked her way into good position to stop Bozek’s shot, the freshman midfielder’s attempt got caught in traffic in front of the goal and deflected off another player’s stick, leaving Tassopoulos helpless to defend it.
The Wildcats kept the pressure up throughout the contest, taking 10 corners while Harvard took just half that amount.
In total, New Hampshire outshot the Crimson, 19-8.
Tassopoulos handled the onslaught well, making a season-high 11 saves in total, including back-to-back penalty corners just a minute apart. The goaltender spent the majority of the second half under pressure, as the Wildcats frequently controlled possession in the Crimson’s defensive zone.
“They were getting by our forward line because they were able to penetrate our press and attack with numbers,” Stansik said.
Harvard hopes to use the experience of the Wildcats game to prepare for their upcoming contest against Yale. The team showed excitement for the first Ivy League game of the season.
Last year the Crimson lost by one point to the Bulldogs, but this year it hopes to use its home field advantage to gain a victory.
“Our first five games have prepared us for Ivy League competition, so we’re excited to see what we can do,” Stansik said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is not often that one looks out the window from the Leverett towers or any other dorm and sees several people strapping on skis with wheels and then taking off using ski poles. It is even stranger when you see a large group of individuals, all doing this in unison down the street.
This was a scene that has presented itself to countless individuals during the course of this week and has undoubtedly raised some thoughts of bewilderment.
However, the simple explanation to this somewhat puzzling situation is that it is the start of the Harvard Nordic Ski Team’s conditioning.
Unlike other teams that have easier times accessing facilities that will help them train, both skiing squads have to resort to comparatively unorthodox means in order to practice in the mountain-less Cambridge terrain.
First, it is important to understand that there are two main forms of skiing. Alpine or downhill skiing is what people are most familiar with, whereas Nordic or cross-country skiing is a form that is probably less known.
In comparison to its foot-based counterpart, cross-country running, Nordic skiing tends to be longer. A Nordic ski race can range anywhere from 5 to 20 km.
Predictably, due to the distinctive nature of each form, both Alpine and Nordic demand radically different methods of conditioning and training that the Crimson ski team is currently undertaking.
Nordic skiing, unlike Alpine, emphasizes endurance, and the team’s preparation certainly emphasizes that.
“Our training tends to be long endurance work,” said Harvard Nordic coach Chris City ’94.  “Last weekend, for example, we were out roller skiing for about 2-3 hours. And our workouts tend to be one hour or more, five to six days a week.”
In the absence of snow, the Nordic team is doing what many other teams and cross-country ski enthusiasts do: they adapt to the weather. Roller skiing is the best form of dry-land training as the workout most closely simulates the motions of actual skiing.
“Roller skis are just like regular skis,” Nordic captain Cara Sprague said. “Its just that they are cut much more shorter and made a little more stiffer and you stick wheels on them,” she added. “The general idea is that one could work the exact same muscles that one would be using if you were skiing on snow.”
Alpine skiers don’t undergo the same training for that reason. Alpine skiing is more about short bursts of energy rather than endurance, and the Alpine team’s exercises are tailored specifically to that.
The Alpine team’s regiment includes weightlifting, core work, and the unique practice of single leg and double leg jumps off the stadium seats in order to condition for the centripetal force that occurs during turns on the course.
“We do work that focuses on balancing and coordination to help players understand how their body moves in space” explained Harvard Alpine coach Tim Mitchell.
In addition to the stark differences between the two forms of skiing, another thing that should impress Crimson faithful is the optimistic fervor with which members of the Nordic ski team speak about the upcoming season.
“I’m very optimistic about the team,” City said. “We are returning almost all of our girl skiers. We had a pretty historic team last season in terms of performance. I expect that we can at least return to that or even build on it during the season.”
When speaking about the prospects of the male side of the team City was similarly optimistic.
“On the guy side we have two promising freshmen who can compliment the other players, so we should see a significant jump.”
That jump will only come with consistent practice, and contrary to common belief, college-level skiing doesn’t end in the absence of snow.
“There is a saying that skiers are made in the summer”, quipped City, “and what I’m seeing is that most did the work over the summer and are continuing the work during the offseason.”

As the clock ticks toward the start of Harvard men’s water polo conference play, a more striking countdown has captured the team’s attention as it watches numbers on their roster slowly dwindle.
On Sept. 8, freshman Mike Rizzo quit the team due to a persistent shoulder injury, news that arrived only a few weeks after fellow rookies Will Roller and Hank Clausner were also ruled unfit to play for the remainder of the season due to various injuries.
“It hurts the team tremendously in terms of numbers,” Clausner said.
Although Clausner, who broke his fifth metacarpal shortly before the beginning of the preseason, and Roller, who is recovering from a hip surgery performed in June, are out for the season, they remain a part of the team and attend every practice.
On the other hand, Rizzo made the decision to leave last week after the intense level of collegiate practices aggravated a pre-existing shoulder injury.
“[The decision] was tough like you wouldn’t believe,” Rizzo said. “I love the sport of water polo but it was really, really hard. I had to consider my ability to do things outside of it and for the rest of my life.”
According to Clausner, the freshman class’ misfortune was preceded by the team’s loss of two rising seniors at the end of last term. One senior quit and the other decided to graduate early, cutting the number of active field players for this season down to ten.
“It affects us in a game like the Princeton game, where we were up 6-5 at halftime,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “Their depth took over us in the third quarter. They were subbing six for six and we can’t go six for six … They wore us down.”
“The guys who can play have to play more minutes,” Roller added. “[Clausner and I] could give our starters a break when they needed it. The guys in the water are pulling more weight.”
The minimal numbers not only limit the Crimson’s depth during games, but also during practices when the team is no longer able to hold intra-squad scrimmages.
“Since we can’t run full scrimmages now, we’re running lots of skill based drills,” said Roller. “There’s a lack of game situations in practice.”
According to co-captain Bret Voith, the team will miss Clausner and Roller in the water not solely because the depth they add, but also because of their skills and talent.
“From a personnel perspective, Will and Hank are both guys that could have come in and made impacts as freshman,” Voith said.
Despite their limitations, both Clausner and Roller have adopted new roles on the team. They run errands for their teammates and provide moral support.
“I try to do as much as I can,” Clausner said. “Will and I notice some things you just can’t see from the pool. We give the guys feedback and they’ll work on it.”
Additionally, Clausner and Roller utilize practice time by using the opportunity to rehabilitate and maintain their strength and endurance.
Clausner also hopes to turn his bad luck into an opportunity down the road in his water polo career. Although he is still working out logistics with the athletics department, he hopes to redshirt this year.
“I was really excited about this freshman class,” Minnis said. “It’s a talented group so it will be exciting when they do get in the pool next year.”
Although Harvard’s lack of depth likely contributed to its rough start in the 2010 season, Minnis considers their 2-5 record a minor obstacle for the team to overcome.
“Later in the season we’ll be in much better shape,” Minnis said. “We’re learning how to play tired. It’s about how you play in the beginning of November. [The conference tournament] is what we’re shooting for.”

Harvard boasts a nation's-best 41 varsity sports teams and makes sure to include that fact in as many recruiting and admissions publications as possible. But for those students who didn’t quite make the cut (or don’t really care for 6 a.m. lifting sessions) but still enjoy a little competition, intramurals offer the perfect venue.
But before anyone takes to the field/court/track/pool for their house or dorm, it may be helpful to know some of the basic guidelines–and surprisingly enough, there are a lot of them, all included in the Intramural Athletics Rule Book.
Here are just a few…
• Points are awarded differently depending on the classification of the sport. For example, “major” fall sports include flag football, A-league volleyball, and ultimate frisbee, while B-league volleyball and team tennis are considered “minor.” First place in a major sport wins 100 points, while first place in a minor sport wins 75.
• Not only does a team obviously lose in case of its forfeit, but five penalty points are also automatically deducted from its overall score.
• Any undergrad training or competing in nationals or the Olympics (and their junior equivalents) is ineligible, regardless of whether or not he or she is a varsity athlete.
• If a team captain can’t control his/her team or its rowdy fans, a new captain can be appointed by the official.
• The “Flash to Bang Method” is the official determinant of a weather delay. (Yes, the one you learned in elementary school. Count the number of seconds after the flash of lightning until you hear the thunder. Anything under 30 seconds warrants a delay or cancellation.)
These and other guidelines, along with rules for each sport, can be found here.

Pay a visit to the Harvard Undergraduate Council website and all seems normal. Right?
Not if you're into secret messages.

We were just informed that a Konami Code is present on the site. To enable it, open the UC homepage and enter the code ↑, ↑, ↓, ↓, ←, →, ←, →, B, A. Voilà.
After a (very) brief investigation, we discovered that the culprit was one of our own: Punit N. Shah '12, a Crimson blog editor and the developer of the current UC website. (Disclaimer: The Crimson was not involved in any way.) Shah confirmed that he embedded the Konami code during the process of building the site. As of this writing, the code still works, so check it out (especially if you're a Mather resident).

A recent Newsweek article, “Best Majors for Big Paychecks,” lists the top ten majors by median starting salary and median salary mid-career. In case you’re angling for a good salary after you graduate, you might want to consider this list when you pick a concentration.
 
Here’s the abbreviated list:
1. Engineering
2. Economics
3. Physics
4. Computer Science
5. Statistics/Math
6. Biochemistry
7. Construction Management
8. Finance
9. Information Systems
10. Geology
 
Economics should be no surprise here, since almost every economics concentrator we know is looking for a job in investment banking, finance, or consulting—three lucrative career paths. And Harvard continues to court engineers, accepting more and more potential concentrators each year. In the last three years, Harvard has seen a 68 percent increase in applicants who list their primary interest as engineering sciences.
 
On the other hand, Harvard is limiting your options in a couple of cases. We don’t have construction management, finance, or information systems majors.
What was surprising about this list was that philosophy didn’t make the cut. After all, knowing if and when to push a fat man in front of a runaway vehicle must deserve a larger salary than deciding when to buy and sell stocks.

Even though the Science of Cooking lottery has come and gone, the popularity of food—and space limitations on learning about it—is clearly an ongoing trend.
On Tuesday, novelist Jonathan Safran Foer—a vegetarian and author of “Eating Animals”—came to Science Center D to talk about the ecological consequences of eating meat. The event was so popular that the room literally overflowed and many could not even enter.
During his talk, Foer argued for reduced meat-eating, focusing almost exclusively on the ecological impact of factory-farming—a point of view that diverges from the stereotypical image of vegetarians who forgo meat for ethical reasons. The slight and bespectacled Foer may seem like an unlikely rock star for the vegetarian movement, whose public faces until now have included individuals such as Pamela Anderson.
Yet the novelist seems to have developed a cult following of vegetarians of all ages. Case in point: many of the attendees were middle aged mothers, some of whom proclaimed during the talk that they were raising their kids vegetarian. (We noticed that many the kids in question who had been brought along spent the evening reading or playing handheld console games.)
Foer, who conducted much of the lecture like a question-and-answer session, attracted enthusiastic repsonses from the audience. An impromptu poll conducted by an audience member revealed,  unsurprisingly, that well over 95 percent of the hall was vegetarian. Questioners competed with each other for who’d been vegetarian  longest, shouting out their responses: from "five years" up to "25 years." This correspondent could not help wondering about the attempts to turn a serious lecture into moral one-upmanship, but we guess the Harvard setting breeds competition in every context.

The saying goes that dog is man’s best friend. But despite this fact, humans generally drink fresh spring water while our dogs settle with the taste of tap.
J.P. Licks has reversed this phenomenon, upping both tap and bottled water for something even better. The local ice cream store is now providing “homemade water” for our canine friends. What makes this water different from all other water? We’re not sure, and our fluffy friends were too busy hydrating to answer any questions.
