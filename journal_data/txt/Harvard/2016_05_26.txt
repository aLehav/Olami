“I’m a man now / And there’s nothing you can do to make me change my mind,” Christine and the Queens proclaims in the song “iT”—the lyrics making for a bold and very fitting statement for the alter ego of French singer-songwriter Héloïse Letissier. Letissier has garnered critical acclaim since the release of her project’s debut EP “Miséricorde” in 2012, winning the awards for Best Female Artist and Music Video of the Year at the Victoires de la Musique 2015 (the French equivalent of the American Grammy Awards) and even earning praise from the likes of Mark Ronson and Madonna. With the fall 2015 release of her self-titled album—a repackaged version of her 2014 debut LP “Chaleur Humaine” for the American market—and an upcoming performance at Boston Calling, Letissier is gearing for an exciting future. Prior to her May 29 set, Letissier sat down with The Crimson to talk about the stage, music festivals, and the art of breaking free.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you become involved with music?
Christine and the Queens: I’ve always been interested in listening to music [and] constantly surrounding myself with music, but I never actually made music or wrote songs until I started this project. It was like six years ago [when] I started to write my first song with this idea of having a stage character and having to build a repertoire for it. Before that, I was interested in being a stage designer [or] director... so I was constantly listening to music that I could use in stuff like that. But [I] never, never wanted to sing, or I thought I was a terrible musician. So it’s weird. It’s a huge shift in my life, but maybe I was just never daring. I didn’t dare to do music before.
THC: So what brought on that shift? I’ve read that you were inspired by local drag queen musicians to form Christine and the Queens.
C&Q: I did meet performers in London. As I said, I wanted to be a stage director before, so I was interested in being on stage, but through theater. But for some reason, something was not clicking; something was missing where I didn’t feel like it was my place. So it felt terrible because I wanted to write and I wanted to do something with the stage, but I didn’t know what. And I think something clicked when I saw the drag queens—first because of the energy of it, because I was in a place where I just needed to see those performers. The queer energy and everything they brought on stage, including this fierceness they had, like this carefree energy, and… the way they invented the name, their character, the way of just being free of any norm—it just inspired me a lot. And I was like, maybe I just need to interact for myself—just make something of my pain or of my awkwardness. Maybe I can turn it into something stronger than me. And I guess music arrived because it was like first healing myself. I discovered the pleasure to sing, to project my voice and be generous of it. I think as a writing technique, it was really interesting to discover the pop song as a form…. I just discovered this new language, and it just felt really natural to use it afterwards.
THC: What is it like performing with dancers or a band?
C&Q: Well, it’s been the end of a process that took me maybe four years because… I started on my own… and then I finally met dancers that went on tour with me and [found] musicians to play this album I made. I think it’s really cool because I just met the right people, and I’m on stage with them for a reason. I toured a lot on my own before because I didn’t want it to be like, “Oh, let’s just have a band and do the whole thing like that.” I just always invited people on stage because it meant something and it actually helped me tell a story. It feels good now because I have the right people to perform along with me…. I don’t want to surround myself just to be surrounded, so because it means something, it’s quite cool.
 
THC: Your songs deal with pretty affecting themes—for instance, being an outsider. What draws you to those topics?
C&Q: I guess I’ve been writing with what I’ve been feeling, and so I just write from the perspective of someone who questions the norms and feels out of it because I always felt like that. I think my character—like, Christine as a stage character—was the first expression of something that came from an anger. When the character was actually being born, I was just constantly writing that Christine was the name of my anger. For me, the first jot of Christine is: What could an angry girl—a young girl—just dream of? And I was dreaming about this mutual energy that could be free from many, many injunctions. I wanted to break free from many things, including the constant urge to be pretty and polite, not to take too much space, not being bossy—stuff like that. I never felt like my way of being a woman could fit before, because partly I’m queer and partly I don’t fit this constant urge to be soft…. I’m just talking about what strikes me.
THC: You’ve mentioned a lot about breaking free. How do you think performing and making music has helped you achieve that?
C&Q: I guess first because I just found a way to relate to people. It sounds a bit cheesy, but it’s just that I’m quite socially anxious. So just the fact that I can actually write something and something can resonate… it’s something, for me, that’s really beautiful…. I’ve been obsessed with being on stage and being a performer since I was a kid, so I get to do what I want now. I get to try to create new ways of existing…. To just be allowed to do that… is a luxury. I don’t know if it’s going to go on, but maybe if it’s not under this form, I just need to write consistently and think about the stage. It’s just what I love to do. This is just what I’m made for.
THC: What should the audience expect from your performance at Boston Calling?
C&Q: They can expect something quite physical... because there’s a lot of dancing involved, lots of movement, lots of sweat. When I’m playing festivals during daytime, I just want something quite simple and generous because you have like 40 minutes to make an impression and then leave. I like to concentrate on what I want to tell and what I want people to actually feel. So I have this boxer energy—just, like, entering this ring, and you have to like kick and punch and then leave. But hopefully [the audience can expect] an introduction to what the character is, and if you want to dance along with us, it’s totally possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although I am out of college almost 40 years now, I do not feel that I have life all figured out.
That is the first thought I have for you: Expect to keep working, occasionally struggling, to create yourself. In the generation before mine, people made choices in their 20s that determined the entire trajectory of their lives in predictable ways. Not so in my generation. Even less so in your generation. The good news is that you can continue to invent yourself and reinvent yourself for your whole life.  The bad news is that you will have to do so and that may be spiritually and economically difficult from time to time.
Here is a second thought: In creating yourself and your future, there is no substitute for experimentation. As I look back, I am struck that each new chapter of my life brought big surprises—I learned things about myself and about the world that I didn't know that I didn't know. I had to live through each chapter before I understood it.
You should seek advice from people who have gone before you down different paths, but don't rely too heavily on them. Even if you aren't completely sure you know what your heart wants or what's right for you, you can be completely sure that no one else knows better.  Go with your gut—don't overthink your big choices, because thinking won't make your decisions any better. You have to experiment. Expect to fail from time to time. Value failure as a better teacher than success.
Third thought: You've made it to graduation and now is the time to stop thinking of life as a ladder or of yourself as a climber. There are many apparent ladders in life—academic, social, professional, corporate, political. From time to time, reaching for the next rung is the right thing to do. But when you look back across your work life, you will feel best about the things you actually did—the people you helped, the things and organizations that you built—not the heights you reached. The higher you climb, the harder it is to know whether what you are doing is actually making any positive difference at all to people on the ground.
In his speech to my graduating class, then Harvard President Derek Bok invoked Cavafy's poem, “Ithaca,” about Odysseus and his marvelous Odyssey, his message being: value the journey, don't expect the destination to be the final reward. Same message a different way.
A related thought: Think big, but don't try to do it all at once. The world is just so much bigger than you can ever know. Accept that. Accept that you have only so much time in life, only so much cognitive capacity, only so much emotional capacity. Change the world, but focus on and seek to change the parts of the world that are close enough to see clearly. And don't spread yourself too thin.
I'm not advocating retreat or isolationism. Travel. Help others. Engage on the largest issues if you can. But think of yourself as part of something that is unimaginably bigger than you are. Real change will happen only if a whole lot of other people also choose to do the right thing. Contribute to the mega-issues from wherever you find yourself—don't rush to be at the center. The people at the center depend as much on the people at the edges as vice versa and every voice matters.
To summarize: Expect to change. Don't be afraid to fail. Trust your gut. Enjoy the journey. Don't spread yourself too thin. Make the difference that life gives you the opportunity to make.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Utter the word “plastics” to just about anyone my age and you’ll evoke an iconic scene in “The Graduate,” the 1967 film classic about the existential bewilderment of a college student catapulted with his degree into the real world.
Fresh home from an East-Coast liberal arts education, Ben Braddock (played by Dustin Hoffman in his first starring role) is feted at a cocktail party hosted by his parents. Young Ben plainly has no idea what he’s going to do with his life, much less how to order his values. And so a family friend, Mr. McGuire, takes him aside to set him straight:
Mr. McGuire:  I just want to say one word to you - just one word.
Ben:  Yes sir.
Mr. McGuire:  Are you listening?
Ben:  Yes I am.
Mr. McGuire:  'Plastics.'
Ben:  Exactly how do you mean?
Mr. McGuire:  There's a great future in plastics.  Think about it.  Will you think about it?
Ben:  Yes I will.
Mr. McGuire:  Shh! Enough said. That's a deal.
For my generation, that exchange showcased the materialism and conformity against which many of us rebelled. It also epitomized the absurd hubris of a self-satisfied elder dispensing “advice” about life in a single word. Fear of becoming Mr. McGuire has informed every graduation speech I’ve ever written.
Now I’m going to take that risk. A few years ago, upon his own Harvard graduation my son asked me, mischievously, for the key to a fulfilled life. “Stretch,” I jokingly replied—referring to my middle-aged appreciation for the importance of keeping one’s physical body in working order.
Much to my surprise, I’ve recalled over and over again that lighthearted exchange. The word “stretch” now occupies a prominent place in my mind, as “plastics” did so long ago. But this word, I think, is no joke. So I’ll take on the mantle of Mr. McGuire.
Of course you should take time to stretch your body: athletes learn that early on; many of the rest of us come to realize it only too late in life.  But I also mean “stretch” in almost every other sense of the word.
Continue to stretch your mind. Certainly you’ve done so thus far, because intellectual rigor is what good schools require and train. But don’t assume that the “real world” will naturally challenge you in this way. It doesn’t at all. Many, many graduates ease imperceptibly into lives of intellectual complacency. Don’t allow yourself to be impoverished in that way.
Resolve to stretch your heart. Admission to Harvard, and success once there, turns on what you’ve done, not on what you’ve felt.  Looking ahead, graduates naturally focus on what they can achieve professionally, materially, and in the esteem of others. We know that love, empathy, and spiritual growth are important, but too often we assume that these things will develop on their own.  Too often they don’t.  Too often we consider devotion to professional achievement and devotion to emotional development as competitors in the zero-sum game of time.  They aren’t by any means.
Finally, make sure to stretch out your hands. You are graduating into a world of tremendous injustice and yawning inequality. As members of the privileged elite, you owe it to others to use your advantages to help make the world fairer and more tolerable.
And believe me, you owe it to yourselves.  Study after study reveals shocking levels of dissatisfaction among professionals of every calling who report an inability to see their work as improving the lives of others or the common good. Yet no one I know who devotes time to helping people they might never otherwise encounter reports anything of the sort.  Will Rogers famously observed, "A man makes a living by what he gets, but he makes a life by what he gives." No truer words were ever spoken. You will do yourselves a world of good if you devote real time to helping others less fortunate.
You are all, each one of you, on the brink of a wonderful adventure. Use your talents, your values, and the love you have and need—to stretch.

When I recently visited an airport, I experienced a moment of panic and confusion as I reached a fork in the road and had to decide whether to take the ramp that said “arriving” or the ramp that said “departing.”
As graduates of Harvard College, let me ask you: Are you arriving or are you departing? Are you arriving at a new station in life, holding your arms out to welcome your newly conferred status as alumni or are your arms grasping at the past—the memories of your undergraduate years from which you now depart? While airport ramps and forks in the road don’t let us simultaneously arrive and depart, at this special moment in your lives, you do have the rare opportunity to simultaneously experience both.
Speaking of arrivals, have you ever stopped to think about how you got here? What were the factors that enabled you to become members of the Harvard College class of 2016? Was it a teacher or a coach who encouraged you to apply, even though you thought Harvard was well beyond your reach? Maybe it was due to your brilliant application essay or the many hours you spent with practice SAT tests or mastering a language. Perhaps there were factors totally out of your control, like your zip code or your parents’ dreams since the day you were born that Harvard was in your future. Maybe, your parents made extraordinary sacrifices, moving from home to home or from one country to another, to put you on the best possible path to Harvard.
Whatever the factors were, whether personal or societal, it is likely that you received a high quality, outstanding education long before you ever arrived in Cambridge. And even if you didn’t attend the best of schools, it is likely that someone in your life helped open doors of opportunity for you that remain closed to many of your childhood peers.
As you think about your long ago arrival and imminent departure, I want you to remember that a high quality education and the opportunity to attend Harvard is not within the reach of most children in the United States. A very inconvenient truth is that whether due to poverty, poor schools, inadequate health, or dysfunctional families, many highly capable and talented youth will not have the same opportunities that you have had. And without dramatic changes in our K-12 education system, many youth are destined to be a drain on our society. That’s both your society and mine.
Consider these statistics: Here, in arguably the richest country in the world, 25 percent of children live in poverty! And for students of color, that number is closer to one out of two. And even if the pernicious effects of poverty were not alarming enough, there is a strikingly high correlation between income and test scores. Even though the U.S. ranks third internationally in per pupil spending, more than one-quarter (26 percent) of 15-year-olds in the United States are not considered proficient by international standards—the level at which individuals will be able to participate effectively and productively in life. Essentially, the poorer you are, the worse you will do academically.
If you think that these data are of little concern to you, esteemed members of the Harvard College class of 2016, please think again! As I have often said in United States in the World 35, “If you are not outraged by these data, then you simply aren’t paying attention!”
Now, as you arrive at a new place in your life, I want you to appreciate the role that education can have in shaping the future of society. Children represent nearly 25 percent of our total population and yet they are 100 percent of our future. And the future depends on the quality of education that children will receive.
The future of our society lies in your hands. Whether you become a lawyer, doctor, writer, software engineer, entrepreneur or Nobel Prize winner, there are many ways to connect the world in which you will live to the education and well-being of children. Of course, I would love for every Harvard student to become a teacher, but realistically you have many different callings. Still, there are limitless ways that each of you can contribute to the education of children.
As you reflect back on your time here, know that the duty to give back to children who may not have had the same opportunities as you is the only way we will achieve a just and worthy society. If you accept the logic of my argument here, your involvement will possibly help one or many future students both arrive and depart from Harvard College.
I leave you with the wise words of John F. Kennedy ’40, who, just like all of you today, once arrived and departed from Harvard. “For of those to whom much is given, much is required.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, as you cram your favorite Harvard sweatshirt into your suitcase, it’s probably safe to say you’ve given zero thought to your fifth reunion in 2021. As you hug your closest friends and head off to whatever adventures await you, the notion of your 50th reunion in 2066 surely must seem unfathomable. But you’ll be surprised at how quickly the decades speed by.
As you process through the Yard on Thursday morning, you’ll be greeted by a gauntlet of alumni and alumnae holding placards for classes with graduation years that end in a 6 and a 1. The 50th  and 25th reunions likely will have the largest contingents and the loudest applause as they welcome you into the ranks of Harvard graduates.
Enjoy the love. Embrace the moment. These 40-somethings and 70-somethings see themselves in you, albeit younger and fresher with boundless possibility and vigor. Some of them may be quietly praying that among you are visionaries with solutions to address global warming, income inequality and bigotry. Some of them wish they’d left you a better world as they watch you launch into the nastiest, most contentious presidential election season in recent memory.
During your four years at Harvard, I hope you’ve created what will become lifelong friendships. I hope you’ve found your passion on a team, in a classroom, with the Kuumba Singers, or like I did, at WHRB. I hope you’ve taken advantage of this intentionally diverse microcosm to get to know people and points of view you’re unlikely to encounter on a daily basis in the “real world.”
Now as alumni and alumnae you join an international universe of people who ate in the same dining halls, survived the winter of 2015 and learned to pronounce “Brattle” in a distinctive way. As alumni and alumnae, I hope you’ll find others in that wide circle who share a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for using their privilege, talent, education and expertise to make meaningful contributions.
I began to appreciate the value of this extended community when I returned to Cambridge in 1979 for my fifth reunion. At the time I was living in Houston, a move I’d made reluctantly, but strategically, for the sake of career development. Although I was learning a lot—and even now remain grateful to my mentors and colleagues—I longed to be back on the East Coast. And while I didn’t fully comprehend it at the time, I was still very much grieving the loss of my mother, who had died three years earlier.
Visiting Radcliffe Yard, sitting in Sanders Theatre and walking through the music department at the Coop lifted my spirits. When I saw women in their 80s and 90s proudly holding the Radcliffe banner at Commencement, I was inspired by their energy and confidence. Partying with friends stirred wonderful memories. Meeting classmates I’d never gotten to know was an unexpected bonus.
In college, out of convenience and affinity, our friendships often were determined by Houses, concentrations and extracurricular interests. Reconnecting with those friends is essential. While I’m at Noir listening to music with other black alumni or taking notes as class secretary at the Radcliffe alumnae meeting, other classmates may be headed to LGBTQ gatherings or having lunch in their Houses. But at reunions, we also mingle beyond past affinities and bond over a shared sense of place and past.
Over time, I’ve noticed that the essays in our reunion books have become more personal and more intimate, the conversations deeper and more revelatory.
At our 40th reunion in 2014, a classmate whose books always are prize-winning best sellers gave an entertaining, enlightening lecture. We listened to a panel of classmates then embarking on second careers and creating volunteer initiatives even as they approached retirement age. And then there was the “Eureka! Moment” session—a cross between a mini-TED Talk and Moth Radio—where twelve classmates gave five-minute presentations about moments that changed their lives. The death of a spouse. Struggles with addiction. A newborn’s severe illness. A near death experience.  And also the recovery, renewal, healing and triumph that came in due time.
There were no recordings. No tweets. Everything was confidential and off-the-record. Love and trust enveloped the room.
It surely occurs to me that those of us who return for reunions are a self-selecting group. More nostalgic perhaps. The reward is being able to share the kind of intimacy we experienced in that “Eureka” session. And to know we’ll come back together again with new joys and stories to share.
I suspect the Class of 2016’s access to Facebook, FaceTime and other social media platforms will remove some of the itch to gather at five-year intervals. But I hope you’ll remain receptive to this ritual of reunion. There just is no on-line substitute for hugging an old friend, for watching her age gracefully, for talking late into the night with someone who knew your secrets and dreams before kids and mortgages and obligations.
Yes, you’ll be surprised at how quickly the decades speed by and how much you’ll come to cherish those friendships you’ve created during these last four years.

The Introduction. One of those Harvard routines that hasn’t changed: name, concentration, House, hometown, a “fun fact.” After you graduate, that introductory routine shifts but only ever so slightly: name, school, job, title, where you live, where you’re from, and maybe on the first day, three fun facts disguised as a game of two truths and a lie.
It’s a snapshot for others to place and locate you. And along with things like your name, your gender, your race, your ancestry, and your wealth, a way to identify and categorize you. It’s the framed portrait that the world is already prepared for: your filtered self.
Yet each of us is filled with silences not reflected in the portrait: pain, exuberance, fire, and tenderness—things that don’t fit in that pretreated frame. And once on the outside, they get quickly tempered or erased.
A few months ago, I returned to Harvard after a lifetime away. Some of the routine is the same. I am once again affiliated with the Institute of Politics and Kirkland House. My love for Noch’s remains. And, sadly, my wealth—like my race and gender—hasn’t changed much.
When I am asked what resonated over this time, what ended up being most important and most valuable, I don’t think of the filters and the successes they reflect. I think instead of the journeys along seemingly random paths that somehow led me to the places I dreamed to reach. Most of all, I think of the communities that unexpectedly sprouted up along the way. Communities that provided (un)common ground, and reminders that in the hardest of times, I was not alone. In our shared soil, I could find and locate myself. I could sit and hear the silences and the silences could find voice and value.
So as you begin charting this next course, I’d ask that you travel beyond those communities that are aligned with what you can see and measure—your graduating class, colleagues on a campaign, the local school board, or your start up team. I’d ask that you find and build vulnerable communities—communities built across borders that defy stereotypes. And that your definition of success be whether you broke new ground and shared soil—whether with a few or many—in a way that ennobled your spirit, strengthened faith in one another, and got you to extend past the filters and hear the silences.
By vulnerable communities, I mean two things.  First, build communities where you can be vulnerable.  Communities that can’t be easily defined on paper—communities of shared freedom, shared joy, shared memory, and shared challenge where you can be open: pained, tumultuous, curious, quiet, straight with no filter. Communities that form out of parts—sometimes yours, maybe others—that don’t fit where they are categorized to go. Where you get to realize that the real lies beneath the surface of things. Where you can dialogue with difference. Where, with your classmates and the many others you will encounter along the way, you get to journey sideways and in between and through the interstices. Where you can get close, and in that proximity, you discover and surprise and evolve.
Second, build up communities that are themselves vulnerable. Those communities that have been lost in the bright lights. Communities experiencing trauma and hunger, violence, and desertion. For these days, among the distorting politics of anger and distrust and denigration, we seem resigned that the best we can do is to acknowledge that vulnerable communities exist, and when pushed, that they matter. And while we might see and recognize, or even call out the state of inequality and violence on social media, we keep our distance.
Yet, now we need much more. We need to open ourselves up and be vulnerable together. To translate for each other. To not only take on a fight you think you can wage, but to get in and sweaty on the same side of the ring. To not only discover and patent a new method to have social impact, but to reveal all the ways in which that impact is immeasurable and to go plant the seeds with your very own hands.
Go in the quiet moments and get close. Sit among the soil and reach out. For in those moments of shared vulnerability, you’ll discover the silences. You’ll discover your voice. You’ll understand how we matter. You’ll remember, at times most needed, that you are not alone. And you’ll find yourself and the way forward. Unfiltered.

If money makes the world go round, then huge gobs of it power the juggernaut that is Harvard. The sheer dollar values are staggering. The endowment reaches towards $40 billion, a sum larger than the economies of 103 countries. A record-breaking $6.5 billion capital campaign is under way, itself larger than the economies of 45 sovereign nations. Indeed, hardly an eye is bat when the construction proposals floated by administrators top $1 billion. (The Allston science complex has a dollar value greater than 15 entities represented at the United Nations.)
Over the past year, the University’s finances have weaved their way into many of the most important news threads. From the capital campaign to campus activism to the national debate over the cost of education, the proper role of the endowment has been a key issue. Major donations like that of John Paulson’s last summer provoked scrutiny over the size and worthiness of the endowment. Law School protestors have demanded tuition be eliminated. Numerous editorials and op-eds on these pages have encouraged Harvard to spend its nest egg differently. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s proposal for free college has sparked a national debate about the spiraling cost of higher education.
As the year concludes, we have revisited the numbers behind the policy choices that are often discussed on campus. Indeed, Harvard’s dozens of financial statements over the past decade reveal the pragmatic choices and practical realities facing administrators confronted with both internal and external demands. Unfortunately, the endowment is poorly understood, giving rise to demands that are often unrealistic.
The Post-Crisis Endowment
Over the course of one year — 2008 — Harvard’s endowment lost $11 billion. As the economy headed for the deepest recession since the 1930s, administrators responded by postponing Allston expansion plans and instituting budget cuts, including nearly $200 million in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
In particular, the high proportion of Harvard’s endowment tied up in illiquid assets, or those that cannot easily be sold, meant that administrators faced a particularly severe cash crunch. No doubt these memories continue to loom large in the minds of administrators.
Today, Harvard Management Company, the University’s in-house investment arm, faces a different problem: underperformance. Since the recession, their performance has lagged both their past results and peer institutions. In fiscal year 2015, only one Ivy League institution, Brown, fared worse than Harvard. Peers at Yale and Princeton delivered 11.5 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively, to Harvard’s 5.8 percent. Whether this is a result of poor investment decisions or a conscious choice to become more risk-averse is unclear, but even President Faust has acknowledged that poor investment returns are deeply concerning.
HMC CEO Jane Mendillo was replaced in 2014 with Stephen Blyth, who has promised to shake up the fund. As we have said in the past, in the long run, HMC returns and not fundraising will shape the size of the endowment. After all, a 1 percent change in performance with a principal as large as Harvard’s has a $370 million impact, a sum larger than the then-largest-ever gift to Harvard that renamed the School of Public Health. Had Harvard matched Stanford’s performance last fiscal year, the endowment would be hundreds of millions greater than it is; had Harvard matched MIT, the endowment would be billions larger.
The Endowment’s Reach
Far from being an idle contest between Ivy League universities to top each other, the size of the endowment has real and tangible impacts on Harvard’s campus. The global financial crisis illustrated this clearly. Expansion plans were postponed, hiring was downsized, and budgets were slashed. Since then, the share of the budget coming from endowment returns has remained relatively constant near 35 percent.
As costs inevitably increase, the University will be forced to find new ways to grow revenues. Financial aid has long been sacrosanct (it was one of the few budgetary items untouched in 2008’s budget cuts), so tuition rises only have a limited impact on the bottom line. As a result, as the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative was rolled out and expanded from 2004 to 2008, tuition growth lagged endowment returns by 26 percent. From 2008 to the 2015, the most recent year for which data has been released, they have grown roughly in parallel.
That financial aid is expensive does not mean it is wrong. Indeed, as Harvard students, we’re proud of the commitment that this institution has made to opening its doors. Any continued steps towards that goal are welcome. The socioeconomic diversity that is enabled by these programs firmly make Harvard a better place.
Nevertheless, we believe that the data demonstrates that those who can pay, should. Contrary to claims made by Board of Overseers candidate slate Free Harvard, Fair Harvard and suggested by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, endowment money would be woefully insufficient to cover the cost of educating Harvard students. Last year, 23 percent of the FAS budget, of which the College is a part, came from tuition. At the Law School, the site of the anti-tuition activist group Fees Must Fall, a huge 46 percent of revenue came from students. The endowment is certainly to be celebrated for making possible these relatively low numbers—it pays for 50 percent and 33 percent of the FAS and Law School budgets, respectively—but it is clear that absent an unexpected doubling of the endowment, tuition must continue to pay for significant portions of the Harvard budget.
Alternative Revenue
To continue to make possible growth in financial aid as well as other important priorities like research, faculty hiring, and House renewal, we encourage the administration to expand the growth of non-tuition revenue. Improving HMC’s performance must be the foremost priority, but alternative sources of funding are critically important. This challenge has been made more difficult by the dropoff in federal funding due to budget cuts, amounting to a $100 million cut from its 2011 peak.
In its place, foundations and corporations have grown in significance. From 2009 to 2013, the last year a breakdown of data was publically available, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation more than doubled its giving to Harvard research. In some cases, the sums are significant: in 2013, 21 percent of the School of Engineering and Applied Science’s non-federal sponsored spending came from the German chemical company BASF; 24 percent of the School of Public Health’s and 35 percent of the Graduate School of Education’s came from the Gates Foundation; and 8 percent of the Kennedy School’s non-federal expenditure came from the China Southern Power Grid Company. The donors are also heavily concentrated: four of the ten largest non-federal sponsors are pharmaceutical companies.
It is no coincidence that the Medical School, which of all degree-granting Harvard schools has the highest percentage of the budget coming from research sponsorships (39 percent), also has the lowest percentage of the budget coming from tuition (7 percent). Though some groups like Divest Harvard have raised conflict of interest questions about corporately-funded research (in 2013, Harvard’s largest foreign sponsor was a Spanish energy giant), universities must be proactive about finding new sources of revenue.
Throughout the University, executive education programs enable growth of other less lucrative programs. In 2013, these continuing education programs surpassed undergraduate tuition, reflecting a University willing to explore alternate streams of income.
The Future of University Finances
Ultimately, these numbers paint a picture of a university bound by the realm of the possible. Budgets must be balanced and costs must be covered. Of course, this might be frustrating to some. It certainly slows the pace of change, but only through this sort of pragmatic attention to budgets and implementation details does change happen. Instead of radical changes like free tuition, Harvard has steadily grown the size of its financial aid program by growing alternative sources of revenue.
Indeed, it is simply not possible for the endowment to fund a substantially greater portion of the University’s affairs than it currently does. The endowment is not a $37.6 billion trust fund or magical pot of money — it must be carefully managed so that it is not quickly depleted. Only a certain portion of endowment funds can be made available each year. Indeed, absent alternative sources of income, the University risks repeating the reliance on endowment returns that can vary with the market. Better understanding the nature of the University’s finances is critical, and it is often disappointing that criticism of Harvard misunderstands the nature of the endowment. These issues deserve a debate that is informed, intelligent, and applicable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among Harvard’s many traditions and oddities is the fact that the Harvard College experience ends with a ceremony called “commencement." On the day when parents, alumni, faculty, administrators, and soon-to-be graduates gather together to celebrate the completion of students’ college careers, administrators announce their educational experience has just begun. Indeed, the hope is that Harvard is not the end of one’s education, but a beginning of a lifelong journey that four years here have helped to inform.
It is in this spirit that we wish the Class of 2016, both from the College and the University’s graduate schools, all the best as they begin their life beyond Cambridge. Some will be doctors and lawyers or bankers and consultants; others will find their calling in teaching and public service or in family and volunteerism. Regardless of their path, we hope they neither forget Harvard nor their years spent on this campus. In a very real sense, today is their true commencement, when they enter the world armed with a degree and a sense of hopefulness for the future. That community is what they are commenced into today. It may seem strange to say it on this day of all days, but never is it more true: welcome to Harvard.Congratulations, Class of 2016!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her annual Baccalaureate address Tuesday, University President Drew G. Faust entreated soon-to-be College graduates to tell their own stories à la the musical “Hamilton”—but “don’t forget from whence you came.”
With more than 1,000 graduating seniors packed into the pews of Memorial Church, Faust delivered an alternately lighthearted and serious recap of the Class of 2016’s tenure at Harvard. During her address, she mused on memories from The Game to the mumps.
Faust also poked fun at herself with a jocular nod to the “Holiday Placemat for Social Justice” that sparked controversy on campus last December.
“Now this is a daunting task, especially since over the course of four years, I have succeeded in disconcerting people on all sides of many issues that you will soon be discussing with parents and grandparents over dinner,” Faust said, opening her address. “So in addition to a speech, for handy reference, I’ve created a placemat for Commencement, filled with useful phrases such as, ‘it’s final club without an ‘s.’”
In the more pensive second half of her address, Faust drew on the musical Hamilton, centering her remarks on the rhetorical question posed in the song “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story.”
“Who will tell your story? You,” she said.
Urging students to “not throw away your shot,” Faust recounted words of wisdom from the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes—who let nobody else finish his sentences, Faust said—and Congressman John R. Lewis, who joined Faust in dedicating a plaque earlier this year to four enslaved persons who lived and worked on Harvard’s campus.
“Titus, Venus, Bilhah, Juba. Their lives changed our story. After three centuries, they have a voice,” Faust said. “They, too, are Harvard.”
The annual Baccalaureate service, which Faust described as an “ancient and curious custom,” kicks off three days of Commencement exercises. The service opened with a series of prayers, hymns, and readings in an array of languages, as well as a brief salutation from Jonathan L. Walton, the Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals.
Beginning around 1:45 p.m., the Class of 2016—donning billowing black robes—snaked around the Yard and into the Church, pausing for the occasional photo.
“I’m paying tuition—her job is to smile, wave, and be nice when I’m taking pictures!” said Marian S. Bleeke, aiming a camera at her daughter Laura M. Bleeke ’16.
Actress Rashida L. Jones ’97 will address the graduating seniors at the College’s Class Day on Wednesday, while renowned filmmaker Steven Spielberg will speak at Harvard’s 365th Commencement Thursday.

Former Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde will move out of Mather House at the end of June, unsure of what lies ahead after stepping down from his administrative post in the middle of this academic year.
“I’m hoping it will be a job where I see students everyday,” Lassonde said, adding that he hopes to find a similar position to the one he held in the Office of Student Life, and expects to hear back from academic employers in the next few weeks.
In an email to undergraduates sent in late January, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana announced that Lassonde—who had led the Office of Student Life since 2013—would step down from his post on Feb. 1. The email did not cite any reason for the departure. Although Lassonde departed from his administrative role, he stayed on for a semester as a lecturer in the History Department.
Standing on the balcony of the 19th floor of Mather, where Lassonde has lived and been actively involved over the course of his tenure, he reflected positively on his time at the College.
“The thing that I will miss most when I leave here are the students,” Lassonde said. “It’s a thrill to be able to teach such talented and engaged people, I love it.”
During his time at Harvard, Lassonde oversaw a spike in administrative funding and programming for undergraduate social life. Lassonde said the development is representative of a larger national trend in higher education of increasing administrative oversight of students’ social lives.
“The larger national trend is increasing diversification, and the admissions office at every institution that knows what it’s doing is looking at the next 20 to 30 years and what the trends are and trying to show that in the accommodations they have for their students,” Lassonde said. “Harvard’s absolutely a part of that.”
However, as universities increase their programming and oversight over social life, Lassonde emphasized the need for administrators to “be very explicit about what your aims are.”
Looking back on his time as a lecturer and Dean of Student Life, Lassonde offered a number of suggestions for students.
“These selective institutions are by nature attracting competitive people who are thinking about what’s coming next but aren’t focusing on who’s sitting across from them at the dining hall table,” Lassonde said. “One thing I tell students that just goes in one ear and out the other is just look across the table and have a conversation.”
In an email, Lassonde added that he is currently writing a book about “the changing relationship of American children to authority during the 20th century.”
The College has yet to announce a permanent head of the Office of the Student Life. Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman is currently serving as interim Dean of Student Life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joining a host of critics, former University President Lawrence H. Summers denounced Harvard’s new sanctions for members of single-gender social organizations as inconsistent with values of free association and academic freedom.
The sanctions, announced earlier this month, will bar members of single-gender social organizations such as fraternities, sororities, and final clubs from holding leadership positions at in recognized groups and receiving College endorsement for top fellowships, beginning with the Class of 2021.
In an interview with The Crimson, Summers, who is a University Professor, criticized the change, arguing that the University should not legislate the views and values of its students, even as he acknowledged a personal distaste with final clubs.
“If I had a child at Harvard, I would strongly discourage my child from being a member of a final club,” Summers said. “That said, I think the freedom of association is a profoundly important value and I think the idea that we would condition fellowship letters or the opportunity to be elected by one’s peers as captain of a football team on agreement with certain values is inconsistent with the central values of an academic institution.”
Summers is neither the first to make similar arguments against the new sanctions, nor the first former administrator to challenge them. In a private letter to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68  wrote that sanctions may engender “a College culture of fear and anxiety about nonconformity.”
Summers also said that pushing the organizations to become co-ed could actually bolster their influence over campus life while not resolving some other issues with the groups.
“There are many troubling aspects of final clubs.  There is the risk that as they move to co-ed admissions in some form they will grow and come to have a larger and in some ways more problematic impact on College social life,” Summers said.
Since the announcement of the sanctions, University President Drew G. Faust, Harvard Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72, Corporation treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75, and several athletic coaches, have supported the changes, arguing the sanctions are efforts to combat gender discrimination and exclusivity on campus.
“Although the fraternities, sororities, and final clubs are not formally recognized by the College, they play an unmistakable and growing role in student life, in many cases enacting forms of privilege and exclusion at odds with our deepest values,” Faust wrote in a letter to Khurana accepting his proposed changes. “The College cannot ignore these organizations if it is to advance our shared commitment to broadening opportunity and making Harvard a campus for all of its students.”
In the coming year, a committee of students, faculty, and administrators will work to determine how the new policy will be enforced.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 25, 2016, at 3:51 p.m.
Twelve professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences submitted a motion Monday resolving that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join,” a proposal that if passed would stand in opposition to the College's sanctions against students involved in final clubs or Greek life.
The professors argued that the College should not penalize students for their involvement in “political parties with which they affiliate, nor social, political or other affinity groups they join, as long as those organizations, parties, or groups have not been judged to be illegal.”
The motion comes in the wake of recently announced sanctions against unrecognized single-gender social organizations, which have drawn widespread criticism from members of those groups, national media outlets, and former top Harvard administrators. Starting with the Class of 2021, undergraduate members of such groups—including male and female final clubs as well as sororities and fraternities—will be ineligible for leadership posts in recognized clubs and Harvard endorsement for top fellowships like the Rhodes. 
The motion, a copy of which was obtained by The Crimson, marks the most vocal faculty opposition to the new sanctions to date.  Faculty who signed the draft motion argued that the College has historically avoided regulating undergraduate participation in organizations that are not Harvard-affiliated, despite setting some rules for student behavior.
“Students may exercise their civil right to free assembly without fear that Harvard will disadvantage them because they have joined an organization that does not comply with Harvard policies,” the group of 12 professors—which includes a former Dean of the College and prominent faculty in the Psychology and Computer Science Departments—wrote.
Referencing 1992 Faculty legislation on ROTC, the motion argued that the precedent of avoiding extending Harvard’s non-discrimination policies “beyond its proper boundaries” should be clarified.
“These ‘proper boundaries’ were not specified in the 1992 legislation, probably because they went without saying. Recent administrative proposals suggest that there is uncertainty about the limits of Harvard’s control over students’ lives,” they wrote. “We therefore believe that this legislation, based on University precedent, history, and practice, is needed to protect the rights of current and future students—and, indeed, by extension, the rights of current and future faculty and staff.”
Since  Khurana announced the sanctions, a host of top administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, Harvard Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72, and Corporation treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 have defended the new policy as a step towards eliminating gender discrimination on campus.
Still, others have been more skeptical. The draft motion is not the first time Harvard faculty have castigated the new sanctions on final clubs and Greek life. Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 recently wrote a private letter to Khurana sharply critiquing the sanctions as a bridge too far in attempting to rein in the clubs, though he wrote he found some of the clubs “noxious.” Lewis is also a signatory of the draft motion.
A committee of faculty, administrators, and students will work out the extensive logistics of how the College will enforce the sanctions. It is unclear whether the sanctions will require a change in the student handbook; the FAS Faculty must approve any changes to the student handbook each year.
Although the motion does not explicitly mention the new policy, Government professor Eric M. Nelson ’99, one of the motion’s signatories, wrote in an email that “The alarming implications of this new policy extend well beyond the issue of final clubs.”
“It should seem obvious that any such policy would pose a grave threat to academic freedom,” Nelson added.
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, one of the 12 professors who signed on to the motion, said in an interview that “obviously there’s a difference in approach between the resolution and the other matter.”
Thomas declined to comment specifically on the sanctions or which of the 12 professors originally decided to write the motion.
James Sidanius and Daniel E. Lieberman, both professors on Faculty Council, the body that sets the agenda for each of the monthly Faculty meetings, said earlier this month they had not been briefed on the new policy ahead of its announcement.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not specify earlier this month whether the Faculty Council had been briefed on the sanction, but wrote in an email that “the College developed these recommendations with careful deliberation.”
Biology professor Richard M. Losick, one of the motion’s signatories, said that although he had discussed the sanctions informally with colleagues since the announcement, he was not aware that administrators consulted faculty on the policy. Losick added that he was “no fan” of final clubs, but worried that administrators’s actions represented a threat to the “fundamental right of freedom of association.”
“The action from the Dean and approved by the President was taken without consultation with the Faculty,” Losick said, adding that he found it “disappointing that there was not an opportunity for it to be discussed among the faculty before such new procedures were put into place.”
FAS Spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an email that the motion “will be brought to the attention”of the Docket Committee when they next meet this fall.
Khurana declined to comment for this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 25, 2016 at 8:43 p.m.
After a chaotic year capped by a set of controversial sanctions, leadership of Harvard’s unrecognized single-gender social organizations are carefully weighing next steps as they head into the summer.
Although many clubs and greek organizations are adopting a wait-and-see approach, some have already adopted major changes or plans to reform membership policies, some even before the sanctions were announced.
The Porcellian Club, Harvard’s oldest final club has opted to hold an “open” punch in the fall, according to a private April 15 letter from the graduate president of the Porcellian Club to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana obtained by The Crimson.
Punch, which has typically been an invite-only affair, is the weeks-long process by which final clubs add new members each fall. Now, the Porcellian and the A.D. Club—which detailed plans for an ‘open’ punch earlier this semester—will reform that system. Still, neither the A.D. nor the Porcellian has announced any plans to go co-ed, a change Khurana has repeatedly urged of all single-gender clubs.
Eugenia B. Schraa ’04, co-founder of the currently all-female Sablière Society, said in an interview that the club was “committed to going gender-neutral.” Conversations about such a move have occurred since before the sanctions.
The Fox Club, meanwhile, remains tentatively co-ed club, a distinction that could change depending on the results of a future graduate vote. While Fox undergraduates elected women to their ranks last fall, they bypassed official graduate approval, prompting bitter internal divisions and a faction known as the “Friends of the Fox.”
In a negotiated settlement, the female, and subsequently many of the male, undergraduates accepted “provisional” membership, leaving their long-term member status up to an alumni vote. Because a co-ed move, according to alumni, constitute a change to “would change the fundamental nature or character of the Club,” a vote to go gender neutral must be approved by a two-thirds majority of alumni.
For Harvard’s female final clubs, which are much younger and do not all own property, mergers may be the preferred method. Besides the Pleiades Society, which sent an email to alumnae reaffirming their commitment to staying all-female, the other four women’s clubs have either publicly expressed their willingness to go gender-neutral or have met with at least one all-male club to explore a possible merger.
Leaders of the all-female Bee, IC, and La Vie clubs have met with Delphic leadership to explore the possibility of a merger, according to a May letter from leadership of the all-male Delphic Club to alumni and obtained by The Crimson.
The Delphic, unlike many other clubs, would only require an undergraduate vote to go co-ed, though there seems to be little appetite among the club’s current student members for such a move, according to the letter. 
“Although they have not been solicited in any comprehensive way, we believe that a healthy majority of the undergraduates would not vote to punch women or merge with a Female Club if such a vote were held today,” wrote Delphic graduate president John R.S. Jacobsson ’90 and vice president David S. DeSimone ’98, “although they recognize that they may be forced to do so depending on the steps taken by Harvard in the future.”
One sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, chose not to renew the lease on their 64 Church Street rental property when it expires this August.
“The chapter and their House Board are currently exploring other options,” Kappa national spokesperson Elizabeth Bailey wrote in an email. Bailey wrote that the decision was not a direct result of the sanctions, but rather that the property is transitioning to commercial use. Bailey declined to comment on whether Kappa would conduct recruitment as planned, deferring to Cambridge Panhellenic Council President Rose P. Traubert ’16, who could not be reached for comment.
Harvard’s sanctions, which will first take effect for students in the Class of 2021, will bar members of single-gender social organizations from leadership positions and certain prestigious fellowships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David M. Rubenstein, a billionaire investor and philanthropist, will replace Nannerl O. Keohane on the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, beginning in July 2017.
Keohane became a member of the Corporation, which oversees a number of major University decisions, including the selection of Harvard’s President, in 2005; she has served longer than anyone else on the body, including University President Drew G. Faust. Keohane was the president of both Wellesley College and Duke University.
While Rubenstein, the co-founder of private equity firm The Carlyle Group, did not attend Harvard, he has been a notable donor to the University. He serves as one of the co-chairs of Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, which recently passed its goal of $6.5 billion. Rubenstein is also the chair of Harvard’s Global Advisory Council.
“Harvard is a truly unique global institution of higher learning and cutting-edge research, and I am humbled to be associated with such an institution in this way,” Rubenstein said in a statement. “I hope John Harvard would approve.”
With Rubenstein, every single member of the Harvard Corporation, the oldest corporation in North America, has been selected during Faust’s tenure. In 2010, the Corporation announced a number of reforms to its membership, creating term limits and expanding the size of the body from seven to 13.
Rubenstein will step down from his position as chair of Duke University’s board of trustees in July 2017, the end of his term. Rubenstein’s appointment comes less than a year after Corporation member and University treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68 unexpectedly died; Shirley M. Tilghman, a former President of Princeton, assumed his spot last December.

On May 4, 2015, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sat down in Cabot House’s Senior Common Room with graduate leaders of Harvard’s eight male final clubs.
For years, administrators had used meetings with club leadership to ensure the groups were abreast of the College’s alcohol and sexual assault policies. From the start of his deanship, though, Khurana took a drastically different approach. Confidential meeting notes later circulated by the College made clear administrators’ vision for the single-gender final clubs: co-ed groups with open application processes.
Just over one year after that meeting, on May 6 2016, University President Drew G. Faust accepted recommendations from Khurana that laid out an unprecedented policy. Starting with the Class of 2021, members of all unrecognized single-gender social organizations—including male final clubs, female final clubs, fraternities, and sororities—will be ineligible for leadership positions in recognized groups and will be barred from receiving College endorsement for coveted fellowships like the Rhodes.
Despite functionally reversing Harvard’s near-three decade long stance towards unrecognized social groups, administrators have remained tight-lipped on the process behind the sanctions. In the aftermath of the policy announcement, certain alumni, male clubs, and women in female final clubs and sororities castigated the College’s decision, with many calling for its reversal. Though Khurana wrote in his letter announcing the sanctions that he developed the policy with “careful deliberation,” he publicly offered few details on what the letter referred to as over two years of engagement with stakeholders.
But more than 100 pages of private meeting notes, emails, letters, as well as interviews with administrators and club members reveal that the process of creating the policy has been anything but smooth.
Marked by tense meetings, allegations of arm-twisting from the Dean of the College, and charges of misusing survey data to argue for co-ed policies, many clubs argued that Khurana obfuscated his goals and relied on uncertainty while pressuring clubs to adopt gender neutral memberships. 
 In a private April 20 letter to Khurana obtained by The Crimson, the graduate board president of the Porcellian wrote that interactions between Khurana and final club representatives this year “have been—without meaning to cast any aspersions concerning motivation—protracted, fragmented, and adversarial.”
Khurana’s alleged tactics, the documents reveal, led to the structural implosion and frayed fundraising of one club that accepted women, public accusations of decanal conflict of interest, administrative silence, and a broad, visceral backlash to the sanctions. Citing the confidential nature of the meetings, Khurana, through College spokesperson Rachael Dane, declined to comment on any of the claims made against him for this article. Dane did send a statement referring to the meetings as “a cumulative effort and part of an ongoing dialogue led by the College to better understand the perspectives of students in unrecognized single-gender social organizations.”
As uncertainty mounts for the future of the College’s unrecognized single-gender groups, some clubs are looking to modify membership practices to avoid administrative ire. The oldest of the final clubs, for instance, the 225-year old Porcellian, plans to overturn years of tradition to adopt a fraternity-like policy of open application for male students.
But behind the scenes, several clubs are going to more extreme lengths: consulting lawyers, officially organizing alumni across single-gender groups, endorsing controversial candidates for top alumni-elected posts, and speaking out publicly in the hopes that Khurana will roll back a policy they say was built on fear and mistrust.
To understand the College’s relationship with the final clubs, it is best to start in 1984.
That year, the male clubs disaffiliated rather than accede to administrative demands that they accept women. Still, the groups remained a relevant part of the school’s social life, frequently hosting parties at multi-million dollar clubhouses located just steps from Harvard dormitories. While the groups enjoyed virtual autonomy, administrators were critical of them, sometimes publicly.
In 1998, then-Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, published a column in the Harvard Independent blasting some of the clubs for what he called their discriminatory practices and potentially dangerous atmosphere for women.
“[O]ver the years the Clubs have ceased to seek recognition and have evolved into organizations which enjoy their status outside the pale. No University recognition means no University supervision,” added Lewis, who wrote in a recent email that he stands by the column.
In the mid 2000s, the College began meeting regularly with the clubs to discuss safe partying practices and anti-hazing rules.  Former Office of Student Life administrator Judith H. Kidd said she conducted meetings with the clubs when the University first re-engaged with them. Some topics, though, were never broached.
“We did not go anywhere near their selection policies and anything like that,” Kidd said.
An agenda for a meeting between graduate leaders of some male clubs and then-Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister in 2013, for instance,  listed “brainstorm[ing] efforts to reduce harmful behaviors and impact of activities in the clubs that land back in the Houses,” but made no mention of club membership policies. To that end, representatives from the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services regularly briefed club leaders.
By the time Khurana assumed the Deanship, administrators and clubs had reached an uneasy, if stable, equilibrium. From his first meeting with club leaders, though, Khurana took his own tack.
Khurana reportedly asked club attendees at a fall 2014 meeting to think about “what their values are and the degree to which they align or don’t align with the mission of the College,” then-Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde told The Crimson shortly after the meeting.
The following spring, College administrators again urged clubs to reconsider their single-gender membership policies in a meeting, according to two attendees and confidential notes distributed by Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.
The tone of the meetings intensified the subsequent fall, the same semester that two historically all-male clubs added women to their membership for the first time.
By March 2016, Khurana called on undergraduate leaders of the groups to inform him by April 15 as to whether or not they planned on going co-ed. Two months later, Khurana announced his new sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, writing in an email to undergraduates that “the College must ensure that when it permits its resources to be expended, when it allows its name to be used, and when it endorses the actions of its students, it does so in a way that is consonant with its core value of nondiscrimination.”
In the wake of the announcements, though, one of his predecessors argued that he had strayed too far from standard administrative practices towards the clubs.
“It seems to me that you are breaking dangerous new ground in articulating this standard and in interpreting it to disqualify students from captaincies and leadership positions,” Lewis wrote in a private letter to Khurana that was obtained by The Crimson.
As clubs met with the College, administrators frequently emphasized their fears of sexual assault on the off-campus properties, later using statistics published in a University-wide report on sexual assault prevention released in early March to argue that the groups played an outsized role in sexual violence on campus.
In an email sent ahead of a March 29 meeting with club undergraduates, Friedrich asked attendees to read through the University’s sexual assault prevention report and an article written about it titled “A Rare Focus on All-Male Groups.”
Released in early March, the report blasted all-male clubs for reports of “deeply misogynistic” attitudes, which, the report argued, contributed to a climate of sexual assault. Of the 20-page report, three were devoted solely to final clubs, and while the task force wrote that the organizations were not “the exclusive or even the principal cause of sexual assault,” they could not “see any solution that does not involve addressing the disturbing practical and cultural implications they present in undergraduate life.”
But when Faust and Khurana announced club sanctions in May, they made few references to sexual assault, focusing instead on what Khurana called Harvard’s “long and complex history of grappling with gender discrimination.”
While administrators, according to a club’s internal notes on three meetings, have always voiced concern about gender equity and social inclusion, many club leaders argue that Harvard conflated these issues with sexual assault in an attempt to make a stronger case for co-ed membership practices.
Male clubs have repeatedly attempted to limit the conversation solely to addressing sexual assault. The evening before Faust announced the new policy, for instance, leaders of the eight traditionally all-male clubs sent a letter to Khurana expressing their unanimous support for certain recommendations from the Task Force report, such as mandatory sexual assault prevention training for all students and training on hosting safe parties.
 When the final policy was released, Fly Club graduate president Richard T. Porteus ’78 argued that the administration had abandoned efforts to address sexual assault completely.
“We’ve arrived at the point that to prevent sexual assault, the number one plan is to prevent sorority sisters from becoming Rhodes scholars,” Porteus said.
That was not the first time Porteus, or other clubs, charged administrators with conflating three issues that, in their minds, were separate: sexual assault, gender equity, and social exclusivity. In a Sept. 17 2015 meeting between male graduate leaders and administrators, Porteus said he explicitly raised this concern.
In multiple private letters to Khurana obtained by The Crimson, the Porcellian Club called on the College to focus efforts on sexual assault prevention and avoid pressuring the groups to go co-ed.
On Oct. 1 2015, the leadership of the Porcellian club suggested that Khurana “separate the critical issues of sexual assault and sexual harassment from other concerns with which they have recently been conflated.”
Half a year and multiple letters later, an April 15 letter to Khurana from the Porcellian charged that the administration “continues to conflate its reservations about men’s and women’s single-sex organizations with the different and much broader issue of sexual misconduct, distracting its community from a critical challenge.”
At a rally protesting Harvard’s sanctions on May 9, more than 200 undergraduate women also implied that the administration’s policy was not well-equipped to address sexual assault, with many women chanting “sexual assault is not our fault.”
Eugenia B. Schraa ’04, a former Crimson editor and co-founder of the all-female Sablière Society, said she also found it difficult to understand the logic behind forcing a co-ed change as a means of reducing sexual assault.
“How does forcing clubs to go co-ed, how does that reduce the prevalence of sexual assault? I’m not sure,” Schraa said.
In their criticisms of administrative conflation, Porteus and the Porcellian went so far as to question the statistical and methodological  integrity of the University’s March  report on sexual assault prevention. That report, citing survey data, reported that 47 percent of female undergraduate seniors participating in final clubs had experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact”—compared to an average of 31 percent for all senior women at the College.
“The report is embarrassingly slanted, it really shouldn’t bear anywhere on it the name of a university that has ‘Veritas’ as its motto,” Porteus said.
The Porcellian publicly charged that the report conflated sexual assault and other issues in a statement from then-graduate president of the Porcellian Charles M. Storey ’82 to The Crimson on April 12. The statement, particularly one sentence on the risk of sexual assault if clubs went co-ed, drew widespread controversy, leading to Storey’s resignation.
A month later, on April 27, the Porcellian Club commissioned Jora B. Stixrud, an economist with the Welch Consulting group, to write a statistical analysis of Harvard’s report. Stixrud’s analysis, which the graduate board president of the Porcellian sent privately to Khurana, questioned the task force’s methodology and conclusions. In that analysis, she accused the University of conflating correlation and causation, concluding that the report’s much-touted 47 percent statistic did “not provide any meaningful information about whether there is any relationship between Final Clubs and nonconsensual sexual contact.”
In a Washington Post op-ed, Caitlin Flanagan, a contributing editor at The Atlantic who has written extensively on fraternity culture, voiced similar doubts, writing that “it would be almost impossible to concoct a more meaningless statistic” than the 47 percent figure.
In the face of these criticisms, the University has stood by its report. Chair of the task force for sexual assault prevention and response and former University Provost Steven E. Hyman wrote in a statement that “the extensive qualitative data gathered at scores of meetings with Harvard undergraduates” bolstered the statistical claims.
“While the combined data shows that sexual assault has many antecedents—leading the Task Force to make a diversity of recommendations—the Task Force  could hardly ignore the significantly heightened risk to female students that was associated with Final Club activities,” Hyman added.
Faust also defended the report in the wake of the Porcellian-commissioned analysis.
“I think we were pretty clear about a very fundamental reality in statistics which is very rare that you show causation. You show correlation, and correlation alerts you to realities that bear further inquiry and consideration,” Faust said in early May. “That’s very much the attitude that I think was expressed in the analysis of the task force report.”
Schuyler H. Daum ’12, an alumna of the all-female IC club, told The Crimson in April that the findings of the report were consistent with her experience as an undergraduate.
“Studies show that women who are in sororities are more likely to be sexually assaulted in college—presumably because they are more likely to end up in alcohol-rich, single-sex environments,” Daum said. “This same dynamic is playing out at Harvard for women who participate in final clubs.”
Still, even some students supportive of the sanctions do not think they will properly address sexual assault.
“I think the policy claims that its acting in the name of sexual assault prevention,which I don’t think is something that it can effectively accomplish as it stands,” said Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, who has previously called for administrators to dismantle final clubs. “I think the policy is trying to address exclusivity, without saying that that’s what it’s doing.”
Shortly after a March 29, 2016 meeting where Khurana requested that undergraduate leaders notify him of potential plans to go co-ed by April 15,  Sablière graduate president Ariel Stoddard ’10 sent a message to  the Dean emphasizing that undergraduates needed approval from graduate leaders to enact major changes.
“Whether or not they wish to, our undergraduate leadership cannot execute significant organizational changes alone,” Stoddard wrote in her April 4 email obtained by The Crimson. “Going forward, communications and requests for information regarding a potential major change to our organization should be directed at both a Graduate and Undergraduate Board representative.”
On multiple occasions this semester, Khurana has referred to final clubs, most of which are Massachusetts corporations with alumni officers responsible for finances and governance, as organizations “led by our students,” repeatedly asking undergraduate leaders to consider changing their membership policies. Club leaders, both graduate and undergraduate, charge that Khurana pressured undergraduates to break with their graduate leadership when deciding whether to adopt gender neutral membership.
When students and alumni met with administrators together, at an April 13 2016 meeting, for instance, Schraa said she was “surprised by the fear or the pressure that [undergraduates] had felt in the fall,” noting that one undergraduate woman said she was afraid that she would be expelled for her involvement in a club.
Throughout negotiations with the clubs this year, Khurana repeatedly refused to rule out pursuing a policy similar to Amherst College’s, which prohibits students from membership in “fraternity-like and sorority-like organizations.” Khurana’s insistence that nothing was “off the table” sparked fear among undergraduates, with student leaders of the Fox club telling graduates in a letter that their “individual reputations and careers” were in jeopardy if they did not satisfy Khurana’s request.
“In meetings last fall, [Khurana] suggested that Harvard has the power to prohibit its undergraduates from belonging to single-gender social organizations, including to the point of expelling undergraduates who did so,” the graduate president and vice president of  the all-male Delphic Club wrote in a recent May letter to alumni that was obtained by The Crimson.
 Laying out a legal defense of the single-gender clubs, A.D. Club graduate member Walter L. Foulke ’61 argued in a private memo that the groups could consider invalidating any Harvard policy barring enrollment in the organizations by arguing that administrators had created an atmosphere of extreme “duress.”
Undergraduates of the Sablière Society this fall went as far as voting to go co-ed before their graduate board stepped in to prevent the change, according to Schraa. Since even before the announcement of the sanctions, Sablière leaders have indicated an interest in adopting gender-neutral membership policies, Schraa said.
While Khurana issued an April 15 deadline to all clubs in the spring, undergraduates of the Fox Club wrote that the Dean imposed an explicit Nov. 1 deadline in the fall as well.
A letter from Fox undergraduates and private meeting notes taken by one club report that Khurana requested information on possible co-ed plans for the purpose of crafting policy recommendations. Still, Fox undergraduates feared that failure to adopt co-ed practices by the given date could spur an administrative crackdown on club members.
Citing pressure from the administration and what they called a hard deadline for action, undergraduates of the Fox unilaterally chose to accept women in October. In a letter explaining their decision to graduate leadership, they referenced a longstanding desire among undergraduates for a co-ed move and the “tremendous pressure” applied by Khurana and other administrators.
The undergraduates’ decision to accept women without the approval of the graduate board created bitter internal division, ultimately giving rise to the “Friends of the Fox,” a group of alumni staunchly opposed to the co-ed move and angered by the undergraduates’s decision to forego graduate board approval.
After the Friends of the Fox called on the graduate board to roll back the undergraduates’s changes, then-graduate board member Rex G. Baker ’05 drove to the clubhouse on Oct. 29 and convinced undergraduates to accept a “grand compromise,” according to an email Baker later wrote to other Fox graduates describing the process. The undergraduate-elected women became “provisional” members whose permanent fate will be determined by a graduate board vote.
When Khurana was asked in the fall to respond to the Fox undergraduates’ letter, he declined to comment on its depiction of his actions.
Khurana’s decision not to comment was one of many times—he also declined comment on this story—that he refused to publicly discuss communications with clubs, saying such meetings are confidential. But even in private, many female and male club leaders argue, Khurana played his cards close to his chest, leaving groups to guess at his eventual actions.
In advance of the April 13 meeting, for instance, Porteus sent Khurana and other College administrators an email expressing  frustration that after a “full year” of meetings with administrators, “no details” had emerged. In the email, Porteus requested yes or no answers to four questions on whether and how Khurana might impose sanctions on single-gender clubs.  “In order to foster transparency within the Harvard community on a topic that has been an ongoing source of speculation,” Porteus sent a copy of the letter to a Crimson reporter. According to Porteus and three other meeting attendees, he did not receive definitive answers to any question at that meeting.
In an interview in early May, Faust disagreed with the notion that Khurana has not been transparent, defending his approach as a process of soliciting opinion.
“I don’t think Dean Khurana has been hiding anything. I think he’s been talking with people in the course of the year in order to develop an approach,” Faust said. “So it’s been a matter of interchange rather than he’s been sitting there hiding the ball on something.”
Still, Schraa said the administration’s messaging “has been very vague and unclear,” though she said that administrative opaqueness could reflect an honest uncertainty over which course of action to pursue.
Indeed, over the course of the year, administrators suggested the formation of policies markedly different from the one eventually announced.
In the fall, according to notes taken by one club during a one-on-one call with the Dean, Khurana suggested that a potential policy could differentiate between single-gender organizations that have no interaction with non-members, and groups that throw parties or otherwise influence broader campus culture.
Even as late as April 15, a private email from Associate Dean Friedrich to club leaders suggested that groups that did not interact with outside members might be treated differently under any policy Khurana recommended.
“If clubs intend to remain single gender private organizations, it will help to understand what a private club would look like from your perspective and what policies would be put in place to eliminate external impacts on the campus,” Friedrich wrote, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Crimson.
Reaction to the sanctions from national greek organizations suggest that some groups were unaware that they could be affected. Jonathan M. Pierce, a national spokesperson for the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, said on May 6 that AEPi had not suspected it would be the target of any sanctions.
The timeline surrounding Khurana’s policy actions has been a topic of confusion for single-gender groups. According to the Fox’s fall letter, Khurana told undergraduates that the University was preparing a report set to be released before the spring semester and that his recommendations to superiors were due by November 1. One club’s notes from the Sept. 17 meeting say that Khurana told clubs he would be “asked to report” within two weeks on where the clubs were in the process of going co-ed.
In March, months later than initially projected, the University released its report on sexual assault prevention and Faust requested that Khurana develop recommendations by the end of the academic year. Khurana released his policy recommendations for the clubs on May 6.
Adding to club leaders’ confusion were questions surrounding who in the administration would make the final policy decision and where the impetus for such a policy was coming from. A set of meeting notes from one club, for instance, reported that Khurana listed four parties that would have to approve policy: Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science Michael D. Smith, the Office of General Council, President Faust, and the Harvard Corporation.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal, citing an OGC policy against commenting on specific interactions, declined to comment on whether OGC approved the policy, adding that “OGC is regularly consulted on a wide range of institutional issues that could have a legal dimension to them.”
Legal experts disagree as to the viability of a potential suit challenging the policy. Timothy M. Burke, an attorney with experience representing Greek organizations, said that while he saw grounds for a suit, he thought Harvard’s attorneys had looked carefully at the sanctions on single-gender organizations.
The Corporation, meanwhile, regularly consults Khurana on final clubs, according to William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow.
“[Khurana] and [Faust] involved us very early in the process in identifying the issues, the ramifications of the issues, and the possible solutions,” said Lee, adding that he supported Khurana’s final recommendations. “I think [Khurana] came and met with us three or four times on the sexual assault survey, the Harvard-specific results for finals clubs.”
According to notes on the Sept. 17 meeting taken by one club, Khurana said he had convinced top administrators to “give clubs a chance,” adding that he was one of few top officials who took that position. Khurana, through College spokesperson Rachael Dane, declined to comment on the meeting notes. Beyond his superiors at the University, club leaders say Khurana listed another source of pressure to reform the clubs’ practices: the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which is currently investigating the College’s compliance with Title IX, an anti-gender discrimination law.
 According to a club’s Sept. 17 meeting notes, Porteus, and the Fox Club’s letter, Khurana repeatedly referenced the ongoing Title IX investigation and the accompanying risk of losing federal funding if Harvard could not control the behavior of the off-campus, independently-owned final clubs.
University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides did not say outright that Harvard was responsible under Title IX for its off-campus clubs, and the Office for Civil Rights declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.  Karvonides noted that Harvard’s sexual harassment policy and procedures includes off-campus conduct in its jurisdiction. Karvonides said she considers the final clubs in terms of how actions there might have a “spillover effect” on campus.
"On one hand, the final clubs are really part of the social fabric of the College,” Karvonides said. “But they're independent of the University.”
In the wake of the policy announcement, a host of critics have made their displeasure known. While many of the policy’s detractors are themselves members of single-gender social organizations, independent media outlets and former high-ranking Harvard officials have also weighed in. Even beyond one of Khurana’s predecessors, former Dean of the College Lewis, former University President Lawrence H. Summers also came out against the sanctions. Despite taking issue with aspects of final club culture, Summers said sanctions are a step too far.
“If I had a child at Harvard, I would strongly discourage my child from being a member of a final club,” Summers said. “That said, I think the freedom of association is a profoundly important value and I think the idea that we would condition fellowship letters or the opportunity to be elected by one's peers as captain of a football team on agreement with certain values is inconsistent with the central values of an academic institution.”
In the midst of these public responses, College administrators have tried to privately maintain contact with undergraduate and graduate leaders of single-gender groups. The Sunday after sanctions were announced, Khurana reportedly met with student leaders of some single-gender clubs. Friedrich, meanwhile, has been scheduling phone calls with leaders of other groups.
In one such conference call between Friedrich and Sablière leaders, Schraa said, administrators implied possible support from the College for clubs willing to go gender-neutral. On that call, Schraa said Assistant Dean of Student Life for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña told Sablière leaders that being “risk-taking” under the new policy would yield benefits.
In an email, dela Peña expanded on the call, writing that while Sablière leaders may fear “what would happen to their membership as well as their organizational mission and goals” were they to go gender neutral, “it's also an opportunity for the Sab to be an example of how it can be done in a thoughtful and principled way.”
Dela Peña added that the College was ready to “provide guidance and support” for a gender-neutral move.
Friedrich, who was also on the call, floated the possibility of “financial support or access to space,” for groups that went gender-neutral, according to Schraa, though she said Friedrich would not go into specifics. Friedrich also declined to elaborate in an emailed statement to The Crimson, though he wrote that the College invites organizations transitioning to gender neutral membership “to let us know what would help them make such a transition.”
Still, many social clubs are not holding their breath for tangible news from administrators, instead focusing their efforts on mounting opposition to the new sanctions by reforming internal policies and organizing external action.
Private email correspondences obtained by The Crimson indicate that members of at least one final club and one sorority circulated information on a controversial, and recently-failed, Overseers ticket which has publicly denounced the College’s recent sanctions. That ticket, calling themselves “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,” has faced backlash for its central platform of eliminating tuition at the College and criticisms of race-based affirmative action.  Ron K. Unz ’83, a candidate on that ticket, has also faced criticism for donations to a “quasi-white nationalist” group.
Beyond taking to Overseers’ ballots, some final club members are coalescing to form an alumni “Special Interest Group,” which the Alumni Association describes as “any collection of Harvard University alumni who actively engage in communicating and/or gathering around a central unifying purpose, mission, background, or activity beyond class affiliation or regional proximity.”
Currently, various final club graduate leaders are gauging interest in a Special Interest Group centered around defending undergraduate involvement in unrecognized single-gender social organizations without threat of punishment or sanctions. To form a Special Interest Group, at least 50 alumni must receive approval from HAA after drawing up articles of incorporation, bylaws, and a constitution. So far, about 20 alumni of various single-gender social groups have signed on, according to an online spreadsheet obtained by The Crimson.
While the Sablière has indicated its interest in adopting gender neutral membership policies, other clubs, like the all-female Pleiades Society, are committed to remaining single-gender at all costs. In an email to alumni, Pleiades leadership wrote that the club was “resolute in [its] commitment” to its current membership policies.
 In the fall, the formerly all-male Spee club, in an historic move, elected women into its membership, officially going co-ed. Graduate leaders of the Spee did not respond to request for comment for this story.
Other clubs, like the currently all-male Delphic Club, have come down somewhere in the middle. Unlike many other clubs, Delphic undergraduates could independently go co-ed because “neither the Club’s constitution nor its by-laws requires that members be male,” according to a May letter sent to club alumni by graduate president John R.S. Jacobsson ’90 and graduate vice-president David S. DeSimone ’98. The letter estimated that current undergraduate members would not vote to elect women or merge with a female group by “a healthy majority.”
Some all-male clubs have reacted to administrative pressure by tightening their guest policies and loosening their punch—the process by which clubs invite specific students to apply for membership. Earlier this spring the A.D. Club, after strongly opposing a co-ed move in the fall, adopted a members-only policy and announced an “open” punch process for men to be held this fall. In a private April 15 letter to Khurana, the Porcellian Club, the oldest of the final clubs, announced their intention to host an open punch this fall as well.
In their letter, Delphic leaders DeSimone and Jacobson wrote that their undergraduates “will consider” hosting an open punch this fall. DeSimone and Jacobson also reiterated their members-only rules, which the Delphic  instituted in the fall of 2013.
Still, members-only policies are not always strictly enforced. While the Delphic technically operates under a no-guest policy, a party last week resulted in the closing of the clubhouse, according to a notice posted in a window the next day.
According to the Delphic’s letter, they are also actively considering a merger with a female club, and have already had “introductory meetings” with the all-female Bee, IC, and La Vie clubs. Graduate leaders of those clubs either did not respond or declined requests for public comment for this story.
And even at the Fox, the fate of its undergraduate membership remains precarious, as women— like many of their male peers elected this year—only enjoy provisional status. Meanwhile, fundraising has dropped off noticeably. Fox Club records show that earlier this spring, the club was over $10,000 behind in its projected alumni donations, leading the club to dip into its trust fund.
In anticipation of a vote on whether the club will accept its provisional members this summer, Fox leaders conducted an extensive poll this spring to assess undergraduate and graduate members’ opinions on the issue. The results of the survey have yet to be announced. Because graduates have deemed that a co-ed move would alter the “fundamental nature or character of the Club,” the vote this summer must approve going co-ed by a two-thirds majority.
Whether graduates vote in favor of the provisional members or not, there is little indication that the results of the vote will unify the fractured club. The Fox’s single-gender peers could see a similarly tumultuous future. With the possibility of litigation on the horizon and the committee tasked with implementing Harvard’s policy yet to be appointed, final clubs will have little time to catch their breath before reaching crucial junctures in their respective histories.
And as clubs work to decide their future, the administration is showing no signs of dialing back the pressure.
In roughly a year, Khurana will submit the first of three annual reports to Faust investigating “whether the College should be considering any further action to advance our core institutional values.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has raised $230 million for the renewal of the College’s upperclassman Houses as of March 31, according to a strategic assessment report released Tuesday.
The figure puts Harvard a little more than halfway towards its $450 million fundraising goal for the project, one of the key priorities of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ ongoing $2.5 billion capital campaign. FAS had raised $197 million for the House renewal project as of last August.
Early on in the capital campaign, House renewal lacked the fundraising momentum of other core FAS priorities, such as funding for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and for faculty research and hiring. Last year, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith explained that it was difficult to articulate a vision for the project before the first construction projects were completed. 
“While valiant efforts were made, even the best renderings and visualizations did not capture the changed experience of students living and learning in renewed Houses,” the report reads. Since Dunster House opened its doors this fall after a nearly 15-month long construction process, administrators have used it as a platform for pitching the House renewal project, hosting events and tours for alumni and donors.
The fundraising progress was fueled by a number of large gifts. Fifty million dollars was raised through a fundraising challenge established in 2012 by leading University donor Glenn H. Hutchins ’77, $10 million was gifted by an unnamed donor to name the Faculty Dean’s Residence at Eliot House in April, and an undisclosed sum was donated by Robert M. Beren ’47, for whom a new five-story hall in Winthrop is to be named.
Tuesday’s report also detailed the general funding model for the House renewal project, which could cost as much as $1.3 billion in total. According to the report, in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, FAS decapitalized its endowment to ensure that the projects in Quincy House, Leverett House, and Dunster House would be completed on schedule. This use of decapped endowments, however, came at a high long-term price. Since the income associated with those endowment funds was lost forever, decapitalization will remove approximately $25 million in “available cash” from the FAS’ operating budget by the completion of the House renewal project.
“The operating impact is compounded by the House Renewal funding model’s focus on utilizing unrestricted endowments and Dean’s Reserves,” the report adds. “By using these two resources, the School’s most flexible resources are being depleted, which will limit the Dean’s abilities to invest in other strategic and academic priorities and contribute heavily to FAS-projected deficits.”
According to the report, this funding model has completely used up FAS’ unrestricted reserves, valued at $112 million in the 2013 fiscal year. Costs of future House renewal projects are also expected to grow up to seven percent per year over the next five years because of rising construction prices.
The report also highlighted lessons learned from the recent renovations of Dunster House, Quincy House’s Stone Hall, and Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall. Among the report’s suggestions are the elimination of hallway doubles and a potential increase in hallway singles in future projects, noting student demand for privacy. The report also recommends the creation of “signature spaces” in each House, spaces like Leverett House’s renewed Emerald Theater that would be open to students from other Houses while still contributing to each House’s distinct identity.
Construction on the next House renewal projects starts this summer with Winthrop House, and Lowell House is slated for renewal the following year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Actress Rashida L. Jones ’97, best known for her roles in TV sitcoms “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” mixed lighthearted memories of her time at Harvard with a call for political action in her speech at the Class of 2016’s Class Day Exercises.
Jones noted she is the first “second-generation” Class Day speaker, after her father, legendary record producer Quincy Jones, who spoke at her own Class Day in 1997. She began her speech by recounting memories from college she said have lasted a lifetime, from napping backstage in Sanders Theater as a member of a capella group the Opportunes, to napping in Lamont library.
“Hooking up with someone in Kirkland so I wouldn’t have to walk all the way back to Currier, hooking up with someone in Dunster A entry so I wouldn’t have to walk all the way back to Dunster C entry,” she continued. “In short, I really took advantage of the best Harvard had to offer.”
Her speech took on a more serious tone as she gave advice to the graduating class. She encouraged changing certain historical precedents at Harvard, specifically calling on the Hasty Pudding Theatricals—which has an all-male theater cast—to include women. In September,  a group of women auditioned for the annual production in protest, although the theater organization decided to remain all-male. Jones was a member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals while at Harvard.
 Jones also focused on national issues. She said that although celebrities are often told to “shut up” about politics, she believes there is too much at stake in the current election cycle for her to stay silent.
“Young unarmed black men are being killed in record numbers. States are passing laws that are systematically stripping away reproductive rights. A presidential candidate is encouraging his supporters to be violent and racist,” she said. “While we’re distracted with pretty Instagram shots of coffee and celebrity breakups, our freedoms are at risk of slipping away.”
Before Jones took the stage, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana also called for changing certain traditions as Harvard moves into the future. Earlier this month, Khurana recommended sweeping penalties on members of single-gender social organizations that will prevent future members from leading campus organizations and receiving College endorsement on top fellowships. Harvard President Drew G. Faust accepted the recommendations in her announcement of the policy.
Although Khurana did not mention the sanctions, he stressed the need for “inclusivity and belonging” at Harvard. The path towards a more inclusive modern-day College has “oftentimes been rocky” and was made possible “ by people seeking to balance tradition and change,” Khurana said.
Between Khurana and Jones, former Republican Club President Aaron I. Henricks ’16 gave the traditionally humorous Ivy Oration. Henricks poked fun at the social club sanctions and the membership changes instituted by some final clubs over the past year.
 At the beginning of his speech, Henricks invited the graduating class to join him on a trip to Mars, where they would be “disrupting the path and inspiring countless generations to come.”
“It’s like we’re new girl members of the Spee,” Henricks said.
“For those of you who might not know what the Spee is,” Henricks explained, “It’s a former single-sex, gender exclusive social space that’s now a gender inclusive, exclusive social space. Not to be confused with the current gender exclusive, social exclusive spaces—those are the bad ones.” The line was met with laughter and applause.
Henricks also took a moment to directly ask Khurana, who was seated on stage nearby, a question about the single-gender social organization sanctions.
“Do these sanctions apply to my bedroom?” Henricks asked. “Because it’s been single-sex exclusive for four years now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a speech during the Law School’s Class Day, Sarah Jessica Parker—renowned actress, businesswoman, and philanthropist—implored the members of the Law School’s Class of 2016 to pursue their dreams relentlessly after leaving Harvard.
A self-proclaimed odd choice for the school’s Class Day speaker, Parker said she initially declined the offer from Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells to speak during the Class Day exercises, worrying that she was not the best speaker to address the class. Eventually coming around to the idea, Parker said she began to view her speech as a “beautiful burden.”
In her speech, Parker laid out her “nine hopes” for the class, many of which echoed what she referred to as the “golden rule”—to treat others as one would want to be treated.
At one point during her speech, Parker lamented that she would not have the opportunity to say each of the graduating students’ names individually during the ceremony. Instead, she asked the students to “scream” out their names in unison.
“Let it speak for your joy,” Parker said. “Be your least modest self.”
Parker was particularly impassioned when telling the students to be thoughtful and relentless in pursuing their dreams. She reflected on her own career, noting she often faced fear when auditioning for job opportunities. She advised class members to be open about their anxieties while not allowing doubts to prevent their success.
“Never stop wanting,” Parker said. “In wanting there is energy, youth, and motion. In not wanting there is inertia.”
The ceremony, which took place outside of the school’s Langdell Library, was relatively subdued after a tumultuous year at the Law School. Yet, aspects of the ceremony reflected the year's events.
Following the Harvard Corporation’s decision to remove the Law School’s seal from campus, banners that formerly displayed seals on the library’s exterior had been changed to ones of solid crimson, without any adornment. Furthermore, members of Reclaim Harvard Law, a student activist group that advocated for the seal change, occasionally thrusted into the air posters emblazoned with images of raised fists from their seats near the center of the crowd.
Despite the somewhat muted audience, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow addressed the crowd ebulliently, praising students for their work and thanking them for their efforts to improve the Law School throughout the past three years.
Other speakers included the Class Marshals, Sells, professor Jeannie C. Suk, and Salvo Arena, president of the Harvard Law School Association.
The theme of the day fluctuated between reflection and foresight. Diana Liebenau, a graduating international student who also spoke, called on attendees to “look forward and backward,” adding, “That’s the Harvard mindset: always dreaming big, and always looking for what comes next.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the NBA draft approaching, Yale sophomore guard Makai Mason just recently rescinded his name from consideration. Mason, who first declared for the draft shortly after dropping 31 points on Baylor in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, took advantage of a new NCAA rule that allows players to test the waters of the draft until May 25. With the deadline approaching, men’s basketball beat writer David Freed takes a look at how Mason compares to previous NBA draft prospects.
Mason’s decision to enter the draft was, in a word, shocking. Mason was an effective reserve a year ago, but didn’t crack the starting rotation until this year. The withdrawal of Jack Montague unleashed Mason in Ivy League play, and the sophomore averaged 17.5 points and 4.0 assists a game after Montague’s departure, up from 15.5 and 3.8, respectively, before. In the NCAA Tournament, playing top-five seeds Baylor and Duke, he was even better—averaging 19.5 points and 5.5 assists a contest.
Yet, Mason wasn’t even close to the best player in the Ancient Eight. According to Sports-Reference, Mason wasn’t even in the top 10 in win shares per 40 minutes. While he finished with the fifth most win shares overall, that was likely as much of a product of playing extended minutes as anything else. Mason ranked ninth on his own team in Box-Score Plus-Minus—the best advanced statistic to measure per-minute performance. While those stats probably ding Mason too much for being inefficient, which was partially a result of playing heavy minutes for a team that lacked any other perimeter creators, they aren’t rosy.
Mason’s draft chances have been pilloried in other spaces. The sophomore wasn’t invited to the NBA draft combine and the Chicago Tribune wrote that he “has virtually no chance of getting drafted.” Yet, that evidence is largely anecdotal. To get a better idea for where the sophomore ranked, I decided to look at how he compared to players taken in previous years.
To get a comparison set, I scraped standard and advanced statistical metrics for every point guard taken in the three preceding draft classes (Phoenix Suns rookie Devin Booker, who plays point guard at the pro level, was included). I then proceeded to rank Mason’s stats for this year against every other player drafted.
The results were, in a word, dismal.
Mason’s ranks in the bottom third of all but three categories that were tested. Two of the three—usage rate and three-point preference—are generally larger indicators of shot-taking than shot-making. His one “elite” skill, by this estimation, is his defensive rebounding—Mason ranked 12th of the 34 point guards in defensive rebounding rate.
When it comes to catch-all metrics, he fared especially poorly. His Box Score Plus-Minus (BPM) ranked second to last, while his Player Efficiency Rating was dead last. Only Joseph Young, a rookie for the Indiana Pacers who graduated from the university of Oregon a year ago, ranked worse than Mason in BPM.
The numbers did not look better when the sample size was cut down to just the players drafted from small (read: non-Big Six conference) institutions. Mason ranked near the bottom in every major statistical category, with his shooting dropping to the back of the pack. Mason’s PER was more than eight points lower than the next highest player, while his 1.4 BPM was not even half of the next worst player and not even a fourth of the group average.
All in all, it seems safe to assume that Yale coach James Jones will see his point guard on campus next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long search, graduating senior Patrick Steeves will extend his playing career for at least one more year at George Washington University. Steeves, who did not play a game until his senior season due to recurring knee and foot injuries, benefits from an NCAA exception that grants extra years of eligibility to players who missed seasons due to injury.
In his words, it was an ideal fit.
“They have a good basketball team and they have a need for my position,” Steeves said. “They are graduating their big men this year. All the pieces hit together pretty much.”
Steeves, who will be pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at George Washington, was not allowed to continue playing for his original team—as is common for most players granted an extra year of eligibility—because Ivy League rules prohibit graduate students from competing on college teams.
As a consequence, after the season ended, he began to field calls from other teams looking to acquire the versatile 6’7” wing who led the Ivy League in three-point percentage. Since his team’s season ended early—Harvard did not make a postseason tournament for the first time since 2009—Steeves waited as possible suitors finished their seasons and began to get an idea of what their rosters would look like for the next season.
The Colonials were one of the final teams to finish, winning the NIT over Valpariso on the last day of March. However, in April the team learned that forward Anthony Swan and sophomore Paul Jorgensen would be transferring, trimming a rotation that was already thin due to the graduation of Kevin Larsen, Alex Mitola, and Patricio Garino.
The coaching staff then placed a call to Steeves.

Senior Patrick Steeves will continue his collegiate basketball career as a graduate student at George Washington University, the senior told The Crimson. Steeves, who did not play a single game his first three years on campus due to a variety of injuries, will step in at a position of need for the Colonials. Men’s basketball beat writer David Freed takes a look at how Steeves will fit in for the 2015-2016 NIT champions, who finished fourth in the Atlantic 10 a year ago.
From the beginning of the season, Steeves should be an impact contributor for the Colonials. To get a sense for the impact he will make on the team, we can look at three main areas: how he fits into the lineup, how he fits into their style of play, and what the team’s outlook is for next year.
Lineup
Steeves will be a valuable older presence on a young team. The Colonials should have anywhere between seven and nine underclassmen next year, depending how transfers work out. In 2015-2016, George Washington was anchored by its seniors. Four of its top six rotation players will be graduating, including Dartmouth transfer Alex Mitola, who averaged 5.3 points and 1.8 assists for the Colonials.
As a stretch four, Steeves will be a much needed rebounder and distributor for the Colonials. George Washington had only one player average more than three assists a year ago, the departing Joe McDonald. With sophomore Paul Jorgensen transferring, the team’s best returning guard is likely junior Matt Hart, who averaged less than nine minutes a year ago. Steeves showed an ability to handle the ball at times for the Crimson, dishing our four or more assists on five separate outings, and can relieve Hart on the perimeter when the season begins.
On the inside, the Colonials will likely play 6’9” junior Tyler Cavanaugh at one of the two forward positions, with Steeves or junior Yuna Watanabe (8.8 ppg, 5.4 rpg) likely flanking him. Cavanaugh did it all for the Colonials a year ago, leading the team in scoring and rebounding while shooting 50 percent from the field and 42 percent from three, and pairing him with Steeves (46 percent from deep) and Hart (42 percent) would create a potent floor spacing lineup.
Style of Play
Under Mike Lonergan, the Colonials have been a very efficient, if slow-tempo, offensive team. The Colonials ranked just 265th in the nation in Ken Pomeroy’s adjusted tempo metric a season ago, just nine spots better than Harvard. The big difference was in what the teams did with the limited possessions, with the Colonials posting the country’s 23rd best attack, while Harvard ranked just 277th.
The Colonials do their damage by generating quality looks from distance. They don’t shoot that many—only about 20 a game, ranking 220th in the country—but they convert them at a 37 percent clip, a top-60 mark nationally. In 2015-2016, they burned opponents from deep with Cavanaugh and seniors Patricio Garino and Kevin Larson, all of whom shot 42 percent or better from distance on nearly 300 combined attempts.
Steeves fits well into this model. He was able to space the floor consistently for coach Tommy Amaker, greasing the wheels for an offense that struggled to create spacing when playing captain Evan Cummins alongside junior forward Zena Edosomwan. Steeves is an adept cutter who can step back behind the three-point line—his favorite spot is the left corner—with ease, and should be able to replace some of Garino’s contributions to the team.
Projected Outlook
It is difficult to get a sense for how a team will do in May, especially one as dependent on freshmen as the Colonials. The departing senior class (Garino, Larsen, etc.) was one of the most successful in George Washington history, winning 74 games during their last three years on campus and making three postseason tournaments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With nearly six months to go until the season starts, the pundits have already begun to line up behind the Harvard men’s basketball team. John Gasaway, who picked Harvard to make the Final Four two years ago, has christened the Crimson the seventh-best mid-major in the country heading into the 2016-2017 season. Harvard ranks right below VCU and Wichita State, two programs who won a combined three games in the NCAA Tournament last year.
Gasaway defended his selection by highlighting the Crimson’s historic recruiting class—Harvard signed four top-100 recruits for the first time in its history—and the return of three-year starter Siyani Chambers ’16-’17, who withdrew from college the 2015-2016 school year due to an ACL injury suffered in the offseason. Chambers rehabbed the entire year while staying in the area and, since the school year is over, can begin practicing with the team immediately, per league rules.
“When you sign a recruiting class ranked No. 10 in the nation, and you do so at an Ivy League program, people will salute you,” Gasaway wrote. “Well, I’m saluting… Harvard recorded its worst results since 2007-08 last season, but this program is poised to rebound in dramatic and rather sudden fashion.”
Before finishing 14-16 a year ago, the Crimson had won at least a share of five consecutive Ivy League titles, including four consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. In 2015-2016, Harvard stumbled out of the blocks in Ivy League play, losing five of its first six games, before rebounding with four wins in five contests to close the year at 7-7, good for fourth place in the Ancient Eight.
During this stretch, the Crimson secured its best victory of the season—a 73-71 home win against Princeton that was the nail in the coffin for the Tigers’ title hopes.
The next time they play, both teams’ title hopes may be on the line, however. Gasaway ranked Princeton just two spots behind Harvard and noted, “don’t hand that 2016-17 Ivy title to Harvard just yet.” Princeton brings back every single contributor from last year’s squad, which finished 12-2 and was a couple buckets away from winning the league outright, and gets senior forward Hans Brase—who missed the season for similar reasons to Chambers—back on campus.
Besides Harvard and Princeton, Penn—who improved significantly in coach Steve Donahue’s first season with a freshman-heavy roster—and Yale, the two-time defending league champion, loom as the other main contenders for the Ivy throne.
