After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has not escaped the recession. President Faust sent an e-mail last Wednesday to the Harvard community detailing just how grim the state of the endowment is. To compensate for the loss of at least $8 billion, Harvard has understandably chosen to cut down its staff. While it is unfortunate that some may lose their jobs due to the impending cuts, Harvard must be fiscally responsible and carefully define its priorities in such times.
Harvard has rightly targeted outsourced custodial labor as a sector of the operational budget that can be cut. One Source, a contractor company that cleans properties operated by Harvard Real Estate Services, has been asked to cut costs by 30 to 40 percent. American Clean Company, a contractor that services the Harvard Medical School, has been requested by HMS custodial directors to eliminate 13 of its 27 workers. These reductions do not seem unreasonably drastic compared to the layoffs occurring outside of Harvard. Economic recession inevitably affects jobs.
In the larger scheme of things, it must be remembered that the custodial staff cuts do not occur in a vacuum. If cuts are not made here, they will be made somewhere else. The educational mission of Harvard must be the main determinant when considering what programs and staff to eliminated, and cutting outsourced custodial labor is a reasonable place to reduce spending. Harvard spokesperson Kevin Galvin explained that the cuts are due to “unprecedented fiscal situation [at] Harvard” that is causing the university to carefully consider funding for each of the programs it administers. 
At a university whose mission is to educate, the educators should be the first priority during downsizing. Eliminating custodial staff will not have the academic consequences of decreased faculty hiring, hopefully allowing Harvard students to still receive a high quality academic experience regardless of the economic state outside of Harvard.
The cuts have been challenged by the custodial workers’ union, SEIU 615. However, Harvard notified the organization of the cuts in January, and even postponed the layoffs to allow them more time to adapt. Harvard seems to have taken reasonable steps with the union, making the group’s criticisms seem a little hollow. 
While it is disheartening to see staff lose their jobs, it is encouraging to see that the people leaving are not those who would otherwise be in the classroom teaching undergraduates. The economic recession affecting the nation is causing Harvard to feel a pinch, and the administration must respond. By deciding to downsize the amount of subcontracted custodial workers, the university is acting in the best interest of preserving the quality of its classrooms, and should not be unreasonably criticized.

Many of the measures Harvard has taken recently in response to losses in the endowment have been particularly ill-advised. Specifically, the hiring freeze and the decision to delay Allston development have been unfortunate decisions. Even in the current environment, these priorities of the school should not have been sacrificed. Of course, preventing further cuts to essential programs will be impossible without more funds, and a tuition increase is one sensible way of generating those funds.
It should also be noted that this expected increase is in line with previous years’ and also with tuition increases at peer institutions. Princeton this year announced that it would raise its tuition by 2.9 percent, Dartmouth by 4.8, and Cornell by 4.9. Harvard is not at all unique in this respect.
The 3.5 percent increase will bring the total tuition package (which includes room and board) to $48,868. This increase will be paired, however, with a corresponding increase in financial aid disbursement, which should mitigate the overall impact of the tuition hike. In other words, Harvard will still be able to meet the financial needs of every admitted student, regardless of the price of tuition.
Going forward, Harvard should consider expanding its financial aid programs to families that currently do not qualify for assistance. Since total financial aid output is expected to rise to a record $147 million next year, perhaps the upper boundary of qualification could be raised to accommodate students who currently pay full price, but who are also presumably feeling the pinch of the economic crisis.
While it is easy to complain about The College’s plan to increase tuition in these difficult times, one must realize that it is precisely at these times that, as a community, we must take steps to ensure that our institution does not languish.

I miss the nineties. Back then, besides having boy bands and great television shows, traveling by plane was almost a pleasant experience. I could carry-on more than just the clothes on my back, a laptop, and a book. Food and non-alcoholic beverages were both free. Go on a flight nowadays, and you find yourself thirsty, hungry, and possibly bereft of clothes when the airline loses your checked baggage.
I don’t, however, miss the higher airfares. Over the last decade, plane ticket prices have become ridiculously low-priced—on the whole, airfares have dropped an average of 30 percent since 1990. It’s easy to get used to paying less; when fares aren’t as low, the public is outraged and accuses airline executives of lining their pockets.
Given the present economic situation, this attitude is irrational. Raising airfares under the circumstances makes sense as airline companies feel the financial strain due to bad money management, raised fuel prices, and the loss of confidence in air-travel after 9/11. There is a fundamental problem with the entitlement the public feels regarding low airfares—flying a commercial aircraft is expensive, and when low ticket prices are coupled with overall financial strain, airline companies lack the means for the necessary aircrafts, pilots, and crew.
While it’s mildly annoying that we must now pay for food, drinks and checked baggage—which is usually our only option when overhead compartments are too small or flights are so full that we can barely fit our carry-on bags in the space provided—any slack in the system of efficient service is even more distressing. 
The financial woes of airlines are particularly noticeable during emergency situations, when any lack of resources becomes obvious. On February 15, 2007, passengers on JetBlue’s Flight 751 to Cancun, Mexico were trapped on the runway for eight hours when a snowstorm delayed their flight. The logical conclusion in most weather-related delays is to have passengers sit in the terminal until the plane is ready to take off; although not an ideal situation, it is still preferable to being trapped in a stuffy airplane. In the case of Flight 751, however, passengers remained stranded on the runway and unable to reenter the terminal because not a single gate was available.
Airlines need to pay over $1 million to airports in gate fees to have ample space for their aircraft—including extra aircraft for emergencies. When airlines face so much financial strain that even water costs money, it’s clear that airlines do not have the means to pay airports for as many gates as are necessary to accommodate delayed flights. Disasters like JetBlue Flight 751 are the result.
Somehow, airlines need to find a means to increase their revenue. Whether this comes from raising food, beverage, and baggage fees—perhaps now pillows, blankets, and even air will cost money!—or from increasing airfares themselves, is up to the airlines. 
The more logical and practical option is to increase airfares, despite the frustration many people will undoubtedly feel as they themselves feel the pinch of the economic downturn. Regardless, the public ought to remember that we are not entitled to being flown to our destination of choice for a low price; everyone, including airlines, is affected by the financial crisis. If increasing airfares is the only way to avoid catastrophes like the JetBlue affair, then the public must accept the economic realities of the airline industry and be prepared to shell out just a little more.

The headline in The Harvard Crimson read: “Chilean Leader Focuses on Democracy.” In September, the president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, visited Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government to give a speech entitled: “Challenges Facing Democracy in Latin America.” Her message was one of active advocacy and incredulous idealism for those in the hemisphere who still yearn for the ink and ballots that might make them the authors of their own future. But Bachelet’s most recent endeavor will cause the archives at The Harvard Crimson to become increasingly inaccurate and ironic.
Last week, she attended a ceremony in Cuba called “Feria del Libro” (Book Festival). President Bachelet has publicly stated that she would not meet with members of the dissident opposition on the island—including prisoners of conscience. Yet there are two primary reasons why it was not a prudent foreign policy pursuit for President Bachelet to visit Cuba without planning to meet with the island’s dissident opposition: structure and history. 
From the logic of a structural perspective, Chile is in the process of consolidating its democracy, and any government that seeks to successfully strengthen its democratic institutions must uphold a particular reputation. As every foreign policy decision is also a political consideration, Chile must emulate the values that it seeks to achieve. It is therefore counterproductive to honor the oppressive without recognizing the oppressed. Since Augusto Pinochet was removed from power in 1989, Chile has been working to stabilize its democracy. The last Chilean president to visit Cuba was socialist Salvador Allende, who considered himself a great friend of the dictator, Fidel Castro. Bachelet’s administration has consistently shown its eagerness to boast of its democratic achievements, but improving relations with a regime that categorically opposes and publicly criticizes these democratic goals is a step in the wrong direction.
Politics and economics go hand in hand. Chile has historically been a model of neo-liberal economic reforms, including deregulation, regional cooperation, and free markets—the antithesis of the Cuban model. There is something incongruent with the goals of Chile and its allies and that of Cuba and the “non-aligned movement” in which it has come to be a leader. In order to maintain international support from its allies and main trading partners, Chile must only visit the Pearl of the Antilles if it is prepared to do so in support of the Cuban people and not the Cuban regime. By revitalizing relations with the state-controlled economy, President Bachelet effectively jeopardizes the support of her allies and the confidence of major extra-governmental lending institutions.
As a young woman, Bachelet coped with her father’s kidnapping, torture, and death. This came at the hands of the rightist authoritarian regime of Pinochet. Shortly thereafter, she and her mother were also captured, tortured, imprisoned, and eventually exiled. She returned to Chile, finished her medical studies, and, after a distinguished career of public service in health and defense, became the first female president of Chile—making her story yet more extraordinary. As a former political prisoner herself, her empathy and compassion might go hand in hand with her politics. But this is not the case. 
By not actively seeking a dialogue with the oppressed in Cuba, the Chilean government will be breaking the virtuous example of the Pope, as well as the presidents of Portugal and Spain who have all recognized and met with opposition leaders in the past. Recently, there has been a deplorable wave of political suppression in Cuba. The state has continued to silence people that they have labeled “counterrevolutionary dissidents”—people that Chile and the United States would call productive citizens.  When President Bachelet visited Cuba, she put Chile’s reputation at risk. She has categorically failed to distinguish between a dictatorship of the right—the Pinochet regime of which she was a victim and staunchly opposed—and an equally despicable dictatorship of the left.  
The Havana edition of “Feria del Libro” is currently an ironic one. In Cuba, only governmentally-approved books are permitted. It may come as a surprise that works by the greatest authors in the Spanish language, like Guillermo Cabrera-Infante and Mario Vargas Llosa, will not be featured anywhere at the event—and forget about any American classics. Anything opposing or threatening to the regime is censored. A similar irony that is greatly damaging for the “champion” of democracy who visited Harvard is the venue for the fair. The event took place in La Cabaña, an 18th century Spanish colonial fortress that overlooks Havana. However, in recent history it is more famous for its role in the Cuban revolution as the location of severe human rights abuses. Here, the nefarious Ernesto “Che” Guevara held daily executions of political prisoners.
Decision-making within sovereign states like Chile greatly impacts hemispheric affairs. Bachelet has passed on the opportunity to send a positive message to transnational institutions like the Organization of American States, which have explicitly sought democratic goals. Politicians will not find integrity in positive change for their own nations unless they are ready to advocate that change for all others.  As President Bachelet writes her legacy, this chapter will be one that sacrifices the dignity of her diplomacy and ironically makes her a challenge to democracy in Latin America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today remains the age of the capitalists. It is their enduring observance to a single principle that has afforded them so glorious a reign: Give the People What They Want. They have established a well-oiled system, elegantly rigged to benefit the common man by bringing him endless servings of whatever he and his family want. As societies slowly fix one of their most intractable problems, failed public education, I predict that they will grudgingly settle on the only credible solution—let the capitalists have a go.
The capitalist, who knows only how to Give the People What They Want, will act predictably. He will do the same for American and international education as he did for the meatpacking industry, the automobile industry, and the pharmaceutical industry. He will invest in research to produce a polished product, and then he will market that product to as large a group of people as possible, ignoring every natural or national boundary. Unpretentious and supremely practical, he will surely engage in the dirtiest of commercial habits: He will spy on his competitors to stay a few steps ahead, fire incompetent employees with alacrity, and invent new business models, all in an effort to capture new market space. It is hard to fathom the ingenuity we would witness if capitalists participated fully in the one-half-trillion dollar market of educating American children, sights set broadly on the trillions more that lay beyond our borders.
I predict: If public subsidies are shifted from the school to the student, regardless of where or how that student chooses to be educated, the best teachers, with the experience to know what works and what does not, will use technology to reach a wider audience. The amazing proliferation of software, video, and the Internet in every part of business and private life is the surest fact of our times. But slow has been their trickle into classrooms. Is it because these tools have no place in the teaching trade? No. Rather, public schools and their tenured employees, unused to the forces of creative destruction, are uniquely ill-suited to develop and deploy new technologies.
My own education, crafted by two ambitious immigrant parents, was a good deal ahead of its time. In 1994, I was one of the first young students of Stanford’s Education Program for Gifted Youth. A pioneering multimedia software program for teaching mathematics, EPGY has now grown into a full suite of distance learning products. I have consumed numerous multimedia education products over the years, from games to video lectures, which taught me more than I ever learned in any classroom. Bill Gates is a regular customer of the products of The Teaching Company, which sells the life changing lectures of star professors.
The substantial innovation that has occurred in this space has occurred despite the long-lived (and criminal) monopoly of the lumbering and depressingly incompetent American public school. This innovation in private and interactive e-education has benefited only those children whose parents take initiative. The public education system is right to treat knowledge as too essential a commodity to be left  for only the wealthy to enjoy; That is, it is morally correct to subsidize education. However, its proponents fail to understand the absurdity—in light of modern innovations in learning—of maintaining the status quo and subsidizing the school (to the tune of $10 thousand per pupil per year) rather than subsidizing the student.
When this tremendous mistake is undone, entrepreneurs will collaborate and compete, remaking in ways we literally cannot yet imagine the business of educating the flower of our youth. The drab monotony of a nation’s students taking notes off of a chalkboard in classrooms unchanged since Ike will be remade precisely the way our phones have been remade: with an explosion of unimagined options and quality, and with an eye to helping us remain productive in a newly complex and global world.
My definition of capitalism is somewhat unorthodox: the system that allows poorer people to have the comforts only rich people once had. In the not-so-distant future, parents will be able to buy their children an education produced under the same competitive stresses that gave us cheap LCD televisions, the iPhone, Lipitor, and Phillips Exeter Academy. Block-heads paint the public schools as a sacred cow, vouchers as undemocratic, and unionized public school teachers as modern heroes. Were trains so holy that today there are no planes? Was cotton so consecrated that we lack polyester? Likewise, the monopoly local middle school should not consider itself a temple. We cannot forget the lessons of productive innovation when it comes to education. I do not ask that public schools as they exist today be shut down. But I submit that, after the subsidy is shifted to the student, public schools compete against the full force of a veritable entrepreneurial revolution.
The shape of the river in education must quickly change, and the stakes are high. We will soon have to turn to the only group whom we can definitely trust to Give the People What They Want. Such is the earnestness and flexibility of the capitalistic class that they saw our love of fish, cars, and shoes, and gave us ubiquitous sushi, Formula 1, and Crocs. They made us an SUV nation, a hamburger nation, and a CrackBerry nation. Let them now make us a learning nation.
