After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BATTLE MOUNTAIN, Nev.—"FOG MAY BE ICY," read a warning sign 50 miles outside Reno.
We didn’t have to deal with icy fog. The major peril of the day, however, was the heavy rain, scheming with the forceful crosswind that eternally plagued I-80. We correctly expected hazards along the stretch from Utah’s Bonneville Salt Flats to Lake Tahoe—the entire width of northern Nevada—but wrongly anticipated boredom. We came to appreciate what was supposed to be the tedious day of a long Western road trip.
The state named for snow and nicknamed for silver spans an extensive range of shapes, colors, and weather conditions.
A turquoise river strays through a Martian canyon.
A green field of shrubs, bisected by rusty train tracks, sits atop yellow grass; all lies under coal-black clouds.
A dim, slate silhouette gradually transforms into a five-layer stack of jagged, snow-capped peaks. Every hilltop unveils a new imposing setting.
The towns, crusty earth, dusty campgrounds, and seedy gas station casinos paint a rarely seen caricature of a spartan Americana. It isn’t a nurturing image, yet its ruggedness is largely superficial. There are many cordial people in the restaurants and shops—hidden gems in a dry mine.
Vegas might be the Entertainment Capital of the World, but northern Nevada deserves more credit for its subtle pleasures.
Understandably, much of the scenery isn’t for everyone. But if you don’t like it, simply drive seven more miles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People tell me that I am two very different people on social media. There’s the Nian on Facebook who posts links to her feminist Crimson articles, starts fights with strangers in the comments section, and yells at misogynists. Then there’s the Nian on Instagram, who posts photos of herself in swimsuits at exotic locales, exchanges sweet pleasantries with strangers in the comments section, and—apparently—perpetuates misogyny by “objectifying herself” and appealing to the male gaze.
For a long time, I knew—or I thought I knew—that the two identities were irreconcilable. I was told that my Instagram account was not only apolitical, but actively anti-feminist. I was “contributing to my own objectification,” I was not “helping the cause,” and I was “giving feminism a bad name.” Articles about feminist Instagram users would showcase women who skateboarded and rode motorbikes and wrote code. These were the “women who lift you up,” as opposed to the Instagram models posing in their swimsuits, who “drag you down.”
And yet, I still considered myself a feminist in my everyday life. I still wrote articles and started fights, both online and in real life, about rape culture or toxic masculinity. There seemed to exist a vast logical disconnect. The same men who argued with me and called me “man-hater” or “feminazi” on Facebook would like my photos on Instagram, write comments about how beautiful I looked, and direct message me to ask me out on dates. People disliked me for what I said, but liked me for how I looked.
And for a while, I was content to keep these two spheres separate. I would receive threatening messages on Facebook in response to my feminist beliefs and I would receive admiring messages on Instagram in response to my appearance. But it was never really that simple. On Instagram, a man who had been expressing his interest in me grew angry when I stopped responding to his messages, and he threatened to “write a blog article about broke attention whores like yourself.” And on Facebook, a man who wrote a scathing blog post in response to my Crimson article found my LinkedIn headshot and expressed his desire to have sex with me.
At the end of the day, there is no escaping the male gaze. Even if I am just writing articles and getting in fights on Facebook, I will still have my appearance scrutinized by strange men. Even if I am fully clothed in all of my photos, even if I don’t post a single bikini photo, even if the only public photo of myself is my LinkedIn headshot, I will still be objectified. My modesty will not protect me from male lechery.
There is also no escaping from misogyny. Even if I am just posting photos of myself in swimsuits, even if I strive to make myself as pleasant and apolitical as possible, even if I refrain from expressing my feminist beliefs, I will still be subjected to misogynistic attacks. My silence will not protect me from male intimidation.
People tell me that I am two very different people on social media, but the reality is that there has only been one person this whole time. It is easier, however, to pretend that there are two people, because women can either be a Madonna or a whore. That’s why so many so-called feminists denigrate Nicki Minaj and Amber Rose, despite all the work that those two women have done for intersectional feminism. It’s hard to respect a woman when she’s not modestly dressed. Feminist role models should wear suits and lab coats, not bikinis and thongs.
And this Madonna-whore complex is what prevents people from reconciling a woman’s sexuality and the important work that she does. People will say things like “you can’t be a hoe and a Black rights activist,” and self-proclaimed feminists will respond to videos of Amber Rose and Blac Chyna twerking by saying that “they’re reducing feminism to sexual liberation.” White men like Piers Morgan will deem it appropriate to lecture women of color like Amber Rose on how “you’re going wrong re feminism.” People are more willing to see Ivanka Trump—who supported her misogynistic father’s run for the presidency and whose fashion line is designed by a contractor that does not offer a single day of paid maternity leave—as a feminist role model. But people are much less eager to bestow that title to Amber Rose, even though she has done so much work to combat slut-shaming and educate the public on consensual sex, simply because she does not dress as conservatively as Ivanka does.
People are wrong to tell Amber Rose that she isn’t a feminist, because “a feminist isn’t going to promote whoreish behavior.” And they are wrong to tell me that I’m not a feminist because I show my body in my Instagram photos. My Instagram account does not make me less of a feminist. My body positivity and my ownership of my own sexuality does not make me anti-feminist—if anything, it makes me the opposite.
I will acknowledge, however, that my thin privilege, my cisgender privilege, and my able-bodied privilege allows me to post swimsuit photos online and receive praise, rather than attacks and criticism, and that my class privilege allows me to travel and buy trendy clothing. My Instagram account should not be held up as the paragon of feminism, because there is nothing revolutionary about my photos nor the lifestyle that I am promoting.
But my sexuality, and the expression thereof on Instagram, should never take away from the work that I do as a feminist. There were never two Nians; there was only one. And it’s not my problem that people can’t come to the terms with the fact that a woman can show her body, express her sexuality, and also make important contributions to society—and yes, be a feminist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Khalil Abdur-Rashid, an adjunct professor of Islamic studies at Southern Methodist University, will become Harvard’s first Muslim chaplain on July 5, six months after University President Drew G. Faust first initiated the search.
Before teaching at Southern Methodist, Abdur-Rashid served as the first paid Muslim programming associate at Columbia University and as a special adviser to the New York City Police Department on Muslim affairs. He has also served as an imam and a social worker.
Faust first called for the University to hire a Muslim Chaplain in the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order barring immigration from several majority Muslim countries.
Harvard Divinity School professor of Islamic studies Ousmane Kane, who led a committee of students, faculty, and staff in the search for Harvard’s new chaplain, cited Abdur-Rashid’s depth of Islamic knowledge, wealth of experience, and strength of character in the choice.
Abdur-Rashid received his bachelor’s degree in social work from Georgia State University and his master’s degrees in Middle East studies and Islamic law from from Columbia University. He studied Islamic law in Yemen and Istanbul, and is now studying American Muslim identity formation as a doctoral student.
Halah Ahmad ’17, one of two undergraduates on the search committee and former president of the Harvard Islamic Society, said Abdur-Rashid’s background “gives him the compassion, wisdom, and knowledge that we really need.”
“We’re kind of reeling with issues of race, religion, class, and other injustices,” Ahmad said. “Khalil’s education as a son of a student of MLK, as someone who was internationally-educated, and as a black Muslim-American really makes him best suited to speak and provide pastoral care across these issues.”
Beyond supporting members of the Islamic faith, Abdur-Rashid will join fellow chaplains in promoting religious pluralism and a “spirit not of mere tolerance but of genuine inclusion,” Faust wrote in January.
Ahmad said she views this appointment as “a huge equalizer on this campus, where there has been really an utter dearth of resources for all students—especially Muslim students—on Islam.”
Zarin I. Rahman ’18, president of the Harvard Islamic Society, echoed the need for stronger institutional support of Muslim students. “In this political climate, students on campus have struggled a lot in terms of spiritual guidance and mental health,” she said.
Abdur-Rashid’s experiences, Rahman said, will enable him to effectively help and advocate for Muslim students “dealing with Islamophobic rhetoric and political rhetoric that makes them question their faith or makes them feel unsafe.”
Rahman said Harvard’s part-time Muslim chaplain “wasn’t as available as we would have liked him to be or needed him to be.” She notes that Abdur-Rashid, as a full-time chaplain, will also bring a Muslim voice to interfaith and other religious discussions on campus.
Noting that comparable institutions of higher education have a Muslim chaplain, Ahmad said she feels more valued by the University because of this appointment. “It’s really one of the things that I leave Harvard most proud of,” she said.
Abdul-Rashid is “deeply humbled and excited” to begin his new role, according to the press release.
“These are challenging times that require us to commit ourselves to public service and mutual support,” he said, in order “to cultivate a deeper understanding of who we are and where we are ultimately going, and to being the best of who we are while remembering the divine in each other, thereby taking us one step closer to turning hate into hope.”
“I have really huge hopes for how it will better inform Muslim students and non-Muslim students on how to be better people, more conscientious people in general,” Ahmad said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Donald Trump’s decision last week to extend Obama-era protections for undocumented students was greeted with relief from some Harvard students even as they reaffirmed a need for immigration reform.
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, rolled out in 2012, enables undocumented students to obtain work permits while avoiding the prospect of deportation. Trump announced last Thursday that he would not eliminate the program, but White House officials added Friday that his administration may follow through on anti-immigration campaign pledges in the future.
For Jin Park ’18, an undocumented student, the announcement was “welcomed news.” After the presidential election in November 2016, Park assumed that DACA would be gone, along with his post-graduation work prospects and health insurance. “But now that I can renew DACA, it’s a different context,” he said.
Enrique Ramirez ’17, an undocumented student and previous board member of student activist group Act on a Dream, said he was not surprised by the announcement. “His position’s always been a friendly one towards Dreamers, while his stance against illegal immigrants in general was a lot more harsh,” he said.
Ramirez said his parents were happy because they were concerned for Ramirez and his siblings’ safety.
DACA, he said, has been a “huge help” in allowing him to pursue opportunities that he otherwise could not have. Under its protection, Ramirez has held up to four jobs, studied abroad, applied to summer internships, and obtained a driver’s license. He said he appreciated being able to drive for his parents and reduce the risk of their being pulled over and deported.
Daishi M. Tanaka ’19, an undocumented student and co-director of Act on a Dream, said his “huge sigh of relief” upon waking up to the news was soon engulfed by a frustration regarding the broader landscape of 11 million undocumented immigrants. DACA protects approximately 800,000 people within that 11 million.
Park likewise said he is skeptical of politicians and how they throw immigration issues around as what he calls “political football.”
“My trust in Trump, there is none. You can’t be confident in someone who, for nine months, has promised to upend your life and put you back somewhere you don’t remember,” Park said.
“Donald Trump has shifted the conversation on immigration so far to the right that even a small advance seems like a monumental achievement, when in reality, it’s not,” Park added. “We need to focus on the core issue, which is comprehensive immigration reform.”
The news of DACA’s continuation came with the official termination of another program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents.
DAPA, an Obama administration proposal that had yet to go into effect, might have protected the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents from deportation.
Park said that while he was happy that “the administration is recognizing the value of people like me,” he is disappointed that the sentiment “doesn’t translate to parents of deferred action recipients and undocumented immigrants in general.”
“I feel like a big weight has been lifted, but at the same time, my parents matter too,” he said.
Ramirez said his family was not hopeful for DAPA to be enacted. “No one was planning for DAPA to come back, especially under Trump,” he said.Tanaka said Act on a Dream’s work is far from finished: “This is just temporary relief and one step in a long journey,” he said. He said the group hopes to advocate for better conditions and rights for all undocumented citizens—protected or unprotected.
“Being DACA-protected has definitely made me realize the amount of privilege I have within the undocumented community and how much capacity I was granted in order to help those without these protections,” Tanaka said.
