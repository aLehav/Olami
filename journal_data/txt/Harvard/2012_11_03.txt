After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and faculty packed into the Belfer Case Study Room on Friday to hear about inequality in post-abolition Brazil from Brodwyn Fischer, a history professor at Northwestern University. The event, titled “Poverty, Social Intimacy, and the Politics of Inequality in Post-Abolition Brazil,” focused on the historiography of a city in Brazil called Recife.
Fischer began the lecture by examining the question of to of whether or not urban inequality was a significant problem from the 19th century to the mid-20th century in Brazilian cities.
Fischer said that even at the time of Brazil’s origins, the society was heavily segmented. Social movements in the country through its history have focused more on people’s concern for survival rather than on their aims to decrease inequality, she said.
“Access to any form of power, prestige, and upward mobility depended on vertical power relations,” Fischer said. She also said that people in Recife relied heavily on social networks for survival.
Fischer, who published a book in 2008 on inequality in Brazil called “A Poverty of Rights: Citizenship and Inequality in Twentieth Century Rio de Janeiro,” is currently working on a second book that discusses inequality in gender, race, and social networks in Brazil.
The event was organized by history professor Emma G. Rothschild and Director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies Merilee S. Grindle,
“[Fisher] was a graduate student here, and it’s so nice to have her back,” Rothschild said. “There isn’t someone on the faculty to teach Brazilian history.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

When students vote for Undergraduate Council president this fall, they can also cast a vote calling on Harvard to revise its policies for handling sexual assault.
Thanks to an online petition that garnered the 670 signatures required by the Council to create a ballot question, voters may indicate their approval of a long list of changes to Harvard’s practices.
The referendum calls for Harvard to endorse the concept of “affirmative consent” to sex, more clearly define “mental incapacitation” that renders a person unable to consent, adopt BGLTQ-inclusive language in its assault policies, and increase the transparency of the case review process.
Kate Sim ’14, who created the successful petition along with Pearl Bhatnagar ’14, described the referendum as “a signal of our agency as students in claiming our mental and physical safety on campus.”
Launched early Thursday morning, the petition garnered more than 300 undergraduate signatures in its first 12 hours online and achieved the 670-signature target Friday evening.
Bhatnagar said that the response indicates broad student interest in changing sexual assault policies, and UC Student Initiatives Committee Chair Nicholas W. Galat ’13 added that the upcoming vote will reinforce that.
“Taking this issue to a referendum will give the UC a more credible stance on what the students want and will allow us to directly say that we do speak for the students,” Galat said.
The last time the University made substantial changes to its sexual assault policies was in 2003. This summer, two stranger rapes—the first in 12 years—were reported at Harvard. And since Harvard announced its intention not to change its policies despite a federal investigation into sexual assault policy at Yale and Harvard Law School, and more recently a former Amherst College student made waves nationwide by publishing an essay on the school’s insensitive response to her rape, Bhatnagar said Harvard should be reconsidering its approach to handling assaults.
“In light of the recent reviews that our peer institutions have pursued, this is a chance for Harvard to improve upon the safety mechanisms that it already has in place for its students,” she said.
UC Rules Committee Chair Darragh Nolan ’15 said that students last petitioned for a UC ballot referendum in 2006, when undergraduates passed a referendum calling for the University to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from their 1990 level by 11 percent by 2020. This year, three questions have made it to the ballot through student—the sexual assault one, a call for Harvard to divest from fossil fuels, and a petition for the Harvard Management Company to take responsibility for the funds collected by the Fair Harvard Fund created last year.
Of the increase in ballot questions, Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, a member of Students for a Just and Stable Future who spearheaded the petition for the fossil fuels referendum, said, “It’s incredible to see how many students have gotten involved in the campaigns and how many students are really latching onto these movements…. This is a really powerful tool. It’s a way to show the administration that the students really care.” Maxmin is also a Crimson editorial editor.
Nolan foresees even more ballot questions in elections to come. “I imagine that there will probably be an increase in petitions as more and more students hear about it,” he said. “Even student activists who don’t normally care about the UC will have reason to log into the system and vote.”
Though there is currently little information in the UC constitution about how ballot questions are run, Nolan said that legislation is being created to streamline the process.
If the UC votes to pass the legislation, there will be two times during the school year when a referendum can be put forth to the student body: on the UC presidential ballot in the fall, and in a special referendum email sent to the student body following spring break. Twenty-five percent of the undergraduate population will have to vote for the referendum for the UC to officially endorse the petition’s stance on the issue.
“Kate and Pearl were already working on a campaign to bring this issue to the administration’s attention,” Dudley House representative Sahil A. Khatod ’14 said. “But they hadn’t been talking to the UC, so I told them that the UC would be the best place to push for a referendum.”
According to representatives, the petition coincides with recent initiatives that the Council has pursued. UC Student Life Committee Chair Michael C. George ’14 said that the Council has recently talked with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response about improving safety on campus.
“Students told us that we need more blue lights, more bike racks in well-lit locations, and better lighting on the path back to the Quad at night,” said George, who is also a Crimson news editor. “We’re organizing a safety walk with OSAPR to investigate all these streets and places where students feel unsafe and do something about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was not a fun day to be a Harvard cheerleader.
In an absolutely dominant showing at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson football team steamrolled Columbia on Saturday afternoon, shutting out the Lions, 69-0.
The 69-point win marked the largest margin of victory in any Ivy League contest since the conference was formed in 1956.
No matter who was on the field, Harvard executed in all facets of the game.
First-string quarterback Colton Chapple threw three first-half touchdown passes and ran for another, second-string middle linebacker Connor Loftus returned an interception for a score, third-string safety Donova Celerin had a late fumble recovery, and fourth-string running back Damani Wilson ran for 121 yards and two scores in a contest in which nearly everyone on the active roster chipped in for the win.
Each of the squad’s top four halfbacks had a touchdown while the defense registered eight sacks, forced six turnovers—plus a number of other fumbles that the Lions recovered—and held Columbia to -19 yards on the ground to add to its FCS lead in run defense.
“It really was the perfect storm of offense, defense, special teams [for] a team and a program that is just much farther along in [its] development [than Columbia is],” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said.
Harvard scored three touchdowns in a 45-second span in the second quarter to break the game open. The Crimson’s 35 points in that quarter set a modern-era program record, and Harvard and went into the half with a 42-0 lead.
With its backups in, the squad then had two touchdowns in the third and fourth quarters to put together its largest win since a 69-0 victory over the Coast Guard on October 19, 1946 and its largest victory over a future Ivy rival since a 77-0 shutout of Cornell on Nov. 1, 1890. The last time the Crimson won by more than 69 was a 124-0 victory over Wesleyan on Nov. 3, 1891.
“I honestly felt badly that we scored that many points,” Murphy said. “We’re not trying to run it up, but we had a lot of guys in there who had never played before and were trying to take as much time off the clock as we could, and we just busted a couple plays.”
Harvard’s first of its ten touchdowns came on its second drive of the game. After moving the Crimson down the field with ease, Chapple hit junior wideout Ricky Zorn on a post to the left corner of the end zone for a 12-yard score. The touchdown pass was Chapple’s 19th of the season, setting a Crimson single-season record.
On Harvard’s ensuing possession, the quarterback capped a seven-play, 74-yard drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to junior Andrew Berg. Chapple pump-faked and then threw a lob towards the right corner of the end zone, where the wideout went up over Jeremy Mingo and was able to get one foot down before falling out-of-bounds to make it 14-0.
Columbia quarterback Sean Brackett fumbled at his own 27 on the Lions next possession, and a Jaron Wilson recovery set the Crimson up for another score. On second-and-goal from the eight, Chapple rolled right but threw across his body to find a wide-open Kyle Juszczyk in the left corner of the end zone for his third passing touchdown of the afternoon.
Junior safety Chris Splinter picked off Brackett on the second play of the Lions’ next drive, returning the ball to the one. From there, senior running back Treavor Scales scored on Harvard’s first play of the series to make it 28-0.
Seconds later, Harvard was in the end zone again. Columbia backup quarterback Trevor McDonagh was intercepted by Loftus, who returned the throw 15 yards to the house for the Crimson’s fourth touchdown in less than four minutes.
“I challenged our defense today,” Murphy said. “The one thing we haven’t done [defensively] is get takeaways...typical of our guys, [if] you challenge them, wherever you set the bar, they manage to reach it.”
After a Columbia three-and-out, the Crimson was back in the end zone within five plays, as Chapple ran play-action with freshman running back Paul Stanton and scored by himself from 11 yards out to make it 42-0.
At the quarter’s end, junior wide receiver Scott Miller fumbled a punt that the Lions returned to the Harvard three. With five seconds to go, Columbia coach Pete Mangurian bypassed the chance at a field goal to go for a touchdown, but two inaccurate Brackett passes kept the Crimson shutout alive.
“Disappointing is an understatement,” Mangurian said. “There’s a lot of lessons to be learned here.”
Sophomore Connor Hempel replaced Chapple in the second half and led an 11-play, 69-yard drive that Stanton capped with a one-yard run, the first touchdown of his career.
Later in the third quarter, Harvard took over at the Lions 16 following a Marcorus Garrett fumble that was recovered by senior defensive back Jonathan Mason. Senior Rich Zajeski rushed for 11 and two yards, respectively, before scoring a five-yard touchdown to put Harvard up, 54-0. With the ensuing extra point, senior David Mothander broke Matt Schindel ’08’s record for career points by a Crimson kicker.
Splinter recorded his second interception of the game early in the fourth quarter, and on the first play of Harvard’s next drive, Wilson found a hole on the right side and rushed 45 yards to the house for his first career touchdown. Later in the quarter, the Crimson started a series at its own 29 and Wilson did the rest, rushing for 28 yards on four carries before busting loose for a 43-yard touchdown to make it 69-0.
“It was really exciting,” said Wilson, who also runs track at Harvard. “We have a lot of depth on the o-line, even with the injuries.... All I had to do was run straight. I got a lot of great looks and just tried to take advantage of them.”
Columbia fumbled in its own territory once again on its ensuing possession, and Solera recovered. But the Crimson chose to take three straight knees instead of trying for another score.
Harvard’s win, combined with Princeton’s loss to Penn, means the Crimson is once again in the driver’s seat for the Ivy League championship with two weeks to go. It can clinch at least a share of the title when it faces the Quakers in Philadelphia next Saturday.
“I’m very proud of the effort,” Murphy said. “We just have to keep moving ahead here.”

Something clearly went down last night (or early this morning), because the John Harvard staute is covered in copious amounts of green paint. We can't help but wonder about the choice of color. John Harvard envy? A comment on wealth? Hungover and about to puke? If you have any tips regarding this incident, let us know in the Tip Box to the right, and keep your eyes peeled for more information on www.thecrimson.com.

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
From creamy lobster rolls to chunky clam chowder, the cuisine of New England highlights the freshest ingredients found underwater. As a coastal city, Boston is home to numerous seafood restaurants, including The Red House in Harvard Square.
The name of the restaurant is certainly not a misnomer—quite literally, it is located in a beautifully restored red house on Winthrop Street. The restaurant specializes in lobster, but its menu expands to other seafood like scallops and salmon as well as pasta and sandwiches.
My friend and I started our culinary cruise with Baked Stuffed Cape Cod Oysters ($9). Each of the four oysters on the plate was topped with spring onions, shiitake mushrooms, and buttered crumbs over a bed of greens. As someone who prefers the salty, natural taste of raw oysters, the restaurant's stuffed alternatives were a bit artificial and heavy for my liking.
The Maine Crab Cake Sandwich ($13) was served as two mini sliders with a side of lettuce and potato salad. The crispy crab cakes unfortunately lacked the much-desired lumpy crabmeats, while the creamy and spicy tanginess from the chipotle-caper remoulade was too overpowering. The buns for the sliders looked and tasted like plain dinner rolls in the dining hall.
Of its extensive lobster entrees, we opted for the Lobster Risotto ($25), hoping that we would be able to enjoy this sea creature without laboring to shuck its shell. Prepared with fresh lobster meat, Swiss chard, and triple cream brie, the risotto was too watery as though the chef accidentally added an extra cup of water. Granted that I tend to add a dash of salt to almost everything I eat, this dish also tasted bland without having rich, savory flavors.
All in all, not the best meal. Have you been? If so, let me know if it was any good by leaving a comment - I'm always game to give restaurants a second chance!

As former governor of Massachusetts, winner of the Baker Scholar for graduating in the top five percent of his class, and founder of a multi-billion dollar investment firm, you would think that the Harvard Business School would be proud to count Mitt Romney as an alumnus.
Instead, an overwhelming majority of HBS students support Barack Obama in the upcoming election. Where is the love?
The Harbus, HBS' independent newspaper, conducted the poll last week. Granted, only a third of the student body participated, but the numbers suggest some major Obamamania. Despite graduating in 1975 with a joint business and law degree, Romney garnered only 32 percent of the vote. Our current president won 65 percent.
Luckily for Romney, the rest of the country is giving him some love. Both Real Clear Politics and Rasmussen Reports,  polling data websites, have had Obama and Romney at a virtual tie for the last few days, with each candidate polling at 47 percent. As the numbers stand, Romney has a good chance (well, an equal chance) of defeating Obama to become the second presidential alumnus from HBS...the first being George W. Bush.
The Crimson has released its own university-wide poll which asks students not only to weigh in on the presidential election, but also on the race between incumbent Senator Scott Brown and former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren. Student opinions on Massachusetts ballot initiatives for marijuana legalization and physician-assisted suicide are also sampled.
At a school that Richard M. Nixon called "the Kremlin on the Charles," we're pretty sure the results will favor Obama. But it's still worth asking: really, HBS? Where is the Romney love?
