After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael Caine is old. “Going in Style” establishes this helpful information early: In the first scene, when Caine’s Joe Harding sits in the waiting area of his brilliantly lit bank and the receptionist calls his number, he struggles to get up, a classically old-person thing to do. We quickly learn that Caine’s co-stars, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin, are old too. The trio’s octogenarian characters, former steelworkers, play bocce in New York parks, eat unappetizing meals at their lodge, and make curmudgeonly comments about “The Bachelorette.”
It’s a good thing we learn these characters’ backgrounds so early, because the humor in this featherweight comedy overwhelmingly relies on it. Old men spend a lot of time in the bathroom. They move slowly. They’re set in their ways. They’re baffled by inflation. Luckily, these three all have vibrant family lives. Caine walks his plucky granddaughter (Joey King) to school, Freeman talks to his on Skype, and Arkin reluctantly falls in love with a grocery store proprietor (Ann-Margaret). Aside from being Hollywood-cheeky, Caine’s Joe and Freeman’s Willie have only one distinguishing feature: age. (Arkin’s Albert gets a bit more personality as a constant complainer, a role right up Arkin’s alley.) Christopher Lloyd, who is also old, gamely plays an even older man in their lodge, providing jokes about even older people—confusion, paranoia, hearing loss—as well as a nearly literal specter of what awaits the trio in a few years.
The premise of the 1979 “Going in Style,” starring George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg, was essentially that three old guys decide to rob a bank to break the monotony of their retirement. Upon succeeding, they head to Vegas, but the authorities are close behind. Overcome with stress, Strasberg and, later, Carney die, and Burns is jailed. In the 2017 update, screenwriter Theodore Melfi, who also wrote “Hidden Figures” and “St. Vincent,” seems to have made every effort to lighten the tone, lower the stakes, sweeten the comedy, and generally iron out any complexity found in Martin Brest’s original. This time, the bank they rob is their own, and it’s foreclosing Joe’s house using a fraudulent mortgage. But even this much moral ambiguity was apparently too much: The same bank is also responsible for eliminating their steelworker pensions. In need of even more justification, Melfi makes Willie need an expensive kidney transplant and paints every bank employee as a greedy, sniveling coward. Without spoiling too much, let’s just say the remake’s characters generally find much, much happier endings than their counterparts in the original. As a result, their character arcs flatten into oblivion. The only lessons learned are that robbing a bank is really easy and that love is real.
Zach Braff, who previously directed the cult classics “Garden State” and “Wish I Was Here,” builds tension pretty successfully in the scenes heading into the climactic robbery. The robbery scene itself, however, stretches to an absurd length, which might be less of a problem if the characters had not repeatedly discussed the brevity of their window. The spectacularly incompetent FBI bases their case on a toddler picking Morgan Freeman out of a lineup. In one of the most painfully predictable and drawn-out scenes in this surprise-free movie, the toddler lies him out of trouble because his watch has a picture of his granddaughter. Braff fills every quiet moment with aggressive emotional cues from Rob Simonsen’s generic heist-comedy score. He uses that technique for cheap effect in the third act: He first feigns the protagonist’s discovery by the FBI, and then the death of a major character. A change in music or a zoom-out later, the audiences realize they’ve been played for fools. It’s rather funny in a cynical way, but it also draws attention to the sugarcoating of the plot and threatens our suspended disbelief. Braff and cinematographer Rodney Charters meet Melfi with equal saccharinity, filling every frame with Easter-candy color. Scenes transition with strange sitcom-meets-heist cuts, and Braff awkwardly intercuts “security camera” shots for little effect.
Largely thanks to its cast, “Going in Style” does not waste all of its tight 96-minute run time. Caine, Freeman, and especially Arkin find laughs and occasional moments of humanity in their lines, and the entertainment value of watching Caine and Freeman smoke pot on screen is undeniable. Kenan Thompson delights in his brief appearance. Jeremy Shinder, who played a similarly pudgy and difficult New York tween in “Louie,” delivers two of the funniest moments in the movie. And although he doesn’t find much novel insight, Melfi’s script reflects the diversity of attitudes towards aging even within a single individual, particularly through Arkin’s character. But funnier old-guy movies with smarter plots, more heart, and, yes, more style abound.

Open on Havana. It’s a “Fast and Furious” movie, so the sun is shining, the music is blasting, the colors are bright, everyone’s having fun, and none of the women in this crowd of hundreds are wearing clothes below the upper thigh. There’s a villain, of course, with an expensive car. The hero, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), is going to race him in the Cuban Mile. Engines roar. Dom will win, of course, in some appropriately dramatic way—in this case, driving a burning junkyard car backwards across the finish line. The villain sees the error of his ways. The crowd applauds. Cue upbeat Cuban music.
The film should have ended there. This opening sequence was spectacular. It took practically all of the franchise’s standout features—vibrant urban scenes, beautiful cars, thrilling race footage—and compressed them into a simple but outstanding ten minutes. And unlike the rest of the film, it was actually about car racing.
Unfortunately, there’s a lot of movie left to go at this point. Enter Charlize Theron as “Cipher,” a silly villain name that will only be used in quotes for the rest of this review, spouting a mix of plot synopsis (“You’re going to betray your brothers, abandon your code, and shatter your family”) and otherwise inexcusably bad dialogue (“This is fate”). It’s nice that Theron is the franchise’s first female villain, and her performance isn’t exactly bad, but she’s saddled with the worst parts of the film’s worst aspect—its plot.
Why does “Cipher” need Dom to help her in a convoluted nuclear scheme that requires little to no skill at driving cars? No good reason. Why doesn’t Dom, coerced by “Cipher” into this elaborate plot, simply tell his friends what’s going on? No good reason. If you have a “Why” question about this film, odds are the answer is going to be “No good reason.”
Organizationally, the storyline of “The Fate of the Furious” is a mess. The main plot with Diesel and Theron is terrible. Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) seem to be characters in what would have been a perfectly good buddy cop movie if it weren’t jammed into one of the subplots. The rest of Dom’s crew flails around in the background, mostly useless except for occasional comic relief.
Still, nobody’s really watching these things for the plot. How does “Fate of the Furious” do on spectacle? The core concepts for action sequences are generally excellent: a car chase ended by a swinging wrecking ball, a bunch of cars hacked and turned into a self-driving zombie convoy in the streets of New York, and a car chase across thin ice with a submarine below. But in implementation—and here new director F. Gary Gray deserves a bit of blame—they don’t quite pop the way the standout scenes in “Fast Five” or “Furious 7” did.
The execution isn’t exactly bad. There’s a delightful sequence of self-driving cars flinging themselves out of the upper stories of parking garages, for instance, with an inspired shot of one car’s proximity sensor suddenly detecting the street as it falls towards it. But in general, the action sequences lack the “wow” factor of those in the prior installment, and they definitely lack the careful management of tension that characterized the franchise’s best film, “Fast Five.”
There are other good parts besides action sequences. There’s a truly hilarious scene reintroducing Hobbs at the beginning of the movie in which he has taken up coaching a terrifying girls’ soccer team, watched by a bevy of lustful mothers. “There seems to be more moms than kids,” another character comments. Practically every scene between Hobbs and Shaw is golden. “I will beat you like a Cherokee drum,” Hobbs threatens Shaw, superhuman muscles conveniently flexing. “Good luck with that, Hercules,” Shaw responds, in a jab at one of Johnson’s past roles.
Actors who aren’t Statham and Johnson have good moments too. A scene near the climax in which several characters attempt to power down a Russian sub and find that the controls are in Russian is genuinely funny. Even Theron gets one good scene, giving Dom a gun, daring him to shoot her, and then cowing him with a quiet, even-toned monologue.
“Fate of the Furious” is littered with good moments. Unfortunately, they’re all jammed into this silly superspy story and don’t work as part of a cohesive whole. At the end of the day, “The Fast and the Furious” is supposed to be about cars. So the endemic misunderstanding of the kinds of things cars can be expected to do—a misunderstanding that by this point sees the gang morphed, with little acknowledgement of the change over the course of the franchise, from street racers into black ops superspies—has pushed the franchise out of its area of expertise and into an unflattering comparison with other spy franchises.
When I reviewed the last installment of this franchise, I warned that “Furious 7” had reached the limits of audience suspension of disbelief. Continuing in this direction would mean a diminution in quality. It gives me only a little pleasure to be proven right: While “Fate of the Furious” maintains the same approximate quality in many of its scenes, it falls short as a whole.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students returning to their rooms last Sunday night received a frightening mock notice in their door baskets, informing them that the “Harvard Special Investigation Unit” had detained a member of their dorm. The flyers, designed by the Palestine Solidarity Committee and co-signed by the Harvard Concilio Latino, the Harvard Islamic Society, and the Harvard Black Students Association, were almost immediately the subject of controversy on campus. Some of these student groups have since released apology statements, acknowledging that while they were meant to raise awareness for a panel on mass incarceration and deportation, the flyers were deeply insensitive to students for whom these topics can be risks in their daily lives.
We feel that it is important to recognize that the student groups involved in producing and distributing the fake notice had good intentions. They were working on challenging issues that are very pertinent to members of the student body. The notice’s traumatic effect indeed underscores that many unfortunately continue to feel threatened in the current political environment. This palpable fear felt by undergraduates personally affected by deportation and mass incarceration demonstrates that more work needs to be done to protect their safety on campus, and Harvard should play a greater role in assuaging this fear.
Yet the method by which these groups chose to publicize their advocacy work was unequivocally wrong. In an effort to draw attention in an oversaturated market of extracurricular events, resorting to the satirization and appropriation of such serious issues is tasteless and can cause harm.
While the flyers aimed to elicit the same emotional reactions that real victims of deportation and indefinite detention face, manufacturing this fear in students is self-serving and unproductive. The students most affected by the flyers were those already personally familiar with these issues. Few were warned ahead of time, and some believed that these notices were real, triggering deeply rooted fears. It is unlikely that the notices evoked a similar reaction in people untouched by these issues, and thus these flyers had a disproportionate impact on the very students they intended to serve.
In the future, we urge student groups handling sensitive topics to reflect on the gravity of their rhetoric and mechanisms for seeking publicity. Despite the best of intentions, actions can inadvertently harm other students and the campus. In this case, more direct attempts to publicize the panel event mentioned in the notice would have been preferable.

“Don’t you feel guilty about liking fashion, because it’s so superficial?”
Recently, someone asked me to justify my love of clothes, and I felt like the wind was knocked out of me. In fact, I renamed my column this semester, from “Justify My Love (of Clothes)” to the current “Fashion Statements” to signify that I was finished with proving to people that my interests mattered.
But this question that felt like a punch to the gut brought me back to sophomore fall, when I won a lottery to have lunch with a famous visiting chef at the Faculty Club. When it was my turn to do so, I explained—to my two professors, a couple of students I had just met, and the guest of honor—what I study: in a word, clothes. Mr. Visiting Chef sneered. “Fashion?” He retorted with something to the effect of “What’s the point of that?”
I felt like his question was an accusation. It’s one I receive often, sometimes in more subtle ways. It happens  when classmates act surprised when they read my essays about clothing and find that I’m talking about cultural shifts, intricate economic systems, or issues of identity and mental health. “No offense,” they say, and I wait to be offended: “I expected you to write something superficial.”
It happens when family members hear that I study History and Literature and write about clothes, and ask, “What are you going to do with that?,” as if I should treat my interests and passions like a tool to get ahead. As if I should already know how to use them to do something.
I don’t mean to victimize myself. As my academic advisor told me a few days ago, everyone is questioned about their interests at some point in their career. I believe that this is true.
But of all the art forms, I think fashion receives some undue criticism that is based on serious misconceptions about what clothing could signify if we created and consumed it more thoughtfully.
When I tell people that I love clothes, I sense that they think I simply love to shop. They might imagine that my closet is humongous, that I have hundreds of pairs of shoes, or that I spend thousands of dollars a year on outfits I’ll only wear once. I’m not surprised that this is the case—the fashion bloggers who command everyone’s attention these days make that life seem pretty glamorous, and the fashion industry has been all too willing to collaborate with them.
Chiara Ferragni is one example that comes to mind—her blog The Blonde Salad chronicles an extremely lavish lifestyle. Ferragni has multiple homes all over the world—each with a walk-in closet teeming with expensive clothes—and has managed to make such a profit from the blog and its related businesses that she now guest-lectures at Harvard Business School. Her Instagram exhibits a parade of high-price items that she seemingly never wears more than once. But the fashion world loves her.
Ferragni is not alone, nor is she a villain. There are plenty of bloggers just like her, and I admit that I’ve found her Instagram to be a fun escape from tedium on occasion.
The thing is, though, I don’t want her life, and it doesn’t actually have much to do with the way I want to think about fashion. There’s nothing necessarily specific to fashion about her excesses: she could buy cars or food or real estate in the same way that she buys clothes—over and over and over again, until she realizes that there is more to life than Chanel.
I don’t love to shop—I love to look at clothes. I don’t buy things on impulse—I buy them with care. And though I’m willing to admit that I own more clothes than are strictly necessary to my survival, I’m grateful for each piece in a different way.
That sounds melodramatic, but it’s true. When I shrug on the sweater my mother bought me for Valentine’s Day, it feels as if she’s hugging me. Every time I wear my white silk blouse, I remember the day I bought it and relive happy memories of being with my family in Washington, D.C. I could tell you something special about every item in my closet, whether I saved up to buy it or it cost me fifty cents.
For me, clothes are repositories for memories. They are comfort, too, because it’s easier to construct an outfit than a personality. On days when I don’t know who I am, I feel a little bit better knowing that I’m at least sure of how I want others to see me.
Clothing as I describe it here is different from Fashion, the fancy clothes that make up a billion-dollar, global industry. Of course, the two are related. And fashion is complicated. Unlike musicians, who manipulate instruments, or sculptors, who manipulate clay, fashion designers manipulate something that happens to be a basic necessity: clothing. You can’t deny the irony in a $1,400 coat worn by some Harvard students when over 1,500 families spend cold nights on the streets of Boston—the same amount of money could go a long way in procuring housing for those families. Ferragni does seem tone-deaf when we think about her in the context of a large problem like poverty in America or even a more manageable one, like homelessness in Cambridge.
But perhaps it isn’t productive to associate clothing-as-art with clothing-as-necessity. That’s uncomfortable. But if we’re going to give the fashion industry a hard time for creating something aesthetic that does not fix one of the world’s many problems directly, then we should fault Michael Jackson and Pablo Picasso and Mark Zuckerberg for the same. In at least one way, fashion has a lot in common with music, sculpting, or even coding: Designing and styling it is an art, and the resulting masterpiece has the potential to make quite a bit of change if you take the time to develop it.
I wish I’d been ready with an answer for the chef two years ago and my classmate two months ago.
Apparently, it takes me a while to formulate a good comeback.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard had been around for well over a century by the time April 19, 1775 rolled around. What transpired that day will never be forgotten, as our nation’s founders fought the Battles of Lexington and Concord—the opening battles of the American Revolutionary War. In 1894, to commemorate this revolutionary fight for American ideals—including liberty, equality, democracy, and tolerance—Harvard alumnus and Massachusetts Governor Frederic Greenhalge declared April 19 Patriots’ Day, now celebrated on the third Monday of April. Public high schools, public colleges, and state-based offices all close to observe Patriots’ Day. Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern, Wellesley College, Holy Cross, Babson, Tufts, Emerson, Suffolk University, Bentley, and UMass all respect this state-wide holiday. Wait. What about that other school in Cambridge? Yes, MIT does too.
While following suit isn’t typical of Harvard, it is high time that Harvard respected and honored Patriots’ Day. After all, military service is the ultimate display of patriotism, and as Dean Khurana so frequently and eloquently states, “other than the two oldest military academies, no institution has given more lives in service of its nation than Harvard College. And other than the two oldest military academies, no institution has more people who’ve been awarded the Medal of Honor than the College.”
Perhaps no event symbolizes Patriots’ Day quite like the Boston Marathon, which links the Athenian and American struggles for liberty (the word marathon is derived from the Greek Battle of Marathon). Beginning in Hopkinton and stretching 26.2 miles to the finish line on Boylston Street in Boston, the Boston Marathon is both the world’s oldest and most iconic annual marathon. It was first run in 1897 and has always taken place on Patriots’ Day to memorialize the pursuit of liberty. The prestigious race featuring exclusive qualifying times still marks an extraordinary platform for showcasing toughness, durability, endurance, and commitment from top performers, but an amendment to the qualifying rules now reserves spots for a few fundraising charities.
This year alone runners from these charities have combined to fundraise over $28 million. As the most-watched live sporting event in New England, the marathon draws over 500,000 spectators annually. But spectators do more than watch the race. By distributing waters and snacks, making signs, cheering, and in some cases even running a portion of the race, spectators provide a huge morale boost to all runners, even those they don’t even know. Taking into account all of the contributions of volunteers, supporters, and the runners themselves, the Boston Marathon brings together millions of participants every year in an inclusive and patriotic way. Unfortunately, Harvard students are left out of this quintessential coming together of the greater Boston community.
So why is it such a big deal now?
For as much patriotism and pride as Patriots’ Day gave Boston and the surrounding area before April 15, 2013, the Boston bombings that took place on that fateful day—taking the lives of three and injuring hundreds more—have elevated the marathon to another level. Boston Strong, a rallying cry that has become emblematic of the city’s impassioned and defiant response to the bombings, represents the unbreakable bond that unifies the entire state. Everyone in Massachusetts shares the pride of being a Bostonian.
For such a heart-wrenching atrocity, the response was uniquely incredible. The entire state worked together to help the injured and minimize damage. An attempt to break Boston’s back only invigorated it. The city rallied and the entire state of Massachusetts came together to recognize its heroes and move forward. This past December, Mark Wahlberg starred in Patriots Day, a commemorative film that does justice to the tragic events and the inspiring response of the entire state.
Every student studying in Massachusetts has the right to truly experience Patriots’ Day in Boston. It’s part of the experience of coming to school here, and barring students from having the opportunity to do so hinders our collective experience at this otherwise empowering institution. In many ways, keeping us from experiencing this community-oriented day further strengthens the grip of the Harvard bubble and promotes a culture that fails to concern itself with the very community in which it thrives.
For all of the inclusivity, unity, and community-building efforts that Harvard publicly promotes, failing to honor such an important day in this nation’s history is disrespectful. After graduating from the College, Harvard students won’t remember the 23rd lecture of today's classes. They would, however, remember the moving experience of Patriots’ Day shared with classmates and all of the greater Boston community.
I encourage anyone who hasn’t yet seen the Boston Marathon—Mile 21 and the finish line are the best viewing spots—to make the effort at least one year over your time at Harvard. It truly is one day when everyone is a Bostonian, and it’s amazing what unity can accomplish. I hope that sometime soon it will be part of the academic calendar, but until then, feel free to join me and a large cohort of Harvard students in excusing ourselves for the day to be a Patriot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University of California, Berkeley filed an appeal Thursday that challenges the Harvard-affiliated Broad Institute for the rights to CRISPR, a groundbreaking gene-editing technology.
The Broad Institute, a genetics research center affiliated with both Harvard and MIT, won a patent lawsuit against UC Berkeley in February. A US Patent Trial court ruled after a year-long legal battle that researchers at the Broad Institute had rights to the CRISPR patent in eukaryotic cells, which include animal and human cells and are primary targets for commercial purposes.
In their appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, UC Berkeley researchers are requesting a reversal of February’s court decision, arguing it was never truly determined who invented the use of CRISPR in eukaryotic cells, according to UK Reuters.
CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing is a cutting-edge technique that enables scientists to edit portions of organisms’ genetic codes with greater precision than in several older techniques of gene surgery. In the future, scientists predict CRISPR may be able to eliminate genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia.
While the Broad Institute is confident that Harvard and MIT have the rights to CRISPR, UC Berkeley researchers have already been granted a CRISPR patent for eukaryotic cells in the United Kingdom, and the European Patent Office is expected to award them another, Reuters reported.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 18, 2017 at 3:50 p.m.
When English professor Louis Menand accepted a post at Harvard in 2003, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s resources seemed unlimited.
FAS was in the midst of expanding its ranks, Harvard was pouring cash into land developments in Allston, the endowment was posting consistently high returns, and Menand said professors felt there was enough money “for every important thing that we felt that we wanted to do.”
But just six years later, the world was in the midst of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, and Harvard was not sheltered from the catastrophe. By September 2009, the crisis had swept away 27.3 percent of the University’s endowment, trimmed $77 million dollars from the FAS budget, and severely damaged the Faculty’s sense of optimism.
Speaking to Faculty at a meeting in October 2008, then-newly-appointed University President Drew G. Faust warned of the effects of the economic downturn.
“This University has survived revolutions, [a] civil war, downturns, and depressions, for more than 370 years, and our endowment enables us to pursue our ambitions over the long term with great consistency,” she said. “But the world is enveloped in a serious financial crisis, and we are not an exception.”
While its financial situation has come a long way since what FAS Dean Michael D. Smith calls the “craziness” of 2008, the Faculty is once again beset with financial difficulties. Multiple years of anemic endowment returns—including a consequential $1.9 billion drop in the size of the endowment value last fiscal year—have forced administrators to make difficult choices to cope with a financial reality far from the halcyon days of the early 2000s.
Among some, there's a sense that Harvard still hasn't fully recovered from the global financial collapse of 2008. Smith said the endowment's recent performance—panned as "disappointing" by many administrators—has not helped.
“It’s just that regular drumbeat of not many years between those slips that has caused the pain,” he said. “We went through a multi-year process and I think we did what we needed to do to get out of [the crisis]. And then we just haven’t had—we hoped for a bunch of good years, but we just never had those."
‘BUCKET OF MONEY’ NO LONGER
The effect of the global financial crisis on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences became clear in December 2008.
In April 2008, administrators struggled to attract faculty to monthly FAS meetings. In December, though, news of freezes on faculty searches and salary raises drew professors to the meeting in droves, forcing many to sit on the floor and stand three-deep in the doorways to University Hall’s Faculty Room.
At the meeting, Smith asked professors to consider how they could cut 10 to 15 percent of their departmental budgets.
“Everyone look at their budgets and tell me what they can possibly do,” Smith said at the meeting.
In a recent interview, Smith said the crisis changed the entire academic planning process in FAS.
“It put us on a path of having to—I think for many good reasons—be more thoughtful about how we’re spending our resources, making sure that our resources are going to our most important academic priorities,” he said.
Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott, an East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor, said his department was forced to admit fewer graduate students at the time. Budget constraints also imposed severe staff cuts on the Harvard-Yenching Library, which Elliott said is a key reason many scholars of East Asia choose Harvard.
Elliott said the hiring freeze was particularly painful for the department.
“That’s something that departments rely on to stay young, to stay fresh and to make sure that the people who are teaching in the classroom represent the latest and most interesting and best scholarship,” he said.
Menand said the financial crisis changed the availability of funding in the department.
“You just couldn’t assume that there’s a bucket of money that you can dip into,” he said.
In an emailed statement, English Department Chair James Simpson wrote that the department "remains extremely well-funded" and pointed to a number of funding opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.
"Our mantra is that if we have the money, we spend it so as to nourish the lives of our students, both undergraduate and graduate," he wrote. "2008 did not make a significant difference."
But Elliott mentioned a smaller indicator of FAS’s troubles from the recession era—the cookies and coffee were gone from Faculty meetings.
‘PROBLEMS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE’
Today, though meeting refreshments have returned, the Faculty continues to grapple with suboptimal financial circumstances.
Poor endowment returns and dwindling cash reserves have compelled FAS to decrease the number of graduate students accepted this year by 4.4 percent. Additionally, Faculty compensation and graduate student stipends are both increasing at a rate below the rate of inflation. In February, Smith said most new faculty hires would only replace departed or retired faculty members.
“I think there’s a lot of concern that the FAS budget is looking at some problems for the foreseeable future,” Menand said.
Smith said the situation has been exacerbated by nonexistent FAS reserves, uncertainty about federal funding in the Trump era, and greater investments in areas like House renewal, which will be funded partially by debt.
After the news of the modest compensation increase, several professors said they were concerned with the financial health of FAS, and of the endowment in particular. Elliott said he hopes changes in Harvard Management Company—which hired a new CEO in the fall and will lay off half its staff by the end of the calendar year—will lead FAS in a more positive financial direction.
“My personal hope is that this will produce some better results,” he said. “If the endowment doesn’t do well that’s a real problem.”
Despite the diminished financial capacity of FAS, Menand said “all of us feel very happy” with the resources that Harvard provides.
“It’s a very generous institution,” he said. “I came from an institution where we didn’t have paper clips.”
Smith offered a similarly moderate view.
“It doesn’t mean the world is ending,” he said.

Harvard scientists have launched the largest-ever research program into “solar geoengineering,” a controversial technique involving the injection of aerosols into the stratosphere with the goal of cooling the planet and reversing climate change.
Launched this weekend, Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program will investigate the safety of geoengineering as well as its environmental and political implications. Scientists specifically look into a technique of injecting specific particles into Earth’s upper atmosphere to create a barrier that reflects more sunlight away from the atmosphere.
“This would therefore offset some of the climate impacts from global warming by cooling down the global temperature of the earth,” said Elizabeth T. Burns, a research fellow at SEAS.
Its proponents tout solar geoengineering as a climate change mitigation tactic to supplement other remedies, which include reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. But the technology is not without its risks: the sulfate aerosols that would be used produce sulfuric acid, which could dangerously damage the ozone layer.
With the program’s launch, Harvard affiliates may now apply for grants and funding to pursue research in the field.
Environmental Science and Public Policy lecturer Gernot Wagner '02, who co-directs the project, said the researchers aim to gather evidence showing the benefits of solar geoengineering. Wagner also said he wants solar geoengineering to be taken seriously as an additional strategy to mitigate climate change, which scientists say may pose serious threats to life on Earth.
David Keith, an Applied Physics professor who also co-directs the program, said he ultimately hopes to create a blueprint that estimates how the technology could be managed, financed, and governed based on its potential risks and environmental impact.
The initiative will be housed under Harvard’s Center for the Environment, and will have an advisory committee with affiliates from the Center for Environment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Kennedy School, according to Burns.
Keith added that the program has to date raised $7.3 million, but hopes to eventually grow this sum to $20 million. Non-profit organizations including The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Open Philanthropy Project, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation have donated to the project, he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to partially fund tailgates before Yardfest at its general meeting Sunday, though some members said they were disappointed that the Office of Student Life asked the UC help foot the bill.
Last year, the Council partnered with the OSL to fund “block parties” in each neighborhood of upperclassmen Houses, pulling monies from its Grant for an Open Harvard College, which is geared towards funding one-time events. This year, funding for the events—which provides students free food and drinks before the College’s annual outdoor concert— is not funded entirely by the OSL, as Council representatives originally anticipated.
The Council voted at its general meeting Sunday to contribute $3000 to supplement the OSL funds. Dunster House representative Alex Popovski ’19 said after weeks of back-and-forth between the OSL and the UC, the OSL reached out on Friday to request partial funding for the tailgates.
At the meeting, representatives said they originally thought the OSL would fund the block parties in full, since it is typically responsible for paying for events after their debut with GOHC funding.
“I think there has been just a little bit of miscommunication on this whole thing, because last year when we funded this, we funded this through GOHC,” said UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18. “GOHC is specifically only for first time events. We thought that the OSL would pick up the tab, because I think the point of GOHC is when there are successful events, the College will then hopefully in following years pick up the full amount.”
UC Treasurer Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said he opposed providing the $3000 to fund Friday’s tailgates, as he said GOHC funding is meant for “institutionalizing things.”
“They should be the ones who take the fall on this, not us,” he said. “We shouldn’t be the ones who have to bend over backwards to try to make sure everything happens in the way that they want to.”
Despite his objections to the legislation to allocate the funding, Boucher proposed an amendment, which passed unanimously, to fund the tailgates from the “emergency fund” instead of the “discretionary fund.” Boucher said after the meeting that the emergency fund is used for “high-pressure situations,” while the discretionary fund is more flexible.
Adams House representative Anna T. Wechsler ’18 said students’ tailgates should not suffer from internal deliberations between the OSL and the UC.
“I think the Yardfest tailgates are really important events,” she said. “It’s a really great way for students who aren’t maybe always in the party scene feel more included, because everyone can go, it’s with your neighborhood.”
She added: “I think it’s important to recognize it’s not the students who are at fault here, so they shouldn’t necessarily be the ones to like lose out.”
Eliot House representative Taylor D. Marquis '18 agreed and said it was not the time for the UC to deny funding.
“I don’t think that this is a time for us to flex our muscles and show the OSL,” he said. “They’ll be funding most of it, actually.”
Ultimately, the legislation passed by a hand vote of 28-13-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before tens of thousands of marathoners descend on the streets of Boston Monday, a smaller but spirited cohort set out at midnight to trace their entire route—albeit on two wheels.
The Boston Midnight Marathon Bike Ride is held annually on the eve of the Boston Marathon, and about 1,000 cyclists participate each year. This year, the Harvard Outing Club organized a contingent of College students to ride the course.
A group of 15 students, decked out in glow stick bracelets, light-up necklaces, and mohawk helmets, gathered on an otherwise dark Linden Street at 12:30 a.m. Monday morning. With Ed Sheeran playing quietly in the background—out of respect for their sleeping peers—the group exchanged phone numbers and fastened glow stick accessories as they prepared to take to the streets of Boston.
The Midnight Marathon first occurred in 2009, and has grown from its original size of around 50 cyclists. This year, there are two official routes—one measuring 30.6 miles and the other 27.3 miles, avoiding a steep hill—and at the end all participants ride over the marathon’s finish line.
Although the event has no official registration, start time, or leaders, members of Harvard’s group said they added structure to the ride so it would be safe for all participants.
“The leaders meet beforehand to come up with a kind of a set of guidelines to make sure that everyone is going to be safe,” said Zachary A. Chauvin ’17, a member of the Outing Club who helped organize Harvard’s Midnight Marathon. “We always have one leader who’s in the front, one leader who’s in the back, and then as people spread out we just make sure that we have track of everyone.”
Chauvin added that this year, Harvard students did not ride the official route in its entirety. Instead, he said that students met up with the larger group halfway through the course, because Harvard’s campus is several miles from the start point of the Midnight Marathon route.
“In order to do the whole thing, we would have to bike 50 miles in total, which is too much,” Chauvin said. “So we’re going to bike just on random roads halfway and then meet up with the course and then ride on the actual course for the latter half.”
Some Midnight Marathon participants said they partook  in Monday morning’s festivities to support Harvard classmates who are running the Boston Marathon.
Outing Club member Julia L. Versel ’17 said she was disappointed that Harvard’s group did not ride the full course, but added she was happy to ride regardless. Versel said she rode to support her roommate, Kruti B. Vora ’17, who will run the marathon later Monday.
“I’m doing this to support Kruti, but also to see what she’ll be experiencing the next day, so I’m really excited,” Versel said. “Originally, I wanted to do the full thing, but I figured it would be better to go with people I know...so I decided to go on the HOC trip.”
Cyclist Paul Lisker ’17, one of the non-Outing Club participants, said he was excited to meet members of the Outing Club as well as to take part in the city-wide celebration.
“The idea of doing the marathon route, or at least part of it, is very exciting given how festive the city becomes as the Marathon Monday approaches,” Lisker said.  “It’s the camaraderie of being with friends and meeting new people at the Outing Club but also playing my small part in celebrating what is one of the nicest days of the Boston year."

The College’s penalties on members of single-gender social organizations could just be the beginning of a broader effort to reduce the social influence of final clubs and Greek organizations if the current policy does not do so adequately, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview Friday.
“As we said when we issued the policy in the first place, it might turn out to be an interim step if we felt that the policy had not succeeded in addressing the concerns about exclusion and hierarchy, both gender and other forms of hierarchy that the current arrangement with single-gender student organizations has reified on the campus," she said.
In previous interviews, Faust has said membership in final clubs should not be based on “accidents of birth,” and that club membership is unlikely to be representative of the socioeconomic and racial diversity of the College. But beyond prompting some of the groups to become gender-neutral, Faust said that the policy is intended to diminish the social cachet of the groups in undergraduate social life.
“My hope is that the policy will accomplish changes in the nature of those organizations that will give them less magnetism, force, status within the larger community, so that they can exist and be whatever they are, but they don’t set a tone for everything else,” she said.
The policy, proposed by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in May 2016, bars members of single-gender social organizations, starting with the class of 2021, from receiving College endorsement for select fellowships and from holding leadership positions in student organizations or captaincies on Varsity teams. An implementation committee has since expanded the list of honors and organizations that will be off-limits to members of noncompliant social organizations.
A faculty committee is now re-examining the policy, which could be “revised or replaced.” In the past, Faust has said she is open to alternatives to the current policy, and in her initial communication about the policy in May she wrote that she did not support banning membership in single-gender groups outright “at this time.”
Although the policy was originally billed partly as an effort to address sexual assault, administrators have framed the policy around promoting inclusivity and dismantling what Khurana called “exclusionary values that undermine those of the larger Harvard College community.”
Administrators hope gender integration will serve as the mechanism for doing so. By pushing clubs to go co-ed, Faust said she aims to break their dominance in the Harvard social scene.
"It also arose from the sense that the policy could disempower those organizations within student social life in a way that would accomplish our goal of building an overall inclusive environment on campus,” Faust said.
Since then, four social groups have adopted gender neutral membership policies  in order to comply with the policy, and their future members will not be penalized. Per recommendations from a committee tasked with implementing  the policy,  the College has created a “provisional social organization” designation for clubs who maintain “non-discriminatory membership requirements.”
Faust said she met with members of implementation committee last week to learn more about their recommendations.
Faust said she hopes to return to the clubs to the periphery of undergraduate social life. In conversations she’s had with alumni, she said she has learned that a generation ago, final clubs did not host large parties, existing instead as members-only spaces on the periphery of undergraduate social life. That changed after the mid-1980s, when the federal government effectively raised the drinking age from 18 to 21, Faust posited.
“There were just a bunch of people who had embraced a level of privilege and community that they enjoyed, but it didn’t inhibit anyone else’s sense of importance or belonging or presence,” Faust said. “I think when the drinking age changed, it gave the single-gender social organizations a kind of aura and power that has distorted undergraduates’ social life since then, and we’re trying to undo that prominence and that authority in a sense, that status that these clubs have.”
A 1958 Crimson article described the scant influence of the clubs at the time, stating that “an overwhelming majority of students have no concern for clubs at all” and referring to them as “little bastions of society in a university world that no longer cares.”
Faust makes her comments as the policy is again under construction. The faculty committee reviewing it will report to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and Faust will approve the final policy. In March, Smith announced that Khurana would co-chair the committee—an appointment some faculty members criticized at a faculty meeting earlier this month.
In an interview Friday, Faust said she believes Khurana must lead a committee whose recommendations he will be tasked with implementing.
"I think he absolutely needs to be in that position, because he’s a person who is going to have to execute any policy changes and whatever the policy is, and he understands the complexities of that, he understands undergraduate student life, he’s very embedded in it,” Faust said. “He needs to have his voice in shaping what comes out and his expertise applied to the discussion, not just to be presented with something that he is forced to own but has had no input into making."
The faculty committee is slated to release a report in the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While students have largely shrugged at Harvard’s announcement that it would rewrite the final lyric of its 181-year-old alma mater, University President Drew G. Faust said Friday she views the change as important to the University’s reexamination of its history.
Earlier this month, the Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging proposed changing the last line of “Fair Harvard,” which presently reads “Till the stock of the Puritans die.”
“This is a matter of symbols, which are both large and small in their importance,” Faust said. “I think it’s a first gesture from the committee, and one can say it’s just a line in the song—which it is—but on the other hand, we need, as an institution that has been around for a very long time, to ask ourselves those questions about some of our traditions.” 
She added, “As for the last line of ‘Fair Harvard,’ I’ve always been a little bit bewildered by what it meant, but I do have a certain sympathy with the notion that one’s alma mater should not end with the word ‘die.’”
The lyric change comes at a time when universities across the country have been forced to confront their oftentimes checkered histories. In February, Yale changed the name of Calhoun College, one of its residential colleges named after slavery advocate and statesman John C. Calhoun, and Princeton has had to contend with student activism surrounding former President Woodrow Wilson’s life and the role his legacy should play on campus.
Harvard has not been a stranger to debates surrounding naming and slavery. The University changed the title of House master to “Faculty Dean” in February 2016; Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in an email announcing the change that “titles send a message.” And in March 2016, a Law School committee recommended the school get change its seal, which bore the crest of the slave-owning Royall family.
Yale administrators codified the institution’s response to renaming requests in a 24-page report written by the Committee to Establish Principles on Renaming. In an interview, Faust praised the “thoughtfulness” of the committee producing that report, but stopped short of saying that Harvard should also adopt such principles.
“I wouldn’t want to be constrained by a set of boxes to check, so I would just be wary of being too explicit for setting up the standards for evaluating a name, because I think often the circumstances might exceed or go beyond the specifics that have been anticipated,” Faust said. “So I’d like to make sure that these questions have sufficient attention to the uniqueness of any particular example.”
Faust also said she sees a need for more research about Harvard’s ties to slavery. In March, speaking at a Harvard conference on higher education and slavery, journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates advocated for universities to give monetary reparations; last year, the ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda wrote a letter to Faust calling on Harvard to offer preferential treatment in admissions to Antiguans, some of whom are descendants of slaves owned by the Royall family.
“I want a much fuller picture, and I want to understand how we fit within the picture of slavery in New England that has been so effectively elaborated by historians over the last 20 or 30 years, and also within the United States itself,” Faust said. “So I think I want to know more, but then I think we also have to figure out what does that mean our obligations to the future are?”
Paul Andrew, Harvard’s Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications, wrote in an email that the hiring process for a researcher dedicated to investigating the history of slavery at Harvard is “still ongoing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its 2016 season, Harvard softball went 16-4 in Ivy League play en route to a berth in the Ivy League Championship Series. Entering this weekend, the Crimson had lost five of its eight Ancient Eight matchups.
Returning to Cambridge after an away win at Bryant, Harvard (15-15, 6-6 Ivy) looked to reverse its fortunes as it kicked off its divisional slate with two doubleheaders against Yale (11-24, 5-7). The Crimson managed to do just that, taking three of four from its rival from New Haven.
“It's very important to come out strong in our division,” sophomore third baseman Erin Lockhart said. “The three wins this weekend allowed us to stay in the running, which is huge for us.”
HARVARD 5, YALE 4 (9 innings)
In a nine-inning marathon, Harvard squeaked past the Bulldogs by a 5-4 margin for the second straight game.
In the bottom of the ninth with the score still sitting at 4-4, senior right fielder Maddy Kaplan led off by stroking a single to center field. She immediately stole second to put a runner in scoring position for Lockhart.
With the count full, Lockhart blasted a fastball over the head of Yale right fielder Rachel Paris. Kaplan raced around to score from second without a play at the plate, and the Crimson celebrated its third victory of the weekend in walk-off fashion.
“Erin really came through this weekend when players were on base so the dugout knew she was going to get the job done,” sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich said.
Senior starter Taylor Cabe’s pitching was crucial to keep Yale off the board in the extra innings victory. The Boiling Springs, S.C. native only allowed one Bulldog to reach base in the two frames, and she recorded five of the six final outs via groundout.
“In those extra innings Taylor Cabe did a great job of managing Yale's offense and limiting their hits,” Rich added.
The Bulldogs forced extra innings by squeezing across a run in its half of the sixth. Paris led off with a triple to right. Cabe was able to induce a flyout and a strikeout to retire the next two batters, but senior first baseman Camille Weisenbach poked a single into right field to knot the game at four apiece.
The top half of Harvard’s lineup once again led the way. Rich and Kaplan recorded three hits and two runs each. Two of Rich’s hits were triples, her fourth and fifth of the season. Lockhart had two hits, including the walk-off double, and she drove in three.
Rebounding from a tough loss the previous day, Cabe stayed on the mound for all nine innings, conceding four runs and striking out four for her fourth win of the year.
HARVARD 5, YALE 4
The Crimson kicked off Sunday’s set of games with a win behind yet another strong performance from sophomore lefthander Katie Duncan. Making her second start in the circle in the four-game set, the Allendale, N.J. native went seven strong innings and allowed two earned runs.
“Katie really did a good job hitting her spots and keeping them off balance throughout the weekend,” Lockhart said.
Three runs in the bottom of the second comprised the bulk of Harvard’s offensive output. With two outs and a runner on third, co-captain and second baseman Giana Panariello walked and stole second base. Singles off the bats of Rich and Lockhart brought in three runs.
Two crucial defensive plays stopped Yale from building significant momentum in the late innings.
In the top of the fifth, Bulldog catcher Madison Sack hit a bullet in the hole between second and first. Panariello ranged to her left into the outfield grass, stabbed the ball, and made a spinning throw to beat the runner to first. In the top of the seventh with a runner on first and no outs, Sack sent a deep fly ball curling toward the right field foul pole. Kaplan chased the ball into the corner and made the grab on the track, slamming into the fence and holding on for out number one.
The first four hitters in the Crimson’s lineup combined for five hits and all five runs batted in. Harvard was economical on the basepaths, only stranding five runners.
YALE 14, HARVARD 6 (5 innings)
Yale reversed its fortunes in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader, delivering Harvard a high-scoring 14-6 defeat. The Bulldogs accumulated fewer hits than runs, but it benefited from four free passes, and five of its hits went for extra bases.
The Crimson’s pitching staff struggled from the outset, allowing 10 runs in the top of the second alone. All told, Harvard’s pitchers only struck out one Yale batter in the game.
Sack blasted two home runs and drove in six, and southpaw Terra Jerpbak kept the Crimson at bay despite allowing 10 hits and six runs. Sack’s biggest hit of the day came in the second, as she chased in four with a grand slam.
Despite the gaudy score on Yale’s side, Harvard’s offense kept its momentum from the earlier game. The Crimson posted 10 hits, including a double each from Lockhart and senior left fielder Catherine Callaway.
HARVARD 11, YALE 1 (5 innings)
Harvard beat up on Bulldog senior righthander Lindsay Efflandt in the first game Saturday afternoon in an 11-1 rout.
“On Saturday, we really came out playing loose and relaxed,” Lockhart said. “It allowed us to swing our bats and score a lot of runs early in the weekend and just have fun with the game.”
The Crimson’s offense, pitching, and defense were all in top shape in the first half of the twinbill. Five different Harvard batters mashed six total extra base hits, and Duncan cruised through five innings of one-run ball. Out of 12 starts, Duncan now has four without recording a strikeout, but this start also marked her sixth without allowing a free pass.
Freshman first baseman Olivia Giaquinto continued to rake, blasting her second and third home runs of the season. The Falls Church, Va. native smashed two solo shots over the left-field fence.
At 3-1, the game was closely contested until the Crimson’s turn at bat in the bottom of the fifth. Harvard piled on eight runs in the home half, the most of any inning in any game this season, to pick up the five-inning victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard women’s tennis team, this weekend saw a continuation of a trend of close Ivy League matches. Like all the Crimson’s other Ancient Eight contests this season, this weekend’s away matches were nail biters—both decided by just one point. The team kicked off its road trip with a 4-3 victory against Columbia on Friday afternoon and finished with a loss to Cornell on Saturday by the same narrow margin.
Harvard went into the weekend with confidence after edging both Brown and Yale 4-3 last weekend. This momentum was bolstered by a No. 49 ranking in the ITA rankings announced earlier in the week, the first time the Crimson has broken the top 50 since the 2009-10 season.
“It’s really nice to see how our team is getting stronger and stronger each Ivy League match,” head coach Traci Green said. “Cornell didn’t go our way but the overall spirit and toughness of our team is really showing.”
With its results this weekend, Harvard will stay atop the Ivy League. However, the team has to share possession of the coveted first place with Princeton, which it will face next weekend.
CORNELL, 4, HARVARD, 3
This weekend’s match in Ithaca was not the first meeting between Harvard and Cornell this season. The teams faced each other in the ECAC Championships in February, when the Crimson walked away with a 4-3 victory. This time, however, the roles were reversed, as the Big Red (13-6, 3-2 Ivy League) came out on top.
The deciding point of the match rested on the No. 3 singles match between Harvard freshman Jenna Friedl and Cornell junior Priyanka Shah. After losing the first set 7-6, Friedl battled back to win the second set, also by a margin of 7-6. Despite a 4-1 lead in the third set, the California native was unable to close the final set, falling 7-5.
“Jenna’s a fighter, and Cornell was doing a great job of counterpunching,” coach Green said. “It literally came down to just a few points.”
The match started off strong for the Crimson, as it was able to secure the doubles point with wins in the first and second positions. The duo of captain June Lee and sophomore Erica Oosterhout put on an impressive 6-4 performance against Cornell seniors Marika Cusick and Alexandra D’Ascenzo, improving to 13-9 on the season in the No. 1 doubles slot. Sophomore Sabrina Xiong and junior Annika Ringblom made quick work of Cornell’s second doubles pair, defeating Shah and and sophomore Mariko Iinuma 6-3.
Despite winning the doubles point, Harvard was unable to capitalize on its one-point lead in the singles competition. Oosterhout, playing No. 1 singles, fell to Cusick 6-1, 6-1, and freshmen Lexi Milunovich and Irene Lu fell in the fourth and fifth positions, respectively. After winning her first set 6-2, Milunovich was unable to hang on, ultimately falling by margins of 6-3 and 7-6 in the final two sets. Lu wasn’t able to keep her match as close, losing 6-3, 6-3 to the Big Red’s Iinuma.
Though these three singles losses, combined with Friedl’s defeat in the deciding match, meant the end of Harvard’s unbeaten record in the Ivy League, the match did have some highlights for the Crimson. In the second position, Lee continued her consistent performance with a 6-3, 7-6 win over D’Ascenzo, and in the sixth position, Ringblom battled back from a 6-1 loss in the first set to win the last two sets 7-6 and 6-4.
“Hats off to the way [Cornell] competed at home with their backs against the wall,” Green said. “They came through, and they deserved to win yesterday.”
HARVARD, 4, COLUMBIA, 3
In its first match of the weekend, the Crimson faced a struggling Columbia team. After losing seven of its first eight matches this season the Lions (5-14, 1-4 Ivy League) clinched their first Ivy League win against Penn on April 7. However, they were unable to improve their Ancient Eight record on Friday at home, as Harvard earned the 4-3 win.
The Crimson got off to a slow start, dropping the doubles point with losses in the second and third doubles positions. Freshmen Natasha Gonzalez and Milunovich lost 6-2 at No. 2 doubles, and the No. 3 pair of Lu and Ringblom fell in a similar manner, 6-4. Harvard’s first doubles duo of Oosterhout and Lee, who have been solid all season, didn’t get a chance to finish their match, as Columbia had secured the point already.
“We’re the veteran doubles team,” Oosterhout said of her and Lee’s consistency in the first doubles position. “We played last year together. We really try to use our experience to help the rest of the team, especially the freshmen. Unfortunately, we lost the doubles point to Columbia, but we were able to bounce back.”
Though Oosterhout lost a hard-fought No. 1 singles match in 7-6, 7-6, 11-9 tiebreaker, she relied on her teammates to anchor the victory, as they won four of the remaining five singles matches. Lee earned her 21st victory of the season with a 7-6, 6-2 performance against Columbia sophomore Andrea Kevakian in the second position, while Ringblom defeated Lions junior Adi Milstein 6-1, 6-3.
“Both matches came down to really close margins, and the whole team was supporting on every court,” Oosterhout said. “I think that was our major improvement, our support for each other while we’re playing.”
The team certainly had reason to cheer on the three freshmen who made their presence felt in the singles lineup for the Crimson. Lu tallied her 18th win of the season with a commanding 6-1, 7-5 victory over senior Vivian Cheng in the fifth position, and Friedl secured the winning point for the Crimson with her 6-4, 7-5 defeat of junior Rima Asatrian in the third position. Despite a close first set, Milunovich fell to fellow freshman Ali Pollack 7-6, 6-1 in the No. 4 singles slot.
“We have a fairly young squad, and all this away Ivy League match experience is definitely going to pay off nicely for us in the future,” said Green of her seven freshmen. “We feel like our team is getting stronger and also closer together, and we’re hoping to build on this momentum.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Penn lacrosse is still battling for a playoff spot. For these Quakers, there must be something in the oats.
The Penn Quakers rolled into Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon, and all looked well until a disappointing fourth quarter dashed the Crimson’s hopes of returning to .500 in Ivy League play. Harvard ultimately fell to Penn, 14-10.
Freshman midfielder Nigel Andrews returned following a two-game hiatus, and made an immediate impact. The New Yorker opened Saturday’s scoring, fielding a rebound and putting it away after junior midfielder Carney Mahon fired a shot from the point that ricocheted off the left post.
Back-to-back goals from junior attackman Morgan Cheek and his brother, freshman midfielder Watson Cheek, pushed the Crimson advantage to three with 5:36 remaining in the first stanza. Penn soon responded with a pair of scores to cut Harvard’s lead to one.
“If we hadn’t started the game strong, we wouldn’t have been in the game at all,” said Cheek. “Throughout the season that’s been a point of emphasis for us to come out of the gates flying.”
Harvard’s riding unit exploded in the waning seconds of the first quarter, as the elder Cheek deflected Penn goalie Reed Junkin’s pass near midfield. Junkin, caught well out of position, raced back to his cage, but to no avail—Cheek swept up the bouncing ground ball, and scored a long range bomb to put the Crimson up 4-2 with 15 seconds to play in the first quarter.
Moments later, Harvard retained possession following a Penn faceoff violation, and the Crimson capitalized. Freshman attackman Ryan Graff handled a pass on the wing from senior tri-captain Sean Coleman. The Canadian then ripped a sidearm shot into the upper-left corner to beat the buzzer with 3 seconds left in the quarter.
“We knew it was going to be a battle from the beginning,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik said. “It’s always a tough game versus Penn. They’re an excellent team, and they play extremely hard, but we played really hard, too. I thought we opened the game really well—very good on offense, and defense as well. Our execution just fell off.”
Harvard (5-6, 1-3 Ivy) suffered a characteristic backtrack in the second quarter. The Crimson found itself trailing by two after hemorrhaging five unanswered goals to the Quakers (5-5, 2-3 Ivy) in an 8:50 span that began 40 seconds into the frame.
“Penn dominated possession, and I think that was a big part of the story,” said Wojcik. “We come out with a lot of energy, and we kind of have that lull in the middle part of the first quarter to the second quarter, which really costs us. We saw that same thing today—its unfortunate, and it’s a broken record.”
Harvard’s 3.45 first-quarter scoring average compared to its 2.36 average in the second quarter quantifies that “lull,” and despite dropping six of its last seven, the Crimson has played its past seven opponents an even 25-25 in the first quarter. In those games, Harvard has been outscored 25-16 in the second quarter.
Cheek converted his eighth hat trick of the season with 2:50 to play in the first half, ending Penn’s offensive barrage to enter the half down 7-6. He added two more goals in the second half, along with an assist to end the game with six total points. Having tallied five or more points in seven of eleven games this season, the Winthrop dweller boosted his scoring average to 3.09 goals per game, and points average to 5.27 per game.
“I wasn’t doing anything special, or out of the ordinary,” said Cheek. “I think I just took advantage of my chances, and the ball happened to go in—I happened to be in the right spot at the right time. I credit the whole offense for playing a good game…We battled hard, but when it mattered, they made the plays at the end, and they beat us straight up.”
With 10:12 left in the fourth quarter, Harvard had clawed its way back to lead 10-9. The Crimson’s optimism took a discouraging turn, as Harvard proceeded to concede five straight goals to Penn to end the game.
Harvard went 6-28 (21.4 percent) at the faceoff X on Saturday, and just 2-13 in the second half. Three of those six wins on the day came by way of a Penn violation. Until Harvard can produce a more efficient faceoff unit, the Crimson will struggle mightily to win games. In its past three losses, Harvard has gone 23-85 on faceoffs (27.1 percent). The season average fell to a season low 36.4 percent.
“We’re going to keep fighting—it’s as simple as that,” said Wojcik. “We’re still mathematically alive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Competing at Brown, the No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team found mixed success in a trio of conference games. The Crimson (14-12, 4-4 CWPA) concluded its regular season with a one-point loss against No. 18 Hartwick (22-9, 6-2) on Friday, and a 7-3 loss against No. 14 Indiana (18-9, 5-3)  and 14-3 win against St. Francis (PA) (10-19, 0-8) on Saturday. With these results, Harvard finishes its regular season with a conference winning percentage of .500.
“This weekend we didn't necessarily come out with the record we were hoping to. But, in the end our seeding isn't the most important thing going into eastern championships,” sophomore attacker Kristen Hong said. “I have a lot of faith that our team can fight our way through to the championship game in a few weeks.”
NO. 18 HARTWICK  12, NO. 20 HARVARD 11
After falling behind to Hartwick 5 -3 eight minutes into the game, Harvard outscored the Hawks over the final three periods. However, the Crimson’s late game efforts were not enough to overcome the first quarter deficit and upset Hartwick.
Fighting back following the first quarter, Harvard closed the gap, tying the score at 9-9 in the third quarter. Leading Harvard’s offensive push, freshman defender Mathilde Ribordy scored three goals for the Crimson, her second career hat trick.
Anchoring the defensive efforts, junior attacker Sami Strutner recorded two steals and two assists. Junior goalie Cleo Harrington made nine stops in net and helped the offense with a team-high four assists, her highest total this season.
NO. 14 INDIANA  7, NO. 20 HARVARD 3
On Saturday, Harvard again struggled to find momentum until too late in the game. Rebounding from a 5-0 deficit at halftime, Harvard outscored Indiana 2-1 in the third quarter, but failed to tally enough goals in the fourth to close the deficit.
Senior attacker Michelle Martinelli, and freshmen attackers Sofia Carrera-Justiz and Ribordy each scored one goal for Harvard in the team’s second half push against the Hoosiers.
NO. 20 HARVARD  14, ST. FRANCIS 3
Coming out strong from the opening moments of the game, Kristen Hong led the Harvard offense to a 14-3 victory against St. Francis. Hong’s hat trick marks the 12th-straight game she has scored in, the longest scoring streak for any Harvard player this season.
Several members of the Crimson found the back of the net multiple times against St. Francis, as senior utility player Zoe Osborne, Strutner, freshman utility player Julie Harrison and freshman defender Lana Gorlinski each scored twice.
Osborne also recorded four steals for the second time in one day, bringing her Saturday total to eight, the highest two-game total of any Harvard player on the year.  In goal, sophomore Sam Acker recorded a season-high 11 saves.
“I think we played really well defensively,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We dictated the tempo and played our pace, which was good”.
The Crimson will return to the pool on April 28 in Indiana for the first day of the CWPA Championships

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week ago, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team managed just five goals against No. 7 Princeton. This Saturday, the Crimson’s attack matched that total in the first 12 minutes of its matchup against Brown.
The first five Harvard scores came from just seven shots, and the Crimson maintained that offensive efficiency throughout the contest. Harvard (8-5, 4-1 Ivy League) would convert nearly half of its 40 attempts throughout the game as it decisively beat Brown (4-8, 0-5 Ivy), 19-12, in Providence, R.I.
The Crimson not only eclipsed its conversion rate of 19 percent from its matchup against the Tigers last week, but also held on to a vital top-four spot in the Ancient Eight. The victory sees Harvard remain in third place in the conference, while the Bears keep their last-place position in the Ivy League.
“I think we did a good job switching up personnel to try new things in the game,” senior attacker Marisa Romeo said. “Lots of people stepped up and performed roles they don't usually do. We fixed things that weren't working early on and continued to put pressure on them all game.”
The Crimson looked like a completely different team from the one that faced Princeton last weekend. In addition to more than doubling its efficiency, Harvard also capitalized on all four of its free position opportunities. The Crimson dominated ground balls as well, scooping up 20 to Brown’s eight.
Harvard’s 37 fouls against the Bears actually outnumbered the team’s infractions against Princeton. Nonetheless, the Crimson did not draw a single yellow card on Saturday, a marked contrast to the six it garnered last weekend.
However, despite the outcome and Harvard’s statistical superiority, Brown had the momentum for stretches of the game. In a trend that has repeated itself all season, the Crimson took a sizeable lead early on only to see its opponent steam back with a string of unanswered goals.
With just under seven minutes remaining in the first half, Harvard held a 9-4 advantage. Junior midfielder Julia Glynn had kicked play off with a free position shot before the Bears put away two quick goals in 60 seconds.
Tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon restored equilibrium with her 22nd goal of the campaign, but it took Brown just 15 seconds to regain the lead.
The Crimson refused to stay behind, though. Tri-captain midfielder Megan Hennessey, sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee, sophomore attacker Nicole Baiocco, and junior attacker Eliza Guild each found the back of the net, while the Bears got a goal back, as Harvard tore into the lead with a 7-1 run.
Romeo supplied the other three goals to round out the streak. The senior could not be stopped, punching home all three finishes in a four-minute stretch to complete her 10th hat trick of the season within the first quarter of the game.
On the back of its strong attacking play, the Crimson had turned a 3-2 deficit into a five-goal advantage, and Harvard seemingly had a monopoly on the momentum of the contest.
Brown, however, would not be counted out. The Bears suddenly found a new gear in the closing minutes of the half, scoring four goals in the same number of minutes without a Harvard response to cut the Crimson’s lead to a single point.
Harvard did not fold under the pressure, as it has before this season. Instead, with Brown nipping at its heels, the Crimson responded with a 10-2 run to put the game to bed.
“The team played with energy and enthusiasm and, most importantly, responded to Brown's surge with a run of our own,” head coach Lisa Miller said. “[It was] a good team effort.”
Harvard did not take long to cancel out the Bears’ streak. Three Crimson players added to their goal totals in the final two minutes of the opening half, extending Harvard’s advantage back to four.
Romeo scored for the fourth time before MacAfee fired home an unassisted strike and Guild completed her brace with a free position goal in the final second of the first stanza.
Brown drew first blood just 40 seconds after halftime, but the Crimson was unwilling to relinquish its momentum.
Sophomore midfielder Caroline Garrity picked up two quick scores to bring her total for the season to 10. Romeo then went on to create two goals in sixty seconds, setting up Glynn’s second score of the day before netting her fifth and final finish of the contest in a man-up position. Romeo’s last goal was her 43rd of the season.
Hennessey, MacAfee, and Garrity all got back in on the action with finishes in the last 17 minutes of the game. The goals completed hat tricks for MacAfee and Garrity.
Brown responded with a pair of scores in the final two minutes of the contest, but the outcome was already decided at that point, and Harvard cruised to its fourth league win of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After teaming up seven days ago to defeat Oxford and Cambridge, the Harvard and Yale track teams were rivals once again for the 115th rendition of their annual dual meet on Saturday.
The Crimson’s men's team, holding the historic advantage over the Bulldogs, maintained its superiority with a strong 113-50 victory on the day. The win represents Harvard’s sixth in seven such meetings improving its overall record against Yale to 65-49-1.
The women’s team would not achieve the same feat. With the majority of the team’s sprinters traveling to Torrance, California for the Mt. SAC relays, the Crimson women were missing some of their most competitive runners. As a result, the team fell to the Bulldogs, 66-88. Harvard’s loss ended a nine meet win streak over Yale, the longest streak of either team since the matchup began in 1978. Despite the loss, the women still hold a 27-12 advantage in the series.
YALE DUAL MEET
Hosting the Bulldogs in the dual meet at the McCurdy Outdoor Track, the Crimson men dominated nearly every aspect of their competition. The team established an early dominance with the sprints. Leading off in the 100-meter dash was tri-captain Efe Uwaifo. The senior took first in his first outdoor race this season with a time of 11.12 seconds. Only .02 seconds behind Uwaifo was teammate junior Matthew Hurst in the silver position. The junior sprinter also grabbed second in the 200-meter dash.
The gold Uwaifo won in the 100-meter dash wasn’t his only of the meet. The senior went on to claim two more, winning both long jump and triple jump with jumps of 7.35 and 14.48 meters, respectively.
In the 400-meter dash, the underclassman duo of sophomore Myles Marshall and freshman Tom Rienas took first and second, respectively. Marshall won the race in 48.11 seconds, finishing a little more than a second ahead of his teammate.
The one-two finish in the 400-meter would eventually be outdone by the clean sweep in the 3000-meter run. Freshman Will Battershill led the trio in his gold medal run at 8:33.32 seconds. Junior Tyler Spear and sophomore Kieran Tuntivate claimed the silver and bronze, respectively.
Harvard did nearly as well in the hurdling events. Taking silver in the 110s was junior Jay Hebert with a time of 14.33. In the 400-meter variant, freshman Jacob McLennan claimed the top spot, completing the race in a clean 54.41 seconds. Following in suit, sophomore Samuel Oh took the gold in the 3000-meter steeplechase.
The Crimson men excelled in the field events. Freshman Donagh Mahon picked up another gold this weekend in high jump, topping the crowd with a 2.00-meter leap. Tri-captain Andrew Roney likewise claimed the gold, though in pole vault, with a jump of 4.72 meters.
Harvard cleaned shop in the throwing events with gold in all four. Tri-captain Julian Nunally picked up three medals on the afternoon, two gold and one bronze. The senior won discus and shot put, while medaling in the hammer throw. Nunally finished fourth earlier in the season at the Indoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships.
“The outdoor season has a more authentic track feel and it is something that everyone looks forward to,” Nunally said. “I look forward to seeing us compete throughout the rest of the season.”
Freshman Gunnar Allison also medaled in three events, taking second in discus and third in both shot put and the hammer throw. Josh Whitener picked up the final gold of the three events with his 51.98 meter throw of the hammer.
In javelin, the Crimson took one, two, and three. Senior Richard Bradley led the trio with a gold medal toss that traveled 58.01 meters. Freshman Anthony DeNitto’s throw landed 3.2 meters behind his teammate’s for the silver medal and junior Andrew Connolly’s threw 51.75 meters to round out the sweep.
For the women, despite the overall loss, the meet was full of personal bests. Senior Sylvia Deppen clocked her best collegiate time, at 12.20 seconds in the 100-meter dash to ascend the podium and win the event. The senior also grabbed another gold in the 400-meter hurdles, topping the crowd with a personal best of 1:02.57 seconds.
Second-team All-American for the indoor 5000-meter race, freshman distance runner Judy Pendergast achieved a second place finish in the 1500-meter race with a time of 4:28.58 seconds. In the same race, sophomore teammate Miranda Sadler finished just under seven seconds behind her teammate to take the bronze. Also running long distance was junior Elianna Shwayder, who took silver in the 3000-meter run. Her time of 9:49.13 was an outdoor best for the Saline, Michigan native.
In pole vault, Harvard took both first and second. Junior Marlena Sabatino achieved a gold medal jump at a height of 3.65 meters, just 1.5 meters above sophomore Nicole Trenchard in the silver position.
“It's exciting to cheer on teammates showing off their hard work as they finally get to throw javelin, discus and hammer as well as run the long hurdles and outdoor track relays,” Trenchard said. “It is always a fun to compete as a team.”
Co-captain Raegan Nizdil rounded out the success of the women against Yale with a gold medal and personal best throw of 29.95 meters in the javelin.
MT. SAC RELAYS
Taking to Torrance, California, the majority of the short distance runners for the women’s team competed in the more competitive Mt. SAC Relays.
Sophomore sprinter Gabby Thomas headlined the team’s success taking two medals. The first was a bronze in the 200-meter dash and the second a silver in the open 100-meter dash. In the former, Thomas clocked a 22.64 second finish, only .04 seconds off her season best.
Freshman Zoe Hughes competed for the Crimson in the heptathlon and finished in sixth place. The Hornchurch, U.K., native achieved the feat with 5444 points, a personal record, the second best finish in program history, and the fourth most points in Ivy League history. In her path to the medal, Hughes achieved personal bests in both the long jump and javelin events.
The 4x100-meter relay team also grabbed a season best in their path to a ninth place finish. The squad, featuring sophomore Ngozi Musa, Thomas, freshman Karina Joiner, and senior Jade Miller, crossed the finish line 45.23 seconds after the sound of the gun. The finish was the second fastest time in program history.
Miller and Joiner rounded out the weekend with successful finishes in the 400-meter hurdles. The former took bronze in the event with a time of 56.41 seconds while Joiner finished in sixth with a personal best time of 1:00.28.
The teams will travel next weekend to the Cardinal Classic in Stanford, California.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With windy conditions at O’Donnell Field carrying balls further than normal, the Harvard baseball team saw its four-game set with Ivy League-leading Yale over the weekend explode into a veritable hit parade. A relatively mild 4-2 opener on Saturday afternoon gave way to the two teams combining to score 75 runs over the last three games—wreaking havoc on ERAs but providing for lively offense on both sides.
The problem for the Crimson was that most of the offense went the Bulldogs’ way. Harvard ultimately dropped the series, three games to one, to move to 13-19 overall and 2-10 in the conference.
The silver lining came in the form of the Crimson’s 12-7 victory in the series closer, preventing the sweep and giving some much-needed momentum to the team heading into the Beanpot Championship on Wednesday.
“The wind was blowing out this weekend—it was beautiful, so definitely ideal hitting conditions for both sides,” sophomore first baseman Patrick McColl said. “It didn’t turn out well for us in a couple of the games, it definitely helped that we were able to add a couple runs on at the end and hang on.”
HARVARD 12, YALE 7
McColl led the way at the plate with a four-hit, three-run, two-RBI day, sophomore righty Kevin Stone pitched 8.0 innings with eight strikeouts, and Harvard ended its seven-game losing streak with a 12-7 win over Yale (19-4, 10-2 Ivy League).
“It was good for us to battle back and win that fourth game,” sophomore outfielder Ben Skinner, who was 3-for-5 in the Saturday closer, said. “It’s pretty easy to let yourself run out of steam when you have these long weekends, so it was encouraging for us to walk away with a win in the last one.”
The Crimson built yet another 5-0 advantage right out of the first inning, but unlike the previous game, it was able to pad its lead with a four-run fourth and tack on insurance runs in the seventh and eighth innings to hold on to the victory.
“Insurance runs are extremely nice—they give our pitchers confidence, they help us keep our momentum rolling, and it’s just great to have that peace of mind,” Skinner said. “The way the ball was carrying this weekend, a lot of runs were being scored, so every run mattered.”
McColl, junior infielder John Fallon, and sophomore outfielder Patrick Robinson all went yard, with Fallon’s three-run blast coming as part of the five-run first inning.
Freshman righty Grant Stone’s scoreless ninth helped prevent the sweep after the Crimson lost the first three games. The elder Stone, meanwhile, garnered his team-leading fourth win for his efforts.
YALE 13, HARVARD 9
Saturday’s opener saw the Bulldogs successfully chip away at a 5-0 deficit after two innings, and the visiting Yale squad steadily pulled away for a 13-9 win. Though Harvard outhit the Bulldogs, 12 to nine, the home team was not efficient on defense, as it committed three errors leading to six unearned runs.
Sophomore Simon Rosenblum-Larson got the start and received the brunt of the defensive sloppiness. The righty pitched 5.2 solid innings of three-hit ball and was only responsible for three earned runs crossing the plate—but nine total runs were put up against his name.
The offense bailed their starter out with a four-run sixth, but a four-run outburst from the Bulldogs in the final inning broke the 9-9 tie and gave Yale the win.
McColl drove in a career-high five runs on 2-for-4 hitting, while freshman infielder Quinn Hoffman had himself a three-hit day with two runs scored.
YALE 21, HARVARD 13
Home runs seemingly flew out of the ballpark at will in the windy conditions in Yale’s 21-13 victory over the Crimson on Saturday afternoon. The Bulldogs hit five dingers, while Harvard one-upped them with six—including senior captain Josh Ellis’ second and third career homers—but it wasn’t enough to overcome Yale’s 21 hits.
Ellis went 3-for-5 with three runs scored and three RBIs to cap off a three-homer, 5-for-9 day, continuing his hot streak as the season progresses. Robinson, meanwhile, drove in four more runs, upping his RBI total to 28 by the end of the weekend.
The Crimson offense managed to chase Yale starter Mason Kukowski after just 1.1 innings, while Harvard starter junior Ian Miller went 5.0 innings and took the loss.
YALE 4, HARVARD 2
The odd game out of the weekend was the tame opener, as both starting pitchers went the seven-inning distance and allowed single-digit hits. The Yale offense prevailed over Crimson starter junior Noah Zavolas, though, with two runs in the second and two more in the fifth to double up Harvard, 4-2.
Ellis’ first career homer and designated hitter junior Austin Black’s RBI single provided the Crimson’s only offense of the game.
“Moving on, you still try and win every game, you want to get better and keep up team morale,” McColl said. “At this point, if we can just kind of stay loose and have fun with it, that’s what we need, and I think we’ll be just fine moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opportunity. For any team to be successful over a course of a season, they must capitalize on opportunities. The Harvard Crimson followed a theme of missing opportunities this season. Whether it was allowing teams to comeback from 2-0 deficits, or not finishing sets after gaining a big lead, Harvard found it difficult to reach its potential with a young but fiery team.
Harvard (10-13, 7-7 EIVA) had the opportunity in its last regular season road trip to punch a ticket to the EIVA tournament by defeating both the Princeton Tigers (12-13, 8-6 EIVA) and NJIT Highlanders (13-13, 6-8 EIVA). Unfortunately for the Crimson, after a loss to Princeton in three straight sets on Friday night, and Sacred Heart beating the Tigers the day after, its season was brought to an early and abrupt close.
“Just a couple things defined the season. We lost a lot of close matches this year which was definitely really tough. But I thought we were really good at dialing back especially after a loss to come back and win on Saturdays, or if we lost on a Saturday, come back on Friday and play a lot better,” junior Riley Moore said. “It was kind of a bummer that we would lose a lot of close matches, but our ability to bounce back and keep fighting to the end of the season was really important.”
HARVARD 3, NJIT 0
The Crimson found itself in a difficult position Saturday afternoon. After losing to Princeton it needed a victory to stay in the hunt for a spot in the playoffs.
“We knew that some things had to happen for us to make the playoffs, but we could only control what we were doing in our match,” Moore said. “We just wanted to make sure that if we won the game, we’re just putting ourselves in the best place we can and hoping for everyone else [in the conference] to do their part.”
Harvard did not want its destiny to rely on the performances of other teams and came out with a new found drive after a devastating loss to the Tigers.
After a nail biting 26-24 victory in the first set, Harvard came out in the second set hot and the momentum carried them throughout the match.
“I feel ok about the way we played today. A lot of courageous play today,” coach Brian Baise said. “A lot of guys were hurt. Really tough loss last night, so to come back from that and play like we did today is impressive. They competed hard.”
Harvard’s offense and defense were top notch in the second set boasting a hitting percentage of .412, and limiting the Highlanders to a hit percentage of .080. After the dominating second game the Crimson would close out the match 25-21 in the final set.
Freshman Erik Johnsson lead the effort with 14 kills, while co-captain Casey White had seven. Freshman Matthew Ctvrtlik had 14 assists and junior Marko Kostich had eight.
“It’s definitely bittersweet getting the win today,” said White. “I’m proud of our team and the resolve we showed to come out and kind of win in a resounding fashion.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson, dropped two crucial home games the previous weekend and had to win its next two conference games. The first win had to come through Princeton, NJ. However, the Tigers had no interests to do any favors for its Ivy League rival.
“They beat us in about every aspect of the game. They were sharp and we just were not. Fundamentally we weren’t great. We didn’t serve great, and we had trouble with their serves,” coach Baise said. “Give them credit, they were the better team last night and we came up one game short this year. We had opportunities, and we didn’t capitalize on them. It wasn’t a lack of desire and effort on our part; our guys were a really hard working group.”
Princeton had a hitting percentage of .468 to Harvard’s .279. The Tigers defense was the largest discrepancy between the two squads. As Harvard had only one block during the match Princeton had 16.
White and Johnsson both collected 13 kills in the match, and Ctvrtlik had 23 assists.
Though clawing back in the second set Harvard would lose it 27-25, and the momentum the Tigers got from the second set win carried them through the third and final set.
Though a bitter way to end the season, the Crimson have a bright future with the squad it will return next season.
Johnsson was second on the team in kills this season (229), second only to captain White who had 248. White’s 248 kills eclipsed the 179 kills he had last season, and he finishes his college career with 716 kills, which ranks 10th in Harvard history.
“White has been awesome; it’s been an amazing experience to watch him become the leader he has become over the last four years,” coach Baise said. “Great player, great competitor, and just an unbelievable captain this year. We wouldn’t have been as close as we were without him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend served up a rollercoaster of emotions for the Harvard men’s tennis team. On Saturday, the team—undefeated in the Ivy conference at that point and riding a six-game win-streak—faced off against a similarly undefeated No.20 Columbia squad at home. After clinching the win 4-2 and moving to first place in the Ivy League, the Crimson took on No. 25 Cornell on Sunday, ultimately falling 4-2.
"Overall it was an amazing weekend for us," co-Captain Jean Thiruoin said. "On paper it looked like we didn’t even belong on the court with both teams but we proved that wrong by taking out Columbia 
and being on the verge of taking out Cornell."
With its 1-1 split this weekend, the team moves to 4-1 in the conference, tied with the Big Red for first in the league. Depending on its performance against Princeton and Penn next weekend, this could be the first time Harvard has a chance at the Ivy title since 2013.
CORNELL 4, HARVARD 2
Harvard took the doubles point early on with two decisive victories. The co-captain duo of Thirouin and Sebastian Beltrame defeated their opponents 6-2, while sophomore Chris Morrow and rookie Logan Weber clinched a 6-4 win at third doubles.
On the singles side, Thirouin earned Harvard a point at third singles with a straight-set defeat of No.116 Cornell freshman Lev Kazakov, who he had faced earlier in his doubles match.
With the Crimson at a 2-0 advantage, the Big Red turned the tables and came back across the ladder, winning two three-set matchups. Beltrame fell 5-7, 6-1, 6-3 at first singles, while Morrow fell 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 at third singles.
"Coming from the high of yesterday, it was hard to find the adjustment between thinking too much about the win and thinking about Ivy League title," Tao said. "We have approached the Ivy season as upstarts, and to finally not be in the underdogs was a unique situation that we should have handled better." 
Senior Brian Yeung went on to fall in two tie-breaker sets at fourth singles, and Zhou suffered a 7-5, 6-4 defeat at fifth singles to give Cornell the 4-2 victory.
"The Cornell loss was especially tough because we were leading the whole match having taken the doubles point and 4 first sets in singles, but they showed why they’re such a great team by turning the match around at the very last moment," Thiruoin said. 
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 2
The stakes were high in the matchup between Harvard and Columbia, with both teams undefeated in the league.
"The Columbia win was an unbelievable feeling for the whole team because we’ve been putting in the work all season and it paid off at the best time," Thiruoin said. 
The Crimson earned the doubles point on Saturday as well. Morrow and Weber came back from behind at third doubles to clinch the match 7-5. At first doubles, the No. 74 doubles duo of Yeung and junior Kenny Tao edged out their Columbia opponents with a tiebreaker victory, 7-6 (7-4), to give Harvard the 1-0 advantage.
"As a team we’ve hit our stride in doubles, winning the majority of doubles points," Tao said. "Also, we’ve been much better at performing consistently, especially outdoors and this showed in our outdoors match with Columbia. Everyone played very mentally tough, and we were more solid than they were in tough conditions." 
While Beltrame and Morrow fell in straight sets at first and fifth singles, respectively, Harvard went on to sweep at second, third, and fourth singles. Tao took a decisive 6-1, 6-4 victory at second singles while Zhou kept his opponent at bay with a 6-2, 7-5 win at fifth singles.
Thirouin came back from dropping the first set to take the deciding win at third singles with a score of 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.
"We always have very scrappy matches with Columbia, and to be able to take down a team that we have a such a deep rivalry with is no small feat," Tao said.
