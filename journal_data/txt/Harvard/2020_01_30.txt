After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I love space, and I’m certainly not alone. From “The Avengers” to “Star Wars,” many of the world’s highest-grossing film franchises feature space travel as a key theme. Humans have been fascinated by the cosmos for millenia, and in the decades since the Moon landing made space travel a reality, our interplanetary wanderlust has reached a fever pitch. So, why have all our post-Apollo space achievements been so underwhelming?
This was one question I pondered during my trip to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Kennedy Space Center last summer, which was funded by a generous Rosenkrantz Travel Grant from Harvard’s History of Science Department. My trip aligned with the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, the 1969 mission that first landed humans on the Moon. Apollo 11 is a continuous source of pride for this country — it’s featured on almost every list of America’s greatest accomplishments.
However, it’s important to remember that the Moon missions weren’t as popular in the sixties as they are in contemporary culture. The proportion of Americans who considered the Apollo program a worthwhile expense peaked at only 53 percent during Apollo 11 itself. Some of the most outspoken critics were African-American activists, who pointed out the stark contrast between the government’s disregard towards living conditions in black neighborhoods and its willingness to spend billions of dollars to land Whitey on the Moon.
Today, Americans remain critical of funnelling billions into space research without any direct benefit to the public. NASA has responded by pointing out that many useful technologies have been created as spin-offs from the space program. But, if we just want consumer technologies, a space agency doesn’t seem like the best destination for our tax dollars.
NASA should be honest with the public and admit that the space program is not something with direct, tangible benefit to the average person. Rather, the benefit of space travel is ideological. Humans are a naturally curious species; we have an innate desire to expand our horizons. From myths to movies, we tell stories about travelling to strange new lands. Then, when some of us accomplish daring feats of exploration — such as going to the International Space Station or landing on the Moon — we feel collective pride. (I’m aware that, historically, “exploration” has gone hand-in-hand with exploitation, but I’m hopeful that international agreements can protect the natural beauty of our planetary neighbors. Perhaps this hope is naive...)
Regardless, we need to face the fact that our ability to explore space is limited. If modern physics is correct, then the speed of light is the speed limit imposed on all things in the universe. Massive objects — such as manned rockets — would require near-infinite energy to get anywhere close to the speed of light. So, given the vast emptiness of space, human exploration to planets outside of our solar system is likely to remain an eternal fantasy.
The same is not necessarily true of unmanned exploration. Breakthrough Starshot, a project chaired by Harvard professor Abraham “Avi” Loeb, hopes to accelerate tiny “nanocrafts” equipped with cameras to 20 percent of the speed of light and send them on a mission of around 20 years to take photographs of our nearest star system. While this would be a big achievement for science, it’s unlikely to satisfy our natural wanderlust in the same way that human missions can.
So, what do we do when our desire to explore the unknown is met with the realization that our exploration has a limit? One answer is to turn to science fiction. If it’s true that the purpose of space travel is to fulfill our desire for awesome new experiences, then can’t sci-fi serve the same purpose? We may never get to fly near a black hole, but we can still feel exhilarated watching Matthew McConaughey do so in “Interstellar.”
And yet, an existence in which our wanderlust is indulged by fiction alone would seem deeply unfulfilling, much like Robert Nozick’s “experience machine.” It seems important that we balance science fiction with science fact and continue our human space program, with Mars as the ideal next step.
This doesn’t mean we must pour billions of dollars into space agencies so they can get us to Mars as quickly as possible. The process is what’s exciting; until the moment a human steps on Mars, the planet is an unexplored world of unlimited possibilities. But when we actually get there, disappointment will set in — the barren, dusty planet can never live up to the idealized vision we’ve had for decades. After Mars, we’ll quickly turn our attention to sending humans to Venus, then Mercury, then the outer planets, and … then what?
Humans prefer the idea of exploration over exploration itself; we’d probably fall into cultural despondency if there was nowhere left for us to explore. So, rather than rush out into the solar system, why don’t we take it slow and enjoy the ride? A gradual approach to space exploration will allow us to appreciate each step of the process and will keep the space program cheaper and safer overall.
So, I encourage my fellow space enthusiasts — I know there are many at Harvard — to be patient. If it takes 50 more years to reach another planet, that’s okay. In the meantime, we can always watch “Star Trek.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Voter apathy has become an epidemic on our campus. In this year’s Undergraduate Council presidential election, Aditya A. Dhar ’21 and Andrew W. Liang ’21, the joke ticket promising to abolish the UC, received the most first-place votes with just over half the student body voting. A similar joke ticket actually won in 2013, demonstrating the student body’s vote of no confidence in UC leadership. And back in 2017, literally no one voted in the Quincy House midterm elections.
So how did we get to this point where voters are sectioned off, disenfranchised, apathetic, or disengaged? What can we do to further rejuvenate our systems of governance that too often feel out-of-touch or ineffectual?
To restore enthusiasm for civic engagement, several cities around the world, including Cambridge, have implemented participatory budgeting, a system that entrusts a certain amount of a city’s capital budget for citizens to appropriate for use on projects. In Cambridge, citizens first propose ideas to various committees in charge of different focus fields, who then develop finalized proposals for the city to review. Then, the remaining proposals are voted upon by the public, and the six to eight projects with the most votes are funded. PB reintroduces people to the political process, providing them an opportunity to directly fund a part of the public infrastructure of their city.
PB has worked. Since 2014, Cambridge has successfully executed six PB cycles that have funded projects such as the bike-repair station outside of the Porter Square T stop. Most recently, in the 2019 PB cycle, Cambridge residents allocated a total of $1,125,000 of capital funding to eight winning proposals, which included planting trees around heat islands, implementing bottle-filling stations in public areas, providing laundry services inside a public school, installing pedestrian-controlled crosswalk lights, and expanding outdoor WiFi services. Throughout the cycles, citizens have expressed a high amount of interest in participating. Election turnout has increased every single year, and in 2019, over 7,600 Cambridge residents age 12 and older voted.
Harvard should follow Cambridge’s lead and adopt a form of participatory budgeting on campus. This could amplify student perspectives, empower a more representative decision-making process, and boost civic engagement across the university. Harvard certainly has ample financial resources at its disposal to fund such a program, especially one that has the potential to bring together diverse groups of people to engage with our campus. Like Cambridge and hundreds of other municipalities worldwide, the university could allocate some portion of its budget towards participatory budgeting projects, in which the most popularly-supported proposals, as voted upon by all Harvard affiliates, would receive funding.
From start to finish, the process of acquiring ideas and then developing and voting upon them should be interactive and engaging. Harvard could host “Challenge Days” throughout the semester for University affiliates to come together and propose projects that they would like to see implemented on campus utilizing Harvard funding — whether they be infrastructural initiatives, such as the installation of solar panels on the roof of the Science Center, or social programs, such as the organization of more mental health awareness panels. These ideas could be collected on a Post-it wall or electronically via an anonymous Google form and corroborated with additional outreach efforts by Harvard PB volunteers.
Harvard PB would be open to student proposals (as opposed to being confined to predetermined initiatives). Harvard affiliates could then be invited to join committees and volunteer to refine these brainstormed ideas into more detailed draft proposals over several weeks. Afterward, at a Harvard PB fair, individuals and teams would present these proposals, emphasizing their rationale and impact on the public. Finally, on a designated voting day, any Harvard affiliate could fill out a ballot containing their votes for the projects that they believe most deserve PB funding.
Implementing PB at Harvard would overcome student apathy for civic engagement at the school level. It would also be a solution to students’ lack of faith in school government and decision making. More importantly, though, participatory budgeting at Harvard would offer the opportunity for University affiliates to become directly involved and engaged in projects that impact campus life — to help make Harvard a better place for everyone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On November 21st, President Bacow announced the creation of a new initiative to examine Harvard’s legacy of slavery. In light of this announcement, I suggest that the first area of research for this new committee be Bacow’s very own residence. Elmwood has a long and fraught history of slavery. If we truly want to understand it, we’ll have to supplement archival study with on-the-ground archeological research.
Built in 1767 by Thomas Oliver, Class of 1753, the Elmwood mansion hasn’t always been the President’s residence, nor has it always been called Elmwood. Thomas Oliver was born into a wealthy English merchant family which primarily made its fortune through Caribbean slave labor. The Olivers owned at least 206 enslaved people, who labored at the family’s Friar’s Hill plantation on Antigua.
Not only were the Olivers actively engaged in the buying and selling of human beings in the Caribbean, at least 11 enslaved people actually labored at Elmwood. According to the English loyalist claim Oliver filed to be reimbursed for lost “property” following the American Revolution; their names were: Buff, Gale, Jerry, Jeoffry, Samuel, Mira, Jude, Sarah, Jenny, Violet, and Young Jerry.
Based on evidence from studying similar households, we can infer a few things about the lives of these 11 people — that they worked at Elmwood while the Olivers lived there, they were subject to being leased to other white families, and they were often under surveillance by the Oliver family. Evidence reveals that a Cambridge woman named Mercy Cooke may have been responsible for caring Young Jerry after the Olivers left Cambridge in 1774, but the fate of the other 10 remains uncertain.
The house was later occupied by abolitionist poet James Russell Lowell, Class of 1838, (who was related by marriage to the Olivers and responsible for the home’s name) before being purchased by Harvard professor Arthur Kingsley Porter and later bequeathed to the University. In the 1960s, Harvard renovated the home and it became the permanent residence of the University President beginning in 1971.
From 2000-2001, Alexandra Chan led an archeological excavation of the Royall House (yes, the same Royalls whose seal was removed from the Law School). Similar to the Olivers, the Royalls were an English merchant family who created their wealth through Caribbean plantations and the slave trade. Whereas at least 11 enslaved people labored at Elmwood, at least 60 enslaved people lived at the Royall house. At the dig, Chan and her team retrieved over 65,000 artifacts, including 303 ceramic vessels and 203 glass ones. Publishing her findings in her book, “Slavery in the Age of Reason,” Chan demystified some questions regarding the site, discussing topics like slave-master relationships, labor conditions, leisure preferences, and other general experiences of Royall house life. She notes that the “slave quarters had not only the most prolific number of artifacts and features at the site, but many of the deposits there could be linked to the Royall period of occupation.” Given the strong similarities between the Olivers and the Royalls, a project at Elmwood could yield similar results. Additionally, like the Harvard Yard Archeology Project, an excavation at Elmwood could present field-work opportunities to students.
The architecture of the house today speaks to its origins, as much of its exterior design is reminiscent of its original display of wealth. Given that visual features were effective in legitimizing social status, families like the Olivers designed homes like Elmwood to project their perceived elitism and grandeur. Sited on a knoll which once overlooked the Charles River, the house features a sizeable, central dual-level entryway with imposing neoclassical columns and double chimneys in order to project the power and inaccessibility of the English gentry class. For the Olivers and similar families, the wealth and power requisite to be part of such a class came directly from the Caribbean slave trade. Therefore, despite having gone through several renovations throughout its history, Elmwood stands as a sharp visual reminder of Harvard’s historic ties to slavery. Perhaps what’s beneath it can add even more to what we know.
When we talk about the “legacy of slavery,” we can’t forget that we are discussing real people. Despite Elmwood’s fascinating journey through time, very little is known about the enslaved people who originally labored there. If President Bacow really wants to examine this University’s complex ties to slavery, might I suggest that he offer his own home for research. Paper-based history can only go so far. Sometimes we must rely on archeology and on-site research to craft the narratives of those who have long been silent in the archives.

Harvard Business School Social Enterprise Initiative Director Matthew M. Segneri ’04 will soon succeed Jodi Goldstein as the new executive director of the Harvard Innovation Labs, a University-wide center for innovation and entrepreneurship.
Segneri has served as the director of the Social Enterprise Initiative for the past five years. He has also co-led the Business School’s New Venture competition, and served as a judge and advisor to the President’s Innovation Challenge, among other experiences.
Segneri, a first-generation college student, graduated from both the College and the Business School. Preparing to take the helm of the i-Lab sometime in March, Segneri said he is “really excited to be in service to our student alumni, entrepreneurs, and university, and also the city of Boston and local area.”
Segneri said that he looks forward to building on his predecessors’ work and getting to know the entrepreneurs in the i-Lab better. Another of his immediate goals is to work with the leadership of all 12 of Harvard’s schools.
“The cross-University nature of the i-lab means that the i-lab has got to be exceptional in what it’s delivering, but it also needs to work well with the leaders of the other schools,” Segneri said.
More than 38,000 students from all 12 Harvard schools have participated in the i-Lab, developing 1,600 separate ventures, according to a Business School press release announcing Segneri’s appointment.
In order to further a spirit of teamwork and cross-disciplinary problem solving, Segneri wants to “make all the programming and offerings and venture creation open and accessible.” He said that the “sense of community” in the i-Lab was one of the primary reasons he was interested in becoming the executive director.
“I definitely think that the i-Lab is when is Harvard is best, so the nature of cross-disciplinary problem solving where you have teams that are bringing together undergrads and grads from across the University to solve problems with their different disciplines is essential,” Segneri said.
Beyond his passion for the job and work experience, Segneri believes that his “deep understanding of the city and region” makes him well-suited for his new position.
He said that he believes the surrounding Allston, Brighton, and greater Boston communities are integral to the i-Lab as well as to Harvard as a whole. Segneri plans to work “in close partnership” with the i-lab’s “entrepreneurial neighbors” in the area.
“I think there’s a lot of good work to be done and it’s a really exciting moment for the University and the city,” Segneri said.

University administrators “strongly” advised Harvard affiliates to refrain from travel to China and urged precautions for those returning from the country to “protect the health and safety of our community,” as the number of confirmed cases of the deadly coronavirus continues to rise.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen issued the guidance in a Wednesday email to University affiliates, citing travel warnings from multiple US government agencies, including a CDC advisory to “Avoid Non-Essential Travel” to China.
Garber and Nguyen also urged Harvard affiliates currently in China to “follow the guidance of local health authorities,” and advised anyone who has recently returned from the country to immediately contact HUHS if they experience a “fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.”
Nguyen previously wrote in an email last week that the University was “closely monitoring” the outbreak. Wednesday’s email reiterated that statement and added the travel warnings and other guidance.
The outbreak is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, but cases have since been confirmed in at least 19 other countries worldwide, including at least five in the United States.
As of Wednesday evening, there are over 7,700 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide, and the death toll has now reached 170.
While there have been no confirmed cases in Massachusetts, state officials have refused to reveal whether they are one of 26 states currently testing possible coronavirus patients.
Garber and Nguyen sought to downplay concerns about risks associated with the virus for Harvard affiliates, though, writing that the likelihood of infection is “very low.”
Nonetheless, they acknowledged the “anxiety and emotional strain” that the virus might cause, and directed individuals towards Harvard’s mental health resources, including Counseling and Mental Health Services and Harvard’s Employee Assistance Program.
The duo also wrote in the Wednesday email that the University is not conducting screening beyond the examinations currently occuring at Boston’s Logan airport, where the CDC recently began screening all travelers arriving from China.
“That could change, of course, as the situation evolves, and Harvard may need to impose conditions on travelers returning to campus if warranted by changing circumstances,” Garber and Nguyen added.
The administrators also wrote that they will send updates on the virus “periodically” and will “regularly” update HUHS’s website with additional information on the outbreak.

Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, discussed the intersection of sports and activism at the Institute of Politics Wednesday night.
In a discussion moderated by Tommie Shelby, professor of philosophy and African and African American Studies, Kerr said his father was a political science professor at the American University of Beirut until he was shot in 1984 and spoke about the personal experiences that guide his activism.
“Probably my number one social cause is gun safety and gun control. A lot of that has to do with losing my dad to gun violence,” Kerr said. “And a lot of that has to do with growing up here watching all of the violence, watching all of the school shootings, reading about them and knowing what all of those poor families are dealing with, because I went through the same thing with my family.”
When asked if NBA policies could obstruct players’ freedom of expression, Kerr replied that the NBA has generally been supportive of its athletes’ activism.
“The NBA has, by far, been the most progressive of the leagues in terms of social activism, in terms of being partners with the players, in terms of trying to actively look for social change and racial justice,” he said.
After the discussion, Kerr fielded questions — and several autograph requests — from students and audience members and spoke about the roles of athletes in political discourse.
“I think they fit in wherever they want. As American citizens, they have the right to speak and say whatever they like. And then there are consequences to that, but they have a big powerful platform and if they decide to use it, that’s well within their rights,” Kerr said.
He was also asked about Kobe Bryant, the Los Angeles Lakers star who recently died in a helicopter crash in California.
“I saw the images of him with his daughter, and I saw he was so at peace, and he just looked so happy,” Kerr said. “To see that family devastated like that is tough.”
Kerr, who took over as head coach of the Warriors in 2014, also played in the NBA for 15 years, during which he won five championships. He serves on the board of directors for PeacePlayers International, which promotes peace and cooperation through basketball.

Harvard Law School launched its new LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic Tuesday to work directly on legal issues affecting BGLTQ individuals, according to a Law School press release.
The clinic will start its pilot program this semester and offer projects which aim to advance BGLTQ rights at the local and national levels. Students will advocate for legislative change, work on impact litigation, and assist BGLTQ clients — particularly underrepresented groups and individuals — in need of legal services.
Four students will help staff the clinic this semester, according to its founding director, Alexander L. Chen.
In the release, Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote that the clinic was a chance for students to work within “an important and rapidly developing field.”
“The LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic will give our students a wonderful opportunity to address vital legal issues in an important and rapidly developing field, to provide first-rate legal representation to the LGBTQ+ community, to develop practice skills and substantive knowledge at the very highest levels, and to make a positive difference in the world,” Manning wrote.
Chen, the founding director and a graduate of the Law School, will also teach a course on gender identity in the law at HLS, where he will cover topics including sex-segregated spaces, health care access, and non-binary and intersex identities.
Chen co-founded Queer Trans People of Color at HLS while at the Law School and worked as an Equal Justice Works Fellow at the National Center for Lesbian Rights. He also served as a member of the litigation team in the transgender military ban cases Doe v. Trump and Stockman v. Trump and co-founded the National Trans Bar Association.
He noted in an interview Wednesday that the Law School’s creation of the clinic follows a push from students for more BGLTQ opportunities, as well as growing diversity in the student body.
“I think for a long time, students here have felt that the Law School should be providing more curricular opportunities and course offerings for that focus on sort of LGBTQ-related legal issues, especially as more and more people who identify as LGBTQ go to law school,” Chen said.
Chen said that the goal of the clinic was to introduce students to the legal issues facing BGLTQ individuals and to teach strategies for effective advocacy in underrepresented populations.
“The hope is that the students will get an opportunity to get a sense of the issues that particularly affect underrepresented people within the LGBT community, and the goal of the clinic is to focus on the areas of legal advocacy that really disproportionately affect marginalized and underrepresented individuals within the LGBTQ community,” he said.
The Law School currently offers 44 different legal clinics and practice opportunities for students — more than any other law school in the world. These clinics aim to translate the lessons learned in classrooms into real legal practice.
“I think that, often times, law students can find it overwhelming to be studying law in such an abstract way,” Chen said. “They can find it difficult to translate their own lived experiences to understanding how they could go out in the world and become attorneys.”
“Every single student who is at the school could go out and do amazing things that really help people,” he added.

Boba tea has popped into Harvard Square with the opening of a new shop and potential for more to come.
Kung Fu Tea — a bubble tea chain with locations in the United States, Australia, Taiwan, Cambodia, Japan, and Canada — opened at 1160 Massachusetts Avenue, filling a space previously occupied by Salt & Olive.
Several students said the store has seen consistently long lines since the semester began.
“I do think that there’s a huge market for bubble tea in general,” Jahnavi S. Rao ’22, a brand ambassador for Kung Fu Tea, said. “I know like, as apparent by the fact that lines for Kung Fu Tea today were like 30-40 minutes.”
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of Harvard Square Business Association, also said Kung Fu Tea has received a warm reception in Harvard Square.
“We are excited for the arrival of Kung Fu Tea,” she wrote in an emailed statement. “They will be a nice addition to the little yellow building at 1156 Mass. Ave.”
Kung Fu Tea is not the only Harvard Square stop where students can get their bubble tea fix. Boston Tea Stop, located on JFK Street, also serves the drink.
Julia M. Shea ’20 said “the more the merrier, for the most part,” with regard to more boba shops.
“Bubble tea shops seem to be a great gathering place for groups of friends,” she said. “One thing that I think makes bubble tea places popular is that they’re sort of liked cross-culturally.”
Some students welcomed Kung Fu Tea’s opening, saying that the store offers reasonable prices and a rewards program.
“Kung Fu Tea, you can have the app, and you can get rewards on it, and, you know, it’s not cash only,” Rao said.
Students may soon be able to choose from a third bubble tea option, according to a Jan. 21 Eater Boston article. Eater reported that Tiger Sugar — a Taiwanese boba chain with stores in New York and around the world — has filed paperwork for locations in Harvard Square and Allston.
Jillson, however, wrote that HSBA is unaware of plans for a Tiger Sugar location in Harvard Square at this time.
“While we don’t have any particulars at this time regarding Tiger Sugar, we look forward to welcoming them to the Square and will reach out to them upon their arrival to assist in any way that we can,” she wrote to the Crimson.
Similarly, Elizabeth Paden, project planner at the Community Development Department for Cambridge, wrote in a statement that she “[does] not have an application or any information on a Tiger Sugar in Harvard Square."
Tiger Sugar could not be reached for comment.
Despite praising the new boba options, some students said they worried about what the arrival of chain stores like Kung Fu Tea and Tiger Sugar could mean for locally owned businesses like Boston Tea Stop. Over the past year, Harvard Square has seen the closing of several stores and restaurants, from local bakery Sweet to national chain Au Bon Pain.
“I think it’s something to consider how the landlords and how pricing in the Square is pushing out local businesses, and we’re having what seems to be a larger percentage of chains and high-end retailers,” Eli D. Troen ’20 said.
“It’s sort of interesting to think that a third boba tea place might come into the Square,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz’s defense of President Donald J. Trump in the impeachment trial has sparked mixed reactions from legal experts across the country.
Launching his opening statement on the Senate floor Sunday night by declaring his “love” for the United States, Dershowitz – a renowned criminal defense lawyer — proceeded to argue that impeachment on the grounds of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress was “unconstitutional.”
“I will argue that our constitution and its terms high crimes and misdemeanors do not encompass the two articles, charging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,” Dershowitz said.
Dershowitz has vocally defended Trump throughout his presidency, taking to media outlets to support the president and some of his policies.
Legal experts from across the country met Dershowitz’s opening statements with a flurry of praise and criticism.
Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said Dershowitz was “dead wrong” in his argument. In December, Gerhardt testified in front of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee as part of a four-person panel discussing the constitutional grounds of impeachment.
“The central point he’s really sending out is that a President can abuse his power all the time. There’s no constitutional check on that,” Gerhardt said. The argument that abuse of power, standing alone, is not an impeachable offense and therefore may not be accountable to Congress is “just startling,” according to Gerdhardt.
“His defense fits neatly in the President’s efforts and the President’s lawyer’s efforts to misdirect people’s attention, essentially trying to confuse people and distract people by misstatement,” Gerhardt added.
Nikolas Bowie, an assistant professor at the Law School, opined in the New York Times that he recognized the argument Dershowitz used in Trump’s defense but disagreed with the assessment that the president did not commit any crimes.
In his opening statement, Dershowitz referenced Bowie’s previous arguments regarding impeachment. Bowie wrote a December 2018 article in the Harvard Law Review titled “High Crimes Without Law” that crimes must occur for an impeachment to take place.
“Watching CNN last week, I learned that I’m partly responsible for President Trump’s legal defense,” Bowie wrote in his opinion piece. “As an academic, my first reaction was to be grateful that someone had actually read one of my articles. But as a legal academic, my second reaction was confusion. Even if you think impeachment requires a crime, as I do, that belief hardly supports the president’s defense or Mr. Dershowitz’s position.”
George Washington University Professor Jonathan Turley offered a defense of Dereshowitz’s opening statements in a piece published to his personal website.
Turley — who testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee and did not recommend impeachment — wrote on his website that he thought Dershowitz’s presentation was “outstanding,” though he disagreed with some aspects of Dershowitz’s theory.
“Alan Dershowitz is hardly someone in need of the defense of others. However, there is a disturbing level of acrimony and personal attacks directed at the retired Harvard professor after he agreed to speak in defense of President Donald Trump,” Turley wrote.
Turley wrote that he is concerned about the commentary surrounding Dershowitz, particularly attacks on his character. He noted that other professors at the Law School did not receive the same criticism for taking high profile cases.
“Commentators attack him for taking famous, high-profile cases and portray him as only motivated by the press,” Turley wrote. “They do not make the same objections to liberal professors and commentators who routinely take such cases and make media appearances from Laurence Tribe to Neil Katyal to Noah Feldman.”
“They agree with their opinions so their motivations are not questioned,” he added. “The fact is that none of their motivations should be questioned. They are all insightful and influential thinkers.”
Law School Lecturer Nancy Gertner denounced Dershowitz’s defense of Trump in a piece she wrote for WBUR’s Cognoscenti blog.
In her blog post, she wrote that Dershowitz used to be an “icon for civil libertarians,” but his support for the president compromised that distinction.
“It was not remotely the position of a civil libertarian to claim that a president is more powerful than a king,” Gertner wrote.
Gertner wrote in her post that no one should combine Dershowitz’s views with the dangerous positions of his client and said Dershowitz rejected bipartisan consensus of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress as impeachable offenses.
“By the end of his presentation on Monday, he was in full-throated defense of the White House on all fronts, summing up his version of the facts, no fancy civil libertarian disclaimer there,” Gertner wrote.
Dershowitz did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square vegan restaurant Veggie Grill recruited a group of Harvard “brand ambassadors” to promote its products to College affiliates in anticipation of its opening last semester.
Veggie Grill, a California chain which opened a new location on JFK Street on Oct. 13, offers a variety of meat substitutes and vegetable-based meals.
Former recruit Alexa C. Jordan ’22 said in a Wednesday interview that she first heard about the opportunity when she received a direct message on Instagram from an account called Intern Queen. Intern Queen — led by entrepreneur Lauren Berger — coordinates internships and “brand ambassador programs,” according to information on its social media accounts.
Jordan said she thought she was invited to apply because she has “a lot of followers” on Instagram. She received the position after a selection process that involved “a very short application” and “a few different calls.”
“After that, I signed a few different contracts about how many times I’d post and different compensation for those posts, as well as different opportunities in which I could give out coupons and actually be paid for my time doing that,” Jordan said. “So there’s a per-hour compensation, but there’s also a general compensation plan for how many times I’d post,” she added.
Sara B. Solomon ’22 — another Veggie Grill marketing recruit — said she appreciated the position because of the “incredible experience” it provided in social media, business, and interpersonal skills.
“The comments that were flooding my content were very positive, and everyone was so excited to try it,” Solomon said. “I think it’s been a really big success so far.”
Jordan said she believes in the mission of Veggie Grill and values the convenience, taste, quality, and sustainability of its food offerings.
“I think what’s most important is that you really have to believe in that brand’s mission and purpose and what they stand for,” Jordan added. “I think that they’re doing something important for Harvard Square.”
Berger wrote in an email that her company facilitated the Veggie Grill marketing initiative last semester but is not currently helping to recruit students.
Veggie Grill did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 6 feet 8 inches tall, renowned Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen was a giant both in academia and in stature. Family and friends, however, remember him most of all for his humility, patience, warmth, and eagerness to give his time to others.
Christensen, known as the world’s foremost authority on “disruptive innovation,” died Jan. 23 surrounded by his family after a year-long battle with leukemia. He was 67 years old.
Christensen joined the HBS faculty in 1992. He is survived by his wife Christine, five children — Matthew, Ann, Michael, Spencer, and Catherine — and nine grandchildren.
HBS Dean Nitin Nohria praised Christensen’s influential research on how industries and companies approach management.
“He was a beloved professor and role model whose brilliant teaching and wisdom inspired generations of students and young academics,” Nohria wrote in a statement. “His loss will be felt deeply by many in our community and his legacy will be long-lasting.”
Christensen was one of the most influential business theorists of the last half-century, according to Forbes Magazine. He was twice ranked at the top of the magazine's Thinkers 50 list.
Much of Christensen’s work centered on identifying factors that determine how businesses innovate in existing and prospective markets. His research also pioneered a theory about how the innovation of affordable products can “disrupt” entire industries. He coined the term “disruptive innovation” to describe this process in his New York Times bestselling, award-winning book “The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail.”
Fellow HBS Professor Rebecca M. Henderson — who first met Christensen roughly 30 years ago when they were HBS graduate students — said Christensen’s seminal work changed the “vocabulary” with which business people discussed innovation.
“So much management theorizing comes and goes. They’re fads,” Henderson said. “But disruptive innovation for a very long time pointed to something very important. It's a term of art.”
Christensen’s groundbreaking theories, best-selling books, and devotion to his teaching earned him celebrity status and a reputation as a prolific, world-class thinker.
Karen Dillon, a former editor of the Harvard Business Review and co-author of three books with Christensen, said some of her fondest memories were seeing people excitedly approach him during events they spoke at or attended — particularly young people asking him for a selfie.
“At first someone came up with a camera and I sort of edged into the picture and then I realized they wanted to hand me the camera to take a picture of the two of them,” Dillon said, laughing.
Despite Christensen’s fame, those who knew him said he always remained humble.
Michael B. Horn — who was a student of his, co-authored a book with him, and co-founded the Clayton Christensen Institute — said Christensen still drove his “beat up” Honda Accord to work everyday long after he became a “famous guru.”
“He was way more comfortable in a Burger King or McDonald's than a nice restaurant. His humility and passion for the low-end was always on display,” Horn said.
Those who knew Christensen also remember him as a masterful woodworker, saying he loved building furniture by hand, including some pieces in his office.
“He could lose himself in creating in all kinds of ways, creating ideas, but also creating something that was enduring and lasting, like a beautiful piece of furniture,” Dillon said.
But above all, his students, colleagues, and friends all said his lasting legacy was the way he built up people around him.
When Christensen’s former student Scott N. Boyle first moved to the Boston area with his family in 2009 after just finishing his Ph.D., his first interaction with Christensen was at their church.
Though Boyle said he was initially intimidated by the “big fish” in the congregation, Christensen — a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — assuaged those feelings when he introduced himself to Boyle, handing out his business card and home phone number.
“Even with as busy as he was with his faculty commitments and his family, he would always find time for people,” Boyle said.
Mark S. Selawry, a former student of Christensen’s, recalls him using the final lecture in a 1998 course to remind his students of their responsibility to others. Christensen urged those in the class — many of whom were looking to someday become business leaders — to take not just a professional but also a custodial interest in their employees and colleagues.
“If as thought leaders, we could make the world a kinder, better, more human place, then I think, according to him, we would have left our most enduring legacy,” Selawry said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is past midnight, and the Harvard men’s basketball team had just gotten off the bus after a two-hour ride back from Hanover, N.H. The Crimson narrowly escaped a spirited comeback effort from Dartmouth, and was now 2-0 in conference play.
But as most of the team departed Lavietes and returned back to their dorms across the Charles River, one player remained: senior guard Christian Juzang.
As captured by assistant coach Brian Eskildsen on social media, the Tarzana, Calif., native stood alone at the free throw line, working diligently to regain his shooting stroke in the peace and quiet of an empty gym.
This snapshot in many ways encapsulates the character and temperament of one of Harvard’s lynchpins: undeterred by adversity, driven for improvement, and trustworthy of the grind.
Coach Tommy Amaker, who has leaned on the word “sacrifice” as a motto for the program, recently acknowledged Juzang’s contributions in a speech to the team.
“[Christian]’s been as valuable as any kid we’ve had in our program for the last two years,” Amaker said. “He’s been able to step in at various moments in times and I admired him — I mentioned this to our team — that his role has changed drastically within the course of this season… His spirit has always been intact, and you have to have an internal spirit about being really a part of everything and being all-in with this team.”
To call this an unpredictable and fluctuating season for Juzang would be an understatement. The fourth-year was named a starter in the season opener, yielded the majority of his minutes to his all-Ivy counterpart Bryce Aiken in November, regained some playing time in early December, and is now back as the workhorse for Amaker whilst Aiken nurses a sprained ankle suffered against George Washington on Dec. 21.
As volatile as this may sound, Juzang is no stranger to taking over the reins of the team. In relief of an injured Bryce Aiken during much of his sophomore Ivy campaign, Juzang broke through with nine double-digit performances and helped the Crimson capture its first Ancient Eight title since 2015. During this past junior season, the Viewpoint School graduate impressed Amaker well enough to retain his starting position, even when Aiken returned from his prior injury in January 2019.
This season’s go-around — one in which Juzang has gone from playing just four minutes against No. 5 Maryland over Thanksgiving to totaling an average of 34 MPG and 12.4 PPG in the most recent five-game span — is no different, according to the seasoned playmaker.
“Just having a calling card of mine just to stay ready for whenever that is,” said Juzang, who quickly deflected to focus on the overall team mindset. “Kind of for everybody, ‘staying ready so you don’t have to get ready.’ Everyone is just happy to chip in where they can and win another Ivy League title, and this year, get to the tournament.”
Juzang’s contributions in recent weeks have been critical to the Crimson’s two-month long eight-game win streak, one away from matching Amaker’s Harvard record. Outside of his recent aggressiveness from deep in which the guard has made 11 triples in five games, Juzang has also dished out at least five assists in three of those contests.
For Coach Amaker, it has also been the intangible qualities that has impressed him the most, including embracing any role that the coaching staff has asked of him. Moreover, he affirmed that Juzang has unquestionably earned the respect of his teammates to command the experienced squad.
“He’s the leader of the team,” Amaker said. “[Justin] Bassey is probably our heart and soul, and I would say that Juzang is probably our leader. He’s not our captain, but it’d be hard for us or anyone on our team to say he isn’t the leader of our team, being the quarterback, the point guard, and the guy that we rely on to lead us out on the court.”
Moving forward, there is little question that Juzang will be called upon in big moments to elevate the Crimson program to its ultimate goals in March. Nevertheless — with Aiken’s return date still uncertain and former all-Ivy Seth Towns out for the season — the Harvard side will certainly need to draw on a balanced team effort to power through to the NCAA Tournament, one that will demand a “ready-at-all-times” mentality.
If that is the case, there seems to be no better individual to spearhead that charge than the one who has embodied that philosophy throughout his four years in Cambridge.

On Monday morning, sports viewers across America will return to work reluctantly following a long evening of Super Bowl festivities. Boston hockey fans, though, will wake up with a special excitement.
That’s because that night, Beantown’s four most storied hockey schools will commence their annual battle for on-ice supremacy: the Beanpot Tournament.
A pair of semifinal matchups — first featuring the Harvard men’s hockey team and Northeastern before turning to a Commonwealth clash between Boston University and Boston College — will kick off the 68th rendition of the famed competition.
“[The Beanpot] is always a highlight,” said Crimson junior forward Henry Bowlby. “The tradition is always there. I’m not even from Boston, but it’s always still a big deal…. We take it very seriously as something that could really turn our season around and give us momentum as we head into the back half.”
The early game of the first round features the last two programs to claim the sought-after trophy. The No. 16 Crimson (9-6-4, 7-4-3 ECAC), last victors in 2017, come up against the No. 13 Huskies (13-7-2, 7-6-1 HEA), who begin their quest to secure the university’s first-ever streak of three consecutive tournament wins.
Prior to these squads’ recent triumphs, the Boston hockey classic was lacking parity, as the other two Beanpot foes had accounted for 23 straight crowns. Now, with each school able to point to a championship in the past five years, Monday’s 5:00 p.m. affair initiates a tournament that is truly up for grabs.
Sure, the No. 5 Eagles (15-7-0, 9-5-0 HEA) will enter as the favorites, given that they sit highest of the four teams on the national big board. But with two other ranked clubs in the field, plus a Terriers (9-8-6, 6-4-5 HEA) squad that will bring its share of high-end talent to TD Garden, the 2020 Beanpot could deliver any possible result.
Harvard and Northeastern should provide an entertaining and competitive opener in their first meeting since the Crimson’s semifinal victory in 2017.
“There’s no question that BC brings the most experience into [the tournament],” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, himself a veteran of the Beanpot. “There’s a case to be made that Northeastern brings the most confidence into it after winning two in a row, and BU has the best performance all-time in the Beanpot, so I think that every team feels that if they play their best hockey, they can get the result they want. And that makes for an exciting tournament.”
Both teams will face conference opponents on Friday — Harvard visits Union and the Huskies host Providence — before shifting focus entirely to Monday’s bout. The outcomes of these weekend primers will certainly influence the momentum that each foe brings to the semifinal. But more generally, the TD Garden clash affords a chance for the victor to reestablish winning ways, after both adversaries have logged mixed results since the new year.
Since rattling off six consecutive wins to open the campaign, the Crimson has posted a lackluster 3-6-4 record. In mid-January, Harvard enjoyed a 7-0 thrashing of rival Yale at Madison Square Garden and was able to follow up its convincing performance with another triumph against St. Lawrence.
The winning stopped there, though, as the following night, top-10 opponent Clarkson halted the Crimson’s comeback attempt in the third period and returned coach Donato’s squad to the loss column. The team’s most recent trip, to Upstate New York, delivered ties at Colgate and No. 1 Cornell, each disappointing in its own way.
Nineteen games into the campaign, Harvard has just two victories over schools currently in the top 20. So, Northeastern represents a marquee opponent against which a win could do wonders for the season trajectory and the Pairwise rankings as the back half of the schedule progresses.
“Monday will be a really big test because Northeastern has those really big wins,” said Crimson freshman defenseman Henry Thrun. “Hopefully, the next Monday we’ll get a good championship matchup, and then we’re going to have Clarkson again later in the season. So we’ll have some big games that will hopefully be able to let us jump a little in the Pairwise.”
The Huskies have several statement wins on their resume entering Monday’s matchup, such as those over Massachusetts and Providence, squads currently ranked No. 7/6 and No. 9/8 in the country, respectively.
In fairness, these victories have come in the form of series splits, in which the formidable foes have also claimed two points against Northeastern at least once. Nonetheless, the Huskies have proven their ability to take down some of the stiffest competition in the nation — a capacity which Harvard is still looking to demonstrate to the rest of college hockey.
Resuming the campaign after the new year, Northeastern handled Connecticut and Bentley to continue the success it had established prior to Christmas, having taken a 6-1 stretch of hockey into the holiday break.
Mid-January, however, provided consecutive setbacks, as UConn and New Hampshire avenged previous defeats with overtime victories.
So just like the Crimson, the Huskies will confront a turning-point opportunity on Monday evening to capture a high-quality win and set their season on a successful course for its final five weeks. And both teams have reason to think that the semifinal game is theirs for the taking. In fact, the schools match up relatively closely.
For one, they can score. Prior to each squad’s conference tilt on Friday, Harvard ranks fifth nationwide in goals per game (3.68), while Northeastern follows just seven spots behind (3.27). On the other side of the ice, the Crimson and its Monday-night opponent sit in the top half of NCAA teams in goals against per game, at 27th (2.63) and 19th (2.50), respectively.
These similar numbers result in the teams being just two spots apart in per-game goal margin, with Harvard at 11th (+1.05) and the Huskies at 13th (+0.77).
“We know they bring a lot of speed and a lot of offense,” Crimson captain Nathan Krusko said. “We have to do a lot of diligence to see what their strengths are and find ways to mitigate that.”
Arguably the most intriguing strategical matchup in Monday’s Beanpot opener will occur on special teams. After pacing the nation in powerplay effectiveness for almost the entirety of 2018-2019, Harvard is once again looking down at the other 59 Division-I teams in this department, posting a 28.6 percent clip.
This carryover in potency with the man advantage comes despite the key losses of defenseman Adam Fox, the quarterback of last year’s unit, and assistant coach Rob Rassey, the architect of the system.
“We try to take advantage of the talents and offensive abilities they have,” said coach Donato of his man-up personnel. “A good powerplay has a good percentage, and a great powerplay can score when you really need a goal. Right now, we have a good percentage. We’re still chasing being able to score that key goal at the right moment.”
Northeastern, however, will bring the league’s fourth-best penalty kill (90.0%) to TD Garden in hopes of containing the Crimson powerplay.
Another area of import heading into Monday is the faceoff dot, where Harvard ranks top-10 in win percentage (53.0%). The Huskies, meanwhile, are in the bottom half of collegiate teams in this respect (49.2%).
Two centers, in particular, contribute to the Crimson’s success in the circles. Junior Jack Badini (4–6—10) is fourth in the country in faceoff percentage (60.9%) among players with at least 100 attempts. Sophomore Jack Drury (11–11—22) also boasts an impressive clip on the dot (57.0%).
When Harvard and Northeastern square off, controlling possession through faceoffs has the potential to give one team the edge.
Badini and Drury are two of many notable icemen participating in Monday’s duel. Both sides bring high-end talent as well as experience to the clash.
For the Crimson, dynamic wingers Casey Dornbach (10–15—25) and Nick Abruzzese (8–15—23) flank Drury on the top forward line, whose members each score over a point per game. Dornbach paces his team in points and sits tied for eighth nationwide in per-game scoring (1.32). Abruzzese (1.21) leads all NCAA freshmen in the category.
Another valuable piece up front for Harvard is Krusko (2–2—4). The sole letter-wearer in 2019-2020, he brings Beanpot experience to a locker room predominated by underclassmen. Krusko’s three-point contribution (2–1—3) in 2017 fueled a 6-3 triumph over BU as the Crimson claimed its first Beanpot title since 1993. The Alpharetta, Ga. native earned tournament Most Valuable Player honors for his performance.
“Coming in as a freshman, obviously coming from Georgia, I didn’t really know too much about it, but with the [Massachusetts] guys in the locker room, it didn’t take me long to realize how special of an opportunity it was,” Krusko said. “[My first Beanpot] kind of was a coming-out party for me…. It was definitely my success in the Beanpot that has given me confidence and really pushed me to get to another level.”
Harvard generates substantial offense from its blue line as well. Key producers include junior Reilly Walsh (5–11—16) and sophomore Jack Rathbone (4–12—16), the latter of whom has missed three straight contests after sustaining an upper-body injury in mid-January.
Were Rathbone, who ranks fourth among defensemen in per-game scoring this season (1.00), to return to the lineup on Monday, an already dangerous Crimson roster would regain an integral component.
“We’re not sure just yet, but I think that’s moving in a positive direction,” said coach Donato of Rathbone’s injury status. “We’re cautiously optimistic.”
As somewhat of a silver lining, the brief absence of the Vancouver Canucks prospect has elevated the roles of other rearguards, providing a bit of extra experience to a young back end. In particular, sophomore Marshall Rifai (0–2—2) has slotted into the top four, and Thrun has continued to enjoy a hefty serving of minutes for a rookie defenseman.
“I thought I’ve been progressing well,” Thrun said. “Learning to manage the game is probably the thing that I’ve learned the most — just being able to play a lot of minutes, kind of learning where to jump up and how to apply myself…. Individually, I’m playing a little more than I thought [going into the season], which obviously is a good thing.”
Harvard’s semifinal adversary will bring just as much skill to TD Garden on Monday. Sophomore forward Tyler Madden (16–15—31) commands the most attention, having centered the Huskies’ formidable top line for the better part of his collegiate career. The Deerfield Beach, Fla. product was the overtime hero in last season’s Beanpot semifinal defeat of BU.
Madden narrowly edges Drury, his former United States teammate in the 2019 IIHF World Junior Championship, for the lead among all Beanpot skaters in per-game scoring (1.41 to Drury’s 1.38).
“[Madden] is very skilled — fast player, dynamic in the O-zone, and makes stuff happen when the puck is on his stick,” Bowlby lauded. “It’ll definitely be interesting playing against him and trying to contain him and his skill.”
Madden and Freshman Aidan McDonough (8–11—19), both Canucks draft choices along with Rathbone, form a threatening duo on Northeastern’s top forward unit. On the Huskies’ second line, the story is quite similar: senior Matt Filipe (6–11—17) and junior Zach Solow (9–14—23) present another one-two punch up front.
On the blue line, coach Jim Madigan’s group is as young as the Crimson’s. Captain Ryan Shea (3–19—22) commands the top six as the only upperclassman and is tied with Rathbone for fourth in the country in per-game scoring among defensemen (1.00).
Sophomore Jordan Harris (3–12—15) and four freshmen fill out the Huskies’ top six. Harris skates with fellow Montréal Canadiens prospect Jayden Struble (3–6—9), and together the two underclassmen form a reliable top-four pairing.
In net, graduate transfer Craig Pantano (13-7-2, 2.39 GAA, .915 SV%) should get the nod for Northeastern on Monday. The former Merrimack net-minder has tended the crease for 97.9 percent of the Huskies’ minutes this season, filling a void created by the National Hockey League departure of Cayden Primeau, the Most Valuable Player in last year’s Beanpot.
For Harvard, the situation between the pipes is somewhat murkier. Freshman Mitchell Gibson (6-4-2, 2.31 GAA, .929 SV%) has fielded pucks for roughly two-thirds of the Crimson’s available minutes in 2019-2020.
Gibson has shown prolonged spells characteristic of a stout number-one goaltender, but senior Cameron Gornet (3-2-2, 2.78 GAA, .913 SV%), a competent backstop in his own right, has earned starts from coach Donato for several games at a time.
“To me, it’s on a night-to-night basis,” said coach Donato of his starting goaltender decisions. “Both guys have had some moments of brilliance, and much like the rest of our team, we’re still chasing a level of consistency. The good part is, I think we have confidence that on any given night, we have two guys that can give us the best chance to win.”
These impact players and others will collide on Monday evening as Harvard and Northeastern both seek a spot in the following week’s tournament final.
The Huskies have not lost a Beanpot game since bowing to the Crimson in the 2017 semifinal and are aiming to continue their recent dominance. Harvard, on the other hand, is hoping to reverse its recent fortunes, having failed to reach the title game in the last two seasons.
“Our seniors have only been to the championship once,” Thrun said. “There’s an urge to get back there and definitely make a name for ourselves in terms of hockey schools in Boston.”
The stage is set for a Beanpot that should deliver on all the usual allures: some of Division I’s most storied programs vying for local supremacy in a time-honored Boston sports tradition. In the tournament opener, Harvard and Northeastern promise to set a lasting tone of fierce and exciting competition.
