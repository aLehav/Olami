After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two days ago, thousands of people filled Zucotti Park to mark the one-year anniversary of the birth of the Occupy Wall Street movement on September 17 of 2011. In November last year, while Harvard celebrated 375 years as the United States’ leading educational institution, while Harvard sociology classes discussed rising inequality, and while Harvard undergraduates were busy piling lines of community service onto their CVs, a group of rowdy activists set up camp in the middle of the Yard and claimed that their university was making the world a worse place. Although the tents disappeared, the students and staff of Occupy Harvard stayed, leading a week-long occupation of Lamont Library that insisted on the same re-examination of the role Harvard plays in society. A usually cordial and self-confident campus community became polarized over what this protest meant, how much it bothered them, and whether being bothered was what mattered at all.
Opinion pieces disagreed on where to place the blame for such discord, looking either toward Harvard students’ hesitance to challenge the status quo or to Occupy Harvard’s failure to market itself persuasively. It’s true that without an organizational structure, inscribed leadership, or a clear set of demands, Occupy Harvard came across as a shambles of a political campaign. But was this a political campaign, with a set of members whose viewpoints should be well articulated and kept in line? Was it an organization that should be tarnished when one person associated with it speaks out of ignorance or impatience? If it is neither of these things, and instead defies categorization, why should we make any effort to understand it, or allow it to be so slippery?
It is ideas that challenge existing categories which spark innovation, and movements that defy established methods which push our society forward. Occupy Harvard is not comparable to the civil rights movement, but it does create that level of confusion and disruption which we should recognize from past junctures.
When I arrived at Harvard three years ago, I was impressed by the wealth of talent, support for students, and excellent facilities, for which I’m grateful to this day. But I was also disturbed by a self-congratulatory smugness and an absence of self-criticism, which I’d not seen before. I wondered why graduate student employees had so little say in their research and teaching contracts, how industry-sponsored academics were using Harvard’s name to endorse private interests, why Harvard’s endowment loss was being felt most keenly by its hourly wage staff, and what on earth lay behind the generation of that endowment in the first place. I looked toward student representative bodies to speak up on these issues, but found that at the department level we had no representation at all and at higher levels there were organizations that focused their energies on channelling funds for social events. I looked to student groups to find activists speaking up about issues within the University, but, with some exceptions, found that students invested public service energies toward problems off campus, or to set up corporate sponsored micro-initiatives in other countries.
Occupy Harvard changed that picture. It marched rudely on stage and told us to confront ourselves as elites, and to be willing to criticize a university whose industry funding and opaque governance was presented as a sign of encroaching corporatization. In line with the wider Occupy movement from which it was inspired, it defined itself negatively, in terms of what it was fed up with, rather than positively, in terms of what it demanded. Like other Occupy movements, it resisted the temptation to organize into a hierarchy and to be restricted to fixed-term campaigns that, once satisfied, would allow us all eventually to breathe a sigh of relief. In so doing, Occupy Harvard pointed to the need for students and staff to act as the conscience of their university—a role that can only be kept alive by insistent action outside of the university establishment.
Does this mean that the rest of us should sit down patiently to decipher an inchoate set of voices, or jump on board some runaway ideological trolley? Not at all. However, I think we should pay attention to the feeling of discomfort that radical activism stirs up, and respect the lonely defiance of principled dissent, however untidy. Students debated over hotly contested issues that Occupy presented to them. People like me have swallowed our distaste for what we first took to be childish tactics or parochial concerns in order to be won over by new forms of horizontal democracy and collaborative deliberation. To me, that makes Occupy Harvard a successful movement, even if it’s just a hint at what student activism here could be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An image: two modern, striated towers, set like silhouettes against a deep, azure sky; sharp flames chalked with smoke, rending and severing the morning and its lives and inspiring the somber echo—we will never forget.
That refrain, a commitment to remembrance, extends backward well beyond 2001. In the nineteenth-century, “Remember the Alamo” spurred on Texan soldiers. In 1863, Lincoln famously declared of the Gettysburg dead—the world “can never forget what they did here.” In Britain, voices have hummed a centuries-old rhyme, to “remember the fifth of November.”
Strangely, then, the date of September 17, which passed on Monday, is not a day that often captures national attention. But it is a day that should. Another image: a flat, trampled, ruddy cornfield, and farther south a pure, white, wooden church (fully out of place), and then a sanguinary, sunken lane-turned-grave, and finally a triple-arched stone bridge across a winding creek.
That is a view of the area around Sharpsburg, Maryland, on Antietam Creek, in the aftermath of the United States’ single bloodiest day: September 17, 1862. This week marks its sesquicentennial, or 150-year anniversary. One hundred and fifty years ago, this week, the Union’s Army of the Potomac launched a day-long, cumbersome, rolling assault that at once both failed to shatter General Robert E. Lee’s scattered Army of Northern Virginia and offered enough of a victory to stave off foreign, pro-South intervention, and to allow Lincoln breathing room for his Proclamation. The battle’s 23,000-plus American casualties have never been surpassed on any date in American history—a crude and unwelcome claim to fame.
Despite the day’s tragic status, our remembrance seems to belie Lincoln’s words at Gettysburg: “The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.” In fact, Lincoln’s words are the stuff of movies and monuments, and the sacrifices’ substance, from our nation’s bloodiest days, garners less acute attention. Is this lamentable? For most of us, reflexively, the answer is yes—we ought to try harder. But the question begets broader ones: What value does memory of these sacrifices confer? What does it mean to “never forget”? And why remember at all?
Maybe a commitment to remember, whether for September 11 or September 17, is for the benefit of the dead. The urge to be remembered is certainly a common refrain (a driver of tombstone epitaphs and monument inscriptions), but memory’s value to the departed can probably fit a less supernatural scope, too. Maybe remembrance is utterly pragmatic—to fuel desire for revenge or justice. For instance, Union soldiers at Gettysburg shouted “Fredericksburg” as they cut down Lee’s last charge, evoking the memory of their own wrecking at Fredericksburg, Virginia, seven months earlier. And the post-9/11 U.S. response involved a similar impulse. “Justice has been done,” President Obama declared at the death of Osama Bin Laden. But that notion has little to offer a 2012 recollection of 1862.
Even without articulating a goal for remembrance, however, we can still make two vital observations. First, remembering is not easy. In his Booker Prize-winning novel, “The Sense of an Ending,” which revolves around memories, author Julian Barnes writes, “Time doesn’t act as a fixative, rather as a solvent.” As years pass, specific memories bleed together and decay. But Barnes is talking about recalling a life. Recalling a generations-old event presents a still steeper task, which demands a deep, conscious effort. And second, historical memory is not something to be taken for granted. Not after the recollection of Antietam’s war was co-opted by a “lost cause” mythology, in turn abetted by a North too willing to forget. Not after the widespread suppression of historical truths—of collective memory—orchestrated by regimes in the Soviet Union, China, Nazi Germany, and elsewhere. Czech writer Milan Kundera pithily described the mechanical proliferation of Vladimir Lenin statues: “Lenin statues have sprouted up by the thousands. They grow like weeds on the ruins, like melancholy flowers of forgetting.” We do not have a political regime fixed on “melancholy flowers,” or a culture committed to misremembering, but we do face our own lassitude. Lincoln, in his speech, presumed a truth that needs restating: “Never forget” is not a platitude.
Back to the question at hand: why remember, and how? Memory of the losses 150 years ago, or 11 years ago, or the many years between and beyond, is, at its core, about responsibility—not just to a prior generation, but to ourselves and our current nation, products of the indelible past. It’s about orienting the present and future in light of the past, in light of the 3,650 dead at Sharpsburg, Maryland, or the countless other lives destroyed or altered on days like it. The 1998 World War II movie, Saving Private Ryan, includes a scene near its end that sums up this idea with more force than any string of logic.
A final image: a battered French town, planes growling through the afternoon sky—this sky is all grey haze—as Tom Hanks’ Captain Miller, moments from death, gasps out four, barely audible words for Private Ryan, whom the captain and his men have died to save: “Earn this. Earn it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The murder of a United States envoy is always a great misfortune and a significant cause for national anger. The death last week of J. Christopher Stevens, late U.S. ambassador to Libya, provoked outrage across the world and for a short time had the potential to cause a crisis for President Barack Obama. The reasoned cautiousness in the White House’s response has since been overlooked as furor throughout the world continues to be directed against the now infamous amateur film “The Innocence of Muslims.”
Amid the continuing coverage of anti-American riots throughout the Islamic world and beyond that show little sign of subsiding, we would like for a moment again to focus on the death of Chris Stevens, an event that appears orchestrated by terrorists who took advantage of anti-American protests to stage this atrocity. Obama and many others have paid tribute to Stevens’ skills and passion as a diplomat with eloquence and emotion. The first U.S. ambassador killed in over two decades also led a career that should stand as a model for idealism and success in a public service career.
Stevens, raised in Northern California, chose to begin his post-college life (he graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1982) by serving in the Peace Corps in Morocco. While the Peace Corps remains a popular and competitive choice for young Americans, this service hardly enjoys the esteem it had in the year after its founding in 1961 under the Kennedy administration. Indeed, Stevens’ later decision to seek a career in the United States Foreign Services is perhaps not as in vogue a choice as in earlier parts of the second half of the last century.
After an interval of several years at law school and working as a trade lawyer in Washington D.C., Stevens joined the foreign service and served in countries including Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia before going to Libya. His appointment as ambassador to Libya in May 2012, one of the most sensitive roles for an American diplomat to fill, marked the culmination of an ambition to succeed in international affairs and development.
From what we know about Stevens, from what we hear from his friends, family, and all those who knew him, he was not a career diplomat of the type bent on getting ahead for the sake of power. Instead, he ended his career as he had started it with the Peace Corps: In North Africa, and with a sincere devotion to the welfare of the local population of the world’s most turbulent region. The often cited characterization of Stevens as “a friend to all Libyans” and the reports of widespread tribute paid to Stevens in Libya only heighten the tragic irony of his ruthless killing in Benghazi.
An early supporter of the Libyan revolution against Colonel Muamar Gaddafi, Stevens was said to be particularly fond of Benghazi and its citizens. That his career should have ended so darkly should not obscure its testimony as a symbol of patriotism and persona success, of public service and genuine care for the wider world. Now, brought so tragically into the limelight, students and all young people can look up to and seek emulate Stevens’ chosen path.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of my friends from my study abroad program in Europe listened to Barack Obama’s speech this weekend. “I was thinking ‘this is beautiful but sounds too religious a speech to be held in France,’” he told me. “Yes, well, we are religious folk,” I replied. Americans are some of the most religious of the developed world, and it is commonly held that their path from the pew to the ballot is a short one. Even the secularized American is inundated with religious ideas and imagery.
This is also true of our two major political parties. Republicans sometimes attack Democrats for not mentioning God and imply a special favor He has for their own party, despite His recent predilection for sending hurricanes to their conventions. Yet the Democrats certainly use religion in their rhetoric from time to time. This week’s convention was telling, as the Democrats ultimately didn’t stray too far from religion—at least in words. They initially voted the word “God” (as well as some references to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel) out of their platform at the convention but scurried to put it back in after the decision generated controversy (“Oops!”). As always, there was prayer and the usual asking God to bless the country. Obama quoted the scripture in his acceptance speech, and most of all he talked about one of his favorite one-word slogans, hope—“…not blind optimism or wishful thinking, but hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward, even when the odds are great, even when the road is long.” By the end of his speech he was cataloguing the things about America that gave him hope—homeless students excelling, factories making sacrifices for their workers, injured veterans on new artificial legs.
Hope is, of course, one of the three theological virtues held in many kinds of Christianity. Catholics describe it as “desire of something together with the expectation of obtaining it,” and this “something” is salvation and God Himself. But what can be read from the translation of this virtue into a pseudo-secularized public sphere?
Perhaps the most interesting point about such slogans is that the Christian hope they knowingly or unknowingly reference is really a very long-term virtue, one that must be exercised for one’s whole lifetime. In most interpretations, virtuous Christians are hopeful not about earthly things but divine ones. The virtue lies not in hoping that God will grant prosperity, health, or victory, but rather in that He is good, His teachings are sound, and through them—however imperceptibly and however long from now—salvation can be achieved.
Interestingly, Obama’s secularized hope is actually very similar to its religious predecessor because he emphasizes the value of the hoped-for policy rather than the result. Certainly he argued that his economic policies would be practically effective, especially those that regulated the economy: “when a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to buy the cars that they build, the whole company does better…when a family can no longer be tricked into signing a mortgage they can't afford, that family is protected, but so is the value of other people's homes, and so is the entire economy.” But ultimately, his message was that while the results might be a long time coming, his policies were the corollary of a greater series of moral choices worth making. “Yes, our path is harder,” he told Americans, “but it leads to a better place…[w]e keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon knowing that providence is with us, and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on Earth.” Since the results take longer, hope is required to make the right moral choice. Change a few words, and he might be a preacher himself.
Mitt Romney naturally took a few jabs at this idea in his own convention speech. “Americans have supported this president in good faith,” he said (ignoring a few members of Congress). “But today, the time has come to turn the page.” He went on to reject this kind of hope. “Hope and change had a powerful appeal,” he reminded the voters, but surely what they were hoping for was a better economy than this. Perhaps a valid point, but of course he put aside the bigger picture that Obama has been constructing over and over again with the phrase. American voters will ultimately choose based largely on two things—whether they believe in Romney’s economic strategy or Obama’s, and whether they accept Obama’s claims about a broader definition of economic success and are willing to wait hopefully.

In an unprecedented show of support, Harvard employees have combined to donate more than $227,000 to Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s campaign for the Massachusetts’s junior U.S. Senate seat since last September, helping to make their colleague the best-financed congressional candidate in the country.
 
New Federal Election Commission filings show 267 employees from all reaches of the University—the vast majority of whom are professors—collectively gave Warren an unprecedented $227,124 between September 2011 and August 17.
Such widespread and deep-pocketed support for Warren is more than any candidate except President Barack Obama has received from Harvard employees in recent memory.
 
Warren’s opponent, Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown received just $33,460 from 30 individuals on Harvard’s payroll during the same period. The majority of Brown’s Harvard donors identified themselves as employees of Harvard Business School.
 
The Massachusetts Senate race has proved thus far to be the most expensive in the country, with Warren and Brown combining to raise more than $45 million dollars. Contributions from Harvard employees, while symbolically important, represent only a small fraction of Warren’s $28 million total.
 
Much of Warren’s support within the University has come from the Law School, where she taught for many years until taking a leave of absence to focus on her campaign early last fall, and where her husband Bruce H. Mann still teaches. In the time since that leave began, a tight group of Warren backers has emerged among long-time colleagues and admirers, who have given generously, defended Warren in the press, and hosted fundraising events on her behalf.
 
Law professors David B. Wilkins ’77, Laurence H. Tribe ’62, and Charles J. Ogletree have all hosted or co-hosted events for Warren, donating between $2,500 and $5,000 each while helping to bring in hundreds of thousands more in support. Law professor Jeannie Suk will co-host a fundraising gala for Warren next week. Wilkins and Tribe, who helped recruit and hire Warren to the Law School faculty in the 1990s, were also integral in defending the candidate against accusations that she deliberately misled the school into believing she was a minority during the hiring process.
 
Though University policy bars institutional endorsement of a candidate, a number of top University professors and administrators have donated to Warren’s campaign. Prominent donors on the Harvard payroll include professor Charles E. Rosenberg, the husband of University President Drew G. Faust, and former University President Derek C. Bok.
 
Though Harvard employees have traditionally donated more money to Democratic candidates, the rate at which Warren is raising funds among them surpasses that of any U.S. Senate candidate in recent memory. By comparison, during the 2010 special election cycle, Harvard employees contributed roughly $11,350 to Brown and $54,000 to Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley as the two competed to fill the empty Senate seat of the late Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.
 
In February, The Crimson reported that 110 Harvard employees had given Warren’s campaign just over $102,000 during the first four months of her campaign. Analysis of FEC filings made prior to last month’s state primary show that, since the beginning of 2012, Warren has raised $124,939 from 178 different Harvard employees.
 
Warren’s campaign has drawn criticism for its lack of financial visibility. Only about 56 percent of the total contributions made to the campaign by individuals have been itemized with the FEC. The data summarized by The Crimson represented only itemized individual contributions by individuals who reported working for Harvard.
 
Warren’s campaign did not comment directly on support it has received from Harvard employees, though Warren spokesperson Alethea Harney said the campaign is grateful to all of its 45,000 Massachusetts donors.
 
Brown and Warren, who have been mired in a statistical dead-heat at the polls since January, will debate for the first time Thursday. Despite what appeared to be a recent Brown lead, three different polls released earlier this week showed Warren slightly ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators and faculty showed up in droves Tuesday night at the premier of the PBS documentary “Death and the Civil War,” based on University President Drew G. Faust’s book “This Republic of Suffering.”
For the learned crowd of professors, the screening and subsequent discussion moderated by Humanities Center Director Homi K. Bhabha served as an opportunity to engage in an academic dialogue about religion and the Civil War, the humanities, and the evolution of government’s role in society.
The panel, which included Faust, History professor Vincent Brown, and Ric Burns, who directed the documentary, was quick to take up the inquiries of their fellow academics.
Lizabeth Cohen, dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, pointed out that the film highlights how the American government expanded as a consequence of the war.
“Amidst all this chaos and difficulty, the federal government sort of took on a new function and in the end was kind of heroic,”  said Cohen. “In the world we’re living in today, where one doesn’t usually hear that message about federal government, how conscious [were you] about making that message?”
Cohen’s work in the field  of U.S. history focuses on the expanding role of government during the 20th century, particularly during the New Deal.
Faust said the reach of the government in society—and the role the Civil War played in developing the extent of that reach—has been a “constant theme” in her discussions about the documentary and one that she had rarely considered before her book was made into film.
The question came up during Faust’s appearance on “The Colbert Report” Monday evening. According to Faust, she was told prior to the taping that the satirical host might ask her if the Civil War “led to Obamacare.”
Religion professor Diana L. Eck was also enthusiastic about engaging in an academic discussion on the Civil War related to her field of study.
She said the film evoked a “sense of American religiousness that is not linked to any particular religion.”
“I can’t help but feel that this really was foundational in a way that I had not anticipated when I came here tonight,” Eck said.
Faust was celebrating more than just the premiere of the documentary. The night ended with a surprise video of Yo-Yo Ma singing “Happy Birthday” to Faust, who turned 65 Tuesday.

A number of unexpected challenges during construction have delayed the opening of the Harvard Art Museums’ central building, formerly known as the Fogg Museum, until the fall of 2014. But faculty and administrators said they are confident that the final product­—first conceived almost 10 years ago—will be well worth the wait.
Unexpectedly high levels of asbestos in the old building, along with the complexity of the structural bracing required to preserve the building’s historic exterior, delayed construction plans by about a year, according to Director of the Harvard University Art Museums Thomas W. Lentz.
Construction for the project broke ground in 2010. Since the Fogg Museum closed in 2008, the Sackler Museum—home to Harvard’s modern art collection—has displayed temporary rotating exhibitions culled from across the University’s collections. Lentz said he does not expect the opening date to be further postponed.
“I think we always thought it was going to be finished in 2014,” said professor David J. Roxburgh, director of undergraduate studies in the history of art and architecture department. “2013 was a long shot.”
Planners say the building, located at 32 Quincy Street, is expected to receive LEED Gold certification under the United States Green Building Council’s sustainability standards—a goal that has challenged both budget and schedule.
“It’s very difficult for art museums to be green buildings,” said Lentz, citing the high energy demands of constant climate control and security for artwork under storage. “But it’s something we believe in deeply.” Ninety-six percent of the old building’s material was recycled, he added.
The Harvard Art Museums will take control of the building from the contractor in late 2013, according to Harvard Art Museums spokesperson Daron Manoogian. It will then require a year of conditioning and installation to ensure that art exhibition and protection systems are functioning properly before it can open to the public.
Access to Harvard’s collections will be restricted during this time as museum staff conduct inventory and arrange the new exhibitions, a fact that will pose difficulty to some departments on campus.
“I know the museum is working hard to minimize that window of time, but it will be a challenge for us,” said Robin Kelsey, chair of the History of Art and Architecture department. The department and the Harvard Art Museums have been in contact with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston to develop resources for students during this time, he said.
History of Art and Architecture professor Henri Zerner, who teaches the survey course HAA 10: “The Western Tradition: Art since the Renaissance,” said the ongoing renovations could influence the organization of the course next fall. While in previous years sections have been taught using objects taken from the museum, Zerner said that this cataloguing may not allow undergraduates to have the same access.
Lentz acknowledged that the decade-long renovation process has been difficult for not just students and faculty but museum staff as well. But he emphasized that the unification of Harvard’s three art museums under the larger umbrella of the “Harvard Art Museums” will make Harvard’s art collection—which numbers close to 250,000 works of art and is one of the largest in the country—more accessible to students, faculty, and the public.
“Finally these collections will be talking to one another,” Lentz said. “We’re asking the building to do much more than it ever did in the past.
”When renovations are completed, the external facade of the flagship museum will remain largely unchanged, and a special effort has been made to preserve and revive core elements of the old Fogg Museum. These include the Calderwood Courtyard, which Lentz calls the “symbolic heart of the museum,” and the conservation laboratory—the oldest of its kind in the United States.
The rest of the interior, however, has been completely redesigned.“That building, beloved as it was, was really sort of grinding to a halt,” said Lentz. In fact, it was a report in 1956 that first called for renovation—a suggestion that was not heeded until nearly 50 years later.
Architect Renzo Piano has worked with the Harvard Art Museums to design spaces particularly suited to integrating exhibition and education.
A new study center complex directly below the conservation laboratory will allow students, faculty, and the public to request works of art to view independently.
In addition to traditional exhibition galleries, the new space will accommodate three 1,000-square foot curricular galleries, and the building will also have seminar rooms and two lecture halls.
The decision to move most of the museum’s stored objects from the basement of the building to an offsite location in Somerville means that the renovated museum will be able to accommodate more square feet for both teaching and exhibition.
The change will also increase lag time for instructors who want to request items from storage to use in their classes. However, professors agreed that the added safety and enhanced climate-controls that offsite storage offers—as well as the freeing-up of space inside the new facility—is well worth the added wait.
“The new museum will enable objects of different kinds to mix in ways that the old museum structure didn’t,” said Kelsey, describing exhibition spaces that could interface work across historical period, geography, and medium.
“For pedagogical reasons, it’s wonderful to have this flexibility, particularly when many students now are interested in issues that fall on the boundary of old categories.”
The design also connects the museum and the Carpenter Center—home of the visual and environmental studies department—via a ramp that cuts through the museum and around to the Carpenter Center’s entrance on Prescott Street.
“We’re going to be tied to [the central museum] by an umbilical cord,” said David Rodowick, the chair of the VES department.
“It’s a very exciting time for what I call the ‘Arts Corridor’ along Quincy Street,” said Kelsey, referencing the Graduate School of Design, the HAA and VES departments, the Carpenter Center, and the Museums. “These institutions are working together in a way that’s unprecedented in my experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Above the stage of a packed Sanders Theatre hung two green signs reading in bold letters, “Green is the new Crimson.”
On Tuesday night, six Harvard professors spent 10 minutes each sharing their ideas about how to address the growing challenge of sustainability during “Harvard Thinks Green 2.”
“The idea was to inspire students to think about sustainability in interdisciplinary ways,” said Office of Sustainability Assistant Director Jaclyn Olsen. Environmental science and engineering professor Daniel P. Schrag showed satellite images of ice caps in 1980 and 2012.
As the audience observed the difference, he said, “We are beginning to see signs of what I call a ‘planetary emergency.’”
Chemistry professor James G. Anderson illustrated the issue by showing images closer to home. He described the problem of climate change by showing how rising sea levels would affect the Harvard campus.
“Here we see three meters of rise in sea levels. The athletic fields are now under water,” he explained, and waited a minute before adding, “It gives a whole new meaning to the term ‘River House,’ doesn’t it?”
In their speeches, professors also suggested solutions to environmental issues. Joseph E. Aldy, an assistant professor of public policy, encouraged a market-based approach to sustainability, promoting natural gas over coal.
Assistant professor of urban planning Joyce K. Rosenthal and Business School professor Amy C. Edmondson ’81 offered a different approach.
“We must build a shared culture of innovation,” Edmondson said, as she explained that the solution lies in building ecologically effective cities that foster urbanization and sustainability.
The six professors, though unique in their approaches to solving this issue, all agreed on the necessity and importance of education.
“Let’s make sure every student leaves Harvard with some basic understanding of the climate energy challenge,” said Schrag. “Whether through science or social science, it should be part of every student’s education.”
The second annual “Harvard Thinks Green 2” is part of the Harvard University Office for Sustainability’s efforts to address global environmental challenges.
The Office for Sustainability is accepting applications for grants from student interested in sustainability and innovation from now until October 18.
Bringing the event to a close, chemistry professor Daniel Nocera said Harvard faculty and students are well-equipped to find an answer to tough environmental dilemmas .
“It’s up to you guys,” Nocera said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Theodore C. Bestor, a professor of social anthropology and Japanese studies, will lead the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies’ mission to promote research and awareness of Japan in his new role as director.
Formerly the chair of the Anthropology Department, Bestor assumed his administrative position in July, taking over the reins from Interim Director Andrew D. Gordon.
Bestor, who specializes in contemporary Japanese culture, looks forward to facilitating exchanges with Japanese visitors and maintaining a vast network of Japanese scholars, but he also anticipates the opportunity to draw attention to Japanese affairs among the undergraduate community.
“I think it’s going to be a great pleasure to be director and I hope the Institute can continue to do what it’s been doing—get more and more undergraduates interested in and visiting Japan,” Bestor said.
Professor Arthur Kleinman, the director of Harvard University Asia Center, looks forward to collaborating with Bestor.
“I think he’ll be a creative and effective Director of the Reischauer Institute,” Kleinman said. “He himself is an outstanding Japanese scholar and as an anthropologist, he will help to bridge the humanistic and social science study of Japan.”
Professor Shigehisa Kuriyama echoed Kleinman’s sentiment, stating that Bestor’s work with the Association for Asian Studies will be an “important element in establishing wider connections between the Institute and Asian studies more broadly.” Bestor serves as president of the association,a scholarly organization which boasts a membership of about 8,000 academics from across the world. He plans to remain president despite his recent appointment.
With its 40th anniversary approaching this year, the Reischauer Institute will launch several initiatives to simultaneously celebrate and exhibit Japanese culture on campus, through art exhibitions, film displays, and food fairs, among other activities.
The forthcoming milestone will emphasize Bestor’s qualifications for direcdirector due to the extensive administrative experience that complements his academic accomplishments, Kuriyama said.
“Because he was chair of the Anthropology Department, he’s someone who can step in and lead the Institute with a very short hand. He doesn’t need a learning curve,” Kuriyama said.
Last year, a record 84 undergraduate and graduate students received grants from the Institute to complete internships and research opportunities in Japan.
Bestor has published books on topics ranging from the social dynamic of the Japanese Tsukiji fish market to the ethnography of local social institutions in Tokyo.
He was also the founding president of the Society for East Asian Anthropology, a branch of the American Anthropological Association.
“He is an eminent scholar in his field and incredibly knowledgeable about Japan. Certainly he will be a dynamic leader for the institute,” said professor Susan J. Pharr, former director of the Reischauer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This article is one of two dueling columns debating "Who's the Better Coach?" The other part of the series can be found here.
The Harvard football program had slowly slipped into middle-of-the-pack status over the previous decade before Tim Murphy was named the head coach at the end of 1993. The Crimson had captured just one Ivy championship in the past 10 years, and worse yet, Harvard had failed to reach the seven-win mark in the previous six seasons.
But it didn’t take Murphy long to right the ship. In just his fourth year at the helm, he led the Crimson to a perfect 7-0 Ivy season en route to a league championship. Four years later, in 2001, Harvard was back on top with its first unbeaten, untied campaign since 1913.
The 2001 season marked the beginning of a historically dominant stretch for Murphy’s Crimson. The numbers are downright eye-popping: 11 seasons, five Ivy League titles. In that stretch, he also racked up two unbeaten, untied seasons, making him the first Crimson coach to accomplish that feat since Hall of Famer Percy Haughton.
But even when Harvard doesn’t come out on top, the team’s always close. The New England Patriots of the Ivy League, the Crimson is always in contention, nipping and scratching and pestering the team that finishes ahead of it. In those 11 seasons, Harvard has won at least seven games every time; by comparison, not a single other school has done that even seven times in a row.
Another fun fact? Every four-year player that Murphy has recruited—every single one—has won an Ivy League title.
Oh, and he’s the winningest coach in Harvard football history.
Murphy’s predecessor, Joe Restic, held the record with 117 wins before Murphy cruised him past late last season. It took Restic 220 games to earn win number 117. (Six games were ties.) How many did it take Murphy to overtake him? Just 177.
“He’s pretty much a universally respected figure because all he really does is win,” said sophomore running back Zach Boden earlier this year.
Murphy has even revolutionized Harvard football for the most casual of fans. You know, those one-a-year folk who only venture across the river the Saturday before Thanksgiving for The Game. Because in his past 11 attempts, Murphy and his Crimson have beaten Yale a whopping 10 times. Under the winningest coach in Harvard history, The Game is becoming as one-sided a battle as that between Indian food and your intestines. It’s almost become an undergraduate ritual: liquor up, get to the field, watch Harvard dominate. Lather, rinse, repeat.
And if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, even Yale football has—finally—acknowledged that Murphy is on to something pretty special in Cambridge. After all, in a move that would’ve made Brutus smile, the Bulldogs hired four Harvard assistants from the 2011 season, including current Yale head coach Tony Reno.
Of course, unlike Tommy Amaker, there isn’t a seemingly limitless ceiling to what Murphy can accomplish. Due to the fact that Ivy League football headscratchingly doesn’t have playoffs or any sort of postseason whatsoever, the most that Murphy can do is win the Ancient Eight championship. And under its long-time coach, Harvard has done that again and again and—well, six times in 18 tries.
But as with all great coaches, Murphy is more than just numbers. He’s the guy who planted the idea that yes, you can be an NFL quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick. (Fitzpatrick ’05 is now the starter for the Buffalo Bills.) He’s the guy who asked a pointed question to Josue Ortiz ’11 (essentially, when he would be a contributor) that helped transform the defensive tackle into the eventual Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year and an integral part of the 2011 championship squad.
Indeed, over the years, Murphy has pulled the right strings time and time again. The result? NFL starters, Ivy League championships, and one of the most enviable coaching records in the nation.
And with a team that has potential NFL prospects and is heavily favored to repeat in 2012, it doesn’t look like Murphy’s unprecedented and historic string of success is going to slow anytime soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This article is one of two dueling columns debating "Who's the Better Coach?" The other part of the series can be found here.
When Tim Murphy took over as the Harvard football team’s head coach in the 1994 season, he inherited a program with a storied tradition; the Crimson boasted seven national championships, eight Ivy League titles (the most recent coming in 1987), and one of the nation’s oldest stadiums.
Current men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker faced a very different situation when he arrived in Cambridge back in 2007. Quite frankly, the Crimson’s past could not have been much worse.
Harvard played in one of the country’s smallest gyms, was the only Ivy League team without a conference championship, and, since 1984, had posted just one winning season in Ivy play. In case you have yet to fulfill your “Quantitative Reasoning” requirement, that’s one time in 23 years.
In five seasons, Amaker not only hung the Crimson’s first two Ivy League championship banners, he made Harvard basketball relevant on the national stage.
In just his second year at the helm, Amaker led Harvard to a win over then-No. 17 Boston College—the Crimson’s first victory against a Top 25 team in program history. And by the time Harvard defeated the Eagles for the fourth straight season last winter, the Crimson was the one in the national rankings.
There’s no denying that Murphy makes winning football games look easier than getting an A in “Babylon”—but that’s within the friendly confines of the Ancient Eight. Amaker has led the Crimson to the top of the Ivy League—and beyond. In addition to two Ivy League titles, he’s coached Harvard to wins over Michigan, Colorado, and Florida State and led the Crimson into the national rankings.
Amaker is not just thinking about Ivy League titles; he’s thinking about making noise in the NCAA tournament. And with his recent successes on the recruiting trail, that might not be too far off.
After setting the bar for Ivy League recruiting, Amaker took it to a whole new level last March when he secured a commitment from Zena Edosomwan, a 6’8” forward ranked among the Top 150 players in his high school class by Rivals. Edosomwan, who is expected to enroll at Harvard next fall, turned down offers from UCLA, Texas, USC, and others to suit up for Amaker.
Bobby, let me know the next time Murphy gets a top-150 recruit to turn down USC to come to Cambridge.
Part of this, of course, is a product of the inherent differences between college football and college basketball. With a few exceptions, it’s rare for a football team outside of the power six conferences—the ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac 12, and SEC—to compete nationally, both on the field and in recruiting. In basketball, it is not unheard of—I’m looking at you Butler, Gonzaga, Memphis, et al.
So if the men’s basketball team’s emergence on the national stage doesn’t convince you, let’s stay within the Harvard bubble.
Getting students to care about Harvard sports is nearly impossible. (If you don’t believe me, you should check out the number of hits we get to thecrimson.com/section/sports. Just kidding—sort of.)
But Amaker has managed to make people care. Not only has he produced a team that wins basketball games, he has created an entertaining product—at least entertaining enough that students willingly show up to games, get this, without being in a mental state that prevents them from legally driving home, if you catch my drift.
So while Tim Murphy may get the edge in the style category (I’ll concede that his camo baseball hats are a little cooler than Tommy Amaker’s turtlenecks), Amaker should get the overall win.
In just five years, he changed the men’s basketball program from “an embarrassment” to “nationally relevant”—and made the student body care about it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the heels of four straight losses, the Harvard women’s volleyball team hoped to gain some much-needed momentum before heading into Ivy League play.  The Crimson (2-8) traveled to New Hampshire (7-8) Tuesday night in what would be the team’s last match before beginning conference play against Dartmouth.
Despite a strong start, Harvard failed to pick up the victory and lost in a five-set thriller, 21-25, 25-23, 25-18, 15-25, 15-12.
“We didn’t play badly tonight,” said sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey.  “[There were] just a couple of runs and momentum swings here and there that went against us.”
In the first game, the Wildcats got off to an early lead, taking the first point off of a service ace.  But the Crimson quickly rebounded to take a 12-8 advantage, only to find itself tied at 13-13 after a 5-1 New Hampshire run.  The game remained close, but Harvard finished out strong and rallied to a 25-21 victory.
The second set was even tighter, with neither team taking more than a two-point advantage through the first half.   The Wildcats held a narrow lead towards the end of the second set until an attack error by New Hampshire’s junior right side Destiny Tolliver squared the game, 22-22.  But a service ace by Tolliver allowed the Wildcats to walk away with a 25-23 victory.
Riding the momentum of the narrow victory, New Hampshire broke out to an early 12-6 lead in the third game and ran away with a 25-18 victory.
“The first two games were both really close,” Casey said.  “[In] the third one, they got off to a really early lead and we never quite caught up, but then we killed it in the fourth.”
The Crimson bounced back from the loss in the third game and dominated the fourth set. The Wildcats took the first point, but Harvard went on an 11-1 run later in the set, steadily building a commanding lead en route to a 25-15 decision.
With the match tied 2-2, the Crimson went into the final game looking to pull out a comeback victory. After New Hampshire took an early 9-1 lead, Harvard cut the deficit to four but could never fully recover. A kill by captain outside hitter Taylor Docter cut the Wildcats’ lead to 14-12, but New Hampshire’s freshman outside hitter Abigail Brinkman countered with a kill to win the match.
“When you go to five, it’s really anyone’s game,” Casey said.  “Whoever gets out in front has the advantage, and that’s what happened to us this game.  Hopefully in the future we can try not to let it get to the fifth game.”
Docter recorded a team-high 16 kills for the Crimson, with Casey and junior setter Natalie Doyle pacing the team with 17 digs apiece.  Junior right side Erin Cooney also added 10 kills and four digs.
The close loss was a difficult one for the team to swallow as Harvard reflects back on its rocky season so far.
“We really wanted to get the win,” Casey said. “[We wanted] to use this as an exclamation point for all the hard work we put in in the preseason.”
But in spite of the loss, the Crimson still found some positives to take away from the match as the team heads into conference play later this week.
“We were fighting all the way until the last point,” said freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace.  “We believed until the end that we could still come back.”
The team’s resilience was evidenced by its strong performance in the critical fourth game.  The confidence the team showed in the set was something Harvard had been searching for in its matches earlier this season.
“Despite the loss, I feel that this time, we were a different team with a very fiery, competitive spirit that we didn’t have before,” Wallace said.  “We can build off it.”
The Crimson will now begin Ivy League play, which picks up with Harvard’s first conference match this Friday night in Hanover, N.H., against the Big Green.
“We have got to keep looking forward to our week starting with playing Dartmouth on Friday,” Casey said. “That’s really what’s on our minds right now.”
