After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fight for voting rights is alive once again. Republican members of the New Hampshire state legislature have proposed a bill that would prohibit local college students from voting in that state.   Sponsored by Representative Gregory M. Sorg of Franconia, the bill would force students to vote in their parents’ home state, rather than the one under whose laws they currently reside.  Sorg claims that the bill would give the helm back to “people who live in these towns…[residents] who have a stake in the future.”  Under the bill, in order to be able to vote, a student would have to prove an intent to stay in the state after graduation by either participating avidly in civic life or “paying in-state tuition.”
Temporary government employees as well as military personnel stationed in the state would also be denied New Hampshire voting rights.  In other words, New Hampshire Republicans say they do not want people deciding laws who will not be around to feel their impact.
Quite simply, this attempt by New Hampshire legislators to make it more difficult for college students and other temporary residents to vote is reprehensible, and their reasoning for the bill is fundamentally flawed.  First of all, the notion that long-term commitment to a community ought to be a prerequisite for the right to vote there goes against both American tradition and good sense. If one is subject to the laws of a state, she must have a say in the creation of those laws.  If a Dartmouth College student is charged with a crime, it will be the laws of New Hampshire, not those her “home” state, that dictate her punishment.
Furthermore, Republican legislators are attempting to impose the standard of long-term commitment to a very specific and arbitrary group.  Why not force all residents to prove their intent to remain Granite staters indefinitely?  Maybe it has something to do with what New Hampshire House Speaker, William L. O’Brien, recently told an audience of non-student residents.  College students, he said, are “basically doing what I did when I was a kid and foolish, and voting as a liberal.”  It is clear that Republican lawmakers in New Hampshire are attempting to prevent left-of-center students from influencing elections in their notoriously close elections.  They ought to be ashamed, for when did it become acceptable for elected officials to attempt to influence elections by restricting the electorate?
Also, if we are to take Sorg at his word that only those who will be around to see the impact of the policies they support ought to have the franchise, that would mean barring the elderly and terminally ill from voting as well. Where do we draw the line? Which other demographic may have its right to vote called into question? It is disheartening that a politician would use such flimsy logic to underpin a measure dealing with something as grave as voting rights. Since no calls are coming from Concord for the disenfranchisement of either of these groups, it can be safely presumed that political motivation lies behind the veneer.
Students in New Hampshire are full members of the New Hampshire community.  Those who have term-time jobs pay taxes to the state of New Hampshire and are uniformly subject to the state’s laws.  There is no barrier between the statutes and practices of the state and the students who reside there. Any statement to the contrary is in conflict with reality.
The 1972 Supreme Court case Dunn v. Blumstein invalidated length-of-residency requirements for voting similar to those Sorg would like to impose.  In a majority opinion written by the great civil rights hero and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the court held that length-of-residency requirements did not guarantee that “knowledgeable voters” alone would vote in the election.  Because of this ruling—which, at the time, struck down a Hanover, NH restriction on Dartmouth students—it is unsure that Sorg’s bill would even be legal.  Should the rest of the legislature come to its senses and vote down the bill, those temporary residents whose voting rights are apparently so dangerous to the future of the Granite state ought to send Sorg and O’Brien to the door.

Over the past few weeks, the news has been rife with headlines following the triple calamity in Japan: the earthquake, tsunami, and ensuing nuclear fallout of several power plants in the area. On March 15, it was announced that radiation from at least one of the reactors had leaked to “levels that can impact human health” and people within 20 miles were cautioned to stay indoors. Accuweather predicted radiation, in case of a widespread leak or meltdown, could reach the West Coast of the United States within 11 days. With the impending threat of nuclear disaster, there has predictably been much cacophony over the state of nuclear power use. Looking empirically at the costs and benefits of nuclear power in today’s technology-driven, energy-consuming society, however we must continue ahead with exploration and implementation of nuclear power sources.
Would a country—especially one like Japan already once devastated by and now well-acquainted with the brute force and lasting impact of nuclear radiation—readily adopt nuclear power without first weighing the costs and benefits? Clearly not; Japan, a country with rocky topography and limited natural resources originally resorted to using nuclear power because of its inability to financially support the sole use of carbon-based fuels.
Safety concerns have sprung anew in light of the recent nuclear scares in Japan, but officials are standing by their word that these plants do not pose undue threats. Compared to the alternative—more fossil fuel consumption—nuclear power seems reasonable. For major cities in the U.S. such as New York City to revert back to reliance on such dirty fuels would result not only in millions of dollars spent on obtaining the facilities, permits, and technology for such a conversion, but also millions spent on cleaning the environment, providing health care to smog-ridden communities, and reckoning with increased energy costs.
Furthermore, various other countries have been using nuclear power with no repercussions. Most notably, France uses nuclear power as its primary source of electric power, with 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, and is the world’s largest net energy exporter. Its resounding success with nuclear power should be used as an example to the world of how to safely and successfully implement this alternative energy source. There have, of course, been minor incidents of leaks, but these have all been dealt with swiftly and efficiently, seldom even making world headlines because of their relatively small impact.
The most notable nuclear plant disasters are relics from the past: Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island. Admittedly, the Three-Mile Island accident was not in the not-so-distant past, but the event was a result of human error, as was the Chernobyl disaster. In the case of the Chernobyl meltdown, though, nuclear power plants were a relatively new and exploratory source of energy, so the human error and ensuing fallout could be used as unfortunate examples to learn from. Now, there are a variety of safety measures, such as the containment shells present in every nuclear reactor and the exclusion of graphite moderators, that can protect against widespread radiation leakage. With a careful review of precautions, nuclear power can be considered virtually safe.
As long as proactive steps and updated safety measures are taken, there is no reason as to why nuclear power plants should not continue to be built or used. In the midst of Japan’s nuclear crisis, there are lessons to be learned about the ability of nature to bring about severe calamity. The probability of such events occurring is so small. We cannot live in fear of such infinitesimal what-ifs, but instead need to look ahead to how we can learn and improve. As Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan commented, “In that case, let’s not bring gas canisters to our homes, let’s not install natural gas, let’s not stream crude oil through our country.”
Already, the European Union has struck a general agreement to apply rigorous stress tests to member countries’ nuclear facilities to ensure the stability of their power sources and the safety of their peoples.
The U.S. itself relies on its 104 operating reactors to generate 20.2 percent of our nation’s electricity needs. Without these reactors and the 20 more being proposed, the U.S. will see itself with the same reliance on foreign oil and dirty energy.
The tragedies of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Japan should be taken as a cautionary tale, of what the global community can improve upon, but not as a foreboding of the evils of nuclear power. We have come too far in our appetite and reliance on energy to do without.

In Brazilian Portuguese there’s an evocative word sertão, meaning “backlands.” It refers to the Northeastern interior, calling up images of cracked earth and cacti, vaqueros and bandits and vast blue sky. The region was the site of the epic 19th-century War of the Canudos—a rebellion against the government by sertanejos led by a Messianic preacher; it’s been the subject of books ranging from João Guimarães Rosa’s The Devil to Pay in the Backlands to one of Mario Vargas Llosa’s most famous novels; it’s where “life is dusty and wears,” as one poet immortalized it. To the public imagination in cosmopolitan São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, while the sertão possesses an acknowledged swathe of rich dance and storytelling traditions, it remains primarily a place of poverty and instability—a slightly terrifying land where ghosts wander, leaders rise up full-formed from the ashes of poverty, and in the deep orange twilight anything can happen.
The U.S. media this week was dominated for obvious reasons by events in Libya and Japan, but much was happening south of our nation as well. Obama’s five-day tour of Latin America, which took him to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador, drew Wednesday to a close. A Wall Street Journal editorial pointed out the “surreal” quality of the situation: while the família Obama was soaking up the sun in shorts and bare legs, the United States was undertaking intensive missile-based intervention in the Middle East. To many newspaper readers here, the entire region from Mexico to Cape Horn can seem at the moment to appear like a sideshow, a flamboyant but untrustworthy neighbor—in a word, a backlands.
At times Obama’s visit, too, seemed to treat the countries this way. When Obama—pausing to take photos with children kicking around a soccer ball—visited the Rio slum Cidade de Deus, subject of a sentimental 2008 Fernando Meirelles film, inhabitants expressed some annoyance their city was being treated as a shantytown worth a feel-good photo-op. In the city centers, Obama pushed his policies: after a few brief remarks commending Brazilian forays into clean energy, he reiterated to President Roussef and the audience that America would help Brazil develop and refine its off-shore oil, so American companies could later import it.
Roussef maintained a strained smile throughout many of the talks, partly because of Obama’s subtle but firm resistance to Brazil’s entreaties for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, partly because Obama should really have made the trip to see her country’s ordem e progresso before now. Brazil is an economic giant—in 2010 Newsweek predicted “Brazil Is the New China,” and its economy is growing at a staggering nine percent per year. Previous President Lula—himself from the town of Caetés, in the backlands—is responsible for many of the economic reforms, but he made it clear he was independent of U.S. views, recognizing Palestine as a state and refusing to blockade Iran. Roussef’s Brazil appears to be taking a similar line, seeking alliance with the U.S. while maintaining its own trajectory.
Obama went on to visit Chile and El Salvador, which retain ties while remaining suspicious of the United States. One can see symbols of inter-Latin American solidarity too in Mexico City’s elegant Palacio de Bellas Artes, where the current exhibition highlights a flag made of femur bones from Pinochet’s Chilean victims. On the walls alongside, however, much political artwork takes up the perennial theme of perceived U.S. hypocrisy. Indeed, Mexican nerves have been frayed more than usual in the past few weeks. A long, complicated history of resentment was bolstered by an inflammatory Wikileaks release resulting in the resignation of the U.S. diplomat to Mexico. This week, while Obama toured South America, The New York Times reported that the U.S. government had begun a drone program, sending in Predators—invisible from the ground—to collect intelligence for the drug wars. Whether or not these drones should be deployed is equivocal—if the U.S. maintains its current drug policy, no better alternative may exist. But because the drone program, long in the works, is now the most visible U.S. sign of involvement there, and because it is run out of American-dominated “fusion centers” in Mexico City filled with staffers who do not always speak fluent Spanish, Mexican perceptions of the U.S. as unsympathetic or incompetent intruders are understandable. Much work needs to be done in repairing these relations.
Forty-five minutes from Mexico City by bus is the town of Cuernavaca, a weekend oasis for those making their living in the sprawling metropolis. Exploring the area over holiday, my sister and I came up without warning against a number of strange white structures, half-domes in the midst of the plaza. The words “Cinema Planeta” were printed outside the tents, but no one seemed to know what was inside. A line stretched round the block for entrance. When we were finally ushered in through two vacuum-sealed doors, abstract silent films were being projected on the ceiling; hundreds of people lay on the ground watching. Sounds of footsteps and fragments of Spanish echoed in the darkness. The next morning, the structures had disappeared. The films were supposed to teach environmentalism, I later learned, but no content was immediately clear. It was a moment of grand metaphor, and pure art—a repudiation of explicit meaning in favor of the mysterious gesture, something like Maupertuis’ imagined amphitheatre of mirrors.
But this was not politics. Politics, too, is built on the calculated gesture, but its business is at least the pretense of directness and sincerity. Obama’s Latin American tour, while an admirable start, came off as too self-serving, and not interested enough in his host nations, to be clearly convincing. To many living in Brazil and Chile, in Mexico and El Salvador, despite the economic and cultural strength of their nations, the perception remains that to our country they are a mere backlands—a haunting but inconsequential desert, a vast canvas with infinite spaces, a place to be plundered but also forgotten.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tomorrow, the musicians Salman Ahmad and Shahram Azhar will perform in Leverett House to benefit the victims of one of nature’s major tragedies. Through that benefit concert, “Umeed-e-Sahar,” the Harvard community can use song to raise money for the countless victims of the earthquake and tsunami that rocked Japan on March 11. The concert joins nationwide efforts that include the donation of songs by Justin Bieber, U2, Rihanna, and others. What sets tomorrow’s concert apart, however, is the fact that it mainly supports the victims of another disaster: the earlier flooding of Pakistan. This dual focus, because it considers not only the latest crisis but also one whose damages are still strongly felt, demonstrates a broader awareness too often lost in public support after headline-grabbing disasters.
In recent days Japan’s disaster recovery has received much comparison to previous efforts after disaster. This has prompted speculation about why Japan’s disaster has not created the same rush of support in the same way as Haiti, the Indian Ocean tsunami, or Hurricane Katrina. Yet agencies have been active in soliciting donations; such evaluations by total dollars do not do justice to what has been a strong outpouring of support. At Harvard, this week has seen concerted efforts of fundraising and events that conclude tomorrow with the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association Benefit Concert. Our community, and many others across the country and globe, has demonstrated admirable unity and compassion in identifying with the Japanese people and seeking to help them.
Rather than question those efforts, it’s important to consider that many aid agencies have not been requested to help in Japan. World Medical Relief, an agency based in Detroit, has sat tight with its stockpile of medical instruments, unneeded, as local efforts in Michigan funnel aid to the Red Cross. With a strong branch of the Red Cross of its own, Japan does not have the need for such aid that was so critical in Haiti. Canadian aid agencies already reportedly plan to use unneeded funds for other purposes unexpected by their donors. And in other nations such as South Africa, it has been asked why major efforts to raise aid not necessarily asked for by Japan cannot be replicated for local projects with great need. These represent just several examples of the massive effort worldwide to assist Japan regardless of the country’s actual needs.
The fact that some assistance may prove superfluous, of course, should not minimize one’s willingness to send assistance to Japan. The country will have huge hurdles to face for years, if not decades, and help will be welcome. Reports of Japan’s agencies handling much of the initial efforts on their own, however, strike me as consistent with the efficiency and strength I witnessed when I traveled through the nation a decade ago. More recently, it has made me think every day about a column I wrote almost exactly a year ago about the relief efforts in Haiti. In that column, I warned that future disasters would make it easy to forget that ongoing efforts in Haiti will take a sustained effort, even as we show support for the world’s latest victims. Today, Haiti has made some progress—its presidential runoff election on March 20 appears to have occurred with minimal disturbance—but the country has a difficult road ahead.
As we give our thoughts and dollars to Japan, we cannot forget the places in the world where World Medical Relief’s instruments—like other supplies present in Japan—are still sorely needed. A humanitarian crisis has been developing in Ivory Coast since November; 300,000 people have fled their homes. Thousands of Somalians are languishing at the troubled country’s border with Kenya and Ethiopia; militia groups there have called directly for aid agencies’ help. Afghanistan, a post 9/11 concern for many Americans but increasingly a politically unpopular subject, remains a critical area for international aid. Closer to Japan, over 100,000 people face the threat of starvation after their rice crop failed in Laos. Libya, of course, will require a major concerted effort, if its government ever topples or allows in such aid.
Unfortunately, the list of places in desperate need of help far exceeds these examples, and will likely always do so. We can take some comfort in the fact that the international community has set up an array of aid agencies who will continue to assist these places to the best of their ability, regardless of public awareness.
With public awareness, however, comes the vast potential of unusual donations—everyday citizens buying donated pop songs or texting donations to the Red Cross. It is heartening to see this reaction in full sway with Japan. I hope, however, for more initatives like tomorrow’s Umeed-e-Sahar—with one eye open to the latest crisis, but another eye open to the many tragedies whose needs greatly exceed their attention in the headlines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many young women coming of age in the 1980s in Manhattan, I arrived at college in the fall of 1986 thinking I could do anything. I had been encouraged in this by my passionately cultured, stay-at-home Belgian-Jewish mother, whose hopes for me and my generation knew no bounds. Her favorite Gloria Steinem line? “We are becoming the men we wanted to marry.” I was most definitely not a seventies-style feminist. As far as my peers and I were concerned, those fiercely fought battles for equality were long over, the hard-won fruits of victory ours. Besides, their approach seemed—from the safe distance of our boom-boom decade—decidedly too earnest and unglamorous. I would never go around with my legs or armpits unshaven. I preferred Chanel bags and black stockings and a well-turned heel.
My first day as a Harvard freshman, while I was unpacking in my Matthews dorm room, a girl from across the hall came and stood in the doorway and said, her red curls and Louisville accent full of charm, “Oh, dear, I dragged my trunk down the hall and made marks on the floor.” She looked forlornly at the two freshly carved grooves running in wavering parallel lines down the hallway. “Don’t worry about the floor,” my mother said, “you are going to make marks on life!”
I also quickly found my groove, signing up for classes in history, literature, and art, trying out for a few plays, comping The Crimson. Thursday nights, my dorm mates and I watched “Cheers,” and I took pleasure in its subverted sexism, subscribing to its message that a snappy comeback held a power all its own. Before long, my favorite meal was the double cheeseburger at the Tasty, especially when eaten at 2:00 a.m. in the company of my new best friend, a fellow dark-haired East Coast sharpie whose charismatic if slightly overbearing mother was Armenian rather than Jewish. She and I found ourselves in sync, whether dancing, all bent knees and swinging elbows, to the seductive beat of Madonna, or admiring the brilliance of art historian T.J. Clark, whose seminal course “An Introduction to Modernism” we took together. We had no problem bluffing for a final about the Venus of Willendorf as a symbol of earthy feminine power, and then showing up later that evening at a party wearing identical black miniskirts and red lipstick. “If you’ve got it, flaunt it,” a girl said to us deadpan, taking in our matching look.
Although Harvard had a long and storied tradition of gender bias—there were far more male professors, deans, department heads, and housemasters than female—and had only recently “officially” disengaged from those bastions of patriarchy known as final clubs, by sophomore year I took a certain kind of equality for granted. I got a tremendous kick out of the fact that I lived in one of the traditionally male river houses while my boyfriend had to hike all the way up to the Quad. I was far less amused by the fact that I couldn’t walk through the front door of the Fly, where he was a member, and quietly cheered when, later that year, a female student took the club to court, suing it for sexual discrimination.
Even if I had been able to ignore the signs of lingering sexism (after all, Larry Summers’s infamous quote about men and women’s “innate differences” was only two decades off), star professors like Alice Jardine and Barbara Johnson were there to remind me of the dangers lurking always beneath the surface. We were the first class that could graduate with a degree in Women’s Studies, and high-minded high-feminist theory, held aloft by such intellectual goddesses as Julia Kristeva, Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray, was the rage. There were all kinds of theoretical stripes one could adopt at the time—semiotic, Marxist, psychoanalytic, structuralist, poststructuralist, postmodernist, and more—but for me and my friends the feminist theorists had a particular hold, from the film course in which we were taught that such Hitchcock classics as “Rear Window” and “Vertigo” were, as critic Laura Mulvey famously observed, “cut to the measure of [male] desire” to a French Literature class, in which almost every obscure French novel we read was, it turned out, about castration. As a male friend of mine put it, “Who knew?” (How we laughed a few years later when that same friend, now a Professor of French at Yale, ended up standing at side-by-side urinals in the men’s room next to Jacques Derrida—at least one of us finally laid eyes on “the ultimate signifier.”)
I enjoyed learning this new language, speaking fluently about the “objectification of women,” the “power of the male gaze,” the “fetishization of desire.” But I was still a romantic at heart. Like many of the girls in my class (although we were supposed to be called women now), I had the poster of Robert Doisneau’s “Kiss by the Hôtel de Ville” up in my room, and my favorite movie was “A Room with a View.” I was obsessed with the moment when the hero, played by Julian Sands, approaches the heroine, Helena Bonham Carter, in a field of wildflowers, only to sweep her up in a fervent embrace. “Yes, but Valerie,” a friend of mine remarked, “if anyone tried to do that to you, you’d slug him.” True enough. At the same time, unlike the emerging tide of third-wave feminists, the riot grrrls and womyn intent on destroying the hegemony of the male canon, I didn’t consider myself overtly outraged about the state of gender affairs, in or out of the classroom. I had no desire to Take Back the Night, as those annual rallies that began in Harvard Yard and wound their way around campus were known—I wanted already to own it. I felt I should be able to go anywhere at any time, even if that wasn’t entirely reasonable (besides, I knew of too many guys who went on the candlelit march hoping to meet women).
The men in my crowd seemed generally unthreatened by the new lingo; after all, weren’t they guaranteed members of the patriarchy? Some of them got right into the spirit of things. One guy I knew took a popular French feminist theory course in which the students sat in a circle, because, the professor explained, it was gynecologic in shape, and at the beginning of class, introduced themselves according to their “matrilineage.” To illustrate the “dominance of the phallocracy,” my friend brought a bottle of Corona in to class, shook it, opened it, and then asked his fellow classmates, “What does this remind you of?” He is still proud of the A+ he received, and I still feel like hitting him over the head when I hear the story.
On the other hand, men had to walk a confusing line. The unforgiving demands of political correctness, which had begun to dominate campuses everywhere, threatened them at every turn. Friends of mine put on a production of “Play it Again, Sam” and spent an inordinate amount of time on the disclaimer in the program, which explained that Woody Allen’s sexist views “did not reflect the views of the producers.” Another friend wasn’t allowed to tell his girlfriend that she was pretty: She found it demeaning, implying that he only liked her for her looks.
Like her, I wanted to be taken seriously, while also dressing however I pleased. I didn’t go so far as to wear bunny ears to class, as one classmate did as part of a performance piece, but I do remember sitting at some black-tie dinner my senior year wearing a silk Hermès scarf as a halter top (a Swiss friend had taught me how to knot it just so). At the end of the conversation with the older gentleman seated next to me, with whom I had discussed everything from my thesis subject to the state of American politics, he turned to me and said, “Well, Valerie, I really enjoyed your top.” I was shocked.
Looking back now, I realize I probably deserved it. What was I thinking? A scarf? But back then it seemed too terrible to be reduced to my outfit in that way. I told the story to a friend recently, and he asked, “Is it possible you misheard him, that he actually said ‘our talk’?” Yes, entirely possible.

Editor’s Note: This excerpt, reprinted with permission of the author, comes from an article published in a 2004 book, "In Singing in the Fire: Women's Experiences in Philosophy," ed. Linda Martín Alcoff, Routledge
Many baby sitters, in short, were required, and it was impossible to mention the whole topic of child care, for fear of being perceived as uncommitted or unprofessional.  Again, one had to smile cheerfully as if one’s life were the same as any other professional’s, while knowing that this was not so.  I remember vividly the day this began to change.   We had a visiting speaker; because the talk began at the usual 5 P.M., I had gotten a baby sitter to pick up my daughter from day care.  A few minutes into the question period, Bob Nozick stood up, and, with the carefree insouciance of which only the tenured are capable, said, “I’m sorry, I have to go now.  I have to pick up my son from hockey practice.”  For me, this was a world-historical moment.  The forbidden topic had been mentioned, as a normal part of a professional life.   As always, Bob was brash, confident, and unashamed.  So one need not, perhaps, be ashamed of having child care duties.   Perhaps this dual responsibility could be respected in a dignified professional world.   I believe that Bob, who was in surprising ways a true feminist, raised this topic deliberately, in order to pose some questions about how well the department was treating its parents.  But whether or not this was true, it gave me permission to begin getting angry at the totally inadequate arrangements for the support of child care, inside the family, in the workplace, and in the larger society.
There has, I think, been a lot of improvement in our academic lives in the area of sexual harassment. In the area of child care things have changed much more slowly. I believe that men now share child care duties somewhat more than they did before; I had three young male colleagues at Brown who really did split the job roughly fifty-fifty, and it pleased me to see little children in the office in backpacks on their fathers’ backs.  But there is less change than there should be, and in some fields, in particular law, I see a true backsliding. My colleagues who are in their forties and fifties do more child care than those in their thirties and twenties.  In large part, I believe that this backsliding results from the demands of the law firm world, which are so exorbitant that they are clearly incompatible with any family life that has home-based work in it; so young men who enter this world choose wives who say they are willing to stay at home.  And women who enter it end up on a lesser “mommy” track, or remain childless.  But universities are also to blame. Maternity leave is still not automatic at our university; it is given at the discretion of one’s Dean, and it has been refused. It is possible at many universities, including ours, for a man to apply to take paternity leave, but fewer men than women avail themselves of this possibility, because child care is still stigmatized. Work arrangements are now slightly more thoughtful about hours and their relation to duties; but only slightly. And people who complain are still stigmatized.

In celebration of the Editorial Board’s 100th anniversary, we turn our attention this month to women’s history at Harvard and at The Crimson. If we can generalize about either, it seems to safe to say that, for the most part, both have been a constant struggle against a firm patriarchal edifice and age-old tradition.
In his 1869 inaugural address, for instance, Harvard President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, told his audience that the University would not yet take on “the difficulties involved in a common residence of hundreds of young men and women of immature character and marriageable age.” In many ways, this sentiment set the tone for the position of women at Harvard in the coming decades.
The Crimson, as a news organization whose views changed with each graduating class, vacillated on the “issue” of women at Harvard. In an 1873 editorial, for instance, the editorial board argued that a woman’s physical attractiveness would distract any serious male student and that an education would make a woman “uninteresting.” This perspective—obviously informed by nineteenth century sexual politics—also appeared six years later in an editorial whose argument was, essentially, that a Harvard education would be unfair to women: “We have too much respect for women to wish to have their association with us in our college course.” In 1889, The Crimson’s editorial board even went so far as to maintain that, in life, “women ought not receive the same salary as men…because they are personally weaker and cannot endure what men can.”
In the 1950s, issues The Crimson concerned itself with consisted primarily of parietal hours, the restrictions on female guests in male dormitories. John Kenneth Galbraith, then a professor of economics, wrote the following of parietal hours in the early 1960s: “I can’t tell you how depressing it is to find Harvard having another discussion of these so-called parietal rules,” he wrote. “Those who (one hopes on the basis of some special competence) are fascinated by the question of whether undergraduates are improved or damaged by fornication can organize private discussion groups or, if married, talk about it with their wives.”
Needless to say, a certain sexist culture persisted in The Crimson’s coverage of women in these years, even though Harvard women had begun to be elected to the newspaper’s Executive Board after years of inferior status in the so-called “Radcliffe Bureau.” In the late 1950s, for instance, The Crimson published a series of patronizing articles on the Seven Sisters schools. We have reprinted here an excerpt from the piece on Wellesley College—along with a response to it from a particular Wellesley College freshman it offended, the writer and director Nora Ephron.
In the 1970s, after debts from Radcliffe’s expansion led to the famous “non-merger merger” between the two bodies, Harvard then took full control of Radcliffe’s operations. The political philosopher Martha C. Nussbaum—herself a former Harvard professor—was a graduate student in the classics department here during these years. We have reprinted here with her permission an excerpt of a piece on the challenges of raising a child in an academic environment somewhat hostile to women with children.
In the 1980s and 1990s, after the heyday of the women’s rights movement, women at Harvard lived in the odd limbo of a campus ostensibly merged but technically still separated. Valerie M. Steiker ’90—now the culture editor at Vogue—has contributed a piece below describing her experiences as an undergraduate during these years.
In 1999, Harvard and Radcliffe merged officially, fulfilling, as The Crimson reported at the time, “a promise its founders made 120 years ago.” Since then, numbers of tenured female faculty have grown, female social organizations proliferated on campus, and a Harvard president—Lawrence H. Summers—resigned in large part due to the outrage over comments he made about why women may be underrepresented in tenured positions at research universities.
As we look forward to our future, we invite you to celebrate with us the history of women at Harvard and at The Crimson in the last century.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I had an idea about what I was planning to do here. I was going to call up this guy named Charles Kingson, who was once a reporter on The Harvard Crimson, and ask him if he was sorry about what he’d written. Even though what he’d written was sort of true. Still, I was hoping to browbeat him into an apology, or make a fool of him if he wasn’t willing to apologize. Something like that.
In l959, when I was a freshman at Wellesley College, Kingson wrote a piece about Wellesley in The Crimson. It was a vicious piece. It said that Wellesley women were tunicata, a subphylum of fish that spends its early years swimming madly around exploring its environment and then, afterwards, settles down on the ocean floor to breed.
This was extremely irritating, not least because it resonated in a horrible For-Whom-The-Bell-Tolls way, and everyone in my class remembers it vividly. My guess is that the only other person who remembers it as vividly as we do is Charles Kingson himself.
Not that any of us actually read it. I must point that out. The Harvard Crimson wasn’t delivered to Wellesley in those days, or anywhere else as far as I know. But we read about it in The Wellesley College News, which played it on the front page.
A couple of weeks ago, an editor at The Crimson asked if I wanted to write about the piece, and I read it for the first time.  It was so mean, so condescending, so superior, and so sexist, a word that had not yet come into common usage in 1959 (if it had even been coined, which I doubt). To my surprise, most of the article was not about tunicata but was instead a wrong-headed, simplistic attack on Wellesley’s academic philosophy, which Kingson felt was too broadly liberal, didn’t stress independent study, and coddled the students by, for example, not correcting them for mispronouncing the word Telemachus. I got irritated all over again.
I immediately Googled Charles Kingson, hoping to discover that he was a used car salesman with no more than eight Google listings, but he turned out to be an expert in tax law.  A picture of him in a Yale publication (he taught there last year) showed him to be a cheerful-looking man, and while I was unable to make any sense of his latest work, “The Nonenforcement of Section 305 Dividend Treatment.” I’m sure it makes perfect sense if you care about such things.
Anyway I called Kingson up the other day to see if he was sorry about what he’d written.  And guess what?  He was. I didn’t even have to push it.  He’d apologized years ago. In 1996, he’d heard that I’d mentioned his article in a commencement speech at Wellesley. He apparently fired off a letter to the Wellesley Alumnae Magazine saying that after college, he’d married a woman whose mother was a Wellesley graduate, and the experience had changed his views about the place. I had no idea he’d done this, and I couldn’t help admiring his mother-in-law, who (it seemed clear to me) had schmikeled him into this concession.
I asked Kingson if he’d read his article in the intervening years—he had—and what he’d thought of it.
“I was very young,” he said.
I found this response so satisfactory that I decided not to press things any further.
Nora Ephron is a writer and film director whose credits include “When Harry Met Sally,” “Sleepless in Seattle,”  “You’ve Got Mail,” and “Julie and Julia.” She graduated from Wellesley College in 1962.
--
Editor's note: The following excerpt, originally part of a piece by Charles I. Kingson '59 published May 8, 1959, was the Wellesley installment in a series of articles The Crimson ran on the Seven Sisters colleges. 
(The Tunicata are thin, lithe animals that move about the sea in their youth, investigating their surroundings. Then one day they grow fat, settle down on the ocean floor--never to move again—and reproduce.)
Wellesley College offers perhaps the finest terminal education in America; and both its virtues and defects arise from this fact. The College is able to produce a girl with a “broadly liberal” back-ground, yet Wellesley is a very tempting target because it does this so well.
The phrase “broadly liberal” comes from the college catalogue, which itself defines the emphasis: “limitation of the amount of specialization safeguards the broadly liberal purpose of the four-year undergraduate curriculum.” This is a double-edged ideal; for, despite the increasing numbers of its graduates who go on to take higher degrees, Wellesley itself gently discourages the academic. The Wellesley girl may not be narrow; but on the other hand there is the danger which Malcolm Cowley pointed out in the Harvard of 1915--that “culture was something to be acquired, like a veneer.”
The lack of concentration, of independent study, is reflected in the fact that of 70 senior English majors, only three are writing theses. This statistic does not necessarily indicate preference. At Wellesley students do not apply to write theses; they are notified of their eligibility, largely based on course grades, by a committee of the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Malalai Joya, an acclaimed Afghani activist, was granted a travel visa yesterday after her application was initially denied, allowing her to start her scheduled three-week U.S. tour, which will begin with a speaking engagement at Harvard.
Joya’s initial visa denial was greeted by a national outcry, with many raising concerns that the decision was driven by Joya’s willingness to speak out against the American presence in Afghanistan.
Tomorrow, Joya will speak alongside MIT Professor Noam Chomsky at an event titled “The Case for Withdrawal from Afghanistan.”
Giacomo Bagarella ’13—co-chair of the Palestine Solidarity Committee, which is co-sponsoring the event—said that as an Afghan woman involved in politics, Joya brings an important perspective to the conversation about her embattled nation.
“We hear about the war in Afghanistan or what the goals for the coalition in Afghanistan are from U.S. media or from representatives of the U.S. army,” said Bagarella. “They give their side of the story, but we never hear the side of the story of the Afghan people.”
Organizations involved in Joya’s national tour have been working all week to raise awareness about her visa denial and have pressured the State Department to reverse the decision. An online petition protesting the visa denial garnered over 3,000 signatures.
Wednesday was declared a national “call-in day,” during which protestors called the offices of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to demand that Joya receive a visa. Additionally, activists held a rally in Harvard Square on Wednesday to protest the State Department’s initial decision.
Sarah A. Macaraeg, the director of publicity at Haymarket Books—which is cosponsoring Joya’s talk at Harvard—said that she first heard from a State Department official this past Tuesday that Joya’s second visa application was being expedited and would more than likely be successful.
Although those organizing her tour have previously posited that Joya’s visa denial may have been politically motivated, Sonali Kolhatkar, a member of the Afghan Women’s Mission, said that when she spoke with a member of the State Department, the individual strongly rejected that opinion.
“I was told that the U.S. never excludes people based on their political views and my response was, ‘Okay. Prove it,’” said Kolhatkar.
Looking at the events of the past week, Nancy Murray, the Director of Education at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said that it is currently unclear whether a single State Department official made a mistake in processing Joya’s request or whether there was an active decision to exclude Joya based on her political views.
Murray added that once Joya arrives, she will be able to explain more fully her interactions with U.S. officials and perhaps shed light on the initial decision.
Regardless of the reason for the initial visa denial, Murray said that it is important for the American people to speak out when they do not agree with the government’s actions.
“We have to continue to be vigilant and when people are not permitted to come and talk to audiences here, we have to apply the pressure and say it is our right to hear these people,” said Murray. “This is how democracies have to work.”

Two Harvard students who have developed a technology that connects Indian health care providers and patients via a text message service have made it to the Imagine Cup finals, a student competition to create technology projects that seek to address the U.N.’s Millennium Development Goals.
Harvard students Annemarie E. Ryu ’13 and Brandon Liu ’14 make up half of a squad that is one of 10 software design teams in the U.S. that beat thousands of other students to make it to the Imagine Cup finals, which caps team size at four members. They will be flown to Seattle next month for a chance to win $8,000 for themselves, $25,000 for the department they represent, and a shot at the international finals.
Their project, Remindavax, is a health care service that seeks to improve patient attendance at doctor’s appointments for maternal and child health care by automatically sending reminders to patients’ cell phones when they are due to meet with a doctor.
The project came about as a collaboration between Ryu and her older brother Alexander Ryu, a student at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the other members of the team.
Alexander interned last summer with Karuna Trust, an non-governmental organization working in rural India, while Annemarie researched mother and child health in Nicaragua.
“My brother and I have a really close relationship,” Annemarie said, “and we kept in touch throughout the summer. In discussing our experiences we came up with the idea to do what we are working on now.”
In a region with widespread poverty and limited access to a postal system, Annemarie said that a large number of people living in rural India have access to cell phones, which provide an opportunity to improve health care delivery.
In collaboration with Karuna Trust, which works with 27 primary health centers that serve over 500,000 people in India, the team successfully sent their first text message in local Indian script last month.
The team intends to implement their technology this summer, to continue work on a mobile application, and—further down the road—to extend the service to other regions and include additional features.
Liu, who heads up the project’s web development, said that their software was filling in a gap in the health care system.
“There is currently no software for doctors and patients to track these checkups, and that is what we are trying to fix,” he said.
Edwin Guarin, an “academic developer evangelist” for Microsoft has advised the team and facilitated connections for them over the last two and a half months.
Guarin also works with students to create technology using Microsoft software in the New England region and sounded an optimistic note about the team’s project. “They have great field experience in India combined with great technical ability,” he said.

The Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance and J Street U Harvard—an on-campus political group pushing for peace and security in Israel—hosted a panel yesterday featuring four American and Israeli soldiers in a discussion of military occupation and its impact.
Held at Harvard Hillel, the panel included Oded Na’aman and Simcha Levental of Breaking the Silence, an organization of veterans with experience in Israeli-occupied territories, as well as Jenn Blain and Ted Goodnight of Iraq Veterans Against the War.
After a five-minute video depicting the day-to-day operations of Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint in the West Bank, the speakers launched into an hour-long conversation moderated by Zara B. Bohan, a Harvard graduate student in Middle Eastern Studies who works with J Street U.
“I joined the army thinking it would make me more of a man, but I found that serving in the West Bank was really the opposite of who I am,” said Na’aman, who is also a Harvard graduate student in philosophy.
All of the speakers focused on the differences between the public perceptions of military involvement and the harsh reality of any occupation.
“People really don’t know what we’re doing,” said Levental. “Through telling our personal story and bringing it to the Israeli and American public, we can go back to our true values, and the values on which we were founded.”
“By focusing only on security, Israel is giving up much of what makes it a good place,” said Na’aman. “We as a military culture have lost our humanity.”
The discussion also highlighted the ways in which an occupying military force tends to dehumanize its enemies in a conflict.
“In occupation, there exists a disparity of power, with both sides immersed in fear,” said Goodnight. “Things get desperate, and the first thing you lose when things get desperate is your humanity.”
Blain echoed Goodnight in recounting her service experience.
“[There] was a deliberate effort, even from basic training, to constantly dehumanize the enemy,” said Blain. “It was a system designed to get us to stop feeling.”
The speakers also touched upon the lasting effects of their involvement in the military.
“You lose a sense that there’s an order to your civil life,” said Na’aman. “You lose a sense of law and that the law can have authority over you.”
Roughly 75 people turned out for the event in an audience largely composed of Cambridge residents and graduate students.
“I learned a lot from watching their reactions to each other,” said James D. Reich, a Harvard Ph.D. student and member of J Street U Harvard. “It was really an emotional and insightful event.”

Nuclear security experts from the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center say that the disaster in the Fukushima power plant will not necessarily constrain the growth of the nuclear power industry, especially where the demand for more energy is high.
Yun Zhou, a Nuclear Security Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said that although the recent disaster has slowed the nuclear power agendas of some Western powers, it will not stop the building of nuclear power plants in rapidly developing countries such as China and India as they attempt to meet their energy demands.
“They [China and India] do not have another effective alternative, for in those countries the economy grows too fast,” said Zhou, who studies international nuclear security. “They have a huge population and a huge energy demand,” she added.
By contrast, Western nations, where demand for energy is steadier, have been more hesitant.
In Germany, for instance, the government is debating whether or not to phase it out altogether.
In the U.S., views on the use of nuclear energy vary widely.
HKS Associate Professor Matthew Bunn, also of the Belfer School, explained that ultimate decision-making lies with the federally appointed Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which issues and renews nuclear power plants’ licenses.
The renewal of the license for of the Vermont Yankee Power Plant earlier this week has caused a stir in that state, and the possible renewal in 2012 of the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, the only nuclear power plant in Massachusetts, will likely face similar opposition.
Both of these cases have been especially contentious because they contain the same General Electric Mark I Boiling Water Reactors that presented a problem in Fukushima, of which only 23 exist in the U.S.—roughly a fifth of those in the country—and 32 in the world, according to the GE website.
Bunn said that a major safety concern within the industry is the lack of a strong international regulating agency that can force nuclear plants to take on additional safety measures. Although the International Energy Agency offers safety checks upon request, he said, the checks are not compulsory and the agency has no authority to declare a plant unsafe.
Bunn said the Mark 1 reactors are vulnerable to the station blackouts that were the root of the troubles in Fukushima. Additionally, he said, American Mark I reactors are only required to have 8 hours of additional battery life on hand to combat blackouts, similar to the battery life at the Fukushima plant.
“The question we should be asking is are there risks ... that could be reduced with relatively small investments,” he said. “And if the answer is yes, then we ought to be making those investments.”

Most people take the world’s natural beauty for granted. But Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan uses it as inspiration to guide research in his lab at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Mahadevan made an important discovery about how lilies bloom, finding that ruffling at the edge of each petal drives the delicate flower to open, contradicting the previous theories of blooming.  Differential growth at the edges of each petal, rather than the stem as commonly suggested, provides the driving force behind the lily’s bloom, according to Mahadevan’s study published last week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Mahadevan made the discovery by creating a mathematical model to represent the dynamics of the flower’s blooming, a somewhat non-traditional approach to botany research.
Associate Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Jacques Dumais said that he believes this to be the first time people have measured what is going on beneath the surface of a blooming lily in a mathematical way.
While contradicting the previously dominant belief on lily blooming, Mahadevan said his finding does vindicate the research of German literary master Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
In 1790 Goethe wrote a poorly received essay entitled “Metamorphosis of Plants” in which he proposed that petals and leaves could be homologous, meaning they are both derived from one ancestral form.
Mahadevan said that his research takes a step toward validating this 220-year-old claim by finally quantifying one aspect of that similarity by showing that—in addition to being shaped similarly—the morphologies of petal and leaves are often determined by similar principles.
In his newly released paper he shows that lilies bloom using a mechanism that is similar to leaf growth.
“In particular, leaves have rippled edges due to gradients in growth in the plane that lead to the edge growing more than the middle,” Mahadevan said.
Previous research by Mahadevan, a member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, has asked questions about how snakes slither and how the Venus Flytrap snaps its jaws, questions united in their shared inspiration by the beauty of nature.
In a press release,  Mahadevan said that the study of lilies was an example of how natural beauty can stimulate scientific research.
“It is just one more small instance of being inspired by and curious about the natural world around us, a subject that fascinates us all,” he said.

Plate tectonic theory can be used to explain movement of the Earth’s crust in Tibet—a key discovery in advancing the understanding of long-term seismic action—according to a study published last month by two Harvard researchers.
Associate Professor Brendan J. Meade and Research Associate Jack Loveless, both of the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department, took a new approach toward the decades-long debate over how continental shifts occur.
Plate tectonics theory, which describes the gradual movement of and interaction between large plates of the Earth’s crust, is generally accepted as a large-scale phenomenon. However, scientists have questioned its utility within smaller regions, maintaining that this deformation is too complex to be explained by a relatively simple theory like plate tectonics.
“What we wanted to do was to determine how much of the deformation could be understood through plate tectonics,” said Loveless, in explaining the motivations behind the project.
“We wanted to get to the bottom of how continents really behave,” Meade added.
The pair chose to study the Tibetan Plateau because of the relative lack of existing geological data there, which have made it the subject of various unproved theories that Meade and Loveless hoped to counter with quantitative analysis.
“Tibet is the ultimate testing ground for continental tectonics,” said Meade. “What we really wanted to do here was research things quantitatively.”
Using advanced GPS data, Meade and Loveless found that 85 percent of the surface motion on the Tibetan Plateau resulted from activity on faults mapped in the field. By including the faults in a mathematical model, the researchers could determine how quickly strain was building up in the surrounding crust, giving them a formal estimate of the amount of activity on known fault lines.
“It turns out that we could explain this broad deformation using a relatively simple theory,” said Loveless.
By looking at the behavior on fault lines, they could predict deformation patterns of the block of crust as a whole—revealing that plate tectonics can, in fact, explain smaller-scale continental interaction.
While the results are significant, their practical implications will be more important for the long-term.
“[The study] allows for a better understanding for how faults behave over long time periods,” said Loveless, “which is important for assessing long-term seismic hazards.”
Meade also underlined the real-world implications of the research, which he hopes will be expanded to study the tectonic movements that have provoked seismic activity in the past.

The Harvard Decision Science Laboratory, home to cutting edge developments in the field of human decision making, supports research across campus.
“We’re designed to be a place that can investigate how factors other than rationality shape human judgment and decision making,” said Executive Director Mark D. W. Edington. “We have people who study how specific emotions—sadness, fear, anger, disgust—have specific and predictable impacts on how we perceive risk, on how we assess our options, how we choose and implement our chosen paths of action.”
The lab, housed at 124 Mount Auburn Street and affiliated with the Harvard Kennedy School, is an efficient, high-tech testing center. Thirty-six individual stations, each of which can be used by one test subject, allow for up to three experiments to go on at the same time.
Edington described the capabilities of one set of stations, designed to analyze physiological responses.
“We can measure your blood pressure, your skin conductance, your respiratory rate, your peripheral temperature—pretty much all of the core physiological functions,” he said.
The cutting-edge facility, opened in 2009, has numerous applications across disciplines.
Army Colonel Kevin M. Felix, a National Security Fellow at HKS, recently brought a group of 16 cadets to serve as study subjects for an analysis on how young military leaders make decisions.
Felix said the type of data gathered could help soldiers better understand their own decision-making processes,
That type of information can help prevent emotions or other compromising factors from interfering.
“If the individual knows him or herself better,” Felix said, “they can develop strategies that at least recognize and possibly change the outcomes of their decisions.”
He said he hopes that the research currently being done will be of use to the Army in the future.
“Can we make better decisions at a tactical level?” Felix asked. “On the battlefield? Or at a higher level in the Pentagon?”
These are the questions some researchers at the lab are trying to answer.
Studies at the lab, for instance, have found that a feeling of fear makes people risk averse, while a feeling of anger encourages risky behavior.
The Decision Science Laboratory has also investigated how people read emotion in others’ appearances.
Research done in the lab has shown that there is a spectrum of ability to recognize these emotions, according to Edington. People who are better at it, he said, are also better at relating to others.

On March 11, an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, devastating the region.
- The U.S. Geological survey reports the magnitude to be 9.0, making it the most powerful earthquake to ever hit Japan.
- The earthquake shortened the day by 1.8 microseconds, shifted the earth’s axis by about 6.5 inches, and moved Japan’s tectonic plate about 13 feet.
- In spite of the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s claim of having a “safe and durable reactor,” the tsunami damaged four of the six nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, causing an explosion in the Fukushima I plant.

Professors leading research initiatives in earthquake science at Harvard say there were prior indications of the earthquake that hit Japan two weeks ago, but that they were taken aback by its 9.0 magnitude.
“In terms of whether we should have earthquakes there, yes, we expect earthquakes,” said Miaki Ishii, an associate professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences. “In terms of whether we expected a magnitude 9.0 earthquake, I don’t think anyone expected it.”
A 7.2 magnitude earthquake two days prior to the earthquake alerted researchers to the possibility of a bigger earthquake event in the near future, according to Geophysics and Engineering Sciences Professor James R. Rice. But the Japanese have traditionally expected no larger than a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the region.
“This is a fantastic learning experience,” Rice said, adding that the extensive network of seismic and GPS instruments across Japan allowed data collection about the earthquake of “unprecedented detail.”
The earthquake was caused by a collision between the Pacific and Eurasian tectonic plates, according to Adam M. Dziewonski, professor emeritus in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, but its unexpected size was due to the large area over which these plates “slipped.”
Ishii used data collected from seismic stations across the United States to model the behavior of the earthquake’s wave fronts in video form.
“The exciting part of our result is that this earthquake could have been worse,” Ishii said, adding that the area of the region which slipped to cause the main shock of magnitude 9.0 was smaller than the total area involved in the earthquake event. “This earthquake could have been magnitude 9.4.”
The earthquake occurred over multiple rupture zones that have been involved in a number of previous Japanese earthquakes—but never all at once—according to Rice.
Rice’s colleagues Brendan J. Meade and Jack Loveless are studying how parts of the Earth move in relation to one another to better predict where earthquakes might occur in the future. Regions of the ocean floor that are “locked,” or not moving now, are potential sites for larger earthquake events.
“On a long term, the floor of the ocean is going to slip under Japan. If it’s not moving much now, it means that it’s got to catch up,” Rice said.
Understanding where earthquakes are most likely to occur can help scientists and engineers make more strategic decisions about infrastructure planning—and avoid the kind of dangers that the collapse of the Fukushima nuclear power plant has presented.
Professors agree, however, that most damage was caused by the subsequent tsunami that the earthquake caused.
Tsunamis form when earthquakes generate enough vertical motion to distort the ocean floor, pushing one side up and the other down. Water races forward to restore balance—it wants to stay flat—and the resulting wave is the tsunami, according to Rice.
But Dziewonski emphasized that the correlation between earthquakes and tsunamis is not straightforward. “[The] size of tsunami generated by earthquake depends on the way that the sea bottom breaks and that may not be directly proportional to the size of earthquake,” he said, adding that the depth of the earthquake dictates how much the ocean floor is deformed.
Rice said research at Harvard about tsunamis is relatively nascent but that geologic projects and understanding have made great strides and take on new relevance in light of the events in Japan.
“Harvard has a great commitment to earthquake science,” he said.

Unlike many fellow undergraduates, Anne M. Baldwin ’13 came to Harvard knowing she would be a science concentrator.
Now, the concentrator in chemistry  and physics spends most of her time shuttling between the Quad and Mallinckrodt Lab, where she does inorganic chemistry research with Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Theodore A. Betley.
“Professor Betley comes highly recommended by other undergraduates,” Baldwin said. “He’s interested in teaching you and making sure that you learn, and not just produce results for him.”
The Currier House resident, who joined the lab this January, works with a high-spin trinuclear iron complex that was recently synthesized and characterized by the Betley group.
She works to further explore the complex’s reactivity and its ability to mediate the multielectron activation of small molecules, which can be used for the conversion of harmful greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into their constituent elements.
The project, which promises to reduce global warming and contribute to the production of clean and storable energy, fits with Baldwin’s interest in the environment.
Since freshman year, she’s been working with the Resource Efficiency Program (REP) to educate her peers on environmental issues and encourage them to make environmentally friendly choices.
“Annie was bursting with enthusiasm when I first met her last term,” Betley said. “Undergraduates are often tugged in many directions beyond their studies and prioritizing research is often not emphasized. However, Annie has been diligent and has pushed her project forward through the term.”
Baldwin now spends over 15 hours per week at the Betley lab, and expects to continue with the project over the summer as part of the Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering (PRISE).
The New York native discovered her interest in the sciences after doing research at a mechanical engineering lab at Columbia University.
“The atmosphere I found there, and the excellent mentorship I had from my first lab advisor really encouraged me to move forward,” she said.
Outside of lab, Baldwin is an active member of the Harvard Model Congress, a board member of the Chemistry Club, and the president of the Society for Physics Students. However, she’s not all about the sciences, according to her friend Chandan G. Lodha ’13.
“She’s really fun and has a good sense of humor,” Lodha said. “She’s really well-rounded.”
Beyond Harvard, Baldwin has her eyes set on graduate school, but said she isn’t certain if she wants to remain in academia.
“I like working with people and applying science to the real world so I’d love to end up in an energy technology company,” she said.

What single improvement to current earthquake detection and warning systems would help most in terms of limiting their destruction (both material and to humans)?
“We don’t have seismometers everywhere. How you deal with that is the question.”
- Miaki Ishii, Associate Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences
“What is most needed in terms of earthquake forecasting is an understanding of which faults are really active.”
- Jeffrey J. Park, Yale Professor of Geology & Geophysics
“Well I think a big improvement would be a reliable and very fast warning system for local tsunamis.”
- Phil R. Cummins, Australian National University Natural Hazard Professor
“When it’s good times, you need to prepare. You need to compile the base maps, have a routine system.”

Exposure to mercury does not increase the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, or total cardiovascular disease, according to a study published by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Although health advisories warn women who are or may become pregnant to avoid consuming fish with a high quantities of mercury content, the study’s findings indicate that there is unlikely to be significant cardiovascular harm for the general public, said lead author Dariush Mozaffarian, an associate professor in epidemiology at the School of Public Health.
“For men—and women who aren’t planning to become pregnant—if they want to consume fish, they can take the concern for mercury level off the table when choosing a fish,” Mozaffarian said.
The study provides the most robust examination of the correlation between mercury levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease to date, Mozaffarian added.
The researchers analyzed data from two cohort groups from previous studies: 51,529 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and 121,700 women in the Nurses’ Health Study.
Scientists measured the mercury concentration in the subjects’ stored toenail clippings.
Then, the study identified 3,427 participants with cases of cardiovascular disease, which were matched with 3,427 controls who had not developed cardiovascular disease since their initial evaluation. The results showed that participants with higher mercury exposure did not have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at the School of Public Health Eric B. Rimm, the study’s senior author, warned that “sensitive” populations, such as women who are pregnant or trying to be pregnant, and young children should remain cautious about an overconsumption of mercury.
Mozaffarian said the researchers next plan to look at whether mercury levels have other potential adverse effects, such as hypertension or risk of diabetes. However, the findings of the study are positive for those who want to incorporate more fish into their diet, as suggested by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, Mozzaffarian said.
“Since cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in men and women and fish is the leading reducer of stroke, this is good news,” Mozaffarian said.
The study appeared in the Thursday edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Barney the Purple Dinosaur dangled precariously above the floor, suspended electromagnetically from a hydraulic lift in one of the Science Center lecture halls.
The stuffed dinosaur was waiting patiently to be hit with a steel ball shot from a spring-powered cannon, so that Robert P. Kirshner ’70, an astronomy professor, could demonstrate the independence of the horizontal and vertical components of a projectile’s velocity.
Moments later, the cannon ball launched through an infra-red photo gate, triggering a circuit that shut down the electromagnet and releasing Barney into the parabolic path of the steel ball. The demo went off without a hitch—but years later, what the Science Center’s lecture demonstrations team remembers is not their careful execution or planning, but a rather unanticipated finishing touch.
“The collision with the wall must have flipped a switch in Barney’s voicebox,” Lecture Demonstration Services Manager Wolfgang H. E. Rueckner recalled, because when Professor Kirshner went to pick up the battered plush doll, leaning over so that his microphone was directly above Barney’s head, the doll said quite audibly: “I need a hug.”
Amidst his students’ spirited laughter, Kirshner readily obliged.
The four lecture demos team members are the engineers and puppet-masters behind the nearly 1,000 demos available for execution each year in Harvard’s science classes and programs. Coupling construction with chemistry and artistry with physical phenomena, the team serves as an integral, and often invisible, coordinating mechanism behind the more memorable—and explosive—elements of Harvard science courses.
“We hope to add to the educational experience and make these scientific concepts more understandable,” Rueckner explained. “We’re doing it visually and experimentally, hopefully with a little flair, and humor, and showmanship so that it can be remembered.”
HYSTERICAL INSTRUMENTS
If you’ve ever wandered the wrong direction on your way to the freshmen mailboxes, you may have stumbled across a doorway in the Science Center basement with the words “Collection of Hysterical Scientific Instruments” plastered across its frame. No, not Historical. Hysterical.
The label alone should be enough to warn you that you’re crossing into rather unconventional scientific territory down in the depths of the 36-year-old Science Center.
Across the hall, the lecture demos office is a scientifically-minded tinkerer’s heaven: books detailing experiments from decades past are stacked on shelves along the wall, while every available surface is riddled with microscopes, old clocks, crushed trash cans, revolving mobiles, artfully arranged yardsticks, and spare lab coats.
“A lot of it is kind of beautiful,” said the team’s chemistry expert, Daniel B. Rosenberg ’84, whose hobbies include deconstructing hard drives and assembling odds and ends into aesthetically-pleasing arrangements (like the shrine to Ben Franklin beside his desk).
The playful atmosphere and juxtaposition of cutting-edge computers with outdated scientific equipment somewhat encapsulate the unique nature of the lecture demos mission.
Demonstration science, Rueckner explained, is more focused on clarity, simplicity, and general principles than research science, which prioritizes precision, minute detail, and cutting-edge technology.
“Here in education, we basically dabble in all [areas], and we are concerned about how to make all these abstract ideas accessible in terms of pedagogy,” Rueckner said.
But using old equipment and leaving room for error can actually add to a demo rather than detract from it, said Douglass B. Goodale, another demo team member.
“By the nature of what we do, because we set things up quickly and because our apparatuses have to be portable, there’s more of an opportunity for experimental error,” he said. “Students see that science is not always the ideal world.”
Because the team members build most of their own equipment in an extensive machine room, they focus on creative solutions to complicated problems.
“Instead of spending all that time in lab adding equipment to make it work just right, we have to make it more clever,” Rosenberg said. “We ask ourselves, ‘how can we do the most with the least?’”
Even with the rise of technological tools, the team mainly relies on instruments they built or acquired years ago—though they do use computers to make quick measurements, project images, and create models.
“It’s good that we still have more antique apparatuses, like electroscopes, corktubes, and galvanometers,” said Allen R. Crockett, the fourth team member. “Things that have a historical place.”
RENAISSANCE MEN
Harvard has featured demonstrations in its lectures since the 1600s—Benjamin Franklin himself actually donated collections of electrical instruments to Harvard back in the day, Rueckner noted.
“The collection of lecture demos that we started with are actually demos we inherited from the original physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy departments,” said Rueckner, who started helping with lecture demos in 1979, back when the university had only one man running the demo show.  Since 1988, the team has had four full-time members.
Rueckner, who teaches an Extension School physics course, holds a Ph.D. in atomic and molecular physics.  Goodale started his career as a physics researcher as well, but also brought six years of work as a carpenter to the table when he joined the team 20 years ago.
Rosenberg, who studied the physical sciences and says he’s “always been a maker of things,” and physics and computer science expert Crockett (who came aboard three years ago) round out the current crew.
Beyond courses, the team helps out with student organizations like ExperiMentors, Project Teach, the Harvard Foundation’s science seminar, and the mid-December Holiday Lectures, which have featured demos about chocolate, bacteria, and cholera.
“Every day is always something different—I enjoy being able to work with my hands, be on my feet, not just sit in a cubicle all day,” Crockett said.
RIPPLE TANKS & ROCKET CARS
The lecture demos office opens into an extensive machine room—replete with power tools, a welding station, and a lathe for shaping metals—which used to be run by a professional machinist who taught undergraduate classes in building and welding.
The lecture demos team works in the shop to build spark chambers, giant jungle gyms, bicycles that generate electricity, ripple tanks, and rocket cars that decorate the halls of the storage room across the hall.
“Those guys seem to be very good with their hands,” said Gregory Tucci, Senior Lecturer in Chemistry and Chemical Biology, who has worked with the lecture demos team for years. “With a lot of these demos, it has to be something that you bring into the world yourself.”
In the ante-chamber of the storage room, the walls are lined with shiny “relativity” train tracks, a pool table that showcases inelastic and elastic collisions, and a vintage Carbonari light source, originally a movie projector.
Some of the items are straight out of a science fiction movie: for example, a giant yo-yo, an armillary sphere, a dozen bowling balls from a Newton’s cradle machine project that never materialized, and a cage full of mousetraps to simulate the type of chain reaction that characterizes a nuclear explosion all adorn the space.
“When I show new faculty around, I always show them the demonstrations,” Tucci said. “There are not a lot of places in the country who have what we have at our disposal.”
Over in the physics wing of the prep room, a 1934 Tesla coil from Radcliffe sits beside a tub full of wooden vectors, which is around the corner from a set of French tuning forks from the 1800s.
“We have close to 1,000 demos,” Reuckner said. “When I came here, it was a tenth of that.”
On the chemistry side are cabinets with 80-year-old bromine and chlorine, as well as a large model of a double helix that’s been in the works for about 15 years, Rosenberg said.
Some of the items are simply enormous, and many are draped with stuffed animals that play a part in various demos. One stuffed toy holds a special place in the team’s heart: their mascot, a small stuffed brown dog named “Demo Dog.”
“He went to Harvard,” Goodale said.  “He just never went home.”
Knowing their way around the storage and prep rooms—and being able to grab a device at a moment’s notice—are all part of the lecture demo team’s job description. After all, even the most complex demos must be assembled in just about seven minutes, the time between two back-to-back classes.
A DEMO’S WORTH 1,000 WORDS
When setting up demos, the team must guide professors who have varying levels of familiarity with demonstration science, they said. Newer faculty often need more help brainstorming, while seasoned professors may need no more than an expert backstage to flip a switch if something goes wrong.
“They’re great, they try to anticipate your needs, they try to keep things in repair,” Kirshner said. “You want to make sure the brakes work on the rocket car, for example.”
The team sometimes likes to pull little jokes, Tucci added—for example, a “little demonstration bear” tends to pop up in the most unexpected places during demos.
But all jokes aside, professors and students indicate that demonstrations add excitement, suspense, and memorability to any lecture.
“Having nature tell you how she works is the most convincing tool because after all, in science, we’re trying to deduce how the world works,” said Eric Mazur, a physics and applied physics professor who researches science education strategies.
But he said that a demonstration is not necessarily effective in a vacuum, so to speak—the lecturer must properly prepare students to absorb the meaning of the demo.
Mazur has conducted studies evaluating whether predicting and discussing demo outcomes affect the degree to which students remember the principles illustrated.
“Adding just the prediction increased the students’ ability to correctly remember very significantly,” Mazur said.
He said that when a new mental model is required to explain the result of a demo, it’s crucial for students to take time to reconstruct their mindsets before moving on—or else they are in danger of remembering the principle incorrectly.
“What happens is that your brain adjusts your memory to the model rather than the model to the observation,” he said. But when students invest in thinking before a demo, “if there is a cognitive dissonance, it’s stronger, and they’re more likely to say ‘woah, let me figure this out, why was I wrong?’” he said.
Kirshner commented that a sense of danger—especially the danger that the professor might get injured—is always exciting (and potentially amusing) for students.
“When they’re exploding things and they put on safety goggles, you know they’re really serious,” said Mary M. Griffin ’13, a student in Physical Sciences 1 who says that demos in the class serve not only to wake students up but give them an “exciting context in which to absorb the material they’re learning.”
By working thoughtfully—and often quite inconspicuously—at the nexus of construction, creativity, innovation, and education, the demo team is able to spread their enthusiasm for science to a wider audience through demonstrations large and small, complex and simple.
“Look, science is real, tangible things—you want to hear it, see it, feel it, smell it, taste it,” said Tucci, in enumerating the virtues of a well-executed demonstration. “It’s not just symbols on a blackboard anymore, it’s real, visceral stuff.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since its inception six years ago, Yardfest will fall during the visiting weekend for high school students who have been offered admission to the College.
Scheduled for Apr. 17, the spring College-wide concert overlaps with the Sunday of the three-day calendar of events, named “Visitas,” that has in the past attracted about 1000 high school students.
Visiting Program Director Valerie A. Beilenson ’07 said that the admissions office, which coordinates Visitas, hopes Yardfest will show prefrosh “a different side of Harvard.”
But current undergraduates said that the concert could give admitted students false perceptions of Harvard life.
“It gives prefrosh a pretty bad impression of what Harvard is like since it only happens once a year,” Jordan A. Monge ’12 said.
Beilenson said that the admissions office scheduled Visitas before the College Events Board and Harvard College Concert Commission—which plan Yardfest—had finalized their plans.
According to Beilenson, coordinators for each event communicated extensively with each other and the admissions office was fully aware that the two events might overlap.
CEB and HCC chose that weekend for Yardfest based on artist availability and scheduling conflicts, according to CEB chair Crystal Y. Coser ’12.
According to Coser, they prioritized putting on “the best possible show for the student body” when determining scheduling.
Coser and other members of the CEB are optimistic that the additional people will make the concert itself more enjoyable.
“It’s going to pump up the atmosphere because there will be more people here,” Yardfest co-chair Spenser R. Goodman ’14 said on Wednesday, when CEB and HCC announced the performers.
But students interviewed said that the presence of so many people could cause overcrowding and change the dynamic of Yardfest.
Organizers of Yardfest expect record attendance numbers at this year’s concert as a result of the visiting high schoolers.
Beilenson said that, other than modifying the schedule to ensure that there were no events during the hours of Yardfest, the overlap between the two programs has had limited impact on plans for Visitas weekend.
The admissions office cautioned student organizations to be mindful of Yardfest when scheduling their events.
“It’s been really challenging because student organizations can’t plan things during the hours of Yardfest,” said Monge, who is the editor-in-chief of the Christian journal The Harvard Ichthus.
Both Beilenson and representatives from the CEB said that the overlap of Yardfest and Vistas may happen again because scheduling must be determined on a year by year basis.
“Hopefully it will be really positive,” Beilenson said of this year’s schedule. “It’s an experiment.”

At a Harvard Kennedy School panel on the recent Japanese earthquake and subsequent problems at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant last night, panelists were mostly optimistic about Japan’s response in the wake of the disaster.
The panel focused on the current status of the disaster zone, Japan’s disaster response efforts, and the ramifications of the complex nuclear problems present.
Moderated by Cristine Russell, a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, “Japan: The Earthquake & The Worldwide Aftershocks” featured a panel composed of Harvard professors and the Consul General of Japan in Boston Takeshi Hikihara.
Hikihara began by summarizing the current situation.
“As of today there are 9,800 deaths, 17,500 missing, and almost 250,000 people who have been evacuated,” Hikihara said. “Unfortunately the total death toll is still expected to increase. Another serious problem is [what happened to] the communities, because the tsunami swept everything away, therefore a big question is whether we can maintain a community in that area.”
Despite the growing number of casualties, Kennedy School Professor Herman “Dutch” B. Leonard said that Japan’s preparation for earthquakes helped prevent greater loss of life and damages to infrastructure.
“Japan is famously one of the most prepared countries in the world for seismic disasters and tsunamis,” Leonard said. “It is important to remember that those preparations worked. Tens of thousands of lives were saved because of those preparations.”
“This event is larger than the largest event that was predicted to be able to happen on that fault line,” he added.
Leonard later explained that experts had predicted that no earthquake could exceed a magnitude of 8.0 on the fault line where Japan was located, while the actual quake reached a magnitude of 9.0.
Matthew Bunn, an associate professor at the Kennedy School, said that despite improvements in the nuclear situation, more effort must be put into designing reactors that can sustain natural disasters and terrorist attacks of multiple phases.
“I think we’re in a much better place than we were a few days ago,” Bunn said. “The risk is reduced, but it isn’t gone yet. Going forward, we need to start looking at possible one-two punches that could happen at other reactors.”
Since the disaster struck, many have turned to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to send their condolences and spread the latest reports. Panelists said that because of the complexity of the situation, technical terms have often been misinterpreted and exaggerated. The term “meltdown”, for instance, which means that the fuel rod’s temperature has exceeded its melting point, has sometimes been used to represent a nuclear catastrophe, which involves complete leakage of radiation and nuclear material.
Susan J. Pharr, a professor of Japanese politics, said that Japan’s leadership has reacted favorably under public pressure.
“This is a complex mega-disaster,” she said. “Therefore when you look at the performance of the leadership, you have to breakdown the different parts of the disaster. If you just look at the earthquake and the tsunami, they’ve done a pretty good job. There’s a sense of the government being very responsible.”
Hikihara echoed Pharr’s optimism.
“Of course the devastation of this earthquake is terrible, it’s really unprecedented,” he said. “We have a lot of experience going through this kind of misfortune. We have resources, human capacity, and technology. If we really concentrate in our efforts, I think we will be successful.”

A district court in New York recently ruled against Google’s proposal to digitize every book ever published, halting a project for which 850,000 of Harvard’s books have already been scanned and challenging the tech giant’s plans to tap into a larger portion of Harvard’s 17 million volumes.
Instead, the University now plans to continue to develop a plan for the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), a vast collection of online volumes that will represent a collaboration between Harvard and many other public and private libraries.
Harvard agreed in 2005 to let Google scan nearly a million books in Harvard’s collections that had already entered the public domain. Harvard was one of four academic institutions initially approached, along with Stanford, the University of California colleges, and the University of Michigan.
But in October 2008, when Google returned to the University with a plan to expand the pool of preserved books to include texts under copyright protection, administrators rejected the proposal, citing the legal risk involved in allowing Google to digitize the new volumes.
According to leaders in the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, a research institute at Harvard Law School, Harvard administrators will continue to focus on the separate DPLA project, with the aim of attracting further capital this spring. The project has already received backing from the Sloan Foundation.
But the initiative faces numerous challenges.
Harvard Law Professor John G. Palfrey ’94, a co-director of the Berkman Center, noted that the project is “incredibly complex,” requiring page-by-page scanning of every volume.
“At this point, I couldn’t even give you an accurate guesstimate of when this project is going to be completed,” Palfrey said.
The project will seek to create a free and accessible online library, allowing for the broader dissemination of written materials to the public. The Library of Congress, the National Archives, and the Smithsonian Institution have already began collaborating on the initiative.
“This is a very, very ambitious project,” University Professor and Director of the Library Robert C. Darnton ’60 said.
Darnton has previously expressed concerns about the Google proposal. He published an opinion piece in The New York Times on Wednesday arguing against Google’s project, calling the New York court’s decision “a victory for the public good” and urging Google to join the coalition spearheading the DPLA program.
“[Google] has scanned about 15 million books; two million of that total are in the public domain and could be turned over to the library as the foundation of its collection,” Darnton wrote. “The company would lose nothing by this generosity, and might win admiration for its good deed.”
Google’s latest legal setback comes after the company settled for $125 million with several publishing houses and the Authors Guild, which had sued for “massive” copyright infringement in 2008.
The following year, the Department of Justice raised initial objections to Google’s settlement, saying the agreement violated antitrust laws and would put much of the digitized resources available under the purview of one for-profit firm.

Approximately 200 administrators from the Harvard School of Public Health—which was slated to move to Allston before the University halted its construction there in 2009—are moving into a recently restored church facility on Smith Street in Mission Hill. The decision to move administrators to a new location with a long-term lease has raised questions about the University’s commitment to developing its properties in Allston.
But the move also frees up space for research and education in its main buildings on Huntington Ave. and has brought administrators closer to the School’s hub in the Longwood Medical Area.
“[The Mission Hill building] is much closer to the school so it’s good for us,” School of Public Health spokesperson Julie F. Rafferty said.
The administrators’ previous offices were located in Landmark Center in Fenway Park.
Since 2001, the School has considered transplanting its 28 building campus to Harvard’s property in Allston. Despite this week’s longer term move, the school has not ruled out relocating to Allston, according to Rafferty.
“As to further expansion, the School of Public Health has always considered Allston to be one of its possible future planning scenarios,” Rafferty wrote in an email.
Rafferty added that the school is considering a variety of different strategies to better organize its campus in the  short- and mid-term.
The University signed a ten-year lease on the 40,000 square foot Mission Hill property nearly a year ago, and the move has raised doubt among Allston residents, who decry the University’s ambiguous plans for the completion of the Allston Science Complex, that Harvard will not follow through on its planned development of the city.
“I think most people in Allston have given up on Harvard,” said Allston resident and Harvard Allston Task Force member Harry E. Mattison. “Harvard’s not making any plans for anything, so now residents get to look at acres and acres of vacant property.”
In 2007, the University commenced building its $1 billion Allston Science Complex, but due to financial constraints University President Drew G. Faust announced a freeze on construction in Dec. 2009.
Allston Civic Association and Task Force member President Paul Berkeley said that Harvard has given residents little insight into its plans for development in Allston. It is still unclear whether Harvard will complete its construction of the Allston Science Complex in accordance with its original plans.
“They don’t even call it the Science Complex any more,” said Berkeley. “They call it the Western Ave. foundation. Harvard is looking at any and all possibilities, and we in Allston have to wait like everyone else.”
But the University has maintained that development in Allston will most likely include the construction of science facilities.
Rafferty added in an e-mail that School of Public Health Dean Julio Frenk, a member of the Harvard Allston Work Team, “is actively engaged in the process to develop the recommendations for the site, which President Faust has said will undoubtedly be tied to one or more science-based uses.”
The Harvard Allston Work Team is currently in the process of analyzing its land holdings in Allston and will release its recommendations in mid-2011, according to University spokesperson Lauren Marshall.
In an open letter to the city, Faust wrote that the Work Team is considering “options for development and co-development around [the Allston Science Complex].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a conversation last night between Daniel Ellsberg, who released the Pentagon Papers 40 years ago, and lawyer-journalist, Scott Horton, Ellsberg said that most confidential government information is intended to be hidden, not from a country’s enemies, but rather from the population at large in order to avoid potential blame or embarrassment after decisions are made.
“Most secrecy is not directed at keeping secrets from external nations, enemies, allies, or otherwise. It’s to keep secrets from Americans, Congress, and public courts. They’re the ones that have the votes and write the budgets,” Ellsberg said at the event, which was sponsored by the Harvard Law School Human Rights Clinic. “They’re the ones whose blame is to be feared.”
Ellsberg is famous for releasing confidential information about the Johnson administration’s actions during the Vietnam War to the New York Times in 1971 when he was working at the Pentagon.
Rejecting the perception that many major disasters were not foreseen in some capacity, Ellsberg cited evidence acquired by the government before 9/11 about the potential for attacks by hijacked planes as well as cables released by Wikileaks that expressed concern about how Japan’s nuclear program would fare in case of severe seismic activity.
It is this type of information, he said, that the government most fears the public will discover because it suggests culpability on the part of public officials.
Ellsberg said that especially within a large organization, whether that be a government or a corporation, loyalty is held at the ultimate premium and is used to justify a member’s silence. He cited not only the American government, but employees of tobacco companies or clergy within the Catholic Church, most of whom did not release information about actions being committed that were harmful to the public.
Looking at the Obama administration, Ellsberg expressed concern about the dramatic increase in prosecutions of whistleblowers. In the 40 years preceeding the Obama administration, there were three prosecutions against people for releasing confidential information. There have been five since his term began.
He also criticized legislation in Congress that he said would establish a system similar to the Official Secrets Act used by Great Britain, which criminalizes the release of confidential information. Ellsberg argued that these laws will severely impair the workings of American democracy.
“We’ll have a government by handout. You’ll know what they want you to know and that really means no democratic participation in foreign policy,” said Ellsberg. “Popular government without popular information is but the prologue to a farce or tragedy.”
Looking at the relatively small number of whistleblowers who have emerged since he released the Pentagon Papers 40 years ago, Ellsberg said that many within a government have “guilty knowledge” about the inner workings of government, but most are afraid to take the risks necessary to reveal information to the public.
However, he said that when he released the Pentagon Papers it was worth risking a life in prison or even execution in order to release information that he felt would shorten the Vietnam war and save lives and that he hoped that others would follow his lead in this respect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the sun went down in Rhode Island, the Harvard softball team (9-9) watched their chance for redemption set with it. After falling to Bryant (6-11), 6-3, in the first game of a double header, the Crimson bounced back with a commanding 7-0 lead in game two.
But the umpire was forced to call the second game before its completion, due to darkness and a lack of field lighting. Game two—which likely would have resulted in a Crimson victory—will not appear on either team’s record.
HARVARD 7, BRYANT 0
A united effort at the plate and strong pitching from freshman Laura Ricciardone put Harvard up by seven before the game was called in the top of the fifth.
“It’s just bad luck,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “The first game took too long and ate away at the time for the second game. It’s too bad we didn’t get it in.”
Ricciardone only gave up three hits in four innings, giving Harvard’s offense some comfort at the plate.
Co-captain and second baseman Ellen Macadam went 2-for-3, driving in a run and scoring one herself, to continue a stellar season at the plate. Macadam is currently batting .429 on the year.
“Ellen has been on fire lately,” junior ace Rachel Brown said. “She’s an anchor in that leadoff hitting position. We love having her in that role.”
Sophomore lefty Stephanie Regan went 1-2 and knocked in two more runs during the Crimson scoring run. Junior infielder Whitney Shaw had another RBI on the day as Harvard scored three more unearned runs on 12 hits in the light-shortened game.
Before the game was called, the Crimson had runners on first and second with no outs, looking to extend its already sizable advantage.
The matchup will not count towards the teams’ official records.
BRYANT 6, HARVARD 3
In the first game of yesterday’s double-header, Harvard fell to the hosting Bulldogs, despite Brown’s game-high 11 strikeouts.
“It was definitely a tough loss,” Brown said. “Today had to be a turning point for our season, and personally I wasn’t that sharp. We didn’t have our typical energy.”
The Crimson opened the game leaving two runners on base—a recurring theme in the match—when junior Mari Zumbro struck out swinging to end the top of the first. The scoring started on a bases- loaded walk with two outs in the bottom half of the first, putting Bryant up 1-0.
“Not enough effort at the plate,” Allard said. “We’ve not had enough focus with runners in scoring position. It’s not bad luck; it’s a lack of focus.”
The second inning was scoreless, as Brown struck out the side, and Harvard entered the third frame down a run.
Macadam made it home on a throwing error to tie the game in the third, when the Bulldogs’ catcher tried to catch Shaw stealing second.
Macadam struck again in the top of the fourth, putting the Crimson ahead, 2-1, on an RBI single to bring freshman Jackie Cooley in for the run. But Harvard missed an opportunity to extend its lead, as it left the bases loaded on a strike-out by Shaw.
Bryant responded with a two-run spree in the bottom of the fourth to put them up for good.
Brown returned to form, recording her 11th strikeout to enter the fifth inning with Harvard down 3-2.
Brown’s day would end in the bottom of the sixth as Bryant freshman Aubrey Mable hit a three-run homer, forcing Ricciardone to come in for relief.
Down 6-2, Crimson freshman Alli Scott drove in a run on a single in the final frame, but it was to no avail, as Harvard left two runners on to finish the game.
“It was really a humbling day,” Brown said. “If we don’t bring our A-game, anything can happen. We’ll live and learn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 11 members of a maximum 12-member team qualifying for the 2011 NCAA Collegiate Fencing Championships, Harvard hopes to improve upon last season’s fifth-place finish at the French Field House and St. John Arena in Columbus, Ohio, in the weekend tournament that began yesterday.
On the men’s side, six athletes are representing the Crimson. Junior co-captain Valentin Staller and sophomore Thomas Kolasa will compete in the sabre, freshman Michael Raynis and junior James Hawrot will participate in the epee, and freshman Lucas Lin and sophomore Tommasso di Robilant will partake in the foil event.
The Harvard women’s team has five athletes competing. Junior Noam Mills and sophomore Felicia Sun will fence in the epee, freshman Alex Kiefer and sophomore Katherine Chou will compete in the foil, and junior co-captain Caroline Vloka will participate in the sabre.
“There’s only 11 of us, so it is tougher to get enough victories to do well.” Kiefer said. “Also the competition is over two days, and it might be hard to stay motivated...[we’re] just making sure [we] don’t get too confident after the first day is over.”
Only Princeton, Notre Dame, and Ohio State qualified the maximum of 12 athletes for the tournament.
Both the Crimson’s women’s and men’s squads have already had considerable experience against the three opponents.
“Princeton is probably our biggest rival, and Notre Dame is also really strong too,” Kiefer said. “At the beginning of the season, the [Harvard] men’s team was ranked second and the women’s was ranked third. But I think we’ve dropped since then.”
“I’ve basically fenced everyone over the past two years, and we’ve fenced all the best teams in the country this season and done fairly well,” Staller said. “I’m pretty optimistic.”
The competition begins with the men, with the first four rounds yesterday and the last three rounds and the gold medal bouts today. The men’s squad scored 39 total victories yesterday and are tied for fourth heading into today’s action. The championships continue in a similar fashion with the women competing tomorrow and Sunday.
The fencers compete in a round-robin event, and the top four fencers go on to compete in the championship rounds. A team is awarded a point for each match that its members win, and at the end of the weekend, the highest point total earned across both the men’s and women’s competition wins the title.
“I’ve heard from Olympic medalists and international champions—and from my personal experience—that this competition is one of the most stressful,” Vloka said. “This format is very different from any other competition. There’s no real way to adjust your attitude to fit this specific type of competition; every bout is riding on your shoulders.”
In last year’s national tournament held at Harvard, Staller, Hawrot, and di Robilant all placed in the top 15 in their respective events. Additionally, Mills was runner-up in the epee and Vloka captured the national title in the sabre event.
Heading into this year’s tournament, the Crimson fencers look poised to better their results from last year.
Earlier this season, the men captured the Ivy League title, and the women came in third. Both teams also had strong showings at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., two weeks ago.
Late season training has also given the Harvard fencers the confidence to jump over their final hurdle in a quest for a national championship.
“We’ve been doing a lot of fencing and lifting weights. I’ve been staying in good shape, but mentally I haven’t been thinking about it,” Kiefer said.
“I’ve been kind of laid back for preparation, just the usual,” Vloka said. “I’ve been conditioning physically, rather than thinking about it. Just going to practice, working hard, and not stressing over it is probably the best thing.”
But the Crimson knows that mental preparedness is a necessity in order to find success this weekend.
“Everyone is entering with the right attitude, and we’re all just really excited. As long everyone is in the right frame of mind and shows up mentally prepared we could all do pretty well,” Staller said. “If we make the top four we get a sweet plaque, which we’ve missed out on the past two years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of the recent snow showers, spring does not seem to be in the air. But for Radcliffe crew, the spring season begins this Saturday on the Charles River. Both the Black and White heavyweight and lightweight crews will host their first regattas of the season against Tulsa, with the lightweight team also competing against MIT.
For heavyweight crew, this spring season holds plenty of excitement, as the team will take on both Ivy League competitors and non-conference schools nationally ranked in the top twenty.
“We don’t have an easy weekend, [but] that’s the way we want it,” heavyweight coach Liz O’Leary said. “We want to be racing the best crews because that is going to give us an indication of where we stand.”
In its fall races, the Radcliffe heavyweight crew team found itself taking second place in two of its regattas, the Head of the Housatonic and the Foot of the Charles. The Black and White’s first varsity eight rowed to second place behind Yale, and Radcliffe’s second varsity eight topped the Bulldogs’ second boat at the Housatonic. In the Foot of the Charles, the Black and White’s A boat fell to Brown by three seconds, and the B boat rowed to an 11th place finish in the varsity four while Radcliffe fought off Dartmouth for first place in the novice eight race.
In the Head of the Charles, the Black and White’s top four took fourth place, with Cornell and Brown winning the top two spots.
“[We’re] looking for better results throughout the season in comparison to where we were last year,” heavyweight co-captain Olivia Coffey said. “We had a really tough rebuilding year because in 2009 we graduated a huge senior class.”
After Tulsa, Radcliffe will face a string of Ivy League competitors, including Brown on April 2 and Cornell and Princeton both on April 9. The speed and strength of the Tigers’ is on the mind of the Black and White. Princeton opened its previous spring season with a strong victory over Brown and Ohio State.
“We have a really demanding schedule, so essentially each of our races is going to be one of our toughest races of the season.” Coffey said. “The Ivy League always [produces] a lot of competitive boats; probably Princeton is going to be the strongest.”
Radcliffe will be able to use the fitness it built up over the winter and during its training session in Florida to find success and longevity throughout the spring.
“We spent a lot of time in Florida getting everyone rowing in a similar way so that we could be interchangeable throughout boats.” co-captain Rachel Rauh said.
“It’s a great team, and they’re having a lot of fun together.” O’Leary said. “We’re all ready to get the season going.”
In its fall season, the lightweight squad had its best performance at the Head of the Charles regatta, placing third behind Wisconsin and Princeton in the varsity eight.
The Black and White took sixth place at the Head of the Housatonic and placed 23rd at the Foot of the Charles where it raced against heavyweights.
“We’re looking to [see] improvement in terms of race results, especially in terms of looking back on past years,” assistant coach Carrie Morelock said. “We’re looking to really learn from each opportunity that we have to race and to improve week-to-week.”
After its disappointment over failing to medal in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association championships last spring, Radcliffe was fueled to train harder in the fall and in its winter training session in Florida.
“We’re hoping to combine the fitness we’ve gained to the technique that we’re working on and use that to propel us to victory in the spring,” co-captain Leah Schwartz said.
Following its race against Tulsa and MIT, the Black and White will travel to Georgetown on April 9. The Hoyas notched first and second place at the Jesuit Invitational against Boston College and Loyola (Md.) on March 19.
“There are so many really fast teams that will undoubtedly be strong competitors.” Schwartz said. “We’re going to have to treat every race like it’s the one to win.”
The only other Ivy that Radcliffe will face before the EAWRC Sprints Championship on May 15 is Princeton.  The race will be no easy task, as the Tigers took third in last year’s IRA National Championships, one spot ahead of the Black and White.
“We’re really looking forward to racing this spring—and that partly means we’re looking forward to winning—but we’re also just looking forward to the opportunity to put into practice all of the things we’ve been working on.” Morelock said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long winter season, three of the four Harvard crew teams will have their first competitions this weekend.
Tomorrow, the men’s lightweight crew and women’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams compete in their first races since the fall season.
The women’s heavyweight crew will have its hands full with Tulsa, as the visitors are coming off a great performance at the Oklahoma Invitational. The Golden Hurricanes swept all three of their varsity races against SMU in a strong start to the spring season.
The men’s lightweight crew team faces off against Delaware at 9:12 am tomorrow.  The Blue Hen squad is actually not a varsity sport at Delaware, and so the Crimson will race against the Blue Hen club team this weekend.
Another water sport that has a busy weekend ahead is sailing, which has four races this weekend. The sailing team faces off for two coveted awards this weekend: the Women’s Toni Deutsch Trophy at MIT and the Harry Anderson Trophy. Besides these two races, the squad will race in the Boston University Invitational and the 82nd-annual Boston Dinghy Club Cup.
Following with the aquatic theme, the women’s water polo team squares off against Wagner this Sunday at 2 pm.  After a tough spring break during which the Crimson lost five of six games, Harvard hopes to capitalize with a win over the Seahawks, an opponent Harvard beat twice last year.
A team having much more success this season is men's lacrosse, which travels to Dartmouth tomorrow. The Crimson has started out the season at 5-1 for one of the best starts in program history.
It will be interesting to see how several Crimson squads performance this weekend with the added stress of classes starting up after the break.

Pulling an all-nighter can not only help you study for a test, but can also create euphoric feelings the next day. So says a study produced by a team of researchers including Harvard Medical School Associate Professor Seung-Schik Yoo.
Of course, it's not all good news if you are used to staying up all night. Other studies by Yoo's group, led by UC Berkeley Associate Professor Matthew P. Walker, have found that lack of sleep can also cause extreme negative emotions and other problems.
The most recent study by Yoo's group involved depriving one group of subjects of sleep for 36 hours and then showing them visual stimuli. The results were surprising. "For those people who didn't get enough sleep, they evaluated the [neutral images] more positively," Yoo said. In short, normal events created exaggerated emotional reactions in sleep-deprived subjects.
To be clear, the study does not recommend skipping sleep as a responsible course of action. Not only are the euphoric reactions short-lived, but the researchers say that sleeplessness has several other negative consequences.
For instance, lack of sleep harms your memories of events. "We know that episodic memory has been altered, and [sleep-deprived subjects] cannot remember as much as people who sleep normally," Yoo said.
More ominously, college students may be at risk for long-term brain damage if they consistently skimp on sleep. Yoo noted the brain's neural plasticity—its ability to adapt to new situations. If the brain is consistently deprived of slumber for an extended period of time, Yoo said, it may adapt to that state and be permanently altered.
"In a chronic state of sleep deprivation, like a student who cannot get enough sleep—it's definitely going to alter the brain in the long term," Yoo said.
In the end, despite the possibility of positive emotions, the takeaway for college students is mostly a downer: that all-nighter might cause euphoria (and a completed problem set), but enough of them could theoretically result in brain damage. Scary stuff.

You know it's not official until it's Facebook official. Well then, it's official: Mark Zuckerberg is taken. The Daily Mail reported that the notoriously private Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and one of Harvard's most famous (and richest!) dropouts, finally updated his relationship status to "In a relationship," seven years since he first began dating Priscilla Chan '07.
Chan concentrated in Biology and is currently pursuing an M.D. at the University of California, San Francisco. The Braintree, MA native met Zuckerberg, then a sophomore, while waiting in line for the bathroom at an Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity party. They've weathered the storm together ever since. Apparently, Zuckerberg's infamous Facemash project didn't faze Chan—they started dating just days after he was notified that he would face the Administrative Board for the controversial website. However, Chan did reportedly draw up a contract delineating rules and expectations of their relationship due to Zuckerberg's workaholic nature.

B.good wants to help you work up an appetite, quite literally, at their burger mile tomorrow.
In order to raise money for Back on My Feet, a nonprofit organization that promotes self-sufficiency among residents of homeless shelters, b.good is hosting a community mile-long jog with free burgers for all participants. The run starts at 3 p.m. at the b.good in Harvard Square.
No advance sign-up is necessary. Just show up ready to run and ready to eat. "It's open to anybody and everybody," said Jon J. Olinto, co-owner and co-founder of b.good. "We want everybody to come out."
The event also hopes to raise awareness for b.good's marathon team, The Burger Brigade. The team, that includes 10 Harvard students, will don burger and fry costumes to run the Boston Marathon on April 18.
"The coolest part about it is each student [on the team] that crosses that finish line raises 1,800 bucks," Olinto said. "That sum represents the cost of taking a guy from a shelter and running him through the entire program. It'll get him started on his life and being productive."
