Many Americans probably don’t know this, but the Philippines starts celebrating Christmas in September. That is when the carols start playing on the radio and shops begin putting up sales displays featuring stockings and snow (tropically-adapted snow, of course, since September brings 80 degree weather). The festivities build up to December 24, when the classic Filipino tradition is for large families to gather, exchange kisses and hugs, and eat. This get-together is called a “Noche Buena,” though “Food Fest” or “Guess Which Cousin is Which” would be more apt.
There are only three things that I can be certain will make an appearance at our family’s annual Christmas Eve gathering:
1) Our cook’s revered lasagna, with the words “Merry X-Mas” written in ketchup above the topmost layer of cheese. 
2) My cousin’s dogs, aptly named Peewee and Poo (you can guess why).
3) Bottles upon bottles of all kinds of wine.
Everything else—including which relatives from our gigantic extended family actually show up—is always a gamble.
This year, my family thought releasing wish lanterns into the sky at midnight would add a little more spice to the event. My cousin had bought some paper lanterns for 50 pesos apiece (a little over a dollar), which could float away with the help of a “small” flame. Of course, small flames can eventually become big flames (standard science here), so I was a little worried about the fire hazard. See, my family doesn’t have a very good track record with fire, and the fact that the instructions were in Japanese didn’t help. But mother persisted, so I obliged.
The first lantern we sent off was pretty. I thought to myself that maybe we could pull this off without a hitch—maybe we could even release many at the same time!
The second lantern we sent off, however, was not as well-formed as the first one was. In fact, its top-left corner was sagging as it floated away, and just before it cleared our fence—our bamboo fence, I might add—the paper frame caught fire. In a blink, the entire lantern was ablaze. I heard several gasps. An officer on patrol started barking into his walkie-talkie, probably for a fire truck. My grandmother turned her face away so she didn’t have to watch what we all expected would happen next.
But, miraculously, the lantern dropped to the ground just inches from anything flammable, missing the bamboo fence, the tarp covering our dining area, and a bunch of bushes. No one moved as what was left of it floated to the ground. Everyone just watched the flames die out, mouths hanging open. It was a regular Christmas miracle.
My little brother laughed first, then my uncle laughed, and, finally, I laughed. Both humored and relieved, everyone turned to each other and started wishing one another a Merry Christmas. Uncles were drunk, I had gained a few pounds, and we were probably going to be fined by the village police for setting fire hazards into the sky, but it was Christmas with my crazy family and the “noche” couldn’t be anymore “buena.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three goals by Princeton forward Andrew Calof led the Tigers over the Harvard men's hockey team, 3-2, on Friday night at Hobey Baker Rink. The loss was the third straight for the Crimson squad, which hasn't seen victory since beating then-No.10 Cornell on Nov. 16 at Lynah Rink, 4-1, on national television.
Harvard (4-6-1, 3-4-0 ECAC) lacked offensive pressure through the contest, while Princeton (4-7-4, 3-3-3 ECAC) capitalized on the energy of its sold-out home crowd to outshoot the Crimson, 36 shots to 18. This was the first game this season in which the Tigers were able to win without scoring at least four goals.
“I thought we battled really hard in the second and the third [periods],” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Through the first period, I don’t think we were at our best, but in the second and third, I thought we played well. We had some chances [and] had two breakaways there in the third.”
Calof was the only member of his team to score during the game, finding the back of the net twice during regulation and once during overtime. 12 minutes and 20 seconds into the first period, the junior was assisted by sophomore defenseman Tom Kroshus and freshman forward Mike Ambrosia to blast the puck past Crimson junior goaltender Raphael Girard. Girard recorded 33 saves through the night, his third-highest number this season.
Calof registered eight shots during his effort for the night. His second goal came almost nine minutes into the second period from just beyond the top of the right circle with help from forwards Kyle Rankin and Jack Berger to put Princeton up, 2-0.
“[Calof is] a good player,” senior forward Marshall Everson said. “He’s quick, he’s smart, he’s real crafty. The key with a guy like that is you have to keep a body on him, keep him outside.... He’s one of those guys you’ve got to watch out for.”
Completing a hat trick, Calof’s third score was fatal for Harvard. Just under a minute into overtime, he came from behind the net to sneak the puck into the right corner of the net past Girard.
“The third goal was a clever play,” Donato said. “[Calof] threw it out from behind the goal line off our skate and he’s a talented enough guy that he did that by design. When you play against a guy that’s creative and scores goals, you have to limit his chances and we didn’t do enough of that tonight.”
The contest was Harvard’s second to continue past regulation this season. The Crimson has yet to win an overtime game this year.
Harvard found its first goal with under five minutes to go in the third period. After a quick save by Girard against Tiger freshman forward Jonathan Liau, the Crimson first line was able to effectively penetrate Princeton’s offensive zone. Forwards Alex Fallstorm and Colin Blackwell raced down the ice to pass to Everson, who drilled the puck past Tigers goaltender Sean Bonar.
Harvard was given just two opportunities for man advantage and was able to capitalize on one for a goal. During the second power play, 12 minutes and 50 seconds into the third period, two misses by Fallstorm allowed the senior, along with Everson, to assist Blackwell for Harvard’s second goal. Power plays have been problematic for the Crimson this season. Harvard has converted just four attempts out of 41 total this season, for a percentage of 9.8, the lowest in the ECAC.
Conversely, the Crimson was only short-handed twice through the game. The first penalty came on high sticking by sophomore forward Petr Placek while the second was off of hooking by freshman forward Greg Gozzo. The penalty kill unit continued to be consistent, denying Princeton during both attempts. The Tigers have only converted two of their last 18 opportunities on the power play. Harvard is now at 82.9 percent in penalty killing.
“Ultimately we’re trying to win hockey games,” Donato said. “We want to create more offensive chances. We have no excuses…. Our guys really fought back being down two-nothing. [They] came back and had a chance to get at least a point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After allowing three goals in less than three-and-a-half minutes, Union looked to reset with a timeout. But the 30-second break in the action merely gave Harvard's top line a breather.
Off the very next faceoff, Crimson co-captain Jillian Dempsey intercepted a Dutchwoman pass and tore across the blueline before slapping a shot past the left pad of Union goaltender Shenae Lundberg. The senior forward notched her second goal of the game to put the Harvard women's ice hockey team up six en route to a 9-0 rout of Union Friday night in Schenectady, N.Y.
In its first game of the new year, the Crimson (10-1-1, 8-0-0 ECAC) enjoyed its largest margin of victory in a shutout since 2006. With the win, Harvard improved its all-time series record versus the Dutchwomen (5-10-3, 0-6-3 ECAC) to 19-0-0.
"I think we came out strong, we finished strong and got better with each period," Crimson coach Katey Stone said. "It was a complete game."
After jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the first, Harvard caught fire in the second frame, scoring five unanswered markers—four in the first six minutes of the period.
Sophomore defender Michelle Picard opened the second period onslaught with her first career goal. Picard threaded a wrister over the right shoulder of Lundberg from inside the circle.
"[Picard] just works her tail off all the time," Dempsey said. "It was really nice to see that pay off with a goal."
Picard and Dempsey finished the night with game-high +5 ratings. Less than a minute after Picard's marker, Dempsey scored from a similar location on the rink to extend her point streak to 26 games.
Two and a half minutes later, a cross-rink lead pass from senior defender Kelsey Romatoski to Dempsey set up the Crimson's fifth goal of the game. The pass created a 2-on-1 in which Dempsey slid the puck to junior Lyndsey Fry, who buried it top-shelf.
Fry's first goal of the game prompted Union's timeout, but it took only five seconds after the next faceoff for a Crimson player to find the back of the net--this time Dempsey with an assist credited to Fry.
"[Dempsey] is relentless; she hunts pucks down," Stone said. "She jumps into spaces; she has a great feel for what's going on. It was great to see her take some quick-release shots tonight."
Dempsey finished with a game-high five points. The Winthrop, Mass., native leads the NCAA in goals per game (1.33) and ranks second in points per game (2.5).
For the final tally of the second period, Dempsey and Fry connected once more. Fry poke-checked the puck away from Union's Rebecca Babiak and ahead to Dempsey, who spun around to feed Fry in the crease. Fry deked around Union back-up goalie Madeleine Dahl for her ninth goal of the season.
"The cool thing about [Dempsey] and I playing together is that it doesn't really matter who puts it away," said Fry, who ranks seventh in the nation with 1.73 points per game. "We've been good about finding each other, and we are able to see each other and make plays all over the ice."
The Crimson bookended the second period with a pair of two-goal frames.
The Crimson controlled the game from the start, outshooting the Dutchwomen, 12-3, in the first period.
Freshman forward Miye D'Oench struck first for Harvard just over eight minutes into the game. D'Oench collected a rebound from teammate Mary Parker and banked the puck off Lundberg's backside with a quick tap from behind the goal line.
With less than four minutes left in the first, sophomore forward Samantha Reber put the Crimson up two with a wrist shot that clanged off the post and into the back of the net. Reber stole the puck in the neutral zone and carried it past the opposing blueline for the unassisted mark.
The third period saw the first NCAA goal for freshman defender Abigail Harris, who snapped a quick shot from the faceoff circle between two Union defenders after carrying the puck into the offensive zone. Freshman third-string goaltender Molly Tissenbaum also made waves for the Crimson in the third period, making a couple key stops to preserve the shutout while Stone rested co-captain starter Laura Bellamy for the final frame.
"It's awesome when we're able to get everybody out on the ice in a game like this," Fry said. "It's so great to just roll the lines and have everybody playing. It makes it so much more fun as a team."
Romatoski made it 9-0 with less than six minutes left. By the final horn, Harvard had outshot the Dutchwomen, 42-13, and registered its fifth shutout of the season.
As she nears the midway point of her final NCAA regular season, Dempsey is pleased with the attitude and effort of her squad.
"We want to be the hardest-working team in the country. We don't want anybody to ever outwork us or outhustle us," Dempsey said. "That's huge because it doesn't take any talent or skill for that kind of play [tonight]; it's all about effort. The energy today was great."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off of a one-point loss on the road to a heavily favored St. Mary’s squad, the Harvard men’s basketball team kicked off the New Year in dominant fashion against non-conference competitor Rice, claiming a 92-62 victory Saturday at Lavietes Pavilion.
“We’re very pleased to have a chance to bounce back after an up-and-down road trip that we had out West,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought our kids really invested in the opportunity and played well here today.”
With 13:15 to play in the first half, the Owls (3-10) crawled within three points of the Crimson (8-5), as Rice’s Austin Ramljak knocked down two free throws. But Harvard quickly responded and extended its lead, headed by an impressive shooting effort from junior co-captain Laurent Rivard.
After a scoreless stretch of 3:27 and 10:52 left in the opening frame, Rivard knocked down his first of five three-pointers on the night, initiating a 15-2 Harvard run that put his team up, 28-12, with 7:25 left in the half.
“[Rivard] is such a big weapon for us, and he always has been,” Amaker said. “I think he got into a good rhythm.”
From there the Crimson was able to maintain its stride, eventually blowing out the visiting Owls by a 30-point margin. Before Saturday’s contest, Harvard’s season high points total was just 79—a solid 13 points below its mark against Rice.
“Intensity on the defensive end and keeping going for 40 minutes are some things we didn’t do at St. Mary’s,” Rivard said. “But today we did, and we kept our lead.”
At the close of the first half—a period in which the Crimson hit 61.5 percent of its shots from the field—Harvard had amassed a 43-21 advantage.
The Owls shot just 25 percent in the opening frame, with leading scorer Tamir Jackson—who averages 17.5 points—ending the period with just four points. Jackson finished the contest shooting 4 of 12 from the field for a total of 14 points.
“That’s what we talked about…how much we were going to invest and commit to play well, and I think we did that very well defensively,” Amaker said. “The second half shooting percentage went up for them dramatically from the first half, but I thought overall our defense was outstanding.”
After two consecutive scores from sophomore Jonah Travis to start the second frame, Rice never came closer than a 23-point deficit, and the Crimson was able to stretch its heavy advantage to 30 before the end of the game.
“We need to find a rhythm here with our team,” Amaker said. “I think we were able to do that very nicely here this afternoon and gain a bit of confidence as we do things over stretches. It was important for us to feel like we played a very good 40 minutes of basketball today.”
Rivard and sophomore wing Wesley Saunders paced all scorers on the night, contributing 21 points apiece, while sophomore Kenyatta Smith posted a career-high 11 points for the Crimson, shooting four of four from the field and three of five from the free-throw line.
“Kenyatta Smith, in his minutes off the bench, was quality,” Amaker said. “He performed nicely for us, blocked shots, and scored on the interior.”
After just five minutes of play, rookie point guard Siyani Chambers—who ended the contest with a double-double on 14 points and a career-high 10 assists—had already amassed three assists, as Harvard knocked down its first six shots of the game. But despite his prowess in most aspects of the game Saturday afternoon, Chambers had a game-high six turnovers.
“As always, obviously, he’s shooting the ball very well, finishing at the free throw line, and just orchestrating the whole thing for the team,” Rivard said. “He turned the ball over, but that’s expected. He has the ball in his hand for most of the game.”
Although Harvard posted an impressive 20 assists to the Owls’ seven, the Crimson turned the ball over 17 times—just one fewer giveaway than Rice.
“I was not happy with how many times we turned the ball over,” Amaker said. “But certainly we got everybody in, a lot of guys played important minutes.”
The Crimson boasted a balanced scoring effort on the night, with 10 of the 11 players who saw action adding at least one point in the victory.
“It’s nice when you invest in something and get the kind of return you expect or you feel you deserve,” Amaker said. “I know Rice is missing a few pieces to their puzzle. It’s been a tough stretch for their team and their program, but we focused on us today, on how we were going to regroup and respond.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the calendar closes in on the anniversary of Linsanity, Jeremy Lin ’10 had eight points and seven assists as the Houston Rockets dispatched the Milwaukee Bucks, 115-101 Friday. With Lin at the helm, the Rockets score the most points in the NBA, at 106.1 per game, and are sixth in the league in assists, at 23 per contest, led by Lin’s 6.4 a game. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the 11th game in which the Rockets have scored 115 or more points this season. No other team in the NBA has more than seven such games.
Lin left the game with 10:34 left in the third quarter after colliding with Bucks forward Larry Sanders in a scramble for a loose ball near midcourt. He sat out for only seven minutes before getting stitches and coming back into the game. Lin added four assists and four points in a pivotal fourth quarter, during which the Rockets scored 38 points and quickly turned a six-point advantage into a comfortable 14-point lead.
“I just know that when I came back, our guys were flying around with high energy,” Lin said in his postgame press conference. “We were getting stops, just the way we’re supposed to play, the way that we’ve played in the past in some spurts. And then we just tried to carry it over to the fourth quarter.”
Lin recorded four steals for the third time in four games and contributed seven or more assists for the fifth game in a row. After starting the season slow, Lin has come on to score in double figures in six of his last ten games and in that span has contributed six or fewer dimes only twice.
Over that same span, the Rockets have gone 8-2 with their only two losses coming to the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs—two top teams in the Western Conference. Along the way, the Rockets posted double-digit wins against the Chicago Bulls, Memphis Grizzlies, New York Knicks, and Philadelphia 76ers—all playoff teams from a year ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final non-conference matchup of the season, the Harvard women’s basketball team will travel to Kingston, R.I. on Sunday to take on the Rhode Island Rams.
Rhode Island (5-9) enters the contest on a three-game losing streak, including a loss to a Providence squad that the Crimson defeated earlier this season. Harvard has bested the Rams in each of their last three meetings.
“I think it’s going to be a good game for us,” senior forward Victoria Lippert said. “We’re continuing to get better and better. We’re practicing, learning, and growing, so I think this game is more about us, and I think that if we play well, we’re going to get the win.”
The Crimson (8-5) enters the matchup coming off a decisive, 85-59 victory over Massachusetts on Wednesday. Harvard never fell behind in the game, amassed its highest scoring total of the year, and gave up its third-smallest point total of the season.
The victory over the Minutewomen snapped a season-high three-game losing streak.
“We were definitely angry after those losses, so we were very motivated to come back and play well,” Lippert said. “I don’t think we played a perfect game against UMass, but I think we were able to execute better and play better defense at some points.”
Junior guard Christine Clark scored her 1,000th career point in the win, a milestone that only 17 players in program history have reached. Clark finished with a team-high 19 points.
Following a 20-point performance in a loss to Southern Methodist, Lippert tallied 17 points against the Minutewomen. Lippert, who has moved into tenth place on the program’s all-time scoring list, has totaled at least 15 points in five of her last seven games.
Clark, Lippert, and sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle have served as the main cogs of the Crimson offense this season, as the trio has accounted for nearly 60 percent of the team’s scoring. Fagbenle was recently named the Ivy League Player and Rookie of the Week, and she captured both awards just two weeks ago as well.
“[Those three girls] are a lot of fun to play with,” co-captain forward Miriam Rutzen said. “They work hard on both ends of the floor, they’re great scorers, and we love to feed them the ball so they can take it to the hole. As long as they keep doing that, and as long as we keep supporting them and backing them up with offensive rebounds, then we’ll have a great year.”
Senior forward Emma Golen has also emerged as a legitimate three-point threat. Golen ranks first in the Ancient Eight, shooting 53.3 percent from behind the arc.
A wealth of different options has helped Harvard post impressive offensive numbers all year.
The Crimson leads the Ivy League in scoring, with 69.5 points per game, and has also posted a conference-best 45.2 field goal percentage.
The Rams, on the other hand, have struggled to put points on the board. The team has scored more than 60 points only twice this year.
“[This game] is going to be a great opportunity for us to show our defensive grit versus a team we know we can outperform,” Rutzen said. “We don’t want to give them one of their better nights. So if we can hold them below their scoring average, we know we will have proved something.”
A young team, Rhode Island has six freshmen on its roster and only four players who have completed their sophomore years. The Rams are coming off a 94-53 loss to Northeastern, the team’s largest margin of defeat all season.
Rhode Island has employed a balanced attack on offense so far this year, as its top three scorers all average within two points of each other. Freshman guard Tayra Melendez leads the team with 10.6 per game.
Freshman forward Samantha Tabakman has also been an important presence for the Rams in the paint. Tabakman, who has come off the bench for much of the season, puts up 9.1 points per game and averages a team-best 7.9 rebounds.
Sunday’s matchup will conclude the first half of the season for Harvard, and will provide the Crimson with a chance to pick up steam for its next fourteen contests against Ancient Eight foes.
“Every game in the Ivy League counts, and there’s not an opportunity to redeem mistakes once you get into league play,” Rutzen said. “One game can make or break your chances at the NCAA Tournament. I think knowing that and having had an up-and-down non-conference season has prepared us really well for the intensity of the Friday and Saturday game-in, game-out competition to get us to our final goal of Ivy League champions.”

Former Congressman Barnett "Barney" Frank '61-'62, who just retired from politics after representing Massachusetts’ Fourth District on Capitol Hill for 32 years, wants back in.
Speaking on the MSNBC show Morning Joe Friday morning, Frank said he had called Governor Deval L. Patrick '78 to ask for a chance to serve as interim replacement to Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, whom Obama has nominated as Secretary of State. Kerry is expected to be confirmed easily by the Senate.
Frank, who made financial reform his top priority during his final years as a Congressman, was blunt during the interview in his explanation for why he wants the Senate position.
"A few weeks ago, I said I wasn't interested. It was kind of like, you're about to graduate and they said, 'you've got to go to summer school.' But that [fiscal cliff] deal now means that February, March, and April are going to be among the most important months in American financial history," Frank told the MSNBC anchors.
Patrick remained non-committal about Frank’s prospects but still complimented the outgoing Congressman during a press conference Friday.
"Congressman Frank is a really gifted legislator, and he'd be a great Senator," Patrick said.
Patrick likely will not name an interim replacement until after Kerry is confirmed. Massachusetts will then hold a special election as early as June to select a permanent replacement to fulfill the remainder of Kerry’s term.
Not only did both Frank and Patrick graduate from the College, but they also each hold a degree from Harvard Law School. If appointed, Frank would join a growing Harvard contingent in the Senate, which includes former Law School professor Elizabeth Warren and six graduates of the College.
Patrick is said to be considering numerous other candidates to replace Kerry, among them Vicki Kennedy, widow of longtime Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56.
