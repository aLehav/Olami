After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is just as well that the United States didn’t send a team to the World Cup, because it’s been incredibly hard this summer to cheer on America in the international sphere.
I’m not the only one feeling dejected. A July Gallup poll revealed that just 47 percent of Americans were “extremely proud” to be American—the lowest percentage recorded in the 17 years that this question has been asked.
However, Republicans are generally prouder than Democrats, and this year the gap widened to 74 percent of Republicans being “extremely proud,” compared to just 32 percent of Democrats. Right-wing political analysis of the situation often portrays dissatisfied left-wingers as unpatriotic and shortsighted. One conservative columnist lamented, “Democrat pride hinges on politics while Republican pride transcends circumstance.”
It is immature not to be proud of America just because one doesn’t support the current president. The greatest things about America were fostered long before our current political parties came into existence. As the national anthem, written in 1814, declares, America is the “land of the free.” As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in 1862, “America is another word for Opportunity.” Individual freedoms and opportunity remain two of the ideals that Americans believe make this country stand out. The patriotism inspired by these ideals should transcend party politics.
Unfortunately, the most demoralizing stories of this summer, the ones that most damage the American reputation, aren’t political either. There are no sides to take on separating families at the border and detaining children. There are no sides to take between America, our own country, and Russia. The worry that the American government’s actions this summer are devaluing what it means to be American does transcend politics, because the issues at hand should be too basic to be politicized.
I would think that being a proud American means believing in and championing freedom, dignity, and decency. As Eleanor Roosevelt wrote in 1962, “True patriotism springs from a belief in the dignity of the individual, freedom, and equality not only for Americans but for all people on earth.” Ronald Reagan said in 1985 that one of the principles that makes America great is “compassion for the others.”
But those ideals are dealt a blow when America forcibly separates families and detains children at the border. When, in a startling display of ineptitude and cold-heartedness, the government still can’t find many of the parents to reunite. This isn’t a debate about immigration policies, like the legal standards of asylum or the number of refugees that should be accepted. This is a horrifying turn of events that I would be aghast to see this perpetrated in other countries. But this is now happening in America, and America is a worse place for it.
But set aside even this moral issue. At the very least, I would think that being a proud American of any political background means defending America. According to the New Oxford American Dictionary, the definition of a “patriot” is someone who “vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors.” Or, in more self-centered terms that might appeal more directly to our president: As President Calvin Coolidge said, patriotism means “looking out for yourself by looking out for your country.”
Yet bewilderingly, it feels like President Donald Trump is rooting and even playing for a different team. Though his campaign slogan was “America First,” his words belie a “Russia First” mentality. Over the word of the American intelligence community, at the July 16 Helsinki summit, Trump essentially accepted Vladimir Putin’s denial of Russian interference in American elections. His excuse, that he was confused by a double negative, and his response of “no” to whether Russia is still interfering, do not inspire more confidence in his desire to defend America’s interests. Leaving our elections vulnerable means leaving vulnerable America’s legacy and claim to be leader of the free world.
So of course it is a shame that so many people are not as proud to be American as they once were. It would be a shame too if this decrease was completely explained by partisanship and the inability to celebrate those on the other side of the political aisle. But I don’t think it is. Right-wing oversimplifications of this decrease are obscuring the alarmingly rapid erosion of America’s standing in the world and the deviation from the ideals put forth by great American historical figures.
Nevertheless, though I can’t say I’m “extremely proud,” I’m far from “not at all proud” of being American. I take solace in the fact that there are still so many people in our nation who make me proud to be an American. I’d like to think that this isn’t partisan — for example, those who serve in the military and those who kneel at the anthem are both inspiring. Ultimately, reversing this downturn of patriotism is not a spectator sport. If those at the top are damaging this country’s good name, it is the other Americans that will have to make up the difference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council plans to sponsor “community conversations” focused on diversity in response to a viral video that depicted a Harvard employee asking a neighbor with a biracial daughter if she lived in affordable housing.
The conversations will center around “community values” and will allow residents to discuss “interactions that are rooted in privilege, classism, and racism,” Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern wrote in a Facebook post Monday. Cambridge City Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui will lead the conversations.
In his post, McGovern wrote that Harvard Humanitarian Initiative Executive Director Theresa A. Lund’s actions in the short video are “an example of classism and racism.” The video shows Lund telling her neighbor Alyson Laliberte that she and her daughter are making too much noise. Lund proceeds to ask Laliberte where she lives in “one of the affordable units” or “one of the Harvard units.”
“Racism and classism is not just something that happens ‘somewhere else’,” McGovern wrote. “The truth is that even here in Cambridge, we have much work to do.”
On Thursday night, HII director Michael J. VanRooyen announced in a Facebook post that Lund was on leave “effective immediately.” He wrote the organization “does not condone” what Lund said to Laliberte in the video.
In her Facebook post, Laliberte called Lund “another Permit Patty,” alluding to a recent set of incidents in which white adults have confronted or called the police on black children performing ordinary activities. The video has received more than 1 million views and drawn widespread censure online.
Lund has apologized publicly, writing on Facebook that her conduct was “inappropriate and wrong.” Lund also apologized to Laliberte and her daughter in person, per her Facebook post.
In an interview, McGovern said he knows the diversity conversations will not fix everything.
“This is not something that we’re going to have four or five conversations and all of a sudden Cambridge is going to be a utopia of a place,” he said. “This takes an incredible amount of time but we’re not going to ignore it.”
Siddiqui said the community conversations are in part meant specifically to reduce the frequency of incidents like the exchange between Lund and Laliberte.
“Our goal is to shift people’s mindsets and to think, ‘This is the impact you have when you make a statement like that and when you ask a question like that,’” she said. “This is something that happens. It’s happened to me, it’s happened to a lot of folks on a daily basis. People who don’t face this regularly don’t know it happens.”
Siddiqui and McGovern have not decided on the number or format of the fall 2018 conversations, both said, but will do so in coming weeks. McGovern said some of his preliminary ideas include town hall meetings, panels, and expert speakers. Siddiqui said her office plans to release more information about the discussions in a few days.
It will be key to “bring the universities in” to the conversations, McGovern said. He said the forums could help Harvard grapple with the question of how to educate its employees, who are sometimes “in a very different position” from local residents.
Harvard spokespeople did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facebook suspended Crimson Hexagon — a data analytics company founded by University professor Gary King— last week, claiming the group may have violated Facebook policies in its analysis of site data for the U.S. government and for a Russian nonprofit linked to the Kremlin.
During the suspension, Facebook will investigate how Crimson Hexagon collects, shares, and stores user data. The suspension and investigation were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Crimson Hexagon, located in Boston, pulls and analyzes public Facebook data for third-party clients. Russian non-profit Civil Society Development Foundation paid the company to study Russians’ opinions of the regime of Vladimir Putin — and, last month, Crimson Hexagon forged a contract with the U.S. State Department for more than $240,000, the Journal reported.
Facebook did not approve the government contracts in advance and does not do much to monitor what the company does with user data, according to the Journal.
Ime Archibong, the vice president of product partnerships at Facebook, announced her company’s investigation of Crimson Hexagon in a statement Friday.
“Facebook has a responsibility to help protect people's information,” Archibong wrote.
Facebook spokesman Jay Nancarrow wrote in an email that, as of July 27, the investigation had not unearthed evidence that Crimson Hexagon obtained Facebook or Instagram data “inappropriately.” Nancarrow added that developers are not allowed to build surveillance tools using Facebook and Instagram information.
Crimson Hexagon’s chief technology officer Chris Bingham wrote in a blog post Friday that the company only collects publicly available social media data. Bingham wrote in a statement that Crimson Hexagon is working with Facebook “to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.”
King, the director of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard and chairman of Crimson Hexagon, founded the company in 2007 with Harvard Business School graduate Candace Fleming. King, who did not respond to requests for comment, told the Journal that “he has never been involved in the firm’s day-to-day operations.”
The suspension comes as King is separately working with Facebook to conduct a research project meant to help determine the platform’s impact on elections and democracies. That project, dubbed Social Science One, will grant a team of academic researchers unprecedented access to Facebook’s anonymized user data. King is pursuing the project solely in his capacity as an academic and Social Science One has no affiliation with Crimson Hexagon.
The Crimson Hexagon inquiry is one of myriad ongoing investigations into third-party apps that use Facebook data. Earlier this year, Facebook CEO and Harvard dropout Mark E. Zuckerberg testified for hours before Congress following revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm connected to President Donald Trump’s campaign, used the data of roughly 87 million Facebook users without their explicit permission.
The swirling concerns over user privacy may be taking their toll on the social media giant once touted as invincible. Facebook shares fell 19 percent Thursday, the largest one-day dip the company has ever faced. The drop came after the company reported poor second-quarter earnings in part due to increased spending on privacy and security.
