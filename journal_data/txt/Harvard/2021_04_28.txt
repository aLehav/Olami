After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Institute of Politics, like any public service organization, should seek to serve its constituents: in the IOP’s case, that means Harvard College undergraduates. A recent Crimson investigation, however, has unveiled a rather unfortunate irony. The institute tasked with studying political leadership, housed in the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, has been plagued by its own host of leadership controversies, the consequences of which are ultimately harming the very undergraduates whom the organization is intended to serve.
The reviews of the internal culture are damning: Students and former staffers cite that a “chronically short-staffed” IOP has created a harmful “culture of overwork” in recent years. Undergraduates often put more than 20 hours of unpaid work per week into the organization, breeding an environment of exhaustion and effectively barring lower-income students from participation.
Even worse, at the beginning of this month, Emily S. Brother ’19, who served as an IOP staff assistant, wrote a public letter claiming that she was forced out of the institute after raising concerns “about staff and student labor and employment practices, gender-based harassment, racial microaggressions, and financial accessibility.” The allegation that Brother’s very serious concerns were met with a termination date — rather than by an urgent investigation by the IOP — is noteworthy and incredibly troubling in and of itself.
And finally, the IOP’s shortcomings are also reflected in the institute’s neglect of its public-facing programming responsibilities. Students have observed that the organization is losing its undergraduate focus, instead unduly elevating graduate priorities. Former U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy ’80 — the daughter of President John F. Kennedy ’40, to whom the IOP is dedicated — also claimed that the IOP’s discussions have been lacking in vibrance, diversity, and the provocation of thought.
A former IOP student president attributed some of these concerning culture problems to the IOP’s executive leadership having different priorities than its undergraduate students. A governing body whose goals are not aligned with those of its constituents? An easy recipe for a leadership failure.
Looking into the turmoil within the governing body of the IOP unveils why undergraduates’ experiences are suffering. Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf has exerted more power over the Senior Advisory Committee, the bipartisan group of public servants tasked with steering the institute, than his predecessors: Most troublingly, critics claim that Elmendorf has endeavored to reserve power over the institute’s finances, and that he has sought to change the IOP’s governing structure by strengthening his own control over the selection of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee members.
Elmendorf’s impositions upon the Senior Advisory Committee have led many of its members to resign in frustration — including, most notably, Caroline Kennedy, who served as its honorary chair. Her departure marks a breach in the dying wishes of her uncle, U.S. Sen. Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54-’56, who had wanted a direct descendant of his brother, the former president, to continue to lead the committee.
Caroline Kennedy’s resignation is a clear red flag, and we, too, find Harvard extending its reach in these ways to be alarming. We share in the concerns of IOP members who speculate that these dynamics threaten to crush what has historically been the “independent spirit” of the institution.
However, we remain unconvinced that the IOP’s original governing structure was perfect to begin with. It’s peculiar that Harvard’s Institute of Politics, dedicated to promoting greater understanding between the “academic world and the world of politics and public affairs” at large, is so deeply intertwined with a specific political dynasty. We know all too well that, for any institution, there exist ugly side effects of excessive reliance on huge donors: most fundamentally, they often expect something in return, creating conflicts of interest from a strictly academic perspective, as well as from a political one.
But shifting back to what matters — life for the students on the ground — there are tangible improvements that can be made, regardless of who makes them. For one, the organization should begin to pay dedicated student laborers for the work that they do, a measure that some student leaders have already called for.
Beyond that, increasing staff and faculty diversity might serve to alleviate some of the concerns surrounding issues like gender-based harassment and racial microaggressions at the IOP. While by no means a complete solution, welcoming and listening to advocates like Brother — instead of pushing them out — is an essential first step towards reckoning and reform.
Amidst these troubles, it holds true that the mission and opportunities offered by the IOP — such as the chance for students to learn through experience, and to engage with wondrous change-makers — remain inspiring, quintessential elements of the Harvard experience.
But at present, the IOP’s rousing vision is in danger. In fact, the IOP’s current state of disregard for student concerns and internal squabbling for the reigns of power is entirely antithetical to its founding mission. Until these issues are grappled with, the IOP will remain an ironic masterclass for the worst of government, not the best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I once sat in a breakout room for ten minutes, and after my smile and my “hey so…” at the start, no one said a word, or even appeared on the screen. Cameras were off, mics were muted — it was the breakout room nightmare.
That kind of conversational paralysis has not been isolated to that one class on Zoom, or in fact, to the virtual screen. That awkward, who-will-speak and what-will-we-speak-about standstill has seemed everywhere this pandemic year. Yes, I’ve been in breakouts where the 60-second countdown clock could not have popped up quicker, or on FaceTimes with a friend where we realized, right at the start, that we had nothing new to share. But I’ve also walked on the street, sort of recognized someone in their mask just as I forgot what class we had together, smiled hello, asked a question, and gotten nothing in return.
Conversations, even the pre-work breakout room type, require complementary maneuvers — demonstrated in questions and answers, or comments that piggyback on another. Humans build our discussions that way, with response layered upon response upon response. And when participants abdicate their roles, the interaction comes to a stop.
For many of us, or at least, for me, there is a natural inclination to vomit words into that silence, to jabber on and on until we get a reply or leave. But connections that get past the masks and Zoom rectangles first require small talk, and even that requires more than just one person.
I’ve had a few small talk successes. I once bonded with a stranger in the dining hall line over microwaved chocolate oat milk. I found that the necessary break-out room tone of voice is between enthusiasm and apathy — the kind that communicates “can you believe they’re making us do this … on Zoom?” in solidarity with the group.
Mostly, I’ll admit, I’ve failed — though I would argue that those losses were not all my fault. The pandemic infected and paralyzed our words, just as it did the same with our lives. We learned words like “Zoom fatigue” and “social distancing.” We used phrases like “I hope that you and your family are staying well” to open emails. We thought ad nauseam about the epic, unimaginable parts of life like death and what comes after — not exactly small talk material.
When I made attempts to avoid Covid-19 in conversation, I found that I could not. I tried chatting about hobbies or courses — but gave up when that ended with “wow, what a weird year …” and silence. For a memorable two weeks, I tried to learn and put into practice some classic sports talk. I had never been that good at it, but talking about games seemed like a low-stakes winner. Even sports trailed off into “wow, unprecedented …” And once a conversation has finished that way, that’s the end of that. Pandemic losses are critical “large talk” material, but those same impacts frustrate the small talk that must come first.
We have an expression in my family that goes, “just making conversation.” It’s a useful one. Stuck in silence on a walk or at dinner or in front of the mirror brushing our teeth, I can turn to my sister and say whatever I want, whatever I think might inspire conversation. When the attempt fails, and our discussion does not progress, it’s not awkward. I can let her know that I was, really, “just making conversation” and try again.
The saying acts as a kind of reassurance that I had no hidden agenda aside from being friendly and passing the time. It works as a free pass from the anxiety of small talk — the clumsiness of throwing topic after topic into the void. Because if something should go wrong, and students in the breakout room blankly stare into their screens or the classmate in the mask pretends not to hear and leaves, it’s ok. You did your best. And who knows, the next conversation might go right.
I am, perhaps, too late for this semester, but not for our more in-person summer and fall. We all have months of connection-building to make up for, and I think we will need to give ourselves permission to get to it. Just make conversation. There’s a good chance that the person you met in the Zoom square next to you was always hoping that you would.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To not be liberal at Harvard is to be unacceptable. In your classrooms, in your conversations, you are intellectually illegitimate, your contributions having little value compared to your progressive peers. It’s easy to feel like you don’t belong anywhere when your thoughts don’t belong anywhere. And yet, to my non-liberal peers, and to all the future students of Harvard, I find myself sharing a hopeful message: If you choose to share your non-mainstream views, you will be forced into the greatest education of your life.
There are, regrettably, problematic institutional and cultural issues at Harvard regarding intellectual diversity. The growing culture of self-censorship is being pushed by an unintelligible and untenable “woke” standard. Students and faculty filter everything they say. We are becoming intellectually homogeneous, despite important and necessary strides in socio-economic and racial diversity. Harvard’s pool of thought is shrinking, and thus, its quest towards Veritas is impaired, hindered by the self-indulgence of the ideological mainstream.
Through this column, I have articulated the culmination of many issues I have witnessed at Harvard. Along the way, my writing has been propelled by the frustration I had about Harvard’s trajectory. Was I the only one feeling this way? Much of my frustration flowed from a place of hopelessness for an academic institution I truly love and respect. At the same time, I feared the high social cost of saying something unpopular or of being misconstrued.
So I pondered every word, researched every statement, and reviewed my pieces fervently and even anxiously. I was forced to hone my opinions and speak deliberately. Given Harvard’s overwhelmingly progressive environment, this is not a necessity for students that think in the mainstream.
But, to my great surprise, with each article, each illustration of frustration, I saw glimmers of hope. Students of all partisan bents, professors of all disciplines, reached out to offer their quiet support, their acknowledgment. My fears of being “canceled,” of being socially shunned, did not come to fruition. I was met with respectful debate or (private) agreement.
And even then, I still worried about speaking out on my own. I needed a space where Harvard’s social cost melted away for me to truly refine, change, and articulate my ideas.
I learned that always being at odds is only possible with a network of friendship. Despite my many differences with the institution, the friends who have defined my four years here, embracing my differences, have enabled my time at Harvard to be positive and personally enriching, giving me a space when I thought there was none.
You can’t be an outsider with a friend, for it is just you and them, reckoning with each other’s triumphs, failures, flaws, and quirks. In fact, it’s your unique tendencies that make you a friend.
Michael Oakeshott, a conservative philosopher, wrote that friendship is inherently conservative in its tendency to savor someone for who they are in the present, quirks and all. He writes “to discard friends because they do not behave as we expected and refuse to be educated to our requirements is the conduct of a [person] who has altogether mistaken the character of friendship.”
A true friend, to Oakeshott, is not someone who “holds certain acceptable opinions” but someone that “engages the imagination, who excites contemplation, who provokes interest, sympathy, delight and loyalty simply on account of the relationship entered into.” Friends do not serve a purpose and do not conform to a standard; they are friends because they do neither. And you are a friend because you are attracted to this singularity: “One friend cannot replace another,” Oakeshott says.
Oakeshott encourages us to accept each other at face value, to not discredit someone for what they are not, but to celebrate them for what they are. But I will push him one step further: Yes, we should celebrate the present version of a friend, but we must be ready for that friendship to change us. Friendship is dynamic, transformative, even.
The greatest hope I have for change at Harvard, and the greatest gift it has given me, is friendship. Each and every one of my friends has pushed me in this column. From self-proclaimed Marxists, to free marketeers, to those indifferent to politics, my friends shared their wildly different viewpoints and backgrounds with me. They read my drafts, challenged my ideas, told me when I was wrong, and celebrated me when I was right. Each one helped shape the final product with their own unique approaches and views. What I feared would be a project that would alienate me from them, through late-night phone debates or conversations outside on warm days, turned into something that brought us all closer.
The feeling of safety in a friendship allowed me to have difficult conversations in which I could make mistakes and be challenged without fear of ostracization. In the end, I know that I was able to refine my views. What a joy it would be to have the same sense of mutual respect and collaboration in the classroom rather than the feeling of constant pressure to say the right (woke) thing.
So while Harvard gave me hostile classrooms and one-sided social norms, it also gave me my friends, the source of my greatest pride, my education, and my hope. If the Class of 2025 — Harvard’s most diverse class to date — is blessed with the friendships I’ve encountered, they will be able to openly learn from their differences, “exciting contemplation” in each other.
Though I have spent thousands of words in this column enumerating Harvard’s problems, I will take now to offer it a solution: sound friendship. Change begins on an interpersonal level when we give each other the margins to express ourselves, to make mistakes, to be corrected, to correct, and ultimately, to feel safe in growing. Friends help us find our Veritas.
Despite my frustrations, Harvard will be the most difficult goodbye I have ever faced because of the people that made sure I belonged. For Oakeshott writes, “What is esteemed is the present … Stay with me because I am attached to you.”
How I wish my friends could stay with me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 28, 2021 at 2:20 a.m.
Victor A. “Vic” Clay will serve as Harvard’s next chief of police, University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced in an email Tuesday afternoon, marking the conclusion to an eight-month long nationwide search for the next leader of the Harvard University Police Department.
Clay will leave a roughly 30-year career in law enforcement in Los Angeles to come to Cambridge, where he will begin his tenure at HUPD on July 26.
Currently, Clay serves as chief of campus security and parking services at the California Institute of Technology, a position he has held since June 2017. Previously, he was chief of campus safety at Occidental College in Los Angeles. In addition, he served with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for 28 years, where he was awarded a meritorious conduct medal for bravery in 1996.
Clay will take over Harvard’s police department during a national reckoning on racism in policing.
In an interview with the Harvard Gazette — a University-run publication — Clay said that he will bring his experience as a Black man in America to his leadership role.
“It’s a real thing to feel uncomfortable because I can’t trust that they understand my culture, and that they don’t profile or prejudge me,” Clay said. “We need to have a department that is attuned to these concerns, and better understands various points of view on past experiences with the police, good and bad.”
At Harvard, Clay will lead a police department that has been mired in controversy and transition over the past year.
Clay will replace interim chief Denis Downing, who assumed leadership after former chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley — who led HUPD for a quarter century — stepped down in 2020. Riley announced his retirement during widespread national calls for reform in policing and amid student demands for the department’s abolition. His retirement also followed an investigation by The Crimson that found repeated sexist and racist incidents inside the force spanning decades.
In August 2020, Lapp assembled a search committee consisting of 16 University affiliates to lead a search for Harvard’s new police chief.
Clay said in the interview he does not believe all public safety emergencies are “cop-worthy.”
“It’s so important that mental health resources be in place,” Clay said. “Police have limited resources, limited training, and limited time when managing incidents involving mental health crises. We can make sure the environment or scene is safe, but people trained in managing mental health issues need to take the lead on those types of incidents.”
Clay said he has experience implementing reforms in university police forces.
“Some of the immediate changes we made at Occidental were: including students in security planning, changing our uniforms to polo shirts and cargo pocket style patrol pants, and adjusting our patrol methods to one of guardianship versus rigid ‘letter of the law’ enforcement,” he said. “We partnered with student affairs and asked that they take a lead role in enforcing conduct violations, while we focused on crimes and investigations.”
In the emailed announcement, Bacow and Lapp urged affiliates to welcome Clay into the new role and to offer him “advice” and “support.”
“At a moment of national reckoning about the relationship between police departments and the communities they serve and protect, we are thrilled to welcome a leader who understands the challenges and opportunities of reimagining public safety,” they wrote.
Jennifer Howes, the assistant vice president for student affairs and wellness at Caltech, wrote in an email that Clay is a “working chief” who actively patrolled and acquainted himself with members of the Caltech community.
Howes wrote that Clay instituted a number of new policies to the security department he led, which helped avoid “unnecessary escalation” in response to some situations.
“Victor modernized and reinvigorated Caltech’s security department – including the implementation of a ranking structure that afforded leadership development opportunities to staff, the creation of an investigator position that works closely with the Title IX office, and the inception of the Special Response Officer program,” Howes wrote, referring to a set of officers specially trained in medical response.
HUPD has faced calls of abolition from University affiliates, which were re-sparked by HUPD’s presence at a Boston protest for racial justice last June, following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police.
Howes wrote that while Caltech has not often seen the same types of protests as other campuses, she believes Clay has been “very open” to discussions with student groups, staff, and administration on issues that concern them, such as “profiling and managing real or perceived threats.”
““I imagine he will spend time observing, listening, and inviting dialogue and real feedback from all members of the Harvard community, including from within the department, in order to set a course for reform,” she wrote.
Gregory E. Powell, II, a security technology administrator at Caltech and a colleague of Clay’s, wrote in an email that working with Clay has been an “absolute pleasure” and that Clay’s ability to connect with students will be useful as he institutes changes to HUPD.
“Chief Clay believes genuine reform starts by being a part of the community he serves and creating partnerships. Doing this brings a level of compassion that allows you to listen to student's concerns while establishing a clear path of communication,” Powell wrote. “As soon as the Harvard community can meet the man, Victor Clay, they will realize he is the right person for the task at hand.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Y2Y Harvard Square, a youth homeless shelter staffed by Harvard students, has continued to accommodate guests under modified protocols this semester despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, while also recruiting volunteers online and facilitating vaccine distribution for guests and staff.
Cecilia R. “CC” D’Arms ’21, a staff director at Y2Y, wrote in an email that operating the shelter during a pandemic has been challenging, though she added not much has changed since the fall semester. D’Arms said among the issues the shelter has faced are reduced guest capacity and restrictions on students allowed to staff the shelter, measures implemented last year as a Covid-19 precaution.
“Working at Y2Y during a pandemic has definitely been hard—it has not felt like as much of a student staff community, and we are serving fewer guests so the space is less vibrant,” D’Arms wrote.
E. Shea Hausman ’22, another Y2Y staff director, said in an interview that students who are currently able to staff Y2Y must be living off-campus.
“Y2Y is sort of considered an in-person activity,” Hausman said. “Due to the high Covid risk nature of the work, folks who are living on campus are not able to [work a] shift.”
Additionally, Y2Y has struggled to recruit first-year students who did not get a chance to participate as Y2Y volunteers before the pandemic, according to Hausman.
“So the majority of [staffers] are upperclassmen, just because we haven’t been able to recruit new people to work in person since freshmen were in dorms and folks who were in dorms couldn’t shift with us,” Hausman said.
She said, however, that the shelter has instituted online programming to engage first-years and other students living in University housing.
“We’ve been able to engage some underclassmen through remote programing. So right now, our case managers are available over Zoom for guests, which has been working out really smoothly,” Hausman said.
Y2Y is currently operated with a reduced number of beds for guests as a public health measure. Usually, the shelter is able to accommodate 27 guests — five of whom normally occupy cots for use in short-term, “emergency” housing — but capacity has now decreased to 22 guests. The shelter also now accommodates guests indefinitely, as opposed to the pre-Covid-19 system in which guests were granted beds through a lottery on a 30-day basis.
D’Arms, a former Crimson News editor, said as the vaccine rollout ramps up in Massachusetts, Y2Y has gained more leeway in how it operates.
“Staff have a little more flexibility on some things thanks to the vaccine. For example, we no longer have to wait as long before we turn over beds,” D’Arms wrote. “But most of our guidance from Harvard and [Massachusetts Department of Public Health] is still to go slow.”
Hausman said all guests and staffers were offered vaccines through the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program and that Y2Y has also instituted programming to inform guests of their vaccine eligibility and to clear up any questions that arise.
“I know our position has been working across multiple sites, often with the same population, in order to make sure folks know that it’s available to them, make sure they get all their questions answered,” she said.
Hausman added that despite its negative impact, the pandemic allowed Y2Y to reflect on the five years it has been operating and develop new programs to promote “guest autonomy.”
Though the College has announced it is planning to resume in-person operations in the fall, it remains unclear if student staffers who live on campus in the coming semester will be able staff Y2Y. D’Arms wrote that she is hopeful student staffers will be able to return.
“I’m really hoping we can return to a mostly student-run model next year if students are able to be in the dorms and shifting,” she wrote.

The Harvard Graduate School of Education released three new early literacy apps targeted at parents, caregivers and children last week, marking the first time HGSE has developed mobile apps for public use.
The three apps — called “Small Wonders”, “Photo Play”, and “Animal Antics” — comprised a project spanning multiple years of work and were developed by Reach Every Reader, a literacy initiative run by HGSE and several partner schools.
Three HGSE faculty led the apps project: senior lecturer Joseph H. “Joe” Blatt ’70, a senior lecturer on education; Meredith L. Rowe, a professor of early learning and development; and Paola Uccelli, a professor of education.
Blatt said motivations for the project included early literacy research by his colleagues Rowe and Uccelli and the desire to put students on more equal footing at the start.
“It would be a better strategy to have kids arrive at school more equally prepared to take advantage of learning, rather than try to solve problems of inequity,” Blatt said.
The team chose to develop apps in particular because access to technology is “essentially ubiquitous,” and apps are things “that everybody feels comfortable using,” Blatt said. The apps will be released on the Apple and Google app stores.
Blatt said time outside is necessary for children’s development, but these apps present an opportunity for screen time that is more productive than other digital options.
“We also want to encourage good foundations for learning, and especially for literacy,” Blatt said. “I think apps present an opportunity to bring parents and kids together for a good purpose — using technology in a smart way.”
Rowe said though phones have at times “distracted” parents from interacting with their children, the apps may also facilitate familial interactions.
“It’s one way to transform the phone into something that might lead to interaction rather than isolated playing,” Rowe said.
With the aim of accessibility, the apps are free to the public and do not require internet connectivity after installing. Additionally, the team designed them so they would not be specific to a particular culture, according to Blatt.
“We did, in the design process, try to concentrate on the sorts of situations — whether it’s in settings where the dialogue might take place, or game setups or so on — that would not be too culturally specific,” Blatt explained.
Though the apps are different in their approaches, Blatt said, they ultimately all aim to promote parent-child interaction.
“I mentioned that they’re three very different approaches, but the goal of all three is exactly the same, which is to promote lively, rich conversation between parent and child,” Blatt said. “That means that they’re essentially inexhaustible.”
Rowe said their tests show that children who used the apps with their parents for small portions of time improved their linguistic abilities in real time.
“Those children, when we went back after a few weeks, were using more complicated and interesting language when they used the app,” she explained.
Blatt pointed to the project as an example of HGSE bringing research into practice.
“I really believe that the Harvard Graduate School of Education is committed to translating research into practice that really makes a difference in the lives of children, young people and families,” Blatt said. “The fact that we were able to distribute these with the HGSE label literally right on the apps I think is an exciting way to share that commitment with the world.”
Rowe said it is crucial to remember that the apps were meant to build dialogue in a fun way.
“There shouldn’t be any stress involved,” Rowe said. “These [apps] were designed to be fun — to promote conversations between parents and kids.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister offered a bleak projection of the University’s finances in a Tuesday interview with The Crimson, forecasting that Harvard will experience its second consecutive year of declining revenues for the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Ever since Covid-19 upended the University’s operations, Harvard has struggled to balance its checkbook as it racks up pandemic-related expenses. The University’s revenue also dropped by $138 million in fiscal year 2020, for a net loss of $10 million, compared to a surplus of $308 million in 2019.
Hollister said he expects revenues to decline once more in 2021, although he declined to offer a specific estimate, citing uncertainty over revenues and expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year.
“It does look as if it’s highly likely we’ll have two years in a row of declining revenues,” Hollister said. “We haven’t seen that at the University since the depression in the 1930s.”
Hollister nonetheless praised the University’s decision to forgo layoffs of direct employees and furloughs altogether.
“A number of colleges and universities, unfortunately, had to resort to layoffs in higher education,” Hollister said. “At one point a year ago, roughly 30 million Americans had lost jobs, and Harvard, fortunately, has not had to have any job layoffs.”
“It’s a great credit to the entire Harvard community. Everyone has been terrific at managing our expenses, and that has made a huge difference,” he added.
Early on in the pandemic, University officials decided to offer an early retirement program to staff as a way to mitigate layoffs and cut costs, setting aside $71 million for the initiative. The program provided eligible staff who opted to retire early an additional benefit equal to one year of their wages.
Out of almost 1,600 eligible employees, nearly 700 staff members opted to retire early, according to a September 2020 letter from University President Lawrence S. Bacow, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp.
Hollister declined to comment on whether the University would continue other cost-cutting efforts such as discretionary spending cuts, hiring freezes, and reductions in capital spending.
“Budgeting for this year was an adventure for everyone, because there was so much uncertainty,” Hollister said. “We need to remain very careful, because it is so dynamic and uncertain still.”
While major capital projects such as the Adams House renewal remain on track, other initiatives across the University have been cut or slowed down, according to Hollister.
“Everyone has tried to reduce spending in every category including capital spending,” Hollister said. “There are dozens and dozens of projects across the university and in laboratories, in athletics, in classrooms — projects of all kinds.”
Hollister said the University expects its finances to improve as Harvard plans to welcome back faculty, staff, and researchers on Aug. 2, and students later that month.
“The schools and units are in the midst of budgeting right now for the coming year,” Hollister said. “Having more students on campus will be helpful to revenues such as tuition, and room and board.”
Hollister said the University is nonetheless planning for accompanying costs incurred in the transition back to in-person instruction.
“We do expect increased financial aid to be one example, certainly ongoing testing and tracing costs to campus safety and labs, classroom reconfigurations, technology support are all examples of increased costs in managing the pandemic,” Hollister added.
Hollister emphasized that Harvard has sought to protect its educational and research initiatives throughout the pandemic. He cited financial aid for undergraduate students, funding for research efforts, and stipends for graduate students as examples of programs the University has maintained over the course of the past year.
“Harvard is about students, faculty, academics and researching,” Hollister said. “We’ve focused on trying to reduce all other discretionary spending, but trying to limit as much impact as possible on teaching and research.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their fourth virtual meeting with the Harvard-Allston Task Force Tuesday, the developers of 180 Western Ave. shared updated plans for mitigating construction and fostering public spaces. Some task force members and locals, however, remain worried about the impact that construction at Barry’s Corner might have.
The development — which will be constructed on Harvard-owned land — began formal public review in July 2020, when the developer, Samuels and Associates, filed their Letter of Intent with the Boston Planning and Development Agency.
Since then, the developers have solicited feedback from the Harvard-Allston Task Force, which is serving as the development’s impact advisory group, and filed an additional planning notification form March 5, detailing further plans for the development.
The latest meeting comes three days before the BDPA’s April 30 deadline for the public to submit comments on the development’s planning notification form.
The information from the task force meetings and feedback from other city agencies will eventually be compiled by BPDA into a “scoping determination,” which will present the developers with suggested next steps before seeking BPDA board approval.
Samuels and Associates Vice President of Development Julia Wynyard presented a brief update on plans for the development’s public spaces and bike safety.
Wynyard said they will seek to include both, rather than just one, of their previous plans for open space — a wider sidewalk and additional trees near North Harvard Street, and an outdoor seating area along Bertram Street.
She also added the developers intend to create a “raised cycle track” and repaint parts of North Harvard Street to “accommodate a dedicated, striped bike lane.”
Following Wynyard, the majority of the meeting focused on construction mitigation, including a presentation from the development’s construction consulting firm, CSL. CSL Consulting Principal Edward G. LeFlore elaborated on the efforts to mitigate potential disruptions and damage caused by 180 Western Ave.’s construction.
He said the developers are committed to establishing a number of lines of communication — including a telephone hotline, dedicated email address, and flyers for residents without technology access — to ensure consistent contact with local residents who will be impacted once construction begins.
LeFlore also pledged that CSL will “set up a baseline monitoring system” to understand underlying noise and vibration levels in the vicinity, and closely monitor and report noise and vibration data to affected residents throughout construction.
He also outlined CSL’s “rodent control plan,” which aims to address what he indicated has been a long-standing problem in Allston. The plans, per LeFlore, will begin with in-depth analysis of the current rodent situation to establish a “baseline” and prevent a “mass exodus” of rodents once construction workers break ground.
LeFlore acknowledged that plans for the development are likely to change after the developers hire a construction manager, and as they try to meet the needs of residents in real time.
“It’s really about having a transparent process about how we’re going to move forward,” he said. “Even before there’s a shovel in the ground, or even before anything’s demolished, everyone in the neighborhood will understand what the current condition is — and then between all of us, we’ll determine if our approach is the right approach or if something else needs to happen.”
Harvard-Allston Task Force member Cindy Marchando questioned whether Samuels and Associates should proceed with development, referencing the firm’s 2014 Continuum development in Barry’s Corner, which garnered criticism from Allston residents who claimed their homes were damaged during construction.
Marchando asked how the developers can move forward with their support “when they’re not doing what they need to do.” She also alleged construction workers had damaged her home and said she hoped the developers would “take responsibility.”
Wynyard said Samuels and Associates “made every effort at the time to understand what was going on and to communicate with the neighborhood” about the issues that arose.
Brighton resident Eva Webster expressed disapproval with the development’s design, referring back to Continuum, which she believed was “one of the least attractive buildings.”
“I am sick and tired of missing the opportunity to beautify our neighborhood with new construction by design that’s too arrogant and and not really respecting our character,” Webster said.
Emily Papella — vice president of Elkus Manfredi Architects, the firm in charge of the development’s architecture — said she appreciated the comment and recognized the need to “pay a lot of attention to the design” of the building.
Harvard-Allston Task Force member Tim McHale thanked Webster for introducing the subject of architecture and said he is also looking for a “masterpiece” of a building with “an amazing public realm.”
“Good architecture fosters good community, and we need to get the architecture right,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will house select undergraduates on campus this summer, requiring them to undergo regular Covid-19 testing and follow public health guidelines similar to those in place on campus this semester, the Dean of Students Office wrote in an email to prospective summer residents last week.
Undergraduates invited to live in Harvard’s dorms in the summer months include students enrolling in the Summer School who spent the entire 2020-2021 academic year studying off campus. Harvard announced last summer it would waive the cost of up to two Summer School courses for those students. Students on financial aid who take advantage of the free summer classes will receive subsidized room and board.
Consistent with previous years, College students participating in Harvard’s Summer Undergraduate Research Village Program will also receive housing on campus. Students currently living on campus for the spring semester who face travel restrictions or extenuating circumstances at home were also able to petition to remain on campus through the summer — from the end of spring term until fall move-in.
The Summer School announced in December it will hold all 2021 classes online due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Student travel is “likely to be very limited” and will depend on campus reopening levels this summer, per the Dean of Students Office website.
“It is essential for all students considering the invitation to be in residence to understand that the campus experience will be markedly different from the one you remember,” the DSO website reads.
Some students reacted negatively to the College’s summer planning announcement, including the restrictions it puts on residential life.
Giovanni Salcedo ’23, who plans to take advantage of the Summer School cost waiver, said he hopes restrictions on campus this summer take into account whether students are vaccinated against Covid-19 or not. Massachusetts expanded its vaccination program to residents 16 and older last week.
“I hope they don’t treat vaccinated students the same as people who haven’t gotten their shots,” he said. “I wouldn’t want my summer experience to be bogged down by too many restrictions, especially since I’ve already lost an entire year since I’ve been staying home.”
Salcedo said he thinks the College should allow indoor dining, small gatherings, and travel in the local area.
Some students criticized the College for the duration of the offered housing.
Students participating in free Summer School courses will move into their summer housing on June 19 or June 20 and will be required to vacate their dorms on August 8. The College will not offer housing to those Summer School students between May 16 — the final day of the spring 2021 semester — and June 19, or between August 8 and the start of the fall semester in late August.
Salcedo said he will incur what he perceives are gratuitous travel and storage fees as a result of the gaps in housing. Harvard will not provide on-campus storage for students over the summer.
“I would have to fly back home and then fly back again to Massachusetts, which is hundreds of dollars extra,” Salcedo, a California resident, said. “Unless I can find somewhere like a friend or family that could help me or somewhere I could stay for a couple of weeks.”
Will Dey ’23, who plans to take the two free Summer School courses and conduct independent research, said the housing arrangement, which concludes weeks before the fall term, will pose logistical challenges.
“My research is through the entire summer but the Summer School is only for one and a half months in the middle,” said Dey, a resident of Texas. “I’m going to be having to move to my own apartment for the first part of summer, then into campus, then back out of campus, and back into campus again.”
Though students participating in the Summer School tuition waiver program said they knew of their eligibility for summer housing since the fall, they said Harvard only confirmed it would offer them housing last week.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the College disclosed its summer housing plan as soon as possible “given the public health situation and the logistics of planning.”

For Angelina A. Kwan, an LL.M. student, her Harvard experience has been an “amazing, frustrating, [and] exhilarating” one, marked by a struggle to keep up with the near-opposite time-zones between Cambridge and her home in Hong Kong.
In a month, Kwan — along with dozens of other Master of Laws students in her cohort — will graduate with a Harvard Law degree, without ever having set foot on campus.
“You take on the challenge and push yourself as much as you can,” Kwan said. “So far I’ve survived.”
From Monday to Wednesday, Kwan logs onto Zoom at 11:30 p.m. in the evening and attends class until 1:30 a.m. On Thursdays, her mediation course begins less than four hours later, at 5:00 a.m.
“You only get three hours max of sleep, and then you have to be able to be present, and be a mediator, and take notes, and answer questions, and go through the Socratic method of learning,” she said.
Harvard Law School’s LL.M. program is a one-year degree program for individuals hailing from a diverse range of backgrounds and ages — 97 percent of the current cohort is composed of international students. In a normal year, the program consists of approximately 180 individuals — including government officials, judges, professors, and businesspeople — from around 70 countries.
With the pandemic, however, LL.M. students have experienced a one-year education many said they never anticipated. Scattered across the globe, participants in the program said in interviews that time zone differences, separation from classmates, and the fact that they will never learn in person on the University’s campus were key issues on their minds.
Harvard Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal said that since the onset of the pandemic, the Law School’s “first priority” has been to “protect the health and safety of our community” while also “maintaining an excellent academic program” and “finding ways to support student community.”
“We understand that this has been an extraordinarily challenging year for students and people around the globe, including our LL.M. students,” Neal wrote.
Pauline Heingle, a LL.M. student originally from France but currently living in Rome, Italy, said the most difficult aspect of the virtual school year was learning to “keep up with the classes psychologically” in an online format and “connect socially with people.”
“It’s quite hard,” she said. “I think it’s the same issue with the first year JDs. For people that have already been on campus in Boston, you already have some network. Here, we’re completely left alone.”
Heingle said finding peers to work together with, let alone scheduling study sessions around time zone differences, has been a major challenge.
“That’s the hardest thing to do,” she said. “To find that classmate you can work with, you can speak with — especially with the different time zones — and do it completely online.”
Makoto C. Hong, an LL.M. student hailing from Singapore — 12 hours ahead of Eastern time — said navigating disparate time zones has been “the most challenging part” of the LL.M. experience.
“It has made it more difficult, especially to go for things like meetings outside of classes, office hours,” Hong said. “The instructors have been really very helpful, but I would still feel very bad to trouble them to schedule special hours as opposed to the usual hours, which are maybe 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. Singapore time.”
Neal wrote that over the course of the pandemic, the Law School increased the number of courses and events offered at times accessible to students in far-away time zones and launched a new Technology Assistance Fund to provide up to $1 million to assist students in overcoming “technological obstacles to participating fully in online learning.”
Though students made an effort to hold regular social events in earlier months, Hong said it has been difficult to continue that effort through nine months of exclusively virtual interaction.
“Frankly, there is much more inertia to meet when it’s a virtual environment and when there are such disparate time zones,” Hong said.
Misthura A. Otubu said that with few peers in her time zone and unreliable internet, her learning experience from Nigeria has been “very exhausting,” and that “Zoom fatigue was real.”
“We share lecture notes and generally everybody is just really willing to help, which is quite uplifting,” Otubu said. “But then again, there’s a big challenge of not being able to associate with a lot of people, as you would normally have in an in-person setting.”
Victor O. Ojeah, another LL.M. student currently residing in Nigeria, said a central reason why he and his peers chose Harvard Law School was because of its unique reputation as a place to connect with global leaders and prominent legal scholars.
“One of the value propositions that Harvard sells to us is the ability to meet and network with some of the most talented people across the world,” Ojeah said. “Unfortunately, that was a promise Harvard did not meet this academic year for LL.M. students.”
Prior to the fall semester, when Ikram Ais learned that her LL.M. program would be virtual, she said she was not surprised given the “difficulty of the situation.”
“I can’t say it was the fair approach, but it was the most reasonable one,” said Ais, who is living in Germany.
After hearing the decision, Ais said she reached out to her peers and made an effort to “keep in touch” and “be communicative with one another.”
“They’re venting, I’m venting, and then we’re just pushing through. I felt like that was really important for all of us,” Ais said.
Ojeah said that from the time LL.M. students received their admission letters in March 2020 up until the news that the spring semester would be remain online, members of his class have “tried to have a conversation” with the Law School to suggest modified policies that could “mutually suit both the students and the administration.”
“It appeared, however, that the administration was not very keen on hearing students’ perspectives,” Ojeah said. “When you talk to an average LL.M. student of this year, the perception we have about HLS is that graduate students are probably not as important as other students in the school.”
According to Ojeah, every time students attempted to “contribute to the decision-making process,” it felt as if they were met with “stiff resistance.”
“Some of the students, for example, as early as April of last year were suggesting to Harvard that if it is thought that the pandemic is going to be so bad, they could consider shifting the calendar to a later date for resumption to allow some in-person activity,” he said. “Or they could give people a more flexible deferral process — we came up with a lot of options, and all of them fell on deaf ears.”
Neal, the HLS spokesperson, wrote that the Law School held “multiple meetings” with this year’s LL.M. class, beginning last summer and carrying on into the fall term in order to hear student perspectives.
Program administrators, Neal added, recognized that many LL.M. students may “prefer not to commence their one-year programs this year,” and extended the traditional deferral deadline by approximately six weeks. All deferrals were accepted, according to Neal.
By May 2020, Ojeah said, nearly half of his class had deferred. Many who have continued with the program, he said, are considering an additional LL.M. program because the Harvard Law experience did not “meet our expectations.”
Following her cohort’s completely virtual year and the online festivities planned in lieu of a traditional commencement, Ais said she is advocating strongly for an in-person ceremony at some point in the future, something Harvard and the Law School have promised to students.
Despite the manifold challenges of being an LL.M. student during the pandemic, Shota Toda — an LL.M. student based in Tokyo — said he had experienced several “silver linings,” including chatting on Zoom with classmates and exchanging photos of their respective home countries.
“Sometimes we’ll send pictures which we took in a neighborhood or in a park or a tourism spot,” Toda said. “I take a picture and send it to my classmates, and that’s how we can communicate with each other.”
Otubu said some of her favorite memories emerged from working with student organizations. Obutu currently serves as a publication editor for the Kennedy School’s Africa Policy Journal.
“I’ve actually really gotten to know the people on the team and I feel like I’ve actually been doing substantial work in that regard,” she said. “It’s just very exciting for me — I’ve never taken on an editorial role in such a renowned journal before.”
Maria L. Passador, an editorial board member of the Harvard Business Law Review, said she worked as part of the publication’s sponsorship committee, organizing seminars with students from across the Law School.
“There were 1Ls, 2Ls, 3Ls, and everybody shared their own views,” Passador said. “That was so exciting, that was really a way in which we could do something, notwithstanding the distance and the fact that there were just a couple of LL.M.s in the group — we were really close-knit.”
Ojeah also said his involvement in a student association — the Harvard Arbitration Society — has been “one of [the] most exciting moments” of his LL.M. experience.
“We had this conference and it was just mind blowing — not just the outcome, but the feedback from people,” Ojeah said. “That’s been one of my highest points at HLS.”
Hong said he and two other LL.M. students from Singapore have made it a tradition since September to meet in person at least once every two weeks to discuss the various aspects of their Law School experience and stay connected.
“That has really helped,” Hong said. “We’ll discuss classes, constitutional law, time zone challenges — so that’s really nice.”
This past January, Toda said he took an exam in his international commercial arbitration class that was “almost crazy” in its degree of complexity and took “long, long hours.” One of Toda’s best friends from the program was also enrolled in the course.
Shortly after Toda completed the grueling exam, he was notified that he had passed with the highest possible grade and his friend had received a Dean’s Scholar distinction.
“We shared that experience on Zoom,” Toda said. “We said congrats to each other — that was the finest moment for me.”

Another semester has Zoomed by, and it’s now Reading Period! After so many months of online lectures and eyestrain, the end is near. Now that you’ve deleted all your classes from your G-Cal (the satisfaction!), here are a few suggestions on how to spend the next seven days before final exams take over your life.
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Take an afternoon off and visit one of the most beloved art museums in Boston, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. If you’re living on campus, you can take the M2 for free, and there is no admission fee for those carrying a Harvard ID. If you’re still not convinced, the museum is a prime spot to take your next Instagram picture, or at least post on your story to let your acquaintances know that you are indeed #cultured.
Arnold Arboretum 
The Arnold Arboretum is a free public park in Boston and is a wonderful place to get away from your laptop screen for a while. Plus, being surrounded by nature is known to reduce unpleasant feelings such as stress and fear, and with so many deadlines around the corner, who doesn’t need that? For the poor souls with an organic chemistry final coming up, the greenery is definitely more aesthetically pleasing than the carbon ring structures you’ve been staring at defeatedly all semester.
Spa and Movie Night
Maybe you’re not living in Cambridge, or you simply don’t have the motivation to change out of your pajamas. If you fall within these categories, you can spend a night indoors spoiling yourself with face masks, mani-pedis, and several hours of Ginny & Georgia (which is officially renewed for a second season!!!). Although this activity can be fun with friends, both over Zoom and in person, it’s also a great opportunity to have some alone time and unwind before due dates hit you like a truck.
Virtual Dance Workouts
It’s been so long since you’ve put on a cute dress and your favorite heels for a fancy formal, but a global pandemic can’t stop you from moving to the beat. Follow along to one of the many energetic YouTube dance workout videos and release those endorphins! However, if dancing (or working out) isn’t really your thing, you can alternatively complete a quiet yoga session.
Study!
Of course, during a regular year, Reading Period is beloved for the lavish formals and off-campus excursions, but hence the name, it’s also time to hit the books. If you want to escape a bit at the same time, you can bring all your class materials to a park and work under the warm sun. You’ll thank yourself next week if you get a jump start on your final projects and practice exams.
Luckily, this week will most likely be the last virtual Reading Period you’ll experience. As you spend the next few days studying, remember to take breaks frequently and to get enough sleep — you got this, queen.
