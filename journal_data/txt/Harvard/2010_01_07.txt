After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The legal team representing Joel Tenenbaum, a Boston University graduate student who lost the second-ever jury trial on file-sharing, filed a motion on Monday requesting a retrial.
In the motion, Tenenbaum's counsel—led by Harvard Law School Professor Charles R. Nesson '60—argued for a new trial by disputing Judge Nancy Gertner's interpretation of the fair use of music files. Tenenbaum had been ordered last summer to pay the Recording Industry Association of America $675,000 for illegally downloading music.
Nesson and the defense asserted that when Tenenbaum downloaded 30 songs in 2004, music listeners were unable to obtain "exactly the songs they wanted, in the format they wanted" from the recording industry.
During the trial, Gertner recognized an "interregnum period," when listeners had no way of purchasing digital media legally before the advent of the iTunes Music Store in 2003. She noted that during this period, "unauthorized use" should be considered "more fair" since there was not yet a ready market in which users could pay for the files.
"The choice that consumers had between freely owned and transferable material and going out to a record store was an unbalanced and unfair choice," Nesson said in an interview with The Crimson.
But Nesson argued that the court should consider the interregnum period to be extended until 2007. From 2003 to 2007, music files purchased online were protected with digital rights management technology, which prevents the files from being converted to different formats and transferred to other listening devices. The difficulty of converting DRM-protected files into different formats sufficiently differentiate these files from DRM-free ones, he said.
"iTunes did not offer an equivalent to the DRM-free material you could get on Napster," Nesson said. "It took years of people like Steve Jobs, people on the industry for them to realize how stupid [DRM] was."
In the filing, Nesson also wrote that the court's treatment of evidence unfairly implied that Tenenbaum had acted dishonestly during the litigation process.
Tenenbaum wrote a letter to the RIAA in November 2005 offering to settle the case by paying $500 and removing the files in question from his computer. The letter was redacted when presented as evidence, leaving only the paragraph in which Tenenbaum wrote that he would delete the files. Nesson asserted that this redacted letter gives jurors the impression that Tenenbaum unconditionally agreed to remove the files from his computer, when in reality he only promised to remove the files as part of the $500 settlement. 
In addition, Tenenbaum's defense team argued that the statutory damages awarded by the jury were "grossly excessive," since Tenenbaum as an individual caused the plaintiffs no provable injury and acted without malicious or profit-seeking intent.
Tenenbaum will appeal if the motion for a retrial is denied and has already requested in the motion that the damages be reduced to the minimum amount—$750 per song, for a total of $22,500—if the court does not grant him a new trial, according to Nesson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council members were unable to reach a decision over the election of a new mayor at the Council's inaugural meeting on Monday.
The nine new council members' votes were divided among five candidates, but a council member must receive at least five votes in order to be elected as mayor for a two-year term.
"We need a mayor, and we need, collectively as a group, to choose a mayor," council member Sam Seidel said. "We will sort of stay at it and keep working at it until we [get] there."
The first re-vote for mayor will take place at the next City Council meeting on Jan. 11.
After Monday's deadlocked election, councilor David P. Maher lead with a total of three votes from fellow council members Sam Seidel and Timothy J. Toomey, as well as himself.
Councilors Marjorie C. Decker and Kenneth E. Reeves '72 tied with two votes each, with first-term council member and Harvard Kennedy  School student Leland Cheung supporting Decker and council member Craig A. Kelley in favor of Reeves. Both Decker and Reeves also voted for themselves.
Outgoing Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons and councilor Henrietta Davis received only their own votes.
Seidel said that he was willing to repeat Monday's election process as many times as necessary.
"I'm ready to vote as often as I need to until we as a group can choose a mayor," he said. "It's going to take a lot more talking, and some more cups of coffee."
Cheung, on the other hand, said he is eager to move on to the council's "substantive work."
"It's not uncommon that there's no definitive vote on the first attempt," said Robert Winters, local pundit and editor of the Cambridge Civic Journal who also teaches at the Harvard Extension  School.
Winters added that council members were also unable to decide upon a mayor at the first meeting of the year in 2007, 2005, as well as 2001.
"It's a very convoluted game of poker that goes on—rarely do any of the elected councilors want to show their hand publicly," Winters said. "Honestly, it's just a little extra cash and a little bit of honor over their colleagues."

Ihor Ševčenko once said that some historians, in their compulsion to ponder the same questions repeatedly, were like mindless dogs who urinated on the same tree in a forest—leaving other trees unexplored for no specific reason. But according to one colleague, this metaphor—called Ševčenko's law—did not apply to Ševčenko himself, who never sought to follow just one trail, both as a historian and a man.
After battling illness for eight months, Ševčenko, the renowned scholar and professor emeritus of Byzantine history and literature, died in his home on Dec. 26, 2009. He was 87.
Born in Poland to Ukranian parents, Ševčenko began translating texts when he was a teenager and eventually mastered French, English, Czech, German, and the Classical languages—in addition to Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian, his native languages. He later published the Ukrainian translation of "Animal Farm."
At the beginning of the 1950s, Ševčenko relocated to the United States to work as a lecturer on ancient and Byzantine history at the University of California at Berkeley.
In 1973, Ševcenko moved to Cambridge to become a professor at Harvard in the Classics department, where he taught and lectured on medieval Greek and Byzantine literature. He was also an active member of the Harvard Ukranian Research Institute until his retirement in 1992.
"He was extremely erudite—he knew a lot about the world," said Michael S. Flier, director of the HURI and a Ukrainian philology professor. "[When speaking to him,] you knew you were around an expert. You had to make sure you were accurate."
Ševčenko's approach to life, according to Flier, could be summed up as "complete devotion to knowledge." Unlike the close-minded historians described in his law of the dog and the forest, Ševčenko was curious about everything, according to Flier.
"What did Caesar ever know about Rome?" Ševčenko would say, suggesting that Caesar did not know much about his own people, according to his daughter,  Elisabeth A. Ševčenko, director of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience.
Ihor Ševčenko, a dedicated subscriber to Rolling Stone magazine, was fascinated by popular culture, according to Elisabeth.
"I remember when I was younger, he took my 'Thriller' album that I had just gotten and said, 'I need this thing! I need to understand this Michael Jackson person,'" Elisabeth recalled. "After listening to the album three times, he came down from the attic and joked, 'I don't understand why Michael Jackson is such a big deal.'"
Ševčenko's unique sense of humor reverberated both in his personal life and work, according to Elisabeth and Flier.
"He made really bad puns," Elisabeth said. "They were really terrible, [but other times] sophisticated—from very high brow to low brow." 
His lightness was also sometimes reflected in his written works. In 1969, Ševčenko published "Two Varieties of Historical Writing," an article that differentiated between two types of historians: "vivid" historians, whom he compared to butterflies, and "technical" historians, whom he compared to caterpillars.
This highly nuanced sense of history, Elisabeth said, also permitted her father a nuanced grasp of politics: "While he had a very strong sense of right and wrong," she said, "nothing was black and white."
Flier, who had known Ševčenko since 1991, said that Ševčenko was not the kind of scholar who spent all of his time isolated in his study, absorbed in his own work—instead, he was a generous and approachable professor who often invited students to lunch. The world of historical scholarship, Flier said, will miss Ševčenko as someone who had great command of the field—but Flier added that he will remember his friend best for his warmth and grace.
"He was down to earth, but he was about 6-foot-4, so you looked up to him in every way," Flier said. "He was a man of great stature."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the resignation of recently imprisoned Massachusetts State Senator Anthony D. Galluccio on Tuesday, a slew of hopefuls are eyeing his now-vacant Senate seat.
In interviews with The Crimson yesterday, Timothy R. Flaherty, who ran against Galluccio for the Senate in 2007, and Daniel C. Hill, a Charlestown lawyer, both stated their intention to run. Galluccio’s chief of staff Sal DiDomenico and Cambridge City Councillors Marjorie C. Decker and E. Denise Simmons have been named as possible contenders in the race. In addition, the Boston Globe named real estate broker Michael Albano as a potential candidate.
Senate President Therese Murray has not yet announced whether a special election will be held to fill Galluccio’s seat, or if the seat will instead remain vacant until the scheduled election this fall. Murray has until Jan. 20 to set a date for a special election for the post, which represents the Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex district.
“I am a candidate for the Senate seat because I care about education, human services, healthcare, and other progressive values that are threatened in these difficult economic times,” Flaherty said. “That’s why I ran before, and that’s why I’m running now."
In November, Hill had declared his intention to run against Galluccio for the seat in the fall of 2010. Hill had already formed a campaign committee, created a Web site, and begun soliciting donations. In light of recent events, Hill said he is “definitely running” for the now-open seat.
“I think people are sick of these distractions, these scandals that have been plaguing the State House for the past few years,” Hill said, naming several other state legislators who have resigned in recent years due to legal troubles. “It’s sad for Mr. Galluccio, but I think it’s time to move on and get someone in this seat who’s a professional—not a career politician.”
Decker, who is currently serving her sixth term on the Cambridge City Council, said in an interview with the State House News Service, “I’m certainly going to explore the seat. I think at this point it’s still a little premature.”
According to Robert Winters—creator of the Cambridge Civic Journal, a website that comments on local politics—an early special election, which he said probably could not take place until late February or March, would be most beneficial to Flaherty, who has run for this seat before and garnered regional name recognition.
“If there were, let’s say, a City Councillor running, nobody outside Cambridge knows who they are,” Winters said. “Over a longer time scale, someone relatively unknown in the rest of the district would have a little more time to buddy-buddy up to all the people you need to network with. In the short term, they have no time to do that. They’re invisible in the short term.”
Galluccio, who was elected in 2007 after Jarret T. Barrios stepped down to run a healthcare company, was sentenced Monday to a year in prison for violating the terms of his probation, which stemmed from an October hit-and-run accident in Cambridge that injured two people. Just three days after he was sentenced to home confinement in December, Galluccio broke his probation by failing a series of breathalyzer tests. Galluccio, who maintains that he did not consume alcohol after receiving the sentence, attributed the test results to his toothpaste and stated Tuesday in his letter of resignation that he intends to appeal the sentence.
Harvard Law School Professor Charles J. Ogletree told the Boston Herald yesterday that he was looking into helping Galluccio with his appeal, describing the senator as “a friend for a couple of decades." Ogletree represented Henry Louis Gates, Jr. in the professor's dispute with the Cambridge police earlier this year.
Several of the people who may run for Galluccio’s seat expressed their sympathy for the convicted senator.
“Frankly, the sentence imposed seems a little bit harsh,” Hill said.
“He did the right thing with regard to resigning,” said Paul R. Nowicki, who came in second to Galluccio in the 2007 race but told the Crimson he would not run for the seat again.

CORRECTION APPENDED
The Harvard Kennedy School has received a $20.5 million gift—one of the five largest in the school’s history—to be directed toward Asia-related programs and research, officials announced Wednesday.
The gift from the PT Rajawali Corporation, one of Indonesia's largest conglomerates, will be used to further scholarly research on Indonesia and is divided in two parts. The Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia will receive $10 million for its permanent endowment, spread over five years, and an additional $10.5 million, also paid over five years, will fund research, teaching, and exchange programs focused on Indonesia.
The Rajawali Foundation Institute will consolidate and endow work already done under the Asia Program of the Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. Both new programs will continue to operate under the leadership of the Ash Center, according to Julian P. Chang, the newly appointed executive director of the Rajawali Foundation Institute.
“It’s a testament to the vision and the forward thinking of a lot of people in Indonesia that...despite all the political problems, despite all the natural disasters and other crises, there are people thinking about how to move the country forward politically," Chang said.
The donation will allow the Kennedy School to dedicate new staff to research Indonesia and to work directly with Indonesian academics and politicians, who will be invited to Harvard for training sessions and meetings with other political leaders. The Institute will also encourage Indonesian students to enroll in graduate school programs at the Kennedy School in an effort to foster cross-university research and collaboration.
The Ash Center’s ongoing work in Vietnam encouraged the donation, according to Chang. After reading reports on socioeconomic development from the Ash Center’s Vietnam Program, Peter Sondakh—the billionaire owner and director of the Rajawali Corporation—had approached the Kennedy School to perform a similar competitive analysis of Indonesia. The initial report that Sondakh requested will be completed by the end of the month.
One of the major benefits of the new Institute is the integration of Indonesian political research with work focusing on the rest of the region, Chang said.
Although the Ash Center had already worked on Indonesian microfinance issues, there had been no sustained, in-depth research on the country. During the preparation of the new report, it became clear that creating an expanded program including Indonesian academics, politicians, and officials would be the most effective way to improve Indonesian political scholarship, Chang said.
“This gives us the opportunity to leverage what we’ve been doing in China and Vietnam to help the Indonesian government to think about their progress moving forward,” Chang said. “We can link Indonesia to other countries in the region in ways that they may not have linked before.”

State Championships. The dream of high school athletes across America doesn’t officially exist in college hoops, but the Harvard women’s basketball team still got a chance to celebrate. With its Wednesday night victory over the University of Massachusetts (6-9), the Crimson (8-4) has now beaten all five Division I basketball teams in the state.
“We’re very proud [of] being the best in the state,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “I don’t think we’ve ever played everybody and beaten everybody.”
Moreover, in beating the Minutewomen 72-60, Harvard picked up its first road victory since Thanksgiving Weekend.
It nearly didn’t happen, though, as a second half rally by Massachusetts threatened to end the Crimson’s recent reign over its regional rivals.
Harvard hit its stride early, with junior captain Christine Matera hitting three three-point shots before six minutes had expired in the first half.
“My teammates hit me,” Matera explained. “I had wide open shots and I just happened to hit them.”
Matera teamed with the other four starters to mount an imposing lead early.
“We started out lights out,” Delaney-Smith said. “I worry about that. I don’t like it.”
It turned out Delaney-Smith’s worry was not without cause, as the Minutewomen were able to close the margin near the end of the half. But a three pointer by Matera seemed to put Massachusetts back in its place. It would not score for the remainder of the half, and the Crimson rolled into halftime with a 17-point lead.
Massachusetts staged a more dangerous comeback in the second half, one led by their starting post players, all three of whom would finish the game in double figures.
“Their forwards were able to score on our forwards,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s a stat line I’m disappointed with.”
But it wasn’t the Minutewomen’s shooting percentage that hurt Harvard. Rather, Massachusetts punished the Crimson on the glass as it earned second and third chances at the basket.
“We let [the Minutewomen] get back with a lack of effort on defense and defensive rebounding,” Matera said.
And whenever Massachusetts wasn’t converting lay-ups, it seemed, it was converting foul shots. All four Crimson post players—juniors Emma Markley and Claire Wheeler and freshmen Victoria Lippert and Miriam Rutzen—found themselves in foul trouble.
With seven minutes remaining, the Minutewomen’s Kristina Danella closed the lead to four with two free throws.
“I thought [the Massachusetts players] were smart,” Delaney-Smith said. “It looked like their strategy was to pound it inside.”
Perhaps the Minutewomen took the physical strategy too far, as the Crimson was able to end Massachusetts’ 14-0 run with consecutive trips to the line by freshman Elle Hagedorn and sophomore point guard Brogan Berry.
“Elle [has] been great off the bench,” Delaney-Smith said. “I though Brogan was phenomenal.”
Berry finished with 16 points, five rebounds, seven assists and a steal.
“She is just consistent game in and game out,” Delaney-Smith said. “I can’t even remember her 16 points. She is the team quarterback and the team leader.”
Meanwhile, junior Emma Markley, Harvard’s other regular on the stat sheet, ended the game with 14 points, nine rebounds, two assists, four blocks, and three steals in another well-rounded performance.
“I find it unbelievable,” Delaney-Smith said. “She actually missed a lot of shots that she rarely misses. [But] it didn’t stop her. She was able to contribute in other ways.”
With its usual stars putting up big numbers, the Crimson survived another scare to pick up its first non-tournament road win.
The state championships are over. But with the Ivy League opener against Dartmouth looming, the real title hunt is about to begin.

Cashless burrito and taco lovers of Cambridge, rejoice! As of Jan. 1, 2010, Felipe's Taqueria in Harvard Square has finally joined its 21st century cohorts in taking credit cards. And it's about time.
The good news is that just about any type of plastic works: MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover are all welcome. Debit cards too!
All Felipe's requests is that customers still pay with cash for orders under $10—although Tom Brush, co-owner of the restaurant, clarified that they won't deny credit card payments for orders under $10.
He and his business partner Felipe Herrera, the restaurant's namesake, decided to start taking plastic because they wanted to make things more convenient for their patrons.
Essentially, they recognized the inconvenience (and embarrassment) of cashless customers who accidentally ignored the "cash only" sign outside, ordered food, and realized only when they got to the register that they were unable to pay.
Brush warned, however, that if taking credit cards becomes a significant cost to the business—since the restaurant is charged a flat rate for each credit card transaction—Felipe's may have to raise its prices.
In the meantime, we'll just remember to buy a second super burrito for a friend the next time we pay with plastic. Share the grease. Share the love.

Feeling a little Harvard-sick? This J-Term, look out for lime green socks and snazzy dance moves when four a capella groups bring a little bit of Harvard to a city near you.
As you sit at home, pajama-clad and well-rested for what feels like the first time in ten years, you may realize how quiet life is without Dins or Kroks serenading you at preposterously-named jams every weekend. But never fear! Some of Harvard’s a capella groups will be touring major cities in and out of the U.S. to fill your ears with music, your hearts with joy, and maybe their pockets with proceeds from selling CDs along the way.
If you’re from sunny Los Angeles (or staying with an L.A.-based roommate to escape the cold—good choice, by the way) you can catch the all-male Krokodiloes on Jan. 9 at 7 p.m. at Westwood Presbyterian Church on Wilshire Blvd. Check out the Facebook event to buy tickets. The Kroks will then hit Utah, performing at the Waterford School on Jan. 14 and the University of Utah on Jan. 18. They’ll finish up with some as-yet-unscheduled shows in NYC and head back to Cambridge on Jan. 22.
The Din & Tonics—and their famed lime-green socks—will be taking Washington, D.C. by storm from Jan. 16-24. Dins President Ari C. Peña ’10 is looking forward to having “a week away just to get to know each other better, and have some man time,” he said.
Dins Business Manager and baritone Dillon C. Powers ’11 said most of the gigs they’ll be singing at are private, but there may be a chance for students in D.C. to attend a show at George Washington University. He said students can check Facebook and the Dins’ Web site to see if that show will be happening or not.
Some co-ed groups are also hitting the road. From Jan. 18-23, the Callbacks will shower Puerto Rican inns, plazas, and the San Jorge Children’s Hospital with music. If you're going to be nearby, check out the schedule on their Web site. The members are looking forward to performing a brand-new Spanish-language song, singer Kristina F. Latino ’13 said.
The Opportunes’ plans are not yet quite so solid. “We know we’re going to New York, but we don’t actually know if we have any gigs yet,” Opportunes baritone singer Zachary N. Bernstein ’13 said. “We’ll have fun wherever we end up going.”
The Radcliffe Pitches is one a capella group that’s staying put until spring and summer (when they’ll hit Bermuda, Japan, and Thailand, among other destinations). But that’s not stopping Catherine E. Williams ’13, a first soprano in the Pitches, from supporting her fellow singers by attending the upcoming Kroks show.
“It’s nice to see your friends and have a little bit of Harvard at home,” she said.
But be sure to watch your step—if you’re not careful you might accidentally stumble into enemy territory, because we hear that the Yale Spizzwinks(?) (yes, the question mark is part of their name) and presumably some other Yale a capella groups are lurking around Los Angeles and other cities dangerously near you.
