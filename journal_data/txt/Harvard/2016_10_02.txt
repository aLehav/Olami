After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When news hit that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce from Brad Pitt after 10 years together and two years of marriage, the internet unsurprisingly flooded with articles dissecting every aspect of their relationship. From Jennifer Aniston memes to tabloids claiming a cheating scandal had caused the rift between the two, no stone was left unturned. While the couples’ indisputable celebrity is no doubt the root cause of the high level of scrutiny their divorce is getting, one can’t deny that there seems to be a particular interest in this divorce compared to other celebrity couples’. J-Lo and Marc Anthony, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, and Kim Kardashian and Chris Humphries were all couples whose separations garnered a lot of attention, so why does this one feel different? Maybe because it’s Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, but maybe because it feels personal.
Brangelina was a love that seemed both unstoppable and endless. For Brad to leave Jennifer Aniston for another woman? To adopt her two children, and to adopt a third together after having their own biological children? To be together for 10 years, not marrying until it was legal for same-sex couples in every state to get married, only to break their vow of waiting because they just couldn’t wait? Theirs looked like a love story even bigger and better than that of the two characters that brought them together, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
Jolie and Pitt not only represented the quintessential Hollywood glam power couple but also have throughout the course of their public life endeared themselves to us. While Angelina may have had a rough start with the public earlier in her career, carrying a vial of her first husband’s blood around her neck and kissing her brother on the red carpet, her unapologetic way of life, adoption of three children, and genuine humanitarianism have made her Hollywood’s angel. Brad’s increasingly progressive producing and acting choices made him more relatable to fans, and his inability to stay away from Angelina portrayed him as a man who couldn’t stop wanting what the heart wanted. If they, two seemingly perfect people, can’t make it together, who can?
It’s no secret that few Hollywood marriages work. While certain divorces come across as more of a shock than others, a couple’s divorce rarely garners attention for more than a couple of days. The end of Brangelina has forced people to ask themselves whether any relationship can withstand public scrutiny in the long term. The suddenness and shocking circumstances of Angelina’s decision to file for divorce have made people wonder if they can actually recognize true love. Allegations of drug and child abuse on Brad’s part seemed to come out of nowhere. And if we can’t look to the celebrity couple who seemed to have everything going for them for inspiration, who can we turn to? The divorce rate for regular people is about 50 percent, and the conditions of their relationships are often much less agreeable.
At the end of the day, all people want is to see a happy ending they can aspire to. With the end of Brangelina comes not only the end of an era, but also the end of a sort of relationship role model many people looked up to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fourteen members of the Class of 2017 were selected as Senior Class Marshals following last week’s elections, concluding a nearly-three week selection process.
An email sent out to the senior class Friday afternoon named the winners of the elections for First, Second, and Class Program Marshals, as well as the students who were appointed as Class Gift Marshals through an application and interview process.
Senior Class Committee appointees, who will plan class events leading up to and during Commencement week in late May, were notified by organizers from the Harvard Alumni Association earlier in the day Friday and briefed on the responsibilities of the positions.
Riya N. Patel ’17, who was named First Marshal, received a phone call around mid-day on Friday telling her of her win.
“I was in shock, it was a little bit of disbelief but mainly just being really excited,” Patel said. “It was really humbling knowing that my classmates made the effort to vote for me.”
Thirty-three seniors put their names forward for eight total spots that were filled by this week’s double round of elections. The first vote conducted last Monday narrowed the pool to 16 candidates, and the final eight were selected by another vote on Wednesday.
Six senior gift marshals who were not elected were also announced Friday. They are responsible for coordinating class gift efforts, both this year and post-graduation.
Katie F.G. Wu ’17, who was elected Second Marshal, said she was excited to find out that she won the position and looks forward to ensuring seniors have a fulfilling final year.
“So much of the time senior year can feel like it’s all about the next step, but hopefully my time on Senior Class Committee will be a time where we can actually enjoy being in senior year. I want the year to be about having a great time together, for reflection, reconnecting with old friends, and really having a great, full year,” Wu said.
Those who placed between third and eighth on Wednesday’s second round ballot were elected as Class Program Marshals.
Though not elected, gift marshals go through a two-round interview process that lasts for two and a half weeks, according to the Harvard Alumni Association website.
Samuel C. Becker ’17, one of this year’s gift marshals, said that, after attending interest meetings, he entered the process because he wanted to give back to the University.
“I was very passionate about giving back to Harvard,” Becker said. “I wanted to help the senior class see the importance of giving back to the school that has given us so much.”
The remaining positions on the Senior Class Committee’s executive committee will be filled in the next few weeks, with applications for house representatives, class secretary, class treasurer, and media team members due Oct. 2.
Some of Friday’s successful candidates expressed excitement at their wins and highlighted their desire to make senior year as memorable as possible.
Rohan Pidaparti ’17 said he looks forward to working with his committee to build camaraderie within the class during his time as Class Program Marshal.
“I think we have a great team assembled,” Pidaparti said. “I’m looking forward to making sure senior year ends with a bang and not a whimper.”
