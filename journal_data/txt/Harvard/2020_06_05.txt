After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Police brutality and its systematic targeting of black people isn’t new, nor is a lack of law enforcement interference in violence against black people by white civilians. It’s the American story, and the horror of George Floyd’s clearly documented murder stands as its most recent prolific chapter — one this University is deeply complicit in and we have not stood up against enough.
The Black Lives Matter movement, alongside like-minded groups, has refocused national attention on the crucial work that needs to be done to improve racial equity in this country. Over the course of the next month and our next four editorials, we’ll be digging into both what we haven’t said and what we’ve said wrong on these issues — challenging ourselves to use this platform to hold ourselves and our University accountable to advancing justice and combating systemic racism, where we have allowed for the continued abuse of police power and maintenance of white supremacy. Genuine introspection and improvement takes work, and we are just beginning that process.
As many of our peers join protests across the country to call for racial justice and anti-racist police reform — putting their bodies at risk of militarized, abusive, and arguably criminal police retaliation — there has been no meaningful institutional response. While many student organizations have organized donation matching efforts (open to all!) for bail funds and anti-racist nonprofits and campaigns, the University as a whole has only sent hollow messages.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s “What I believe” email missed the mark entirely. Not only did it dodge the hard work of making concrete commitments as to how the University would act on its “special responsibilities,” but it made the horrifying killings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, and so many others simply the pretext for Bacow’s self-indulgent musing.
Far more important than you and your beliefs, President Bacow, is how you will leverage your position as the leader of the most prominent University in the world to fight for the just society we desperately need — one in which black people not only have access to opportunity, but are able to work, study, speak out, and live without fear of violence. Your black students are experiencing this national trauma intimately. What in your email was for them?
While Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s subsequent email gestured more toward action and programmatic reflection, any hint of what that looks like — its leadership, structure, timeline, or concrete goals — is nowhere to be found.
And though Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay got to the heart of the matter more profoundly — looking honestly and personally into the pain felt by so many — we are still left with big questions about how her division will concretely respond and how exactly students and affiliates can “lean on this community” in processing their responses to the epidemic of militarized, racialized police violence.
Our subsequent three editorials will address actionable responses the University can take. In the first, we will call on the University to address its own complicity in racist and anti-activist policing. Harvard must abolish its private police force. The Harvard University Police Department is no different than municipal and state forces across the nation. HUPD has been deployed in the armed policing of Boston-area protests and has helped arrest protesters at least once in recent memory. It has a history of racist policing and a current culture of racism, unjustifiable violence, and unaccountability. It has no place on our campus.
In the second, we — in a long-overdue shift — will join the call for Harvard to divest from private prisons and the prison industrial complex. Our previous precedent was not only insensitive, but missed the point. We can no longer fail the black community by failing to take into account the magnitude of oppression enacted by the prison industrial complex and its investors. Harvard can’t either.
In the third, we will dive into Harvard’s continued engagement with issues of race, both internally and externally. From explicitly — and with real financial teeth — supporting mutual aid funds, nonprofit organizations, and bail funds that combat state oppression of black people, to moving beyond facile diversity and inclusion rhetoric toward a more robust engagement with racism, discrimination, and ignorance on our campus, we will call attention to a number of ways — long advocated for by the activists already committed to this fight — that Harvard can consistently make its campus and community more just.
As we criticize the administration for its poor response, we have to acknowledge and reflect on the extent to which our institution and editorial board have accommodated, contributed to, and ignored instances and structures of racism — both against black people and other historically marginalized groups. We have been morally complicit in the perpetuation of this oppression — sometimes speaking too weakly and sometimes wrongly. We have caused pain in many communities, held up racist double standards, and failed to hold ourselves or the University to sufficient account. Underwriting these poor judgments, we continue to need to reflect on what anti-racism in the editorial process looks like. The nation’s issue and the University’s issue is our issue, too.
In a fourth editorial, we will address our own shortcomings in-depth — combing through our precedents and practices as we reimagine our editorial platform and commit to working for an anti-racist future.
These editorials are only a small contribution to a much greater struggle; we’re largely just amplifying the ideas of our peers. But they cannot be left unwritten.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear University President Lawrence S. Bacow,

Over the weekend, I read with mounting disappointment, and then growing anger, your letter to the Harvard community titled "What I believe." Like you, Dr. Bacow, I graduated from Harvard Law School. Like you, I am white and Jewish, roughly the same age. Like you, I remember 1968 clearly. 

Unlike you, I do not remember us “moving forward.” I remember us moving on. 

Unlike you, I do not believe that “our strength as a nation is due in no small measure to our tradition of welcoming those who come to our shores in search of freedom and opportunity, individuals who repay us multiple times over through their hard work, creativity, and devotion to their new home.” Let’s try to set aside the troubling implicit but undefined “we” in that statement, though it’s hard to ignore. Let’s set aside its fallacy, given the many times this nation has closed its borders to groups desperate to enter or abused them once they arrived — the oppressed from (to name a few) China, Japan, Vietnam, Ireland, Italy, El Salvador, Haiti, Mexico, Nigeria; and the Jews, like your family and mine, trying to escape the pogroms and the Holocaust. Set aside, too, whether the reference to “our nation” includes the indigenous people we’ve displaced from their lands and whose heritage we've tried to eradicate. 

How about the people dragged here in chains? In a statement to the Harvard community prompted by racial tragedy, this omission leaps off the page. Four hundred years later, have they yet been welcomed to “our” shores or thanked for their hard work, creativity, and devotion they’ve maintained in the face of the unending persecution that’s been inflicted on them? This nation we share was built on the blood and sweat that have been demanded of them, only to be repaid by laws and policies that have crippled them.  

I am not the head of world's best known university, but unlike you, I could not have written that “all of us, liberal and conservative, Democrat and Republican, whatever our race or ethnicity, want a better life for our children” without calling out the countless ways nice white folks (and the beloved university) have tacitly made it easier for their children to get that better life than the children of black parents. (Despite the debates that have raged at Harvard over affirmative action, has Harvard eliminated factors it traditionally used that gave non-academically-based boosts vastly favoring white applicants: legacy, financial contributions to the school, geographic distribution, and recruitment for students to field sports like ice hockey, water polo, sailing, squash, and crew? Will Harvard eliminate use of standardized testing it currently seems to rely heavily on?) 

Dr. Bacow, I have four African American children. I can picture them under the knee of a police officer, and I do, night after night. But I don’t think it requires having children who are directly in harm’s way to say that, unlike you, I could not have written the pablum you served up in your letter. 

You referred in your letter to your belief in the Constitution and the rights conferred by the 14th Amendment — one that’s supposed to guarantee due process and equal protection of the laws to all Americans. What specifically does that mean to you? Despite the fact that your letter was sent in response to one in a unbroken series of outrages against the black community, it fails to talk about or identify them. Even when you wrote about the disruption and “incomprehensible loss” caused by COVID-19, you never mentioned the disparate impact the pandemic has had on communities of color and the resulting rates of unemployment. 

I would have been interested in reading about ways Harvard, with its vast network of distinguished alumni in every boardroom, courtroom, classroom, hospital, and governing body in this country, must take on as a central focus the sources of, and concrete ways to fix, these tragic imbalances. I would have been interested in reading about how you will use the University’s resources to widen the conversation to include those who never had the privilege of attending Harvard. I would have been interested in reading about plans for Harvard, under your leadership, to do a deep dive into its own practices to figure out why the college admits 14 percent African American applicants but only matriculates eight to nine percent, and what that percentage really means to that sole black student (and his or her classmates) in a class of 15. 

I would have been interested in reading any attempt to reflect the real pain once again visited upon the black community instead of a list of your beliefs in unrealized American myths and aspirations.  

So please, President Bacow, talk to us like the thinking adults we are. Admit candidly the ways Harvard has failed during its long history to promote for everyone the American dream you believe in, and the ways you intend to use your position to fix that right now.

You have been given much. We expect more from you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 5, 2020, 4:18 p.m.
Twenty-five members of the Harvard Anthropology faculty requested professor Gary Urton’s immediate resignation Thursday, as more former students alleged that Urton had sexually harassed them.
Two former Ph.D. students in the department — Carrie J. Brezine and Jade d’Alpoim Guedes — told The Crimson this week that Urton sexually harassed them when they were graduate students.
Brezine said she faced “years of sexual coercion and emotional abuse” by Urton between 2003 and 2007; she said he made her feel that saying no to his “routine” requests for sex might end her career.
Guedes filed a Title IX complaint against Urton on Tuesday based on a 2012 email in which Urton asked her to join him in a hotel room.
The two women came forward days after an investigation by The Crimson found another former student had accused Urton of sexual harassment in 2016, though that she never filed a formal charge against him.
In their letter to Urton requesting his resignation Thursday, the faculty cited The Crimson’s reporting, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay’s decision to place Urton on administrative leave, and “moral grounds.”
“The strong evidence put forth in these allegations has destroyed our confidence in your ability to be a teacher, colleague, and productive member of the department,” they wrote. “We see your continued presence as an impediment in our efforts to move the department in a more equitable, responsive, and responsible direction.”
Urton did not respond to requests for comment on the faculty letter and Brezine’s allegations Thursday. He apologized for his behavior toward Guedes in a statement Tuesday.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson Thursday responding to Brezine and Guedes’s allegations, Gay asserted “unequivocally” that the FAS will not tolerate sexual harassment.
“Sexual harassment constitutes a form of discrimination that is both personally damaging for those who experience it and is an assault on our faculty’s fundamental commitments to equity and academic excellence,” Gay wrote. “Since 2013, the FAS has been using its strengthened procedures, additional reporting requirements, and updated disciplinary policies to combat sexual misconduct in our community, while also bolstering prevention and support for those who have experienced it.”
“We must continue to improve upon these efforts to ensure that all members of our community experience a safe and healthy educational and work environment,” Gay added.
Brezine said Urton first asked her to have sex with him in the summer of 2003, when she was a staff member working with Urton in Peru.
“Abusers are really good at choosing a moment when there are limited options,” Brezine said. “We’re in a place that was fairly remote, Gary is controlling the finances, and he comes to my hotel room late at night.”
Brezine said this marked the first of many sexual requests by Urton. She said she believed turning Urton down would jeopardize her employment, and, once she entered the Harvard Ph.D. program in 2005, her graduate studies.
Brezine said Urton requested sex from her on work trips to Peru and Europe, conferences in Washington, D.C., in his office and at her home. Between 2003 and 2007, she said he made the requests roughly once a day while they traveled together, and roughly weekly while they were in Cambridge.
Brezine said she and Urton both work in the “extremely niche field” of Khipu studies, the study of pre-Columbian Andean record-keeping. Urton was and remains an acknowledged expert in the field, she said, so she believed she would not be able to work in the field without completing her degree under his supervision.
“He said, in these words, ‘I have created you as a scholar,’ which meant I had no standing on my own,” she said. “I believed he could halt my career.”
Brezine said that, along with his sexual requests, Urton controlled her work, how she spent her time, and with whom she met. He would become “livid” if she did not answer his calls or spent time in the office reading for a class besides his, she said.
“He wanted to know my whereabouts all the time, who I was with,” Brezine said. “His emotional manipulation and controlling behavior was extreme.”
Refusing his requests for sex would cause the emotional manipulation to escalate dramatically, Brezine said.
“This all contributed to not being able to tell anyone because I felt so guilty, so ashamed,” she said. “I knew there would be retaliation.”
Brezine said she reported Urton’s behavior to University Ombudsman Lydia L. Cummings ’80 and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana in early 2007.
At the time, however, FAS policies on sexual harassment did not prohibit sexual relationships between faculty members and students, and Brezine said guilt and shame led to her to describe her sexual relations with Urton as a consensual affair to the administrators.
She said she now believes such a relationship between a student or a staff member and a person who controls their career can never be “truly consensual.”
Brezine said she felt Cummings and McCavana appropriately laid out all her options for reporting but made it clear to her the “immense” costs of filing a complaint. She said they told her reporting might cost her years of time — and even her Harvard degree — because her project relied so heavily on Urton.
“I was essentially told that I could file a complaint or get a degree, but not both,” Brezine wrote in an email. “It was emphasized that complaints rarely work in the victim’s favor.”
FAS policies at the time did not require McCavana to report Urton’s behavior to Harvard sexual harassment officers. FAS adopted a mandatory reporter policy in 2014, and later updated its sexual harassment policy to explicitly ban faculty from engaging in sexual relations with students under their supervision.
Cummings wrote in an emailed statement that the Ombudsman is a “confidential, neutral and independent resource” for Harvard affiliates.
“Strict confidentiality is essential to the Ombudsman function,” she wrote. “I do not disclose, affirm or deny the identify of visitors to the Office and all conversations are kept in strict confidence. I cannot affirm or deny any accounts made by others.”
As an employee beginning in 2002 and later as a graduate student, Brezine built the Khipu database, the first computerized repository of complete descriptions of all known pre-Columbian knotted string records.
She said she signed a contract agreeing that her work on the database would belong to Harvard, and that Urton always credited her for her work.
Brezine said that, despite her wishes to do so, she did not write her dissertation based on the database because Urton controlled access to it.
She said McCavana arranged a meeting between her and then-department chair Arthur M. Kleinman in 2007, where she explained the hostile work environment created by Urton, though she did not tell him about sexual relations.
Kleinman wrote in an emailed statement that he did not recall discussing a “hostile work environment” with Brezine, and instead understood the meeting to be centered around an “issue of intellectual dispute over access to the data she needed for her PhD research.”
“It was presented to me as an issue in mentoring related to promises made about access to a database and that is how I discussed the problem with Ms. Brezine,” Kleinman wrote. “When I discussed this issue with Prof. Urton I urged him to resolve this problem as an issue of intellectual dispute over access to the data she needed for her PhD research.”
“I certainly would have done more if the issue were a hostile work environment,” he added. “This dispute stayed in my mind as an example of our need to improve mentoring.”
Brezine and McCavana drew up “ground rules” for her workplace interactions with Urton, but that he wrote back with edits specifying that he could withdraw her permission to use the database at any point.
She said she worried that even after years of research, Urton might suddenly withdraw his permission if she did something to anger him.
“If you knew my passion for Inka khipu and wondered why that wasn’t my disseration, the condition of access to the khipu database was sex,” Brezine wrote in an email. “Gary made it clear that he could, and would, revoke my access at any time if I did not perform adequately. I felt that was too risky a basis on which to propose a dissertation topic.”
Guedes, the other graduate student who reported harassment by Urton this week, said she noticed Urton tightly controlled the people with whom Brezine could meet. Guedes said Brezine told her on one occasion that Urton had temporarily withheld Brezine’s access to the Khipu data.
Brezine said she never filed an official complaint in part because she felt people would believe that it was her fault, or that she had “traded” sex for a Harvard degree.
She said Urton’s sexual requests tapered off between 2007 and 2010, but that his controlling behavior continued until she graduated and moved away from Cambridge in 2011.
“If you have cited the Khipu Database Project, or found it interesting, you should know that it was first created on the sexual exploitation of a staff/graduate student,” Brezine wrote. “If you have ever cited an article of Gary’s on which I am a co-author, know that it was written in an atmosphere of sexual coercion and emotional manipulation and abuse.”
She said she is currently in contact with the Title IX office and exploring her options for reporting.
Urton is the subject of at least one other recent sexual harassment allegation, detailed in a Title IX complaint Guedes filed Tuesday.
Guedes wrote in the complaint that she felt compelled to come forward when she noticed the similarities between the 2016 allegations reported by The Crimson last week and her own interactions with Urton, according to a copy of the complaint she provided.
She wrote in the complaint that she did not report Urton’s behavior immediately after it occurred because she initially believed Urton had not made similar advances toward other students, and she feared negative consequences for her career. Urton served as department chair at the time of the alleged incident, and held that position through 2018.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson Tuesday, Urton apologized for his behavior toward Guedes.
“My behavior in this situation showed very poor judgment and has embarrassed me every time I think about it,” Urton wrote. “I am thankful that Dr. Guedes had the good sense to decline my advances and that I was respectful in my response. I am deeply sorry, and offered an apology both at that time, and on at least two subsequent occasions when I encountered her at professional meetings.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Guedes’s allegation and complaint, noting that Harvard does not confirm or comment on Title IX investigations.
In July 2012, when Guedes was in her second-to-last year of graduate school, she encountered Urton in the lab where she was working late at night. He suggested that the two of them meet one-on-one, which she agreed to. Guedes wrote in her Title IX complaint that she believed he wanted to discuss her research.
On the evening of July 20, 2012, Urton emailed Guedes from his Harvard email asking if she wanted to go out to eat or drink with him, according to exhibits attached to her Title IX complaint. Guedes wrote back that she had seen the email after she arrived home and agreed to meet Urton another evening.
The next morning, July 21, Urton sent Guedes another email from his Harvard account, according to the exhibits.
“Recognizing that opportunities for joy are few, I wonder if we should just plan a time to have a tete-a-tete, daytime or nighttime, rather than leaving it to chance?” he wrote. “If you are busy, and I am out of line, please just disregard this note...but I would find it most enjoyable.”
He also suggested that Guedes could reply to his personal email account, “or, just ignore this note, and write it off as silliness!”
“I thought this email was strange at the time, but had always found him socially awkward so I
brushed it off and discussed the potential of a lunch meeting with him,” Guedes wrote in the Title IX complaint.
Later that day, she received an email from Urton’s personal email account, asking if she “would be interested in something more intimate.”
“I mean, lunch is still on offer, and would be quite pleasant, but, well, what if I got a hotel room and then we got a bottle of wine and spent an afternoon in conversation and exploration?” Urton wrote in the email, which Guedes also attached to her complaint. “I have absolutely no expectations, and certainly there is no pressure; just a thought of a possibility of something potentially quite special and unique.”
Guedes said in an interview that she was shocked and upset after reading Urton’s message.
Later on July 21, Urton contacted her from his FAS email account, writing “if you would be so kind, let's forget my last email; it was a bad and inappropriate idea.” He also asked Guedes if she still planned to meet him for lunch five days later.
After receiving Urton’s emails, Guedes wrote in her complaint that she met with her Harvard mental health counselor, who helped her craft a reply to Urton.
On July 24, 2012, Guedes responded.
“What you said makes me feel uncomfortable and it was indeed inappropriate. I do not wish to meet you for lunch and prefer that we do not have social contact,” she wrote, according to the exhibits.
Urton replied with an apology minutes later on July 24. He wrote to Guedes that his email asking her to join him in the hotel room “was deeply inappropriate, was not motivated by any action on your part, and will be something that I will deeply regret forever.”
The following day, Urton sent Guedes another email noting that he would not visit her office without permission, but offered to find her another office for the summer, according to the exhibits. He added that he would be happy to write her letters of recommendation for future positions.
“I stand ready to help you out in whatever way I can as you make your way in your career,” he wrote in the July 25 email.
Urton had previously written her a letter of recommendation, Guedes wrote in her Title IX complaint.
“Part of what was difficult at the time was, I was about to go on the job market and I was just having this moment of being like, ‘if I report this guy, that might be it for me, like my whole academic career is done,’” Guedes said in an interview. “So I decided not to do anything.”
Following the email exchange, Guedes switched to a different letter writer and has “cold-shouldered” Urton since, she said.
She alleged in the Title IX complaint that the incident “created an incredibly hostile work environment during my final year.”
“I was afraid of coming in and wanted to avoid the department as much as possible,” she wrote. “I also felt I had to tiptoe around Gary because of the potential retaliation.”
Guedes wrote in the Title IX complaint that she informed her advisor, Anthropology professor Rowan K. Flad, of Urton’s email on July 25, 2012.
Flad encouraged her to report the email to the Title IX office and told her he wanted to report it himself, Guedes wrote. Guedes requested that Flad not do so because she was "extremely worried about the consequences it would have for [her] on the job market.” She also wrote that she doubted that Harvard would act in her favor if she chose to report. Eventually, Flad “reluctantly” agreed not to report, according to Guedes’s complaint.
Flad, who currently serves as interim chair of the department, did not respond to questions about his knowledge of Guedes’s allegations. FAS policies at the time did not require him to elevate sexual harassment allegations reported to him, as current policies do.
The Crimson’s investigation of the Anthropology department identified allegations of sexual harassment against three senior faculty — Urton, Theodore C. Bestor, and John L. Comaroff. Several of those who alleged the misconduct said the professors’ power in anthropology — a tight-knit field where informal contacts can often determine career prospects — sometimes allowed them to avoid investigation into their behavior.
Guedes wrote in her complaint that she chose not to report the email at the time because she feared retaliation and believed it was a “one off” incident. She wrote that she realized last week that her story matched that of the other alleged incident of sexual misconduct by Urton when that incident was reported by The Crimson.
According to an affidavit she filed in federal court, a former Extension School student reported to an FAS sexual harassment officer in 2016 that Urton had pressured her into “unwelcome sex” before writing her a recommendation letter in 2011.
In response to the allegations in the affidavit, Urton wrote last month that he had never violated FAS policies on sexual harassment and that, due to confidentiality rules, he could issue nothing but a blanket denial of allegations against him.
The twenty-five faculty who signed the letter included Flad, department chair Ajantha Subramanian, 12 other tenured faculty, and all five of the department’s current tenure-track faculty.
They requested he immediately resign his professorship and his position as Faculty Curator of Andean Archaeology in the Peabody Museum.
The department removed Urton from his position as Director of Undergraduate Studies Tuesday as a result of allegations against him. Flad and Subramanian announced Saturday the formation of a standing committee to “work to dismantle” structures that contributed to “an environment in which abuses continue to manifest and go undetected.”
In her email announcing the decision to put Urton on paid administrative leave, Gay referenced the allegation in the Crimson story and Guedes’s allegation, which she had posted on social media. Gay also wrote that her office has heard from others who alleged Urton sexually harassed them.
“In addition to these public reports, my office has also received direct outreach from current and former members of our community recounting experiences of sexual harassment by Professor Urton,” Gay wrote.
The faculty of Pontificia Universidad Católica del Peru, where Urton holds on honorary professorship, issued a statement Monday urging Harvard to conduct an investigation into the allegations against Urton.
Depending on the course of that investigation, the PUCP faculty wrote that they may call on their institution to withdraw the distinction granted to Urton, as they would in any case of sexual harassment involving a professor.
In response to the Peruvian faculty letter, Urton wrote that he hopes his contributions to Peruvian culture are judged on their merits.
“I have spent my entire academic career working to help create a better, deeper understanding of the accomplishments and the intellectual and technological achievements of ancient Peruvians, including the Incas, as well as present-day Quechua-speaking peoples of the Andes,” Urton wrote. “I have always enjoyed the support of the students and faculty of PUCP, and of many other institutions in Peru, and I hope that I will be able to count on that support again some day, moving forward, in the future.”
The Museo de Arte de Lima in Peru, where Urton was co-curator of an exhibit on Khipus scheduled to open this year, suspended all collaboration with Urton, according to a statement posted on Twitter Tuesday.
Guedes wrote in her Title IX complaint that she believes Harvard should remove Urton from situations in which he interacts with students because of his alleged behavior.
“I request that this time Harvard do the right thing, and ensure he is removed from his post and no longer able to interact with students,” she wrote. “This must happen definitively and swiftly and he must be removed from all student contact and teaching.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College held a vigil Thursday evening to honor the memory of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and the untold number of victims of racial violence and police brutality.
The virtual gathering, which welcomed students from all 12 undergraduate houses, featured student remarks, music by Kuumba — the oldest black student organization at Harvard — and a benediction by interim minister of Memorial Church Stephanie A. Paulsell.
The vigil centered on an 8 minute and 46 second moment of silence — the length of time that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck, asphyxiating and murdering him.
Undergraduate Council Vice President Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 began the vigil by condemning police brutality and calling for racial justice.
“Over the past few weeks, the gross misconduct, racial bias, and inherent bigoted nature of the law enforcement system has been highlighted on a national and even global scale,” she said. “Our so-called justice system has failed to acknowledge and provide timely justice to the innocent black lives lost at the hands of those who are meant to protect us.”
“The reality is black people are systemically demonized, oppressed and murdered in a country that was literally built by black people,” she added. “We are gathered here today because black lives matter.”
UC President James A. Mathew ’21 said that, over the past five days, the UC organized a campus-wide fundraiser that raised over $35,000 to be distributed among “black solidarity charities.” He said the UC will also be donating an additional $10,000 of its own funds.
“We believe that it is simply not enough to release statements condemning these tragic events,” Mathew said. “Effective support must include action, and it is up to each one of us, no matter our color, to take this action.”
Treasure F. Brooks ’21 said she wished the University had taken greater action as students work to raise funds and demand action from lawmakers.
“I find it absolutely hilarious that the onus has been placed on students to raise funds for racial justice organizations, when our own university is the richest institution in the world with a $38.3 billion endowment,” Brooks said.
Brooks said there was “a great deal of irony” in Harvard holding a vigil for victims of police brutality when the Harvard University Police Department has faced allegations of racism and sexism.
HUPD has also come under fire from students for assisting the Boston Police Department at Black Lives Matter protests in recent days, as well as for allegedly using excessive force in arresting homeless black men in the Smith Campus Center.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an emailed statement that the nation and Harvard both face “important” issues.
"I think we as administrators need to listen closely to our students and engage directly in conversation,” he wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain said the University declined to comment on the student criticisms.
Swain did confirm, however, that University President Lawrence S. Bacow was in attendance at the vigil.

John B. Loengard ’56 was a senior at Harvard College and a photographer for The Crimson when Life magazine approached him to photograph a freighter in Cape Cod in 1956. Thus began his longtime affiliation with the magazine, for which he served as a photographer and later its seventh picture editor.
John P. Ganson ’62, who worked with him at The Crimson, fondly remembered Loengard’s aptitude for printing and love of working in the darkroom.
“When a roll of film is properly developed, it has a sparkle to it. I don't know quite how to describe it, but it kind of looks back at you,” he said. “And when you get negatives that are like that, they are so easy to print and they are just a delight.”
“And you'd look at Loengard's roll of film,” he added. “They were all exposed absolutely perfectly, and they would develop absolutely perfectly.”
Loengard, a celebrated photographer and picture editor who worked at Life magazine, died from heart failure last week. He was 85.
Loengard officially became a staff photographer for Life magazine in 1961 and became a picture editor for Life Special Reports around a decade later, after Life suspended its weekly publication.
Several of his former colleagues and friends said Loengard’s characteristic attention to detail was present throughout his entire career.
Russell Burrows, Loengard’s longtime family friend, called him “the thinking person’s photographer” and the “absolute epitome” of understanding the importance of “anticipation” when taking a photograph. Burrows said Loengard translated this into his work as a picture editor as well.
“They’d [the photographers] come back with dozens or 100 rolls of film, and John would studiously edit all of it,” he said. “At the end when they're waiting for him in the layout block to come in with the final selections of what he’d chosen, he could— and this is partly joking— but he would show up with a single frame and say, ‘Here it is.’ Because in his mind, it was the essence of what the story was supposed to be.”
“He would draw right down to that — that perfect picture,” Burrows added.
Renowned photographer Harry J. Benson, who worked at Life Magazine, said Loengard’s experience as a photographer helped shape his actions as a picture editor.
“His biggest asset was he protected the photographer in meetings when he was a picture editor,” Benson said. “If he saw the photographer being dumped on by writers or the editors, he would protect them.”
“He was a photographer's photographer like nobody else I've ever known, because he understood the problems that you had,” he added.
Burrows echoed this sentiment, describing the way Loengard often advocated on behalf of other photographers in negotiations.
“John, even as sort of a young fellow in the ’60s, was often turned to by the other photographers, as their sort of negotiating representative,” he said.
Over the course of his career, Loengard photographed several famous subjects in black and white, including the Beatles swimming in a pool and Louis Armstrong applying lip balm. In 1966, he photographed Georgia O’Keeffe in a series that would later become some of his most widely recognized work. M.C. Marden, a colleague of Loengard’s from Life’s parent company Time Inc., said Loengard was able to capture O’Keeffe in a way no other photographer could.
“John went down to New Mexico and he did pictures that nobody else got. Everybody else did the sort of formal New Mexico portraits of her,” she said. “John had one incredible picture of her walking across the horizon, with two or three dogs following her, way, way in the distance. Even so, you knew it was Georgia O'Keeffe.”
“The pictures are unlike anybody else's. They are simply John Loengard pictures, because he knew how to present Georgia O'Keeffe in a different way, but presenting her the way she was,” she added.
In 1973, Loengard helped launch People magazine, serving as its first picture editor for three months after its publication. Marden, who became photo editor of People several years after Loengard left, described his contribution to the magazine at its inception.
“In the beginning, they thought that — People Magazine — it would be really very easy to just pick up photography — photography that had previously been shot and just pay space rates for it,” she said. “I think John certainly was the person who said that probably isn't a really great idea and started using a lot of the former Life photographers.”
“That gave, certainly, a strength to the magazine it wouldn't have had if it had simply been non-assigned, non-thought out, non-talked out assignments. So, I think he set the magazine on the right track,” she added.
Loengard later helped Life in its revival as a monthly magazine, serving as its picture editor until 1987. After leaving Life, he freelanced and authored books. In 2018, he was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame.
Well-respected and always willing to give a critique, Loengard was also a trusted source of advice for fellow photographers, young and old.
“He was the only person I ever listened to about photography,” Benson said. “He was always right, and you’d listen to him. And he helped an awful lot of photographers— young photographers.”
“I think when they write a history on photography, he will have to be mentioned for some of his photographs and his generosity of time,” he added.
Indeed, this view was echoed by several of Loengard’s colleagues.
“Everybody looked up to him,” Maddy Miller, a photo editor at People magazine and photographer, said. “In my head, I used to call him the professor, because he was just so full of knowledge.”
“He was just so smart, and he was just great to be around, because you thought you wanted to be a sponge,” Marden said. “You wanted to record everything he said.”
Jill Krementz, a photographer and close friend of Loengard, said he will be remembered not only for his contributions to photography, but also for his character.
“His photographs are embedded into the history of photography,” Krementz wrote in an emailed statement.
“I miss him calling me up at night now,” Benson said. “We'd just chat about nothing.”
Loengard is survived by three children, Anna, Jenna, and Charles; three grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren.
Anna Loengard said her father’s love of photography had a lasting impression on her life.
“As his daughter I think the things that struck me were taking for granted having my whole life documented in these amazing black and white images,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson. “I don’t think I realized until adulthood how unique and special this was.”
Anna said her father was devoted to his grandchildren and enjoyed talking with them, endeavoring to gain “some sense of who they were as individuals with a unique way of seeing the world.”
Having traveled with him on some of his assignments, she also recalled the unique way her father viewed the world through his lens.
“His eye saw things that mine did not,” she wrote. “He was a keen observer and I think to some extent always saw the world through a lens, always looking at the contrast - in images and also in opinions and thought.”
