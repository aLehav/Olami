After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard athletics, yesterday was all about ending droughts. The No. 2 men’s varsity lightweight crew and the men’s lacrosse team each tallied victories against Navy and Princeton, respectively, to bring the end of a winning era for these two dominant opponents.
The varsity eight won at Navy for the first time in 13 years yesterday morning by 5.5 seconds, a time good enough to keep the coveted Haines Cup. The Crimson (8-0) finished in 5:52.2, and the varsity eight was one of four Harvard boats to finish before the No. 3 Midshipmen. The second and third varsity eight, as well as the freshman eight, beat Navy, overcoming a strong Annapolis home crowd for the wins.
Back in Cambridge and on land, the men’s lacrosse team was accomplishing a similar feat, only in a very different sport. Harvard downed the No. 6 Tigers for the first time since 1990, putting itself in the position to secure a spot in the Ivy League tournament. Three goals from sophomore Kevin Vaughan and two goals and an assist from junior Dean Gibbons, who helped maintain a steady first-half shot advantage over Princeton, bolstered the 11-8 victory. The Crimson improves to 6-5 overall and 2-3 in the Ancient Eight and will close out regular season against No. 11 Yale on Saturday.
This post has been revised for the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 27, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 25 sports blog post "Making History" incorrectly stated that the Harvard lightweight varsity crew defeated Navy for the first time in 13 years. In fact, the instance marked the first time the Harvard team won at Navy in 13 years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s lacrosse teams are both looking to lock up spots in post-season play, but regardless of how the rest of the season goes, the two squads have already accomplished something huge for the Crimson lacrosse program.
With the men’s victory yesterday and the women’s win last weekend, this season marks the first in which Harvard lacrosse has swept play against Princeton in 20 years.
Yesterday, the Crimson men built up an early lead and secured an 11-8 win at home against the No. 6 Tigers to keep hopes alive for a spot in the first-ever Ivy League Tournament. The last time the Harvard men’s team defeated Princeton was in 1990—before some of the players on this year’s squad were even born.
The Crimson women’s team took down the Tigers 11-9 at home last weekend, beating the league rival for the first time since 1992. At halftime, the athletic department honored the 1990 Crimson NCAA National Championship team and presented banners to commemorate Harvard lacrosse’s tournament appearances and titles.
Along with the ceremonies, both of this year’s games against Princeton took place on the teams’ Alumni Days, so plenty of former Crimson players returned to Harvard Stadium to cheer on their successors en route to the landmark victories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the week belonged to the ladies of the distance medley team—juniors co-captain Thea Lee and Claire Richardson and freshmen Carlyle Davis and Melissa Bellin—the weekend belonged to Harvard co-captain Jack Brady.
On Friday, the third day of competition for the Crimson men and women’s track and field teams at Penn Relays, Brady placed third in the college men’s eastern championship shot put event. Brady was about 1.5 meters behind first-place finisher Mike Alleman from the University of Connecticut, and 0.2 meters ahead of freshman teammate Edward Brucker, picking up the second medal for Harvard.
The Crimson’s men’s 4x200-meter team also had a successful day, as the squad of co-captain Justin Grinstead, sophomores Jonathan Meminger and John Dingus, and junior John Fahnenstiel placed 28th out of 64 teams.
But Brady shined again on Saturday, as the senior was the only Harvard athlete to compete. Although not as exhilarating as a top-three finish, Brady came in 16th out of 30 individuals competing in the college men’s hammer throw challenge.
While only part of the Crimson team traveled to Philadelphia for the Penn Relays, the whole squad will reunite for May 8’s Heptagonal Championships at Princeton.

Saturday night was as typical as any other—part of the student body cruising for a place to rage (some accompanied by prefrosh worthy of corruption), and others working away at those end-of-semester papers.
But around 10:30 p.m., the Harvard Band broke the monotony by playing a not-so-impromptu concert (check out the video) on Mill Street between Quincy and Leverett, in honor of the latter's 80s Time Warp Dance.
As the music reverberated throughout the River area, spectators lined up against the walls of Old Lev to enjoy the scene. The band members, some of whom dressed for the occasion in brightly colored tights or leg warmers, cheered loudly in between renditions of 80s songs such as "Heaven is a Place on Earth" and "Livin' on a Prayer."
"It's a really cute gig," said Christine K. Son '11, the manager of the band.
This performance had the added benefit of reaching the prefrosh roaming around campus. "We want them to feel excited and welcome about coming to Harvard," said Drum Major Matthew D. Trout '11.
The band's efforts seem to have worked: several large crowds of students (and/or prefrosh) headed directly into old Leverett, in the direction of the dance, while they were playing outside.

Bored with Busch? Think Natural Ice is nasty? Reeling over Rubinoff? Every day, we try to bring you news worth reading, but with The Crimson Cocktail, we offer you news that you can drink.
The Story:
Last weekend Mather proved to be the place to be for students and firefighters alike—but one of those groups wasn’t there to party. Mather Lather, which was sold-out this year, apparently got so crazy that at least two fire alarms were set off. But it was a good time, so no worries, right?
The Drink:
In case you do have regrets from that night, we have a solution: Blame it On The Goose. The spirit of Jamie Foxx and expert bartender Paulo from Grafton Street Pub & Grill have united to make you a drink that you’ll be proud to blame your depraved acts on. Grafton calls it the “Taste of Cambridge,” but we think our name (Blame It On The Goose) might be more appropriate for your needs.
Ingredients:
1. Pour Gray Goose La Poire into a shaker
2. Add St. Germain liqueur
3. Shake it all up
4. Strain into martini glass
5. Top with Nicolas Feuillatte champagne
6. Garnish with lime
Turn on “Blame It” and enjoy your night.
