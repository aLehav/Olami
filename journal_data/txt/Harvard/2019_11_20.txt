After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I don’t usually get disgusted glances from strangers. Stares filled with righteous contempt and palpable revolt, simmering below semi-apologetic smiles. I take care of the image I project, spending way too much time hesitating between identical peach-colored sweaters. And my status as a Harvard student guarantees a certain degree of (undeserved) anthropological admiration from the herds of tourists that roam our campus. The friendly foreign gaze tends to be a given — that is, until I decide to light a cigarette.
Americans love their unhealthy addictions. From Dr. Pepper-Big Mac combos and Republican politics, to the constant blasting of aggressively bad reality TV shows (which blonde white girl will the former jock choose?), this country appears to have a genuine appreciation for the pleasingly self-destructive power of capitalism. But the moment I even so much as finger an overpriced Camel Royal, the entire nation flinches in agony.
Don’t get me wrong: I am well aware of the deleterious effects of smoking. The past two months have been an outright symposium — guest starring every single one of my American friends, as well as a particularly concerned group of Japanese visitors who felt the need to approach me as I smoked under the rain and suggest that I quit immediately — on the health hazard those delightful tar-filled tubes represent.
And while I may brush their concerns off, citing my country’s higher smoking rates and greater life expectancy (a facetious argument, but also a great deflection), I am too personally tied to cancer to ignore their claims. As a child, aware that three out of my four grandparents had suffered malignant tumors at one point or another, I repeatedly tried to get my own mother to quit. I hid her packs, scolded her constantly, and planned devious (albeit unfulfilled) schemes to autograph subtle discouragements onto her cigarettes, sadistically hoping that writing “I love you” right above the orange filter would make her realise what she was endangering.
Even beyond the whole “increasing the likelihood of premature death” issue, smoking is also just very inconvenient. For one, thanks to Massachusetts’ high taxation and the eternal broke-ness of university life, choosing to do so actively hurts my finances. The winter weather doesn’t help either, adding frostbite to the list of potential health hazards. Should I manage to avoid freezing to death, I’d still be left with the inescapable paranoia that that one esteemed faculty member I’m about to meet with will be able to tell that I just went through my last two Marlboros over the course of five minutes. The cigarette life is hardly ideal.
So, asks the American, why on earth do I smoke?
Perhaps there’s an element of nostalgia — lungs pierced in longing. I miss Europe, I miss Spain. I miss Spanish food, olive oil, and tomato rubbed over a piece of toast, softening its crust. I miss my native tongue, a language I speak without marbles in my mouth, where I am not continually harassed by the fear of mispronunciation and pained by a poignant awareness of my mistakes. I miss the bright, harsh sun, the stare of a cloudless sky, the stale, warm air buzzing around me. I miss an entire existence that lies an ocean away, an existence embedded with the comforting scent of burning cigarettes. Resting on an ashtray by a cup of black coffee, making my entire living room foggy over the course of some Tarantino film, casually exchanged between strangers on the street. Nicotine nation. Home.
But there is something else too, something I can never quite put my finger on. Back home, smoking was inherently social. I would light a couple cigarettes in the warm summer nights, right after grabbing dinner with some friends. I would climb out of my window with my sister, legs dangling over the ledge, and lean back against the peeling shutters to enjoy half a pack’s worth of “the last one for tonight.”
In the U.S., smoking feels lonely. Not that I don’t have anyone to smoke with — at this point I have both found fellow smokers and converted a bunch of close friends. We go on walks by the Charles or climb onto rooftops (unidentified, for the sake of my academic standing) and enjoy that rare intimacy that lingers timidly even when the burning ring reaches the filter. I have people to smoke with, yet I mostly smoke alone. I sneak out of a long lecture or an aggressively American birthday breakfast at some overpriced IHOP and quietly light a cigarette. Smoking here, smoking alone, feels real. Oddly so. A campus (a country?) where everything appears coated in layers of calculation; every conversation a multifaceted evaluation of the other, an attempt to network or impress; where buildings aren’t as old as they are pretentious, tacky imitations of foreign styles; where the moral high ground is eternally desirable, but doubtful at best. Image, projection, performativity.
Hence, cigarettes. Sitting silently, feeling the slight rush pulsing through my brain, observing my surroundings. The wet bricks, the light breeze, the ever-busy transients. Smoking in the rain — hot breath in, cold droplets sliding down my skin. Leaving a suffocating prison of essays and extracurriculars, to do nothing but take deep, poisonous breaths. Thinking — overthinking, even — everything.
Perhaps I will quit someday. Give into rationality, the worship of the practical. Try to preserve my own mortality, start running and drinking broccoli shakes. Maybe I will vape instead, suck onto a plastic pen to convince myself that my nicotine addiction is totally okay (it isn’t). Wear Uncle Sam pajamas to watch the Super Bowl. American assimilation.
But in the meantime, I could really do without the disgusted glances. Just let smokers be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College Board’s long-standing practice of selling information on roughly 2.5 million students to almost 2,000 colleges and universities, has come under fire from experts concerned about student privacy and the commodification of admissions. The practice, in which Harvard has long taken part, includes selling the names, approximate SAT/PSAT scores, and some demographic information, including ethnicity, of individual students.
While we recognize these concerns, we believe this program is important because it can help connect high-achieving students with college opportunities they might not have known about otherwise. This is particularly true for students from underprivileged backgrounds with less institutional and familial support through the college application process. Typically, more than 60 percent of Harvard students in a given year will have had their information sold through this process, rising to over 80 percent for minority students. Overall, students who participate in the program — which is optional — are 12 percent more likely to enroll in a four-year college program.
That said, we take issue with some of the College Board’s practices more broadly. First, the commodification of students and their education cannot be overlooked. Though this program might help to facilitate fair and open communication between students and educational institutions, we cannot forget the profit motives behind the College Board’s practices. It’s not a free exchange of data after all. As a result, continued scrutiny to ensure adequate concern for student privacy is appropriate and necessary.
Second, we are concerned that College Board’s apparent monopoly on this information is not really conducive to transparency or equity of access. That begins with the business practices discussed above. But it also pertains to the beliefs of students themselves. The outreach colleges conduct using this data — particularly to students with a limited understanding of the college process, who stand to benefit the most from the program — easily lends itself to misinterpretation. These students may misunderstand outreach programs from colleges purchasing this data as promised acceptance or some kind of preferential treatment. It’s, of course, not.
In not making students aware of the ruthlessly competitive nature of college admissions, the College Board risks disadvantaging the very students this program claims to help by fostering a false sense of security. After all, it is not in the monetary interest of the College Board to dispel any misconceptions about the weight of these letters. Doing so might well diminish their value toward making students feel desirable and confident.
Still, programs that connect high-achieving students, and particularly those from underrepresented groups, are important to breaking down disparities in educational access and attainment across the United States. So far as the College Board can facilitate those connections in a way that respects the privacy and dignity of each individual student, it should continue to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Love, respect, and discipline. Those three values have been instilled in me from a very young age. Growing up in American Samoa, I was taught that love should color every aspect of life as I was constantly surrounded by the laughter and joy of my siblings, parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles, and cousins. I was taught to carry respect everywhere I went, whether it was for my family and peers or for the earth I walked on or the ocean I swam in. And I was taught to have discipline through the ways my cousins and I were to obediently serve our elders and our families at every toana’i, fa’alavelave, and other family functions.
Since being at Harvard, there have been many times where I’ve felt inadequate and have had to draw on these values for strength and perseverance. Love has helped me to remain patient with myself and my mistakes. Respect has helped me to maintain confidence in my ability to achieve. But discipline — that is the value that has often fallen short of helping me. In fact, the value of discipline, as I had learned it back home, has often pushed me towards silence.
In American Samoa, as well as other Pacific cultures, one of the first things every child must learn is discipline. We learn discipline at home, as we are given responsibilities around the house and over our younger siblings from an early age. We learn discipline at school, as we are not to question what we are taught. And we learn discipline in our villages, as we are taught to serve our communities in any capacity that we can. Having been raised in this way, I’ve gained many valuable qualities, such as self-accountability and reliability, as well as how to be a good listener. I’ve been able to employ these qualities in my academic, extracurricular, and social life here on campus.
However, while I appreciate the qualities that I have gained, I cannot ignore one of the main things that I was taught from this value of discipline — silence. At home, we are taught to quietly obey our parents and never complain, regardless of any personal struggle we might be facing. At school, we are not encouraged to critically engage with our material and question what we are being taught. And in our villages, it is taboo to call out or vocally challenge our authority figures. Any of these actions would constitute a deep disrespect and unappreciation of our families, our schools, our institutions, and our community.
The value placed on this respect and appreciation, especially for our families and communities, is easily understandable since they continually give and sacrifice so much for us every day. And in return for all that they sacrifice, it makes sense that our silent, unquestioning discipline is the least we could give back to them. But this silent discipline hurts us more than it helps us.
The silence that accompanies this discipline does not allow us to express or speak out about what we might be dealing or struggling with. Because we are expected to be silent and obedient, we are not allowed to have problems. We are not allowed to struggle. According to a 2008 New Zealand Ministry of Health report, 46.5 percent of surveyed Pacific people had experienced some type of mental disorder at some point in their lives — including depression, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. Although there are a lot of factors that go into this statistic, this culture of silent discipline only worsens the problem and has lasting effects. In fact, even today, I still find it difficult confiding in my friends, family, professors, and advisors when I am struggling because I have been conditioned to stay silent.
This silence also does not allow us to critically engage with, question, and challenge things that we might disagree with. Protesting is quite uncommon (though it has become a bit more common as of late) and looked down upon as a disrespect of our elders and authority figures. In fact, I had never seen a protest in my life until my junior year of high school, when members of the American Samoa legislature tried to raise their salaries instead of allocating that money to much needed improvements in education or healthcare. After a large group of teachers, students, and other professionals protested outside of the Fono building, President Gaoteote Togafau Palaie said the Fono does not work according to the wishes of "people who roam the streets and take their issues to the media", effectively criticizing the protestors for exercising their right to protest. We see that the subtle invocation of the value of discipline is often used to condemn and silence our voices.
This silencing goes even beyond questioning things that are only happening within our local communities. It extends to the classroom, where we are not empowered to challenge what we are being taught but instead encouraged to take it as law. But, we must not feel the pressure of silence when we disagree with Western thought and philosophy that places itself above the valuable knowledge that our societies produce. Having been raised in a tradition of silent discipline, one of the biggest things that I struggled with when I got to Harvard was being able to challenge what I was learning in class. I was taught to silently appreciate what was given to me, not challenge it. So when I read a lot of Western theory, though I may have had my qualms about some of its racist and sexist undertones, I did not think it was my place to question or challenge it.
But it is our place. It is our place to speak, whether it’s about what we are struggling with or what we don’t agree with. Having respect, discipline, and appreciation in everything we do is not mutually exclusive with speaking up. If we truly want to respect and appreciate our families, our institutions, and our communities, we should not be silent. We should speak up, so that we can eventually have productive conversations and work together towards a more accepting, communicative community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Tax Court found that former Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. failed to file income tax returns from 2005 through 2013 and failed to pay the Internal Revenue Service more than $1 million in an opinion released Tuesday.
The IRS brought the case in order to collect an outstanding tax balance from 2012 and 2013, which amounted to $1,231,775. Sullivan, who is also a Harvard Law School professor, wrote in a 2017 form he submitted to the IRS that he did not believe he should have to pay the assessed 2013 balance.
“I did not (nor have I ever made) enough money to justify a $1.2M tax,” he wrote.
USTC judge Albert G. Lauber issued a summary judgement — meaning the court did not hold a full trial — after Sullivan failed to respond to multiple requests that he provide evidence that the IRS incorrectly assessed his assets in determining his tax bill. Lauber ruled that the IRS is entitled to collect the money it believes Sullivan owes.
Sullivan, who represented himself in the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the court’s decision Tuesday evening.
Sullivan made national headlines earlier this year after he decided to represent Harvey Weinstein in his criminal case while simultaneously serving as faculty dean of Winthrop House. Harvard College declined to renew Sullivan as faculty dean in May after a semester of student outcry over his decision to join Weinstein’s legal team. At the time, students argued his response to their concerns was inadequate.
Over the course of 2017, the IRS sent Sullivan three letters informing him he would need to file his 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 returns in order to contest the amount he was required to pay. At one point, the assigned IRS settlement officer scheduled a date for a telephone hearing; Sullivan did not call in on the appointed date, provide relevant financial documents, or provide tax returns. In total, the IRS sent Sullivan at least seven messages attempting to inform him of the outstanding tax balance.
IRS records showed that Sullivan also failed to file tax returns from 2005 to 2011, according to the court.
Lauber wrote in the opinion that the bulk of what Sullivan owed in 2013 likely stemmed from the sale of his former home in Newton, Mass. Sullivan sold the house for $1,865,000 that year. From 2009 to 2019, he and his wife Stephanie R. Robinson served as faculty deans of Winthrop House and lived in the deans’ residence overlooking the Charles River.
In 2018, Sullivan sent the IRS a letter petitioning the court to overturn the IRS’s decision, writing that he did not receive notice of the hearing dates or his missing tax returns.
In April, the court again requested that Sullivan provide to the IRS “on or before June 15, 2019, a statement showing all income he received for tax years 2012 and 2013 and the dollar amount of each deduction to which he believes he is entitled for each year.”
Sullivan did not subsequently provide the requested documents. The IRS then requested summary judgement, to which Sullivan also did not respond. Lauber wrote that Sullivan may now propose a plan to pay the outstanding tax bill, including paying in installments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a more than year-long vacancy, the search for an associate dean of students for inclusion and belonging is in its “final stages,” Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said in an interview Tuesday.
College administrators have been looking to fill this position since the former Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis stepped down in September 2018 after a year-long tenure. The Dean of Students Office — which is overseeing the search, according to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana — will likely interview finalists on campus before the end of the semester.
“We hope to bring candidates to campus in early December and hopefully be able to conclude that for someone to start as soon as possible,” O’Dair said.
In February, O’Dair and Khurana announced in an email that the College’s Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion — which Davis oversaw — and the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations would merge to form a single office under the auspices of the DSO. O’Dair also informed College affiliates in an email that Khurana would establish a working group of students, faculty, and staff to provide input on the dean search and review the new office’s mission.
The associate dean of students for inclusion and belonging will oversee the new office. O’Dair said the DSO is looking for a candidate who has “a new way of thinking” about student support.
“We are looking for someone who has a vision for what a, kind of, revitalized equity diversity inclusion area, someone who deeply understands intersectionality, intra- and intercultural competencies, and learning around multiple identities,” O’Dair said.
Harvard has retained executive search firm Spelman Johnson to assist with the search, according to an online job posting, which notes an application deadline of Oct. 25, 2019 — more than one year after Davis left his position. Ten years of experience in a “complex” organization, knowledge of the “functions and purpose of diversity and inclusion efforts,” and “keen political acumen” are among expected qualifications for the position, as is a master’s degree or doctorate, according to the posting.
O’Dair declined to say whether the College is considering external candidates or current Harvard administrators as finalists for the position.
In addition to the Harvard Foundation, the new associate dean will oversee the four other divisions of the EDI Office — the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Office of Diversity Education and Support, the College’s Title IX Office, and the Women’s Center. The Title IX Office has started reporting directly to O’Dair following Davis’s departure, while Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller has overseen the other three divisions.
The EDI Office supervises a number of on-campus initiatives involving peer education and support for women, BGLTQ students, and students of color. The Office of Diversity Education and Support oversees Diversity Peer Educators — a group of student facilitators who conduct outreach and host events on behalf of the EDI Office.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Friday interview that Harvard will need to continue research and planning before making any decisions regarding a possible multicultural center.
“I appreciate that from a student's perspective that things can seem like they take a longer time. And partly, you know, it's because constructing anything — and then you have to maintain it and sustain it and make sure that it outlasts the sort of current moment — takes time,” Khurana said.
Several candidates in the recently concluded Undergraduate Council presidential election proposed establishing a multicultural center. UC president- and vice president-elect James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 have advocated converting a floor of the Smith Campus Center into a multicultural space. Other candidates proposed that the UC rent off-campus space for a multicultural center.
Khurana also cited the work of the Symbols and Spaces Committee the College created last year in response to the candidates’ proposals. In February, he said the group would use student feedback to create diversity-related programming and examine how Harvard uses its physical spaces.
“Part of what we’re working on, and we're doing work through our Symbols and Spaces Committee, is what is the nature of the kinds of spaces students are looking for? What's the programming? What happens in those places? Who are the people you want to see in those places? What's the staff that you want to see in those?” he said Friday.
The UC candidates’ proposals for a multicultural center mark the latest effort in decades of student calls for such a space on campus. Student activism for a multicultural center stretches back to the 1960s and 70s, but the University has yet to approve any such plans.
A 2018 University-wide diversity task force identified the continued development of “inclusive symbols and spaces” as a priority for Harvard. The UC created a “Multicultural Center Coalition” in 2018 that has solicited student perspectives on the matter and sent plans for a center to Khurana.
Khurana said he hopes to work with Mathew and White-Thorpe when they take office to integrate student feedback into the College’s planning. The pair declined to comment on their multicultural center proposal.
Khurana also spoke about the challenges of repurposing physical space at the College, citing the construction of the Smith Campus Center, which started in 2016. He said he understands that students often want to see physical changes during their four years at Harvard, but that the College’s timeline often stretches for much longer.
“I think what we try to do as much as possible is work on trying to address things that are in the short term that we can be very responsive to, identify those things in the medium term as we sort of think about spaces where we locate something, and then also understand the long term that these things require,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former United States government officials and policy experts, including former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter and former Treasury Secretary and former University President Lawrence H. Summers, participated in a live simulation of a White House National Security Council meeting at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Tuesday.
Kennedy School professor and former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns, former deputy national security adviser Meghan L. O’Sullivan, former chief of staff to the Defense Secretary Eric B. Rosenbach, and former U.S. Ambassador to India Richard R. Verma also joined the simulation, among the ten experts.
The simulation took place two years into the future on November 19, 2021. In the scenario, China has hypothetically unveiled a new currency known as the digital yuan and spread this currency to Southeastern Asian countries.
During the simulation, the mock cabinet members, including the National Security Advisor, Secretary of Defense, and Vice President, reacted to breaking news of new North Korean missile tests. The North Korean government evaded economic sanctions levied on them by using the available digital currency to develop the missiles, according to a mock breaking news alert at the beginning of the event.
The National Security Council meeting was run by the National Security Advisor, role-played by Rosenbach. At the beginning of the simulation, Rosenbach established a directive for the pseudo cabinet meeting.
“We’ll conclude by seeing what our interests are at stake here and trying to come up with options for the President so that we can give her a holistic strategy,” Rosenbach said.
Kennedy School students created the simulation. The students also formulated policy briefs and prepared the participants throughout the week ahead of the event.
Transformed into a mock situation room, the usual stage at the forum was replaced by a long table with the American flag and seal in the background. The principal cabinet members sat around the table during the scenario to re-enact a typical National Security Council meeting.
After more than an hour of debate amongst the experts, the group concluded on a set of recommendations to deliver to the president. Their plan called on the U.S. president to create a line of communication with the Chinese president to prevent the North Korean government from advancing missile development.
“We’re going to talk about new avenues for cooperation...to have them help us stop the North Koreans from using the digital yuan,” Rosenbach said. “Make sure they understand that if there’s a threat to the United States from the North Korean missile program and they have been part of that, knowing of or otherwise, that carries grave strategic consequences for our relationship.”
The group also proposed creating a new digital currency for the United States to rival the hypothetical digital yuan.
Audience members said the unorthodox format of the forum was a draw for them.
Ronald J. Kornish II ’87 said that while he came to see what the situation room re-enactment would look like, what resonated most was the purpose behind the simulation.
“They do these exercises at the Kennedy School to forecast what might happen in the future, and they do it all for the students,” Kornish said. “That’s why people come to learn, that’s why people come back, who’ve taught here. They come back to be on these panels and to make the world a better place.”

A new working paper by Students for Fair Admissions expert witness Peter S. Arcidiacono alleged that Harvard sends recruitment materials to African American high school students who “effectively have no chance of being admitted” in order to raise the number of African American applicants to the school each year and lower the College’s acceptance rate.
The paper — accepted to the National Bureau of Economics Research on Monday — uses documents that the College made public as a part of its ongoing lawsuit with SFFA, an anti-affirmative action advocacy group. SFFA sued Harvard in 2014, alleging that the College unlawfully discriminates against Asian American applicants.
Arcidiacono wrote that 38 percent of African American applicants to Harvard had “essentially no chance of admission based on their test scores alone.” The paper has not been peer reviewed.
Harvard has long purchased student information — including students’ names, ethnicities, and test scores — from College Board’s Student Search Program and other similar recruitment services. When recruiting students for the Class of 2012, Harvard sent out more than 112,000 letters to students as part of the program; for the Class of 2017, it sent 114,000.
Arcidiacono found that — excluding athletes, legacy students, students tapped by the Dean of Admissions and Director of Admissions, and children and faculty of staff — African American students accounted for 41 percent of applicants whose test scores and GPAs fell in the bottom decile of the overall applicant pool. Harvard eventually admitted just 0.03 percent of those applicants.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that, in a typical year, more than 60 percent of Harvard freshmen were among the names the College purchased from Student Search. The same percentage is much higher — over 80 percent — for minority students at the College.
In the paper, Arcidiacono focused on Harvard’s recruiting efforts from the Class of 2008 through the Class of 2012 because the number of African American applicants to the College grew 58 percent during that period, from 6.4 to 10.1 percent of the total.
“At the same, there was no change over that same period in the share of admits who were African American,” Arcidiacono wrote in an email.
During the time period Arcidiacono studied, the acceptance rate for African American applicants to Harvard dropped from 16.7 percent to 7.8 percent.
Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Natasha Kumar Warikoo said that she does not think that admissions officers are “intentionally” recruiting students who do not have a chance of admission.
“What the article is kind of implicitly trying to argue — and they talked about this in the conclusion — is that that the University is doing this knowingly because of an interest in keeping the admit rates of all the different racial groups the same, so that claims that African Americans have an easier time getting in than Asian Americans or white Americans can't be made,” Warikoo said. “I am not convinced that that is what's happening.”
She added that she thinks Harvard lowered the cutoff score for minority recruitment in order to attract more African American applicants and compensate for issues that researchers have identified with standardized tests like the SAT with regard to race and socioeconomic status.
“It’s not a very good predictor of your grades in freshman year, especially for African American students,” she said. “It's highly correlated with your incomes and your neighborhood.”
Warikoo said she thinks that the arguments Arcidiacono makes in the paper are similar to the ones SFFA made in its case against Harvard.
“This does feel a little more connected to the argument they're making in the trial — ‘look at the lengths they're going to create this facade of racial equity and non-discrimination towards Asians and whites,’” she said.

Several departments may delay grading or change final exam formats in the event that Harvard’s graduate student union goes on strike next month, according to faculty members across the University.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers will strike if it does not reach a contract agreement with the University by Dec. 3, the union announced earlier this month. The two sides remain at odds over several key issues in the more than year-old negotiations process, including compensation, health insurance, and grievance procedures for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
Since union voters overwhelmingly authorized the strike late last month, multiple department heads across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have sent emails to undergraduates informing them that their grades may be delayed in the event of a strike.
History and Literature Director of Undergraduate Studies Lauren Kaminsky wrote in an email to undergraduates last week that the department would not hire temporary instructors to fill in for teaching staff represented by the union.
The potential effects of a strike, however, will likely vary by department. Astronomy Chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb wrote in an email that other departments are “much more dependent” than his on their teaching assistants.
“The Astronomy department faculty are fully prepared [for] the potential strike and we do not expect any significant disruptions to our courses,” he wrote.
Economics Director of Graduate and Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey Miron said that though exams may pose a “major” logistical challenge to the department in the event of a strike, faculty should be able to handle the issue “fairly easily.”
Professors will likely have to grade exams themselves, and those teaching large courses may make finals multiple choice to streamline grading, according to Miron. For instance, the final exam for Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” — which has 601 students — will consist of “exclusively” multiple choice questions, according to an email to students from head teaching fellow Anne N. Le Brun.
“The main alternative, if you don't have a TF, is you can do the thing yourself,” Miron said.
Psychology Director of Undergraduate Studies Jill M. Hooley and Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies Katherine E. Powers wrote in an email to concentrators that they should expect “course-related” meetings, assignments, and exams to be held on schedule, but that grading may be delayed. Social Studies Chair Eric Beerbohm and Director of Studies Anya Bassett wrote in an email to their concentrators that they have asked faculty to “determine how they will hold their courses” in the event of a strike.
Some faculty members indicated that they planned to support graduate students throughout the strike.
“I have never crossed a picket line in my life, and I do not plan to start now,” History professor Walter Johnson wrote in an email.
Impacts of the strike will likely extend beyond the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — roughly 150 faculty members across the University have signed onto a non-retaliation letter posted to HGSU’s website.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an email to Kennedy School affiliates that he is committed to the “continued learning” of students.
“Therefore, even if student teaching assistants go on strike, instruction in courses, grading of coursework, and advising of students will continue,” he wrote.
A strike “toolkit” released by HGSU asks faculty to “refuse to replace” student labor by declining to grade assignments typically graded by teaching fellows and not running study sessions usually facilitated by student workers. HGSU has also encouraged faculty to engage in “disruption of class activities” by cancelling classes or moving them off campus or online. The guide asks that they withhold grades until the strike ends.

So you’ve figured out your Harvard-Yale ticketing, housing, and transportation, but you have yet to solve your most pressing Harvard-Yale concern: what your Insta caption should be. For many Harvard students, The Game is the one event of the year where you’re almost guaranteed to secure an Insta-worthy post. But in a sea of posts of smiling Harvard students in H sweaters, how are you going to give your caption that zing to set it apart? Here are some witty captions to boost your Harvard-Yale Insta game.
“Getting to the Yale Bowl was truly a Hike”
Pay tribute to the trek to the Yale Bowl while showcasing your limited football knowledge! And if anyone has the audacity to insult your caption, tell them to take a hike.
“Yaled so loud for Harvard, I lost my voice”
While it’s hard to think of many pros of Yale at this time of the year, one thing you have to give them is the punnability of their name. Show off your school spirit by letting your peers know just how much you love Harvard. #GOCRIMSON
“Looking Connecti-cute”
Embrace your inner basic by taking advantage of the fact that you finally got off-campus this semester! Have a follower who doesn’t appreciate the caption? Time to Connecti-cut them off.
“If I got a quarter(back) for _________, I’d have a lot of quarters”
First quarter of the game and you’re already bored? Let your followers know what classic Harvard-Yale shenanigans you had to suffer through for the duration of the weekend.
“HY is not worth the HYpe”
Didn’t have the best Harvard-Yale experience? You don’t need a super witty caption — the fact that you’re willingly admitting something that will no doubt cross all of our minds at some point is enough to set your post apart. At the end of the day, you still got an Insta-worthy post to boast!
And hey, if none of these captions quite do it for you, there’s always the classic #yuckfale and #safetyschool to fall back on.

The Game is coming up fast, but let’s be honest: The real nail-biter isn’t seeing who gets the most touchdowns — it’s seeing who can survive the never-ending logistical mess of even getting there in the first place. Luckily, we’re here to help with at least one portion of your logistical woes: transportation. Check out some of the most popular routes we’ve found to get you to New Haven.
The Classic: HSA Bus
Organized by HSA and publicized by the College, these shuttles are the classic route to get you to New Haven. With a cost of $58, these may be a little more expensive than you’d hope for, but this does cover both to and from Yale, and are SEF eligible. These are also great for convenience, as you can buy tickets right from the Smith Campus Center Box Office. Pick a time that works best for you, and leave right from the Science Center! Just make sure to buy tickets ASAP, and bring along a pair of earbuds for that 2-3 hour bus ride.
The Alternative: Some Other Bus Service
With the experience of an HSA bus but for at least slightly cheaper, you can also try another bus service like Greyhound or Boltbus. Make sure to buy these ASAP as the best times are quickly selling out, but they can be another great transportation option (especially if you’re looking to get away from a bus full of just Harvard students).
The Speedy: Train
Perfect for those who hate the evening traffic that we’ll inevitably encounter getting to and from Yale, the train can be a nice speedy alternative. While it will likely set you back between $150 and $250 (in the case of Amtrak), it has plenty of times to choose from and can make your ride a little more comfortable.
The Independent: Zipcar
For those wanting a little more flexibility in their plans, a Zipcar can also be a good option. You’ll want to make sure to sign up for an account ahead of time, but if you already have one you should be all set to rent a car near campus. It’ll cost you somewhere between $100 and $200 depending on the type of car you get and how long you rent it for, but get some friends to join you for a road trip to help make that price a little more manageable. Don’t forget about parking!
The Energy-Efficient: Walking
Will it take you nearly two days to get there? Perhaps. However, consider how much energy you’ll save by choosing this fun scenic route! We’re always being told to slow down and smell the roses, so take this advice to heart and truly savor those 136 miles between here and New Haven.
