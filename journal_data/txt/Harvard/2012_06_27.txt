After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard administrator said the University does not intend to alter its sexual assault policies in response to Yale’s recent settlement over a complaint that alleged that Yale’s sexual misconduct grievance procedures violated Title IX.
In an agreement with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, Yale agreed to uphold its recent policy changes—including its adoption of the lower “preponderance of the evidence” standard, which requires the university to be at least 51 percent certain of an alleged perpetrator’s guilt before issuing a guilty verdict. The previous policy required a “clear preponderance of the evidence,” a more stringent burden of proof.
“We don’t have any plans to make changes but we are still looking at our policy and our practices,” Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison wrote in an email. “Yale’s situation was different than ours but we can learn from them.”
Currently, Harvard employs different standards of evidence among its various schools. The Law School uses the more stringent “burden of proof” standard--which requires about 80 percent proof for a guilty verdict--while the Faculty of Arts and Sciences requires that the Administrative Board be “sufficiently persuaded” of an accused student’s responsibility for an alleged incident.
For the past two years, Harvard has been in the process of conducting an internal review of its sexual assault grievance procedures to ensure that it is compliant with the guidelines set forth in a “Dear Colleague” letter, which was released in April 2011 by the OCR.
Harvard Law School is also currently under investigation by the OCR for alleged violations of Title IX in its sexual misconduct grievance procedures. A spokesperson for the OCR said that federal officials do not have a timetable in place for resolving the complaint.
Yale’s settlement with the OCR was announced on June 15 after a fifteen-month investigation. The OCR’s probe of Yale was launched after 16 Yale students and alumni filed a complaint in March 2011 alleging that Yale had not responded “in a prompt and equitable” manner to correct a sexually hostile campus environment. The complaint came just months after a video of a group of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity members chanting “No means yes! Yes means anal!” during a pledge event on Yale’s Old Campus made national headlines.
During the OCR’s investigation, Yale moved to update its procedures, establishing the University Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct last July—which was already in motion before the complaint—and naming a campus Title IX coordinator last November.
Although the OCR did not find Yale guilty of noncompliance with Title IX, Yale’s settlement stipulated that the University report to the OCR until the end of May 2014.
Wendy Murphy, the lawyer who filed the complaint against Harvard Law School in 2010, said she thinks that the OCR would be inconsistent if it did not require Harvard to make the same changes that Yale agreed to as part of its settlement agreement.
Murphy pointed to three changes made by Yale in advance of the settlement—its adoption of the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, its new standard for prompt resolution of complaints, and its new requirement to lay out clear timeframes about the duration of an investigation—as issues that are being explored in the investigation of Harvard Law School that is currently underway.
“It may not be mandatory binding legal precedent on all schools to have something happen to Yale, but it matters and schools should pay attention because it’s the writing on the wall,” said Murphy, who is a professor at the New England School of Law.
Still, Murphy said, the OCR’s hesitance to universally enforce mandates delivered in individual cases may allow Harvard to maintain its existing policies, at least for some time.
“OCR has never been clear that there’s real force in the rulings against other schools,” Murphy said. “Most schools—I’ll put Harvard in that list—think that they’re not necessarily required to abide by a ruling if it comes down against another school.”
This past spring, several of Harvard’s peer institutions—including the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell—made changes to their sexual assault policies that also sparked speculation that Harvard may be persuaded to follow suit.

As the Supreme Court nears judgment day on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, professors at Harvard and other colleges said that the act was constitutional but were unsure what ruling the nation’s highest court would make by Thursday.
The PPACA, informally called “Obamacare,” would serve as one the largest overhauls of the healthcare system in America. In debating whether the bill would pass or not, professors especially contested how the justices would vote.
“My prediction is that it will be five-four against the constitutionality of the mandate,” said Harvard Law School professor Richard D. Parker.
Parker predicted that Associate Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76 would vote against the act. But other scholars, however, were less certain.
“Kennedy is kind of a loose cannon,” said Yale Law School professor Robert A. Burt. “Sometimes he's quite formalistic and sometimes there's something about a case that grabs him about human suffering.”
Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 said that he expected both Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts to join the more liberal judges in upholding the constitutionality of the act.
“I expect the Supreme Court to uphold the Obama health care law in its entirety by a vote of 6-3 with Chief Justice Roberts writing for the majority, with a concurring opinion by Justice Kennedy, and with several very angry dissents by Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito,” Tribe wrote in an email to the Crimson. “Nobody has a crystal ball, of course, but that’s my best bet.”
Burt agreed that Roberts might vote for the act, if only to write the majority and construe the court’s decision in an extremely narrow sense. He added that though he expected Scalia to vote against the act, it was possible that he would draw upon his own opinion from “Gonzales v. Raich,” where he as part of the majority ruled that the federal government has the right to ban medicinal marijuana even when overriding a state’s decision to legalize it, acknowledging the power of the federal government when regulating commerce.
Many, such as Law School professor Einer R. Elhauge ’82, have argued that a very similar argument can be made to support the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. But both Elhauge and Burt said that this outcome was somewhat unlikely.
“Scalia, in particular, made lots of statements that I would say are contrary to his opinion in the medical marijuana case,” Elhauge said.
Other points of debate included whether the entire act or just portions of it would be struck down.
“I think they will uphold the Medicaid limitations,” said Yale Law School professor William N. Eskridge, Jr. “I think there is a good chance—a likely chance—that they will strike down the individual mandate.”
Law School professor Richard Fallon agreed that the individual mandate would be struck down, noting that the fate of the Medicaid limitations depends on the act’s severability—the ability of portions of a law to be enforced if other parts are found illegal or unconstitutional.
Most professors, however, said that they personally believed the act to be constitutional. Even professors who disagreed with portions of the act, such as Yale Law School professor Peter H. Schuck, held this view.
“The Constitution permits government to coerce people in a variety of ways: taxes, the draft, obtaining a passport to travel,” Schuck wrote in an email. In the case of a well-debated and important law, “the Court should only strike it down if the violation is very clear, not where as here invalidation would be a stretch.”
Other scholars, like Parker, were less dismissive of the arguments against Obamacare. Parker said many scholars and pundits had failed to apply legal realism and forgotten that precedents can be changed. According to him, many of the justices see this case as a quickly receding opportunity.
“If they let this go, I don't believe that they will see any foreseeable prospect of stopping federal expansion,” Parker said.
Though Burt more emphatically defended the constitutionality of the act, he similarly acknowledged that the final decision will be made not by scholars, but by the justices.
“The Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is,” Burt said. “We'll learn on Thursday if [the act] is constitutional.”

Two days into what many consider the most difficult event on the swimming calendar, 12 Olympic tickets have already been punched by American athletes at the US Olympic Swimming Trials in Omaha, NE.
The event, which concludes on July 2nd, features 26 current, former and future Crimson athletes. All the action can be watched on the NBC family of networks as well as online at http://www.nbcolympics.com/.
Through 11 events, no Harvard swimmers have progressed past the Heat stage, but there have been some impressive performances.
In the Men’s 400 meter Individual Medley incoming freshman Christian Carbone finished in a time of 4:26.11, good for 30th out of a 109 swimmer field and just 15 seconds off the pace of America’s two big-name qualifiers in the event, six-time Olympic Medalist Ryan Lochte and 16-time Olympic Medalist Michael Phelps. Rising sophomore Mike Gaudiani also raced in the 400 IM, placing 97th.
Gaudiani and classmate Reed Snyder raced in the 400 meter freestyle, placing 106th and 96th, respectively, with three-time Olympic Medalist Peter Vanderkaay and Florida teammate Connor Dwyer taking the coveted Olympic spots.
Rising juniors Spenser Goodman and Chris Satterthwaite and rising sophomore Zach Walters competed in the 200 meter freestyle, all placing 90th and above. Four-time Ivy League Champion Satterthwaite also raced in the 100 meter backstroke, finishing 121st.
Rounding out the competition on the men’s side was rising sophomore Chuck Katis who came 37th in the 100 meter breast stroke. Four-time Olympic Medalist Brendan Hansen and cancer survivor Eric Shanteau will be representing the United States in London.
The top performer on the women’s side was rising sophomore Courtney Otto. The New Yorker finished 28th in the 400 meter IM behind Olympians Elizabeth Beisel and Caitlin Leverenz, and will also be competing in the 200 meter butterfly and 200 meter IM. Classmate Faith Martin also raced in the 400 meter IM, placing 106th.
Kate Mills ’11 placed 35th in the 100 meter butterfly, behind Olympic Gold Medalist Dana Vollmer and Claire Donahue. Mills, who graduated with the highest career point total in the Ivy League, will also compete in the 200 meter butterfly.
Rounding out the competition a trio of Crimson swimmers raced in the 400 meter freestyle. Rising sophomore Kelsey Hojan-Clark, incoming freshman Margaret Ramsey and recent graduate Catherine Zagroba ’12 placed 87th, 82nd and 73rd respectively.
Rising senior Mackenzie Luick placed 143rd in the 100 meter breast stroke and incoming freshman Kendall Crawford placed 141st in the 100 meter back stroke.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 Ivy League Player of the Year and 2012 second-team All-Ivy forward Keith Wright ’12 has spent the last few months preparing for the NBA Draft, which begins tomorrow, June 28.
Wright has worked out for a number of teams, including the Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics, and Golden State Warriors.
Wright will most likely go undrafted, but has a chance of being picked in the late second round. At 6’8”, Wright is undersized at the 4, but lacks the midrange game and athleticism of a 3. Working in his favor are an array of post-moves and a nose for the ball on the offensive glass.
After a stellar junior season in which Wright led Harvard to its first Ivy League co-championship with 15.4 points per game, 8.9 rebounds per game and 2.1 blocks per game, expectations were high coming into his senior year.
Though the team achieved more success, the offense became much more balanced, with junior Kyle Casey taking more of a lead role on the scoring end, and Wright becoming a secondary option.
Wright continued to perform at a high level—he registered 10.6 points, 8.1 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and an impressive 58.6 field goal percentage—but poor performances against bigger, more athletic big men in UConn’s Andre Drummond and Vanderbilt’s Festus Ezeli exposed some potential weaknesses on the next level.
In two matchups with the premier big-men, Wright averaged 8.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and just 33 percent shooting from the field while giving up a field goal percentage of 80, both in losing efforts. Both Drummond and Ezeli, 7’0” and 6’11”, respectively, are projected to go in the first round, with Drummond expected to be a top-10 pick.
Despite Harvard’s recent success on the national level, reaching the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946, there still remains the question of the Crimson’s pedigree as a basketball program. Jeremy Lin ’10 did a lot to quell any doubts, and Wright’s reputation as an undersized and under-athletic Harvard graduate sound a lot like the same criticisms lobbed Lin’s way leading up to the draft two years ago.
Lin ended up going undrafted and the team that eventually signed him, the Warriors, may be looking to make good on a blunder of its own. After signing, Lin spent his rookie season with Golden State, seeing limited action outside of the D-League before being released. After a brief stop with the Houston Rockets, Lin ended up on the New York Knicks—and we all know what happened next.
Before Lin’s contract situation was resolved with the Knicks, there was talk of the Warriors trying to get back in on the Linsanity. Perhaps they, or some other team, will try and make amends with the Harvard faithful by making Wright just the second Crimson player in the NBA in the last 50 years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
OMAHA—Niall Janney breathed heavily as he floated toward the pool wall.  He had just completed one of swimming’s most physically-demanding races, the 200-meter butterfly. It wasn’t Janney’s best performance, but it was a special one.
Twenty-seven Harvard-affiliated swimmers are competing in the U.S. Olympic Trials this week at CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Neb. Among these swimmers are thirteen returning student-athletes and eight recruits. In addition, four swimmers from the Class of 2012 will be swimming their last races for the Crimson: Niall Janney, Meghan Leddy, Hilary Roberts, and Catherine Zagroba.
On the third day of Trials on Wednesday, Janney swam nearly three seconds slower than his best time in the 200 butterfly, finishing 123rd in a 139-swimmer field. But he walked away from the pool content, having concluded his career on one of swimming’s grandest stages.
“It was a little bit of a disappointing swim for me personally, but it’s a terrific feeling being able to finish off my career here at Trials with my teammates,” Janney said. “I couldn’t be happier representing Harvard in my last swim; it feels really good.”
Yesterday, Catherine Zagroba also wrapped up her career with the Crimson with a 73rd-place finish in the 400 freestyle. She looks forward to following the women’s team next year as she works in Boston.
“It just means so much to be here with all the Harvard girls,” said Zagroba after her race. “I wouldn’t be here without all of their support.”
Through the first three days of Olympic Trials, Harvard swimmers and recruits have accounted for 24 individual swims in 10 different events. Rising sophomore Courtney Otto has led the Crimson with a 22nd-place finish in the 200 individual medley.
“I was happy with the swim,” said Otto. “I was really trying to work on my backstroke and breaststroke legs; I tried to speed up my tempo in those strokes.”
Otto, who represented Harvard at the NCAA Championships this spring, dropped nearly two seconds from her previous best time and narrowly missed the top-16 semifinal round. She looks forward to competing in her best event, the 200 butterfly, tomorrow.
On the men’s side, rising sophomore Chuck Katis turned in a 37th-place finish in the 100 breaststroke on the first day of competition. Katis broke school records in the 100- and 200-yard breaststrokes in his debut collegiate season earlier this year.
“The whole race felt great, though I think I tightened up a little bit at the end,” said Katis, who will swim the 200 breaststroke tomorrow and the 200 individual medley on Friday.
While the Trials represent a final farewell for graduated Harvard swimmers, it also provides a first look at important new additions to the men’s and women’s programs. Trials competitors Steven Kekacs, Christian Yeager, Jacob Luna, Christian Carbone, and Tyler Rocca will join the men’s team next year as members of the Class of 2016. Margaret Ramsey, Kendall Crawford, and Connie Hsu will join the women’s.
“[The men’s team] did really well this year, but with our recruiting class, we’ll be really strong,” said Kekacs. “It should be a good match-up between us and Princeton at Ivies.”
The Harvard men placed a close second to Princeton at the 2012 Ivy League Championships in March.
“I’m looking forward to them coming in and producing a whole new dynamic for the team,” Otto said of the women’s recruits.
The Trials is also new women’s assistant coach Chris Morgan’s first major meet with the team. Otto expressed disappointment at the departure of popular coach Matt Davidson, but is excited about what Morgan brings to the table.
“I think Chris is going to be great,” said Otto. “He has a lot of new ideas for our dry-land program and our training sets.”
Olympic open water swimming qualifier Alex Meyer, Class of 2010, is seeded 12th in the men’s 1,500 free, which will be contested in the final two days of the meet.  If he places first or second in the 1,500, he would be the first American to compete in open water and pool events in a single Olympiad.
“Alex is a really great influence on all of us, someone whom we all aspire to,” said Janney, who was a sophomore the year Meyer captained the men’s team.
Meyer will travel with Harvard men’s head coach Tim Murphy to London next month.
The 1,500 freestyle will be one of the Crimson’s strongest events in the final five days of the meet as Meyer and three other Harvard swimmers and recruits—Reed Snyder, Michael Gaudiani and Kekacs—are slated to swim the endurance race. Tomorrow’s female 200-meter butterfly will also be a promising event for the Crimson as Otto will be joined by Danielle Schulkin, Hilary Roberts, recruit Connie Hsu, and alum Kate Mills. In addition, the men’s 50 freestyle on Sunday will be an interesting battle between Chris Satterthwaite, Griffin Schumacher, and Oliver Lee, who posted the three fastest 50-yard freestyle times in school history earlier this year during NCAA competition.

When Daniel A. Gross ’13 thought about life after graduation, he decided that with his departure from campus, he didn’t want to lose the education he got sitting around in dining halls, hearing and participating in conversations on all sorts of subjects.
He created a solution: The Best Harvard Nonrequired Required Reading List.
"My sense is that when we graduate from college, we keep a certain individualized, personalized education," he said. "But we lose that communal aspect."
Gross sought to compile a list of students’ favorite assigned readings from their time at Harvard.
He wrote to the Currier House email list with a request: “help me build a Harvard College-curated pile of once-required, now-nonrequired reading that any undergrad can use when they're looking for something interesting to read.”
Gross invited students to each name a favorite reading and write 10 words about the work.  The list, which Gross says is currently in its early stages, contains over 40 titles.

It's 1:30 in the morning, and you're hungry. But where do you go? It is a divisive debate among the Harvard student body, and loyalties to the Square's late-night stops run deep. Over an 11 day period, The Crimson will debate 11 popular choices around campus. Now up: Pizza Ring.
I can think of two things that are best bought past midnight, get delivered to your door, have a big selection, and give you a cheap, satisfying, quick fix with almost certain regret in the morning. One is not legal in the state of Massachusetts. The other is Pizza Ring.
While Pizza Ring may not be the healthiest of choices or have the promptest of service, it is indisputably—for lack of a better word—clutch.
What do I mean, you ask?
Well, imagine it’s Friday night and you and your friends have made it back to your room after a night of revelry. You don’t feel like leaving the comforts of your suite again, but you also don’t feel like ending the night quite yet. Whether you just sit and talk, start a bad movie, or flip on the N64 for a few rounds of Super Smash, the inevitable happens: you all feel that pang in your stomachs that signals your second most primitive instinct—hunger. The problem, my friends, is that it’s 3:30 a.m.
The 24 Hour Market and IHOP would be great…if you felt like moving. Domino's? Nope, they closed at two.
You feel panicked and claustrophobic with the fact that you are trapped in your dorm room hungry, foodless, and hopeless, until you remember two beautiful words—Pizza Ring.
It takes a second to get past the name. I don’t know about you, but “Pizza Circle” would seem more fitting. Or if “Ring” is meant to reference boxing, the owner should seriously reconsider the name after the whole Paquiao-Bradley fiasco.
But once you look up the menu, all of your doubts are expelled. You realize you can get a jumbo pizza delivered that costs only $11.99. Jumbo! That’s bigger than “super,” which is bigger than “large.” It’s enough pizza to save and eat for breakfast tomorrow afternoon when you wake up.
And besides having great bang-for-your-buck pizza, Pizza Ring has much more to offer than its name suggests. The menu is beyond extensive. You can order burgers, hot wings, sub sandwiches, and cake, as well as less ordinary items such as cream cheese jalapeno poppers, fried ravioli, sea scallops, and baklava. It caters to your food baby’s every desire. What exactly is a side order of Jamaican Style Beef Patties? Beats me, but it’s $1.99—let’s get it.
Reading through the Yelp reviews, I realized the biggest complaint is the service. But besides the fact that customers should not expect Ruth’s Chris’ service from a place called “Pizza Ring,” I’ve found the service to be quite favorable. Yes, sometimes deliveries take a little longer than desired, but the staff is always understanding and friendly. They will deliver to you almost anywhere (rumor has it they even deliver to final clubs—not that I ever go to those), which is more than many other places can say at 4:00 a.m.
They also realize that delivering food to college kids until the wee hours of the morning will inevitably lead to some strange events. By this I mean I have personally witnessed a student pay for pizza using only the change he scavenged from underneath the cushions of the couches in his room. And when he presented the man from Pizza Ring with roughly three handfuls of coins, the deliveryman simply laughed, accepted the nickels and dimes without counting it, gave the student the pizza, and left.
Try that at the Kong.
So while the pizza slices may not be cut straight and the Department of Public Health’s A-rating on the door may be questionable, Pizza Ring is undoubtedly the greatest late-night option Harvard and the City of Cambridge has to offer. In short, it understands you at a time when not much else is being understood.
