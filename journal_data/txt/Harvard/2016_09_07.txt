After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the new school year already in full swing, I am waiting for my inevitable lapse into a routine I know all too well. It’s very simple, and it goes something like this: grab tray, load plate, find spot (separated by at least one seat on either side), sit down, laptop out, headphones in, eat. This is a series of motions I know many—if not all—of us have gone through at one point or another, but it’s a topic I’ve never once heard discussed aloud.
I suspect that my first time eating alone as a freshman was much less troubling for me than it was for many of my peers. In fact, I have no memory of the occasion. You see, I have long been a seasoned veteran in eating alone. I did exactly that in Annenberg every day for an entire summer as a student in the Harvard Secondary School Program a year before matriculating to the College a year ago. Hence, while I knew what invariably looms—the judging stares, each a target on on my back—they do not bother me one bit.
A disclaimer: I did not take most or even the majority of my meals in solitude last year, and I have yet to eat alone now as a sophomore. But when the time comes, as it certainly must, I know I will once more be keenly aware of my solitariness, especially if there are no other solo-diners in whom I can quietly take comfort and derive some sort of mental justification for our shared, sorry state.
What I find particularly sad about this recurring affair is not the fact that I dine alone more often than most or that I dine alone at all. Rather, I am troubled by the fact that I feel the need to justify my aloneness.
In our society, and perhaps even more so at this university, there is a stigma associated with eating alone. But on campus, I think the strain of this shame-inducing virus is particularly virulent.
For many of us, amidst the mess of our multicolored Google Calendars filled to the brim with classes and extracurricular commitments and—for the most methodical among us—study sessions, often the only blank spaces to be found are lunch and dinner. Consequently, we are forced to designate mealtimes as venues for social interaction and, in so doing, we ingenious Harvard students, always seeking the maximize the utility of every waking moment—we kill two birds with one stone.
To eat alone, then, is to stand in opposition to the social norm. And so, if you are going to dine solo, the guise of productivity or some other engagement at the very least—a laptop or phone or p-set or book—is essential.
I sense the reality of this unspoken yet pernicious expectation only adds insult to injury for those who eat alone because of very real issues of mental health. For a time last year, I would not have necessarily excluded myself from this category. Indeed, in the winter of my second semester, the burden of schoolwork and the fragmentation of what I had previously assumed to be a tight group of friends subjected me to a crippling mixture of anxiety and loneliness. Sometimes, rather than facing the prospect of dining by myself amidst the sea of smiling faces and excited hubbub that is characteristic of Annenberg, eating microwavable mac-n-cheese on my bed or, occasionally, skipping a meal entirely seemed a preferable alternative. I escaped my bout of isolation as the semester progressed, but I am sure others have not found themselves as lucky.
I find it necessary to dispel the myth that eating alone—aloneness in general, for that matter—is equivalent to being lonely. Truly, in that same period when I emerged from my dark cave of lonesomeness, I regularly ate alone, although for very different reasons than before. For while many feel compelled to fill every blank space in their calendar with socializing, I came to the realization that these same intervals often provide me a much needed opportunity for relaxation and reflection, luxuries afforded neither by a full day of classes and homework nor the company of friends.
The implications of my argument may seem contradictory. How are we as a community to disassociate eating alone and loneliness when the latter may or may not be at play? I do not pretend to have a definitive answer to this difficult question, but a good starting point may be to adopt a quality useful in all human interactions: empathy.
This is my challenge: The next time you see someone eating alone in the d-hall, eschew your judging gaze and instead, whether they’re lonely or just in need of some time alone, try to put yourself in their shoes. You don’t have to invite them over, but maybe strike up a conversation outside of the d-hall if their aloneness seems persistent. At the very least, give them a smile—that never hurt anyone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Love him or hate him, Kanye West is a potent artist. He has continually pushed the boundaries of his field. Initially, this meant bringing consciousness and emotional expression back into rap: “All Falls Down” was the first song that I felt accurately reflected the sorrow in the hypocrisy of materialism. When Kanye rose to fame, he stood for something pure, and his arrogance was just an unimportant reflection of his fallibility in this endeavor.
But over time, his pure intentions were misplaced in the looming monster of arrogance that was consuming him. Kanye was no longer concerned about whether Jesus Walks but was more concerned with quite blatantly, Power. His previous desire to bring falseness to the forefront of our minds and stand for authenticity became corrupted by the sudden influx of endless streams of praise, women, and money that comes into the life of a superstar. “Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” replaced God with Nietzsche.
In early 2016 Kanye dropped “The Life of Pablo,” and I listened to it every day for the next few months. The album was the type of production that I was immediately drawn to; it was fluid and free, emotional and focused all at once. In more concrete terms, it was Kanye’s introspection on his life, with a nod to what we assume is Pablo Picasso, although the reality is that Pablo could be anyone.
The story arc of the songs within TLOP effectively parallels the path of Kanye’s artistic journey. He starts emotionally, open, and with pure intentions on “Ultralight Beam.” The middle of the album is volatile, with moments of gospel and God and overwhelmingly dark vulnerability—a reflection of the middle of Kanye’s discography. And finally, the thumping braggadocio of “Facts” and “No More Parties in LA” represents Yeezus and reflects the trademark arrogance that serves as the simultaneous shield and fuel for Kanye’s frustration and insecurity.
The last track of the album, “Saint Pablo,” serves as an insight into the state of mind of Kanye as he was creating TLOP. Here is the ending piece, and here is where we can understand best what is going on. As the concerns of day-to-day life that start the song fade out, Sampha’s yearning voice croons:
“Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, father, father...)”
In this moment it becomes clear: Kanye wants liberation. Liberation from the bounds of many things, but when we strip away the superficial, he like all of us at our core, wants to transcend the human conditions of fallibility and mortality. The invocation of God at the beginning of TLOP reflects the central role God plays to Kanye; the wistfulness of the fading ending reflects the idea that God is the salvation.
Kanye, in many senses, is the 21st century version of Dante Allegheri—a poet going through an epic journey through the three religious phases of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. In Dante’s time, society, and people, were judged based on their sins. Medieval Florence, beyond just the realm of sin, had incredibly structured social roles with a clearly defined hierarchy and set customs for behavior at each level. In his “Divine Comedy,” Dante accurately reflects these clearly defined levels through the layers of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven.
In the post-postmodern, there is no clearly defined anything. There is no set hierarchical value system, and there is nothing new to be stated. Only quotes of prior statements to give new light to the same concepts.
Kanye reflects this in his extensive sampling, a process where music from another period is layered into your own. Kanye samples sounds, artists, and even Vines from all over the world and across the last hundred years of music production.
What I hear on the ending of TLOP, “Saint Pablo,” is a song about a guy striving for salvation, looking to be in touch with God. Taken literally, Kanye received his taste of fame, and fell into the pits of hell, indulging in beautiful dark twisted fantasies; and now he leaves and reflects, reaching a subjective purgatory. As he looks to the church in the night sky, he sees the path to Heaven and the fallibility of his current being. He understands, just as Dante did, that he must shed his sin to reach the next level in pursuit of something greater. Whether he will or not reach that higher level is still to be determined, but the path is there, and in the dim glow of the moon the path to the light becomes clear.
The extraordinary awareness in his music seems to already illuminate the path to salvation; perhaps all Kanye needs simply to follow his own lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An agreement between the city of Boston and its Police Patrolmen’s Association this past July to equip volunteer officers with body cameras in a pilot program should have been a commendable measure toward increased police accountability. Instead, no officers stepped up, prompting Police Commissioner William Evans to select 100 to enter the program. The Association sued in response, postponing the start of the initiative.
Officers’ refusal to volunteer, and the police union’s subsequent lawsuit, are both unfortunate setbacks to a promising program. Researchers have found that body cameras effectively reduce use of force and a majority of officers assigned to wear them ultimately view their use more favorably and believe they should be implemented on a larger scale. In a year in which 741 people—a disproportionate number of them persons of color—have been killed by police so far, any reasonable initiative to combat police brutality should be adopted.
While body cameras are a step in the right direction, Boston’s focus on that initiative should not preclude the police department from minimizing its use of force in other ways. This includes reducing police militarization, which we have previously decried, and increasing diversity within the department.
Furthermore, police officers’ actions result from the environments in which they are trained, and police trainings’ emphasis on using force, coupled with officers’ fear for their lives in the dangerous situations they face, are partially responsible for unnecessary violence in other situations.
Therefore, Evans’s decision to implement the program despite a lack of voluntary participation should in no way be seen as a punishment for police officers. On the contrary, body cameras serve as a valuable corrective to police violence. This measure should, and will, benefit police officers as well as the communities they serve.
For instance, officers equipped with body cameras will likely receive fewer complaints, as one study found an 88 percent reduction in complaints after the introduction of body cameras to a Californian police force. Responsible officers equipped with cameras will also be able to provide video evidence in case any actions they take are questioned.

More than $17,000 worth of dental equipment was stolen from the Harvard School of Dental Medicine in Longwood sometime last month. The equipment was discovered stolen on Aug. 24 at 10:30 a.m. and has yet to be recovered.
According to HSDM spokesperson Heather M. Denny, the incident occurred at 188 Longwood Avenue, although the report was filed at the adjacent Research and Education Building, on the Dental School’s campus. Denny declined to comment further because the investigation is ongoing.
Steven G. Catalano, spokesperson for the Harvard University Police Department, wrote in an email that “the investigation into the theft of dental equipment is open and ongoing,” and that the department “does not comment on open investigations.”

Harvard’s Graduate School of Design and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have officially welcomed their first cohort of 15 students pursuing a master’s degree in design engineering.
The program, which lasts two years, combines introductory courses, collaborative group projects, and a final, individual capstone project.
Prior to embarking on individual projects, degree candidates in their first year work in groups to develop an app, website, or other solution to a predetermined social issue. This year, students will be tasked with developing solutions to problems facing food  systems.
Master in Design Engineering co-director Woodward Yang said the program aims to create well-rounded thinkers, as opposed to highly-specialized academics.
“[We’re] trying to get people who have some areas of expertise to sit together in a room with people with different areas of expertise, look at real world problems, understand that real world problems actually aren’t pointy,...learn from each other, and come up with a really good solution,” Yang said.
The current group of degree candidates draws from the design, engineering and business fields. All of the students have previous experience in at least two of those fields, according to Yang.
“That’s one of the most interesting and exciting things. All these students come from different and multiple areas of expertise and they’re interested in learning more,” Yang said.
Though the current program is small in number, MDE co-director Martin Bechthold said ambitions are high.
Bechthold said he hopes the master’s program will become the best in the field of “programs that address big, complex problems through teaching interdisciplinary methods.”
“The goal is to make the MDE something that, in 50 or 100 years, has become an established degree,”  Bechthold said. “Today, the MBA is that and it started at Harvard, and the MDE may be the future MBA in its own field.”
Some current students were particularly attracted to the degree’s combination of distinct academic disciplines and professional skills.
“I think this [program] just gives you a really solid foundation of knowledge that applies across disciplines,” MDE candidate Julie Loiland said. “A lot of companies are looking for people who can connect the designers with the engineers with the business people and kind of bring it altogether, so I think this program will set us up well for being able to work across disciplines in the real world.”

UPDATED: September 6, 2016, at 12:44 a.m.
Harvard University Dining workers are preparing to go on strike after three months of stagnant contract negotiations with the University’s bargaining team on issues of health benefits and wage increases.
Spokesperson for Local 26—the union that represents HUDS—Tiffany Ten Eyck wrote in a press release Tuesday that the workers’ contract with Harvard  is set to expire on Sept. 17, after which workers plan to strike should the University not comply with demands for an increased minimum salary and more affordable health benefits. 
Ten Eyck wrote the workers will announce their intent to strike Wednesday afternoon at a rally at First Parish Church. At the rally, the workers will unveil a mural composed of photographs of 600 dining services workers who “are ready to strike,” according to the press release.
Their intent to strike comes just days after the University announced it raised more than $7 billion in its historic capital campaign—a point Ten Eyck emphasized in the release. The fundraising drive was publicly launched in 2013 and has aimed to raise money across the University for priorities including House renewal, financial aid, and a new building for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
In a statement Tuesday evening, Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that the wages and benefits of Harvard dining employees are competitive nationally.
“Harvard’s dining hall workers currently receive highly competitive wages that lead the local and national workforce for comparable positions in the food service industry,” deLuzuriaga wrote. “The fact that the average tenure of a Harvard dining hall worker is 12 years is a testament to the quality of work opportunities here.”
According to deLuzuriaga, the average dining hall worker at Harvard earns a $21.89 per hour salary. HUDS employees’ work corresponds with the academic calendar; they do not work during school recesses.  Still, according to deLuzuriaga, the University offers HUDS workers health benefits during the stretches of time they are not actively employed at Harvard.
HUDS workers have been in negotiations with Harvard administrators since late May, and have sat through at least 13 bargaining sessions. Their contract, last ratified in 2013, was set to expire in June but was extended to mid September as negotiations continued past the deadline. According to the press release, the current contract includes a “no-strike” clause that will expire on Sept. 17, after which HUDS may begin a strike.
Employees have called for a $35,000 minimum salary for all employees, regardless of hours worked, and a 22 percent wage increase over the next five years, according to deLuzuriaga.
Tuesday evening, the Student Labor Action Movement—an undergraduate organization that has supported HUDS in the past—released a statement on Facebook in support of the workers’ decision to strike, charging Harvard with a “moral obligation” to provide their employees with more affordable health care plans.
“The Harvard administration has failed to address employees’ concerns regarding affordable healthcare and a sufficient yearly income,” the group wrote. “The money required to maintain current health-care plans and ensure a sustainable annual income is inconsequential to the University but of utmost consequence to workers.”
SLAM is currently circulating a petition amongst undergraduates to support the workers’ planned strike.
Last spring, more than 200 Harvard affiliates gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall to express their support for HUDS workers ahead of the start of their negotiations

Harvard’s First Year Outdoor Program piloted a less intensive week-long trip this summer intended to encourage more minority students to participate in the popular freshman orientation program—part of a larger effort to address ongoing issues with the program's diversity.
As opposed to traditional FOP trips—which typically involve a week of backpacking, canoeing, or outdoor service projects held just before incoming freshmen come to campus—the new program brought around 20 students to the Harvard Forest for activities during the day, according to Paul R. “Coz” Teplitz ’03-’09, the director of FOP. The freshmen then returned to cabins at night, he said.
The pilot cost the same as FOP’s other orientation programs—$425.
“[It] was designed to be a little less—to use the term we’ve been throwing out—‘hardcore,’” Teplitz said. “For most of the programs, you were moving from place to place each day and that, we were worried, we’re putting people off.”
FOP has faced criticism for a lack of socioeconomic and racial diversity among its participants, given the cost of the program, though it does offer need-based financial aid. This year, according to The Crimson’s annual survey of the freshman class, 67 percent of freshman respondents that participated in the program said their parents have a combined annual income exceeding $125,000.
Teplitz said 185 of the 431 first-years who participated in FOP this summer received financial aid, or 43 percent. A total of $63,000 was given out in financial aid, up from the $57,250 distributed last year. The average aid award was $338, or about 80 percent of the program fee.
Teplitz said the pilot targeted freshmen who were not as interested in a fully immersive outdoors experience; historically, according to the National Park Service, many of such people have been minorities.
Teplitz and Katherine W. Steele, the College’s director for freshman programming, said they thought overall reception to the pilot program has been positive, though there is some uncertainty about whether it will be continued next year. FOP has not collected any demographic data on this year’s participants, so Teplitz said he is unsure whether the pilot program affected the makeup of FOP.
In addition to rolling out a pilot program, FOP continued a previous effort to diversify the composition of its participants. For the second year, FOP’s leadership—working with the Freshman Dean's Office—matched the percentage of financial aid that a student receives from the College.
“If you get 100 percent coverage of your expenses term-time, then there’s no cost to doing FOP,” Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said. “I don’t know what impact that had on enrollment, but… I got to guess that that helps a lot, to make sure that people who want to do FOP can afford it.”
Funding for both FOP’s financial aid initiative and the  pilot program did not come from the FDO or the College, but rather individual donors—program alumni, parents of FOP participants, and the parents of FOP leaders.
Last summer, a donor committed to multiple years of funding for the program, ensuring that the program can continue to match the percentage of financial aid students receive during the term.
“That relieves a lot of pressure regarding the aid,” Teplitz said.
He and Steele both attributed the ability of FOP to offer its new pilot program, and the amount of financial aid it has given out, to the generosity of the program’s donors.
“I would say that both the FDO office and the College have been really supportive, but at this point the donors are the ones who are supplying most of the money that we needed,” Teplitz said.

UPDATED: September 8, 2016, at 6:55 p.m.
Fans of Chicago deep-dish pizza and cheap appetizers will have a harder time finding culinary satisfaction in Harvard Square now that Uno Pizzeria and Grill has closed its local restaurant.
Customers hoping to grab a meal at the chain’s 22 JFK St. branch last Thursday were surprised to see the storefront stripped of all semblances of the eatery. All that remained was a note taped onto the building’s front window urging customers “not to say goodbye” and referring would-be patrons to nearby Uno locations.
Uno joins the burgeoning list of businesses closing their doors in Harvard Square, including Au Bon Pain and Al’s, all of which were displaced by the renovation of the Smith Campus Center. Panera was also shuttered this year.
The restaurant closed its doors because the eatery became too expensive to operate amid high rent prices, according to Uno’s Chief Marketing Officer Skip Weldon.
“We tried very hard to cooperate with the landlord, but the rents are very high in Harvard Square,” Weldon said. “The rent prices have just gotten out of whack the last couple of years.”
The building was purchased within recent years by Gerald L. Chan, a Hong Kong billionaire who also made a historic donation to Harvard’s School of Public Health.
“It was an incredibly difficult decision as we’ve been in Harvard Square since 1980,” Weldon said.  “We had a great staff and a commitment to the Harvard Square community.”
The pizza joint, with corporate headquarters in Boston, specializes in Chicago-style deep dish pizza and has been in the Square for over 20 years. During late nights, the restaurant also offered appetizers like mozzarella sticks at discounted prices.
Several student organizations regularly hosted meeting and events at the restaurant, and said they would miss the location.
“The [International Relations Council] had a great working relationship with this particular Uno,” Model United Nations board member Timothy J.  Cavanaro ’18 said. “In the past, we have held a number of large group events there, and even some of our largest parties, up to 200 people over the course of two hours, were easily accommodated by their friendly staff.”
Students more generally were surprised and disappointed by the news.
Charles G.  Alver ’17 said he  found out about Uno’s closure after receiving an Uno email alert which stated that the closest Uno location to him was not in Harvard Square anymore, but rather another location in Boston.
“It was a really great place to meet up with people and get drinks or food,” Alver said. “I’m not totally sure where I'll get a deep dish chocolate chip cookie with ice cream now.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: September 8, 2016 
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Panera's closure was due to Smith Campus center construction.

Responding to student frustration, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences administrators modified student benefits this semester by granting more flexibility for guaranteed teaching spots and increasing the rate of supplemental payments.
The changes will allow students in the arts and humanities or social science divisions to invoke their guaranteed teaching outside of the third and fourth years. Prior to the modification, Ph.D. students were guaranteed four semesters of teaching only in their third and fourth years.
Teaching fellows eligible for a “top-up”—a supplement that equalizes funding for all Ph.D students—will also see a benefit. Instead of a one-time payment at the start of the semester, GSAS will now disburse top-up funding monthly. GSAS students may also accrue $3,000 from additional research and teaching jobs without a reduction in supplemental payments.
GSAS administrators said both modifications to funding packages—which were announced three days after the National Labor Relations Board ruled that undergraduate and graduate student teaching and research assistants have the right to form a union—resulted from student concerns.
“It was engagement with students, engagement with faculty, and internal deliberations and problem solving—how can we fix this, how can we address these things,” GSAS dean for administration and finance Allen Aloise said.
GSAS dean for admissions and financial aid Mohan D. Boodram said current issues around top-up funding were a “sore point” for many Ph.D. students.
The top-up benefit was introduced in 2005 to fill any gaps in funding as students enter their teaching years. Although Boodram said administrators initially considered the program innovative, students noticed that if they took on additional teaching or research, their top-up would be deducted.
“As they earned more, the amount of the incremental payment actually started decreasing dollar for dollar. So it felt like you were being penalized for doing extra effort, which was certainly never anyone’s intention,” Boodram said. He added that the increased frequency of top-up payment will help students throughout the semester.
“This will be a bit more burdensome for our staff because they’ll have to do a lot of corrections after the fact and a lot of auditing, but clearly it’s the right thing to do from our students point of view,” Boodram said.
Charles F. Bartlett, a Classics sixth-year student, said he will be largely unaffected by the changes, but praised the “flexibility” added to guaranteed teaching years.
Shortly after GSAS announced the funding package modifications, members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers celebrated the change on the group’s Facebook page. Since April 2015, a group of graduate students has been organizing in the hope of forming a union.
“When we stand together, we win! Over the past year, our union has highlighted these issues, and our effort has pushed the administration to enact long overdue change,” the group posted.
Last year, GSAS rolled out several other benefits for students, including a 50 percent discount on T passes and a doubled stipend for expecting and adoptive parents. Members of the HGSU-UAW have said their campaign sparked those changes.
But Boodram said the most recent modifications to GSAS benefits are the continued results of ongoing discussions between administrators and students. Aloise and other administrators took part in “listening tours” of each department to speak with students and also met with faculty in half of the GSAS departments.
“This is a direct result of the listening tours,” Boodram said, referring to the new enhancements. He added that the changes have been in the works for the past six months.
Despite the improvements, HGSU-UAW organizers have called into question the application of benefits, which apply only to students receiving a Ph.D. In a Crimson op-ed, organizers argued that a union could ensure that non-Ph.D. seeking students receive equal benefits.

As shopping week comes to a close, some students said they were still unclear how Gen Ed changes applied to them.
Although the overhaul of the Gen Ed program will take effect in the fall of 2018, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced in June that current students will be allowed to take a broader range of courses to fulfill their requirements starting this fall semester “in the spirit of the new distribution requirement.”
Members of the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019 may now, for instance, fulfill some Gen Ed requirements via departmental or divisional courses.
According to Harris, the number of requirements for students may either decrease or remain unchanged.
In August, the Gen Ed office provided an Academic Advising Report to every student with guidance on how the initial implementation of changes in the fall semester would affect remaining requirements. The office also published an infographic about flexibility for current students in fulfilling gen ed requirements.
Still, some students said they were unsure how the new changes would affect their remaining years at the College.  “I think the extent of my knowledge is that nothing for me personally changed,”  Margaret P. Powell ’19 said.
Powell said that notifying students of changes over summer vacation, when access to advising resources are limited, was poorly timed.
“They were sending out emails over the summer, but it just seemed too complicated to figure out, so I waited until the fall to talk to my adviser,” she said.
Harris urged students to read the resources that have been sent out and are available on the Gen Ed website.
“If having read that they remained confused, they should get in touch with the Gen Ed office,” he said. “If they can help us to figure out how to do it better, I invite them to be in touch. We always want to do it better.”
Liz L. Roux ’19, who also contacted her sophomore adviser for guidance, said she felt the new policy merely changed the names of the Gen Ed requirements.
“They don’t seem to affect me. There are still eight requirements that I need to fulfill,” Roux said.
Others, however, embraced the greater freedom students now have in course selection.
Myles A. Ingram ’18 said that although the changes “drastically” affected his shopping week, the result was ultimately a good one because he now has fewer requirements to fulfill.
“I think overall it’s had a positive effect, because now I can take classes I want to take just for fun,” Ingram said.
Although the Gen Ed renewal did not affect Andrew Paek’s  ’17 requirements coming into his senior year, Paek said he would take advantage of the newfound flexibility in fulfilling his last two requirements.
“I think the Gen Ed website is really where all the information is, and there it’s really clear,” Paek said. “What’s hard is finding it, but once you’re there and you find the senior section, it’s pretty clear what you can do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 7, 2016, at 12:36 a.m.
The currently all-female Sablière society has committed to going gender neutral by next fall, according to graduate board president Ariel Stoddard ’10.
Undergraduate and graduate members of the Sab approved the change—which the club had preliminary announced last spring—in a two-thirds affirmative vote last weekend, making the Sab the first of the five all-female final clubs to publicly announce a plan for a gender neutral transition. The club has now outlined a specific timeline for the transition by 2017, Stoddard wrote in an email to The Crimson Tuesday.
Before the club begins considering non-female candidates, the club will also host an open selection process for all sophomore women this fall, Sab undergraduate president Reva Nohria ’17 said in an interview. The Sab joins two other final clubs, the all-male A.D. Club and Porcellian club, in hosting single-gender open “punches”—the final club-specific term for the membership selection process—this year.
The Sab is also the first final club, male or female, to put forth concrete plans to go gender neutral after the announcement of College sanctions that, starting with the Class of 2021, will bar students involved in single-gender social organizations from leadership positions and College endorsement for certain coveted Fellowships.
The Seneca, a currently all-female 501(c)3 group that does not identify itself as a final club, plans to go gender neutral, though its leadership believes the club could remain single gender in practice without invoking the College’s impending sanctions.
Though the Sab will become gender neutral the same semester as the sanctions take effect, Nohria called the decision “the culmination of over a year of discussions” within the club. She stressed that while administrative pressure and campus climate had some bearing on the decision, much of the impetus for change was internal.
Nohria said the Sab has also committed to making the move without merging with an all-male club, adding that avoiding a merger “allows us to define what we believe a social organization on campus can be.”
The all-female Bee, IC, and La Vie clubs have all met with the all-male Delphic club to explore the possibility of a merger, according to Delphic Club correspondence from May.
Nohria described the full year between the announcement and when the Sab will begin accepting non-female members as an opportunity for “due diligence in making sure that we create the best framework” for a gender neutral punch.
“We wanted to make sure that if we were going to undertake a significant change in our membership, we wanted to plan it appropriately for that membership,” the Sablière’s culture chair Morgan E. Arenson ’06 said. “We have to acknowledge that things will be different when you’re not just looking to bring Harvard women into the club.”
While the change is likely to please College administrators, who for over a year have been urging single-gender social organizations to widen their membership policies, Nohria said the club has “not announced it beyond our club at this point.”
Though constitutionally the Sab’s change only required two-thirds approval from undergraduate and graduate leadership, Stoddard wrote that Sab leadership had “agreed not to move forward without a ⅔ majority” of the entire undergraduate membership, a threshold reached over the weekend.
Sab leaders also said they expect no administrative support or reward for their decision—a possibility that Sab co-founder and legal chair Eugenia B. Schraa ’04 said  was floated in a meeting last May with Assistant Dean of Student Life for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña and Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich. 
“There’s been so much ambiguity and there continues to be so much ambiguity,” Schraa, a former Crimson editor, said of the College’s administrators. “In the end we went with what the undergrads feel deeply about their identity and that made it a bit easier than thinking about what the administration is really going to do.”
Schraa added that many in the Sab still identify with the grievances against the administration that some club leaders aired in a Crimson editorial in April. Nohria preferred to focus on the club’s actions “as opposed to [the] sanctions.”
“We believe that it’s a really feminist movement for women to open up their spaces in this way and that it allows us to define what we believe a social organization on campus can be,” Nohria said. “We are proud to be pioneers in this.”
Despite the historic nature of the change, Arenson said she hopes it will not fundamentally alter the club.
“The plan is there will be a lot of consistency in how [the Sab] feels … apart from the literal question of gender,” Arenson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A number of Harvard Square retailers including the Curious George store and Urban Outfitters face likely eviction, as the owner of their iconic building seeks to transform it into a pedestrian mall.
In preliminary renderings submitted to the Cambridge Historical Commission, Equity One, the current owner of the centrally-located building at the corner of JFK and Brattle Street, proposes a two-floor addition to the back of the building, as well as a complete redesign of the interior, opening up floor space for new tenants and turning the space into a small mall.
Noticeably missing from the designs is the Curious George Store—a famed local favorite which bills itself as “The World’s Only Curious George Store”—which would be gutted and turned into a lobby with stairs and an elevator.
The proposal will have a public hearing this Thursday, when the Historical Commission is set to meet with Equity One representatives and community members at City Hall at 6 p.m. to discuss the plans.
However, the Historical Commission may be limited in its power to alter designs for the building’s interior, and plans for the exterior appear minor. If the plans are approved by the Historical Commission in a potentially lengthy process, they would still need a special permit from the Cambridge City Planning Board.
In the meantime, city officials and tenants are scrambling to learn what the plans may mean for the future of Harvard Square. Business owners like Susan Miller-Havens, owner of the Miller-Havens Fine Art Studio located in the building alongside Brattle Street, said tenants would be forced out should the proposal be approved.
“We’re just all going to get evicted. None of us are going to be able to afford the rent,” Miller-Havens said. “It’s a very disruptive thing, what these people are doing.”
Equity One, a real estate investment firm based in Miami and New York, purchased the building last October for over $80 million. Their website calls the building “The Harvard Collection” and highlights the “strong demographics” of Harvard Square, including the over 500,000 person “annual average daily traffic” that passes through the square. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Cambridge City Councillor Dennis J. Carlone agreed an increase in rent would likely accompany the renovation.
“The developers, who are from out of town, have made their design to maximize profit within their purchase,” he said. “Not understanding Harvard Square, I can visualize why they did that.”
One unique tenant in the building at risk of eviction is the Harvard Square Business Association, which has its offices on the third floor. Denise A. Jillson, the association’s executive director, said tenants have known about the potential for changes for almost a year now.
“Of course we’re very concerned about all the tenants of the building, many of whom are members of the Harvard Square Business Association,” Jillson said. “I’m not hopeful that we can stay there. It would be delightful if we could. It’s been home to us for many years.”
City Councillor Jan Devereux, who spoke with building tenants throughout the weekend, worried the potential changes would alter the current first floor storefronts and more broadly, the character of the Square.
“I very much don’t want to see it turn into a mall that could be anywhere where you have big chain stores and no connection to the sidewalk,” Devereux said. “To me the plan that is under consideration right now is not the result of any thoughtful conversation about the sustainability of a community but is more about how to harvest the highest rent possible.”
Hugh A. Russell ’64, a former chair of the Cambridge Planning Board and founder of Russell, Scott, Steedle & Capone architects, a building tenant, said he was unsure about the thought that went into the renderings.
“They’re schematic level drawings so they haven’t thought out in detail what they’re really going to do. That’s what it looks like to me as an architect,” Russell said. “Second floor retail is usually pretty difficult to sustain.”
According to Russell, the Thursday hearing is just the first step in a process that may take months.
Despite looming eviction, Jillson noted some of the improvements that the renovation would bring to the Square, including the potential for more businesses on the new floors.
“Increased density is a good thing within the rules and regulations,” Jillson said. “Certainly increasing the capacity above Urban Outfitters is a good thing.”
The hearing comes at a time of rapid construction and seemingly overnight closures for Harvard Square. The 2015-2016 school year alone saw multiple business closures, and the beginning of construction on the Smith Campus Center. Last week, Cambridge residents debated the city-approved renovations of the historic Out of Town News Kiosk.
Carlone and Devereux both agreed that the City Council only has tangential sway over projects like Equity One’s proposal, as the City Council controls zoning through the Zoning and Ordinance Committee. However it is unlikely that the process will reach that committee or the Planning Board anytime soon.
“Equity One has their rights as a property owner and we support their right to petition the city,” Jillson said. “The great thing about Cambridge is that there are lots of opinions. And the city is very good about making sure those opinions are heard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A settlement has been reached in a copyright infringement lawsuit between the University and Steve Elmore, a researcher of native American pottery, after a district court judge in New Mexico ruled that he violated his contract with one of Harvard’s museums.
In June 2015, Harvard filed suit against Elmore alleging copyright infringement, breach of contract, and violation of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology’s trademark policies. Elmore had been researching at the Peabody to complete a manuscript of his book, “In Search of Nampeyo: The Early Years 1875-1892.”
At issue in the suit was whether Elmore broke copyright laws by commissioning the illustration of Native American pottery from the Peabody Museum for his book.
After a district court judge ruled against Harvard’s copyright infringement claim, Elmore called the suit against him “frivolous and vindictive without merit.”
The same district court judge ruled at the end of August that Elmore had violated his contract with the museum when he published over 100 illustrations of pottery he had photographed for his research.
Consequently, the court directed Elmore to pay Harvard $10,000. At a settlement conference, Harvard waived that fee and encouraged Elmore to donate to a Native American charity.
“The Peabody Museum has been committed to the study of native art from around the world, most notably the American southwest, for more than a century,” Jeffrey Quilter, director of the Peabody, said in a press release. “We believe in open access for researchers, but also stand by the claim that photographs taken for research purposes should be used for just that: research. We are grateful that the court agreed with our position, enabling the important scholarship that takes place each day at the Museum to go forward.”
Elmore filed a series of counterclaims over the course of the lawsuit, one of which alleged that that Harvard had wrongfully declined to publish his manuscript. The federal court dismissed all of Elmore’s counterclaims except one, according to Harvard’s press release, which requested a $257 travel reimbursement from Harvard. Elmore dropped the claim after the settlement conference.
During the course of the suit, an injunction was placed on Elmore’s book, preventing copies of the book from being disseminated. That injunction has since been lifted.
Elmore’s book will return to print with the caveat that he include a statement in his book explicitly stating that photographs attributed to the Peabody Museum were published without the museum’s permission.
“I believe this suit against me should not have been filed,” Elmore wrote in a press release. “I would have gladly included Harvard’s one-page letter, which will now appears in each copy of the book, at Harvard’s request long ago.”
In a separate email to The Crimson in September, Elmore was sharply critical of Harvard’s suit, calling it a “twenty month long nightmare.”
“It all feels now like a bad fraternity prank mixed with a New England witch hunt,” Elmore wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will continue to fight a Title IX lawsuit that charges that the University reacted with “deliberate indifference” to an undergraduate’s sexual assault complaint, taking its arguments to federal court on September 21.
Earlier this year, Alyssa R. Leader ’15 sued Harvard, charging that the university had violated the anti-sex discrimination law Title IX when it responded to her sexual assault complaint. Leader’s initial filing details a sexual harassment complaint she filed with Harvard in 2015 against “John Doe”—a male College student—who Leader says sexually abused her during a “dating relationship” and subsequently stalked and harassed her in Cabot House after the relationship ended.
In a series of filings this summer, Harvard moved to throw out the case on the grounds that Leader’s claims do not entitle her to any legal recourse.
In turn, Leader’s attorney doubled down, filing documents opposing Harvard’s motions in early August and challenging many of Harvard’s arguments. While the University contended that it took a number of steps to investigate Leader’s complaints and provide her with support, Leader’s legal team countered that Harvard’s motion to dismiss “largely ignores the gravamen” of her allegations.
“In an attempt to misdirect this Court from the real issues, with respect to Ms. Leader’s Title IX claim, Defendant focuses almost exclusively on its initial response to Ms. Leader’s formal report of rape by Doe, and not on its response to her multiple reports that she was subjected to continuous, retaliatory harassment by Doe and his friends,” reads one of Leader’s attorney’s briefs.
Now at issue in the legal battle is whether the University fulfilled its obligation to investigate and respond to all complaints of sexual harassment and assault as required under Title IX. Harvard’s legal office declined to comment, and Leader’s attorney, Alex S. Zalkin, could not be reached.
In addition to the legal proceedings between the two principal parties, Wendy Murphy, an adjunct New England School of Law professor who specializes in Title IX, filed an amicus brief in the case on August 28. In it, she argued that the court must consider the case in a civil rights context, particularly one that understands women as a class.
“I have to assume the victim in this case would want to assert her strongest legal claims to full equality - but maybe I'm wrong about that. I suppose it's possible for a victim to want to be subjugated and treated as less than fully equal on campus,” Murphy wrote in an email. Zalkin, Leader’s attorney, did not consent to the brief. It identifies what Murphy believes are legal shortcomings in the initial suit.
Murphy wrote that she has filed similar briefs in other lawsuits around the country; she also filed a Title IX complaint against Harvard Law School in 2011. In 2014, the United States Department of Education found the Law School in violation of Title IX, and the College’s compliance with Title IX is currently under investigation by the federal government.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard senior forward Midge Purce lined up against Army last Monday, she knew the opposing defense would be marking her carefully. It is what she has come to expect—and embrace—after leading the Crimson in scoring three years running.
In fact, entering the matchup, Purce was second to only Katherine Sheeleigh ’11 in the team record books for most career goals since the 1990’s. Purce had 30 through her junior season, while Sheeleigh finished her career with 31. On the all-time scoring list, Purce sat 6th, also one spot behind Sheeleigh.
One week later, Purce has not just matched Sheeleigh but blown by her, scoring four times in three games. The haul began with a goal against the Black Knights on Monday, followed by two tallies against Central Connecticut State on Thursday and one more playing away at Louisville on Sunday.
Purce’s strong performances were enough to guide Harvard to two victories in the three games. After starting the season with a loss to No. 10 UConn, the Crimson is now back at .500 with a record of 2-2-0. Individually, Purce was also named the Ivy League Co-Player of the Week, along with Princeton senior forward Tyler Lussi.
“Midge has earned these honors,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “She has always been a threat offensively, but her commitment to defending this early in the season has really made her stand out.”
Perhaps most frightening for opponents this season may be the fact that Purce has honed her skills on the defensive end as well. Through four games she has shown an improved ability to anticipate passes and take the ball off the feet of opposing players, earning the Crimson key second-chance opportunities.
This skill set has helped Purce create chances on her own, as two of her four goals this past week came unassisted. Her goal against Army this past week was particularly telling, as she stole a pass and ran half the length of the field on her own before slotting the ball home.
“As a team we have committed to our defending collectively,” Hamblin said. “Midge is leading by example by working hard both sides of the ball.”
During the week, Purce exhibited her ability to score in other situations as well, and also displayed a sharp passing touch.
Against the Blue Devils on Thursday, she scored first off of a corner and then off a through ball from fellow senior forward Rachel Garcia. Purce also set up a great chance in the 17th minute that was narrowly missed by Joan Fleischman, another senior forward.
A big part of Purce’s growth is likely due to her involvement with the U.S. Women’s U23 team over the summer. Since joining the program at the U17 level, Purce has represented the U.S. in several tournaments, with the most recent being the Nordic Tournament this past June.
“Every time I play with them [the U.S. teams], I feel like I learn and grow a lot,” Purce said. “Everyone there knows something that the others don’t, and we all help each other improve different areas of our game.”
Purce has taken the lessons she learned with the national team back to Cambridge, but she feels that her role on the team has not changed much.
“Our coaches expect a lot out of all the players, whether it’s in practice or on the field,” Purce said. “Besides going from freshman year to sophomore year and so on, I feel like we all know our role on the team and we have the same expectations.”
With 34 goals now to her name, Purce is only three away from tying Naomi Miller ’98 and Emily Stauffer ’99 for third on the all-time Crimson scoring list.
Despite the historic implications of her scoring, Purce realizes that it is her senior year, and she only has a single goal in mind.
“We won the Ivy title my first two seasons here and we want to get that back this year,” Purce said. “The goals are nice, but the wins are the most important thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first weekend of field hockey played on the recently inaugurated Berylson Family Field Hockey Field did not disappoint. Both of Harvard’s games against Holy Cross (1-0) on Friday and New Hampshire (1-1) on Sunday resulted in tense overtime standoffs with neck-and-neck scores of 1-1 at the end of regulation.
The Crimson clinched a win against the Crusaders after a 10 round shootout when sophomore midfielder Emily Duarte made her debut goal of the season, solidifying a Harvard victory. However, Harvard was unable to repeat their overtime triumph against the Wildcats on Sunday.
HARVARD 1, NEW HAMPSHIRE 2
The Crimson took an early lead on Sunday when junior forward Hannah Wellington found the back of the net with her second goal in just as many games only two minutes into the game.
Despite carrying the 1-0 lead until halftime, Harvard found itself locked into a 1-1 tie with New Hampshire just after halftime when Ashley Mendonca scored off a penalty corner. The Crimson struggled to keep pace with the Wildcats during the second half but managed to keep the score tied. However, a seventh minute goal by New Hampshire in overtime ensured a Harvard loss.
“I think it’s tough to come off such an emotional game Friday and turn around to reset your mentality for the next game,” captain Kyla Cordrey said.  “I don’t think we did as well as we should have…we never really found our flow so I don’t think we performed as well as we could’ve.”
The Wildcats held the upperhand in both shots on goal and penalties, at 21-7 and 10-3, respectively.
HARVARD 2, HOLY CROSS 1
Harvard and Holy Cross were neck and neck all the way through double overtime and nine rounds of shootouts until Duarte secured a Crimson victory with her goal in the tenth and final shootout in front of a cheering crowd.
“A lot of people showed up to the game and the vibe and overall atmosphere of the Friday night game was fantastic,” said coach Tjerk van her Waarden. “I think we started really well [and] were able to execute our game plan…we just had difficulty finding the net which eventually led to a 1-1 score towards the end of the game. The whole entire game was a fantastic mark and a showcase of our sport.”
In both the first and second halves of the game, Harvard had eight shots on goal to Holy Cross’ combined three. The Crimson continued its offensive domination by outshooting the Crusaders 7-3 through two overtimes. Despite also garnering 12 penalty corners to Holy Cross’ 5, Harvard could not convert any of their offensive attacks into goals.
“It is tough to think that maybe we should’ve converted some of those opportunities earlier so we wouldn’t have to go into overtime and then shootouts,” Cordrey said. “But it’s nice to see that we have the power to get those opportunities and now it’s just a matter of finishing them.”
The Crimson’s defense was equally strong with goalkeeper junior Olivia Startup not having to make a save all game.
Harvard field hockey is looking toward its most competitive season yet, with 4 of 17 opposing teams being nationally ranked in the NFHCA National Preseason Poll.
“I think this will be a really exciting season,” Cordrey said. “I don’t think people think we’re the team to beat top teams like UConn and BC, but I think this year with all the talent on the team, especially with the incoming freshman I think we have a chance.”
The Crimson will be newly joined this season by six freshman which allows for each position on the field to be double manned.
“It’s a fantastic situation to be in as coach,” van her Waarden said. “I think [the freshmen] provide us with a lot of flexibility, options and opportunities because we know we have enough people to play and contribute on the field. We want to grow as a program and with them we can compete and see how we match up with these top programs in the nation.”
