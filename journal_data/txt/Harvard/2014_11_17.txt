After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their first Ivy League swimming and diving meet of the season, the Big Red and the Big Green looked anything but big.
Opening its title defense as champion of the Ancient Eight on Saturday, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) took on Cornell (2-1, 1-1) and Dartmouth (0-2, 0-2), which placed seventh and eighth respectively in the conference last year.
After beating Cornell, 156-144, and Dartmouth, 239-61, the Crimson showed the crowd at Blodgett Pool, as well as its conference rivals, that it is ready to compete in the conference yet again.
The meet started off with the 200-meter medley relay, in which Harvard took both first and second place. The A team, comprised of 2014 NCAA qualifier Danielle Lee and captain Stephanie Ferrell, earned the top spot, finishing in 1 minute, 43.98 seconds.
“We were just really pumped because this was the first meet,” Lee said. “We were really excited to go into it. We just wanted to see how fast we could go.”
The Crimson’s strong performance continued into the next three events, as Harvard swimmers placed first in the 200 freestyle, the 100 breaststroke, and the 100 backstroke—sweeping the latter of the three events.
“We have a lot of depth on our team,” head coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92 said. “All the [swimmers] know how to come together to really race for that end result.”
Notable Crimson performances also came from the freshman swimmers, including Kristina Li and Katie Evans. Li took second in the 100 backstroke with a time of 57.07, while Evans placed second in the 200 breaststroke with a time of 2:27.64. Rookie Regan Kology also took first place for Harvard in the 1000 freestyle, with a 10:10.05 finish, seven seconds ahead of Cornell’s Currie Murch Elliot.
“We’ve been working with the freshmen who have a lot of natural talent on how to fine tune their racing skills,” Morawski said. “The upperclassmen have done an amazing job pushing the point home that they need to focus on the little things—their starts, their turns, their finishes.”
According to Lee, the team’s collective mentality has been somewhat of an anomaly, as swimming is often considered an individual sport.
“We’ve always used each other to [get pumped up] and cheer each other on,” Lee said. “It just really helps getting through the last 10 or 15 meters in the race.”
The Crimson divers started the season off strong as well, sweeping both the three-meter and one-meter springboard events. Sophomore Elina Leiviska placed first in the three-meter competition, and freshman Hannah Allchurch came in first for the one-meter.
“It’s amazing just having the freshmen do so well this early on in the season,” Lee said. “It just shows that we’re going to be so much stronger at the end of the season. It shows the Ivy League that we’re very good at multiple events.”
Although the Dartmouth squad did not place in the top three in a single event, the Bears proved a difficult rival. After Dartmouth’s A team was disqualified from the 200 medley relay, Cornell’s B team edged out the remaining Bears’ squad by .09 seconds for a third place finish, behind two Harvard teams. The Big Red also swept the 200 IM—the only competition in which the Crimson did not place.
Coming into the Tri-Meet as the defending Ivy League champion, Morawski challenged her swimmers to compete in events that they do not typically swim, using the meet for training.
“We know we have a target on our backs and we’re up for the challenge,” Morawski said. “This is our pool, and we’re going to protect it. Our goal was to swim the meet not in our top events and still try to win it. “
Moving into the rest of the season, Lee says that the team views this meet as a stepping-stone towards a larger goal: holding onto the Ivy title. However, Harvard’s main focus remains its mentality and process.
“All of us hope that together as a team we stay positive and strong for the whole season,” Lee said. “[We want to] always give it our best, and as we go through each swim meet, [we want to] take it one step at a time and hopefully at the end win an Ivy Championship again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The four tickets competing for the Undergraduate Council’s top leadership positions questioned each other on their platforms and track records at a rowdy “Crimson Crossfire” debate Saturday night, which was attended by more than 100 undergraduates and held by The Crimson.
The audience, which included the current UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 drinking from a flask, cheered raucously and frequently shouted at the candidates. The debate followed one held at the Institute of Politics Thursday and offered candidates the opportunity to directly ask their competitors questions. Candidates did not receive any questions beforehand.
From the start, the pairs sought to differentiate themselves. While duo Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 handed out polished posters to their supporters, Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17 provided crayons and coloring sheets.
When asked about the biggest issue facing the study body, both Heine and the ticket of Faith A. Jackson ’16 and Happy Yang ’16 emphasized a problem with exclusivity and a lack of social space on campus.
“I think it’s despicable that every safe space for minorities is literally underground,” Jackson said, referring to the Harvard College Women’s Center in Canaday’s basement and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life in Boylston’s basement. “This is why we’re fighting for a multicultural center. On a Friday night, that’s the most divisive time on our campus.”
For his part, Heine argued for undergraduate input in the building plans of the Smith Campus Center.
Presidential candidate Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 also called for an increased student role in administrative decision-making, describing the decision to close the Stillman Infirmary without widespread student consultation beforehand as “patronizing.”
“It comes down to a pattern that happens over and over again. Decisions get made and then students get consulted,” Kanuparthy said. “People decide what’s going to happen and then pretend having a town hall afterwards makes it up.”
Nasrollahzadeh similarly criticized the infirmary’s closing, saying that students not having a place on campus where they can go after 10 p.m. for urgent care “really sucks.”
Later in the debate, Yang and Jackson advocated for reevaluating the University-wide sexual assault policy to potentially include an “affirmative consent” clause, despite the fact that Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX officer, has said the policy’s language will not change.
“What we actually need to do is perhaps have a referendum where students vote on affirmative consent,” Jackson said. “There is no reason that students should not be deciding on this instead of just having 45 members of a 6,700 person community decide.”
With candidates directly addressing components of their competitors’ platforms, criticism flew freely. While Heine and Turban proposed allowing clubs to spend UC funding on alcohol, Kanuparthy, who is running with Ema H. Horvath ’16, called the proposal a “question that’s already been answered.”
“We’re not doing it because the lawyers stepped in and said we couldn’t do it,” Kanuparthy said. “The last time we tried this, all of the funding for student groups got pulled, and I don’t think that’s the world we want.”
The questions the candidates asked each other ranged from serious to silly. Yang opened the cross-questioning by asking Turban, “How do you tie a bow tie?” in response to rumors that he wears clip-ons.
Yet other questions focused on candidates’ campaign platforms, including one from Horvath asking Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal to explain their proposal that the UC should act as a middleman for distributing alumni donations to student groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA— With 15 minutes left on the clock, the Harvard football team found itself in unfamiliar territory. Trailing in the second half for the first time since week two, the Crimson (9-0, 6-0 Ivy) needed to mount a fourth quarter comeback to defeat Penn (1-8, 1-5).
Harvard found itself on the right side of a 17-10 lead at halftime, but a weak third quarter for the Crimson saw the team’s chances of clinching a share of the Ivy title seemingly slip away.
Stalled by the Penn defense, the Crimson went 0-for-3 on third down conversions and could only manage 11 yards of offense through the first 13 minutes of the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Quakers added a pair of touchdown scores as the home team gained a 24-17 by the end of the quarter.
But buoyed by 27-yard completion to end the third, the Crimson rattled off 17 unanswered points in the fourth to regain the lead and keep its undefeated season intact.
“We didn’t even feel like we needed to change scheme or anything,” said senior defensive end Zack Hodges. “We knew this would be a battle, and if we did what we were supposed to do, we would come out where we were supposed to be.”
Senior kicker Andrew Flesher threaded the posts on a 38-yard field goal attempt to cut the Quakers’ lead to four two minutes into the final quarter. The Harvard defense stalled Penn on its next drive, and Harvard only needed three plays on its ensuing possession to score another touchdown. A 28-yard reception by senior tight end Ty Hamblin gave the Crimson a lead it would not relinquish in the final ten minutes of play.
RUN, STANTON, RUN
With a career night on the ground, junior running back Paul Stanton Jr. spearheaded the Crimson’s offensive charge, amassing 235 rushing yards—the fourth-best single-game total in school history.
Stanton got Harvard off to a quick start with its first touchdown less than 90 seconds into the contest. A short Penn punt gave the Crimson good field position, and Stanton took the handoff on the first play of the drive, running in for a 42-yard score.
Midway through the second quarter, with Harvard trailing, 10-7, Stanton added another touchdown on the second play of the drive with a 75-yard carry to help the Crimson regain the lead. His 173 rushing yards in the first half nearly passed his previous career-high total of 180 yards on the ground.
And it didn’t stop there. With the Crimson in desperate need of momentum in the second half, Stanton came up with big run after big run, pushing a stalled Harvard offense down the field. The junior added another touchdown in fourth quarter with a 14-yard carry to give the Crimson a two-possession cushion heading into the final six minutes of play.
“I knew I had to get in, just to finish the game off,” said Stanton of his last scoring drive. “We always talk about finishing the game off. We knew this would be a tough game going in. We knew we had the ability to finish, we just had to go out there and play.”
SWAN SONG
It may not have been the storybook ending he was hoping for, but Penn head coach Al Bagnoli still walked off Franklin Field on Saturday as one of the Ivy League’s all-time winningest coaches.
In his final home game, Bagnoli’s Quakers gave the Crimson everything they had, but couldn’t give the veteran coach one final win.
But the loss could hardly mar the record of one of the Ivy League’s most storied coaches. Bagnoli lead the Quakers to 111 Ivy wins over his 23-year tenure at the helm of the Penn program. Only Carmen Cozza—whose 32 years spent as head coach of Yale Bulldogs spanned 1965 to 1996—has more wins against Ancient Eight programs.
“He is the standard by which they will measure all coaches in this league this this era,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “What they’ve done in two-plus decades is absolutely remarkable. His and their body of work is just amazing.”
Penn’s 1-8 record during its 2014 campaign is a far cry from the success the program has had over the past 23 years. Bagnoli coached the Quakers to an overall record of 147-80 while at the helm of the program and led Penn to nine Ivy titles—more than any Ivy program has in its history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior midfielder Laura Aguilar connected on a hard, low cross and immediately raised her arms in celebration. Aguilar knew she had just scored to give the Harvard women’s soccer team an insurmountable 6-0 lead over Central Connecticut State University and a trip to the second round of the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001.
Aguilar, one of the Crimson’s seven seniors, had a lot to cheer about—a goal in her final appearance at Soldiers Field, a new goal-scoring record for an Ivy League team in the NCAA tournament, and the seniors’ first advancement to the second round of the tournament after two previous attempts.
“It meant so much to [our seniors],” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “I think when we played before, we were the less experienced team in the NCAA tournament. And this time, we finally had seven seniors that had been to three of them. I think they were more relaxed today and ready for the opportunity.”
The Crimson (11-4-2, 5-1-1 Ivy) dominated the Blue Devils (11-6-4, 4-2-2 Northeast) from the opening whistle.
Freshman midfielder Dani Stollar, recently named Ivy League Rookie of the Year, wasted no time giving Harvard an early advantage. On the team’s first drive of the game, Stollar faked out a CCSU defender and sent a laser-like shot into the upper left post.
Just 22 seconds into the game, the Crimson had a 1-0 lead.
“Sometimes really early goals can actually be a disadvantage because teams can get complacent,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “But we all looked at each other and [said], ‘It’s 0-0. It didn’t even happen.’ We never took our foot off the pedal.”
Harvard continued to play with urgency throughout the first half. The team dominated possession in the Blue Devils’ territory. The duo of sophomore forward Midge Purce and co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby continuously applied pressure down the right sideline, setting up a handful of scoring chances. After three missed shots on drives set up from the right side, the Crimson switched it up.
Junior forward Emily Mosbacher found space along the left sideline and dribbled toward goal. Unpressured by the CCSU defense, Mosbacher sent a sharp, low shot to the far right post to give Harvard a 2-0 lead.
“We had a lot of room to play and to really do our thing,” Purce said. “Everybody was kind of on the same page today. It was just a lot better movement and understanding of where everyone is.”
The Crimson scored on six of its 15 shots in the game. This .400 shooting percentage greatly outpaced Harvard’s average shooting percentage of .124 in its previous 17 games.
On the other end, the Crimson defense did not allow the Blue Devils to get any offensive rhythm. Strong communication and pressure from Harvard’s back line held CCSU to just five total shots in the game.
With five minutes remaining in the first half, Purce received a pass near the edge of the box and flicked it up to herself to maneuver past three Blue Devils. With an opening and the ball on her left foot, Purce fired a shot past the goalkeeper to put the Crimson up 3-0.
Five minutes into the second half, Purce again beat a handful of CCSU defenders for her second goal of the day and tenth of the season.
“We thought less about the tournament and more about the game,” Purce said. “So when you’re making a run, you’re not thinking about winning the whole game, you’re thinking about making the run, getting into the box, scoring the goal. It’s one at a time.”
Harvard maintained its focused, confident style of play throughout the second half. The Crimson continued to control possession and dictate the pace of the game. And it continued to build its lead.
Just three minutes after Purce’s second goal, Mosbacher added her second goal of the day with a header off a corner from junior midfielder Haley Washburn.
With a 5-0 advantage, Leone made a series of substitutions. Aguilar, one of those substitutions, tallied Harvard’s final goal in her fifth minute on the field.
“As a unit, we’re all playing really well together,” Purce said. “When we all play well together, it allows everyone to play well individually.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, undergraduates chose a joke ticket to lead the Undergraduate Council, a rebuke for an organization that for too long had been seen as stilted and ineffective. But a year later, under the leadership of President Gus A. Mayopolous ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the UC has become reinvigorated—it is both more relevant and relatable to students and increasingly combative with the administration on issues like club funding, summer storage, and the new sexual assault policy.
The task at hand for the next UC leaders is maintaining the positive momentum of the last year, by pressuring administrators and engaging students to achieve important, but realistic, goals. From our conversations with the candidates, we believe that Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 and Ema H. Horvath ’16 are best equipped for the task.
Unlike other UC campaigns past and present, theirs does not have an alliterative platform, a snazzy slogan, or Napoleonic costumes—but what it lacks in glamour, it makes up in substance.
Kanuparthy, a past UC secretary and current UC treasurer, was the single most impressive candidate, who gave consistently thoughtful and considerate answers to our questions. His platform of reforming funding for smaller student groups, instituting financial aid for student summer storage, and releasing plans for the Richard A. & Susan F. Smith Campus Center strikes a balance between importance to students and feasibility.
The opposing ticket made up of Ava Nazrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 certainly has considerable UC experience, but their platform is made up of little more than the usual crowd-pleasers like weekend brain break and not allowing midterms on housing day. Their proposal to solicit UC funds directly from alumni could also turn the focus of the council towards fundraising, rather than its more important mission of representing students.
Another ticket, made up of Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16, deserve credit for most cogently diagnosing the problem of the UC: it is “‘derpy’ in that it’s decentralized, it’s exclusive, the relevance is lacking, the power of change is unclear.” A chief proposal of theirs for a student multicultural center is ambitious, albeit one that seems highly unlikely.
A sophomore ticket of Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17, running on a platform of restoring UC funding of alcohol for student groups, made a remarkable showing of infiltrating 11 of the 13 undergraduate dining halls and replacing newsletters with ones containing their watermarked campaign message—but it remains unclear how their watermarking prowess will translate to benefits for Harvard students.
Whoever wins the UC election will need to ensure that administrators are pressured to respond to student concerns and that a new slate of fresh ideas are brought before their constituents. Kanuparthy and Horvath are the ones who best fit that bill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time that the Harvard women’s basketball team lost a home opener was in 2008. On Saturday, senior forward Temi Fagbenle and junior forward AnnMarie Healy made sure to extend the streak to six.
Harvard (1-0, 0-0 Ivy) held off a late second half rally to beat Colgate (0-1, 0-0 Patriot), 68-53, in a matinee at Lavietes Pavilion.
Fagbenle led the way for Harvard with 17 points while adding nine rebounds, and Healy produced most of her 11 points and 10 rebounds down the stretch.
“It was your typical first game, slightly ugly,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We have enough veterans that held us together…. What I cared about was weathering the storm of the pressure in the defensive end and the rebounding. We took care of business at the end when we had to.”
The Harvard lead stood at 13 with 13 minutes left in the second half, but the Raiders refused to go away. Colgate went on a 14-4 run to cut Harvard’s lead to three with nine minutes left, during a four-minute stretch without a Crimson field goal.
With the game on the line, Fagbenle and Healy took over. The duo scored 13 of the team’s final 15 points, capped off by an and-one lay-up by Healy with 1:19 left that brought the crowd to its feet.
“I thought both Temi and AnnMarie were immense, both as rebounders, [and] as defenders securing the ball,” Delaney-Smith said. “We count on both of them to do that. That isn’t unusual for either of them.”
The Crimson finished the game on a 21-9 run and held the Raiders to five points in the final five minutes. Harvard’s rotation down the stretch featured a mix of experience and new players, who came together to put away Colgate.
“I thought the way that we finished that game was the best thing that I’ve seen all season,” co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “The way we came together, made the adjustments, ripped down those boards in the time of need, and executed on offense, I was very pleased with it.”
The Raiders jumped out to an early lead, penetrating Harvard’s defense and getting high percentage shots inside. Dinkins kept Harvard in the game, connecting on four first-half threes for 12 points. The game was a breakthrough for Dinkins, who had scored 15 points total in a Crimson jersey Saturday. The senior was making her first career start and finished the game with 14 points, three assists, and three rebounds.
“It all came from my teammates,” Dinkins said. “They were looking for me, and they gave me some awesome passes, and I knocked them down. So, I definitely have to thank them for that awareness and give them all the credit.”
Colgate’s defense made it difficult for Harvard to get the ball inside, and the team had to settle for long jump shots early in the first half. Alongside Harvard’s starting line-up of four seniors and one junior, two players making their collegiate debuts played significant roles in the Crimson’s season-opening victory.
Destiny Nunley, a sophomore forward who missed all of last season with an injury, played 23 minutes and added seven points, including a key pair of free throws to help seal the victory. Freshman guard Kirby Porter registered two points and two blocks in her first career appearance.
After switching to zone defense, Harvard limited Colgate’s inside chances and went into halftime up by seven. Harvard padded its lead in the beginning of the second half as Fagbenle began getting better looks inside. The London native shot 8-of-10 from the field and added 12 second-half points.
The home opener had special meaning for senior point guard Ali Curtis, who faced off against her younger sister, Katie, a sophomore guard for the Raiders. Ali finished with two points, two rebounds, and an assist, while Katie, who guarded her sister early in the second half, saw seven minutes of action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After putting in long hours at a desk in Lamont—skimming through Facebook photos, reading a few New York Times articles, watching some skateboarding YouTube videos, and studying a fascinating piece of lint next to my untouched homework—I’ve always found a distinct pleasure in relieving myself from it all by heading over to the library’s third-story men’s bathroom to, well, relieve myself.
This may seem like a pretty normal occurrence. As the time-honored literature on the subject has taught us, everyone poops. But this bathroom trip has been anything but normal these past few years. That’s because every time I go into Lamont’s third-story men’s bathroom, I make note of how astonishingly, consistently, and improbably clean it is. In fact, it’s the most consistently immaculate bathroom I have ever seen.
The bright, fluorescent lights infiltrate every corner, producing a happy, spotless shine from every angle, like a bare baby’s bottom in a light bulb factory. The sinks never seem to have any splashed water in or around them. And even the toilets—the toilets—remain totally immaculate each time I pay them a friendly visit.
Sure: There is this funky burnt-cheese-type smell that comes from that bathroom, on occasion. But that’s rare and doesn’t diminish from the fact that every time I walk in there, I feel as if I’m walking into the marble-coated restroom atop the temple of Mt. Olympus, where the excrement of the gods is flushed for us mortals to worship down below.
Let’s focus on the toilets, again, for a minute. Their seats are plastic, so they never produce that wretched coldness that grasps the thighs in its steely grip. Their flush handles are an un-stained fluorescent green, which counterintuitively gives you the impression that they are safe to touch. And their flushing power never fails to handle the failures of my digestive system in handling a dining hall Scheherazade Casserole. And, most of all, by God, they are clean! They are clean!
I don’t know if it’s just me who has noticed this, or if it’s an unspoken observation by the entire male population of Harvard. But this type of cleanliness is completely unprecedented within the Harvard library system. The Widener bathrooms outside the reading room are pretty clean—certainly not dirty, as far as bathroom go—but they don’t shine with the brilliance of a bare baby’s bottom floating in space right next to the sun. Not even in the newly renovated Leverett House would you find such a shine. In fact, in the long and better-left-untold story of disgusting men’s bathrooms throughout history, this type of brilliance in cleanliness is a totally unprecedented and ground-breaking achievement for mankind.
I thought, at first, that maybe the Lamont third-story men’s bathroom goes unused. In theory, if one never uses a bathroom, it should stay clean. Sure, the traffic in that bathroom is modest. But, more often than not, there’s at least one other person in there when I’m there.
Fancy hotels have pretty clean-looking bathrooms, but that’s mostly because its amenities are so ornate that people don’t dare to make them look dirty. The Lamont bathroom, by contrast, doesn’t look like a particularly expensive bathroom. It’s pleasantly lit, but most of its surfaces are plain and plastic. Unlike the Ritz, this bathroom didn’t get it cleanliness from overspending.
So what is the mystical force at work behind this miracle?
Well, maybe it’s not a miracle. If I had to guess, two fairly normal things are at play here: the foresight of the unnamed architect who built the bathroom and the continued work of the staff who maintain it.
The floor plan is pleasant and the materials, although not ornate, are nice. And to keep it looking so nice, there must be constant maintenance. In fact, the vast majority of bathrooms on campus, although not on Lamont’s level, are clean and well-kept.
So, to whomever made the floor plan for the Lamont third-story men’s bathroom and to whoever routinely maintains its cleanliness, thank you. Walking in there always puts a smile on my face. That smile usually creeps out the guy at the urinal next to mine, but I think we’re all appreciative of how clean that bathroom is, as well as most bathrooms at Harvard. It may seem like “ordinary design and maintenance,” but as far as I’m concerned, you’re working miracles.
At a place like college, it’s easy to appreciate the stars in an astrophysics class or the grand stories of times long ago in a history class. But when pooping in Lamont library or farting in Winthrop library—actions that are so fundamental to our lives—it can be more difficult to appreciate the power and beauty of that room across from the high-minded lecture hall.
So, again, thank you. I don’t think I give nearly enough credit for the greatness what’s been in front of me all along.
Or, rather…behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard men’s basketball team (1-0) opened its season with a 21-point win over Cambridge neighbor MIT, it faces a stiffer challenge Sunday against Holy Cross in the Coaches v. Cancer tripleheader. Below, The Back Page takes a quick look at the three main things to keep your eye on heading into Sunday’s tilt.
Battle Up Front: Against MIT, the Crimson’s frontcourt hardly looked dominant. Wing Wesley Saunders outrebounded the entire frontcourt, 8-3, in the first half and the group as a whole pulled down only 18 rebounds on the night, three less than the Engineers. Holy Cross, which has nine players taller than 6’7” on the roster, will pose a significantly tougher test. The Crusaders will look to pound the ball inside and exploit Harvard’s interior defense, which was not really tested Friday night.
The Hot Hand: After losing one of the program’s all-time greatest shooters in Laurent Rivard ’14, concerns abounded in the beginning of the season about how well the Crimson would be able to shoot the ball. Conscious of this, the Engineers challenged Harvard with a 2-3 zone early and often in the Friday matchup, not letting the Crimson take advantage of its advantage inside and baiting it into shooting low-percentage three-point chances.
Harvard was happy to oblige, making seven of its 13 attempts on the night and looking comfortable stretching the defense. Saunders repeatedly got into the middle of the zone before kicking it out to junior co-captain Siyani Chambers and sophomore Corbin Miller (a combined six-for-10 from long range) for three after three. If the Crusaders try and go big, it will be crucial that the Crimson be able to punish Holy Cross with its outside shooting.
Getting Healthy: One notable absence from the Friday lineup was junior Agunwa Okolie, who had previously injured himself during a scrimmage against Providence. Indicators out of camp were that Okolie was going to be a starter for the year, and his health is crucial to monitor going forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just before the Harvard men’s basketball team started off its season, it already began to plan for the next one. On Tuesday, Vermont Academy three-star guard Corey Johnson became the fourth player to join the Crimson’s class of 2015.
Johnson, who boasts size (6’6”) and a nice shooting touch, is part of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s effort in recent classes to replace the shooting that left Cambridge last spring—when able shooters Brandyn Curry ’13-14, Kyle Casey ’13-14, and Laurent Rivard ’14 graduated.
The signing cements Harvard’s growing ability to recruit north of the border. Johnson, who is from Ontario, would be the fourth Canadian on the Harvard roster—joining freshman Chris Egi (Markham, Ontario) and juniors Agunwa Okolie (Ajax, Ontario) and Patrick Steeves (Montreal, Quebec).
Johnson will join Tommy McCarthy, Weisner Perez, and Blasa Dragovic in the four-person class, which could expand to five later this fall. McCarthy and Johnson, along with current sophomore Corbin Miller and freshman Andre Chatfield, will be the core of the future in the backcourt for Amaker’s squad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time ever, students interested in pursuing public service after graduation had the same opportunity those applying to elite private sector jobs have long enjoyed—interviews on campus.
Ninety-nine seniors, selected from a pool of 150 applicants, had one-on-one interviews on Friday with 20 public service organizations.
“It’s obvious to us that many Harvard College students have a passion for public service…but don’t know how to navigate finding opportunities in the sector,” said Gene A. Corbin, assistant dean of student life for public service. “This day is meeting an enormous need.”
Students in attendance agreed that the initiative was a much-needed signal from the College of support for careers in public service.
Diana I. Acosta ’15 said that she was heartened to see the University host the recruiting day, which was jointly organized by the Center for Public Interest Careers, the Institute of Politics, and the Office of Career Services.
“I think it is more than just a job opportunity for students,” Acosta said. “It’s a great message for the freshmen who are probably thinking about long-term goals.”
Another student participant, Erick M. Juarez ’15, said that he hopes that public service recruitment continues to develop.
“Hopefully this will grow into something of a staple of the Harvard College recruitment process as a whole, and can compete with finance and consulting recruiting sometime in the future and expand to other organizations,” he said.
Employers partaking in the inaugural Public Service Recruiting Day echoed the optimism of the students they interviewed.
Maribel H. Rivera ’04, a recruiter from Immigrant Justice Corps, said that she was interested in public service when she was a student at the College, but she did not have access to programs that would provide a clear pathway into the field.
“It’s really powerful and exciting to see that Harvard College really cares about public interest work and that it’s allowing its students a path to do what they want to do,” Rivera said.
Corbin, who coordinated the event, said that employers seemed impressed with the students they met, and would subsequently be making job offers.
The 20 participating employers included Green Corps, City Year, and Points of Light.
The day was financed by Hope S. Taitz, managing partner of ELY Advisors and a member of multiple nonprofit boards, and her husband Glenn P. Taitz.
Hope Taitz said that she and her husband will continue to sponsor the initiative in future years.
“We are committed to making this long-term for Harvard,” she said. “The key to success is innovation and collaboration, and this event combines both.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Legendary music industry executive Clive Davis described his transformation from Harvard Law School student to president of Columbia Records at a lecture in Wasserstein Hall on Friday afternoon. Answering questions from HLS Dean Martha L. Minow and audience members, Davis talked extensively about his work with Whitney Houston, Dionne Warwick, and other artists before a crowd of several hundred event attendees.
His talk came days after the release of “Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances,” a live album that celebrates some of Houston’s biggest hits, which Davis helped produce. Davis, who launched Houston’s career, remains one of the only non-performers to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He signed artists like Janis Joplin, Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin, and Alicia Keys.
“I am so nervous,” said Minow after Davis received a standing ovation at the start of the event. “I have interviewed Supreme Court justices; I have been with presidents of countries; [but] I’m just so nervous. I am a fan.”
Davis’ college years, he said, were characterized by great anxiety over his financial situation: both of his parents died when he was a teenager and left him only $4,000, the balance of his father’s life insurance policy.
This precarious financial situation, coupled with the rigorous curriculum at HLS, motivated him to work hard, he said.
“The fear that if you don’t maintain a certain average you’ll lose your scholarship just creates the drive, the determination, the scared necessity,” Davis said, adding that such a necessity solidified his work ethic, which would prove instrumental in his career.
According to Davis, his entrance into the music world after law school was purely accidental: Columbia Records happened to be one of the clients of the law firm where he worked after graduating from Harvard in 1956. The record company, in search of a general counsel, hired Davis, and eventually offered him the role of president after a string of promotions left the position vacant.
“[That is] how I became head of Columbia Records,” Davis said. “It wasn’t my awareness, any ambition, any training. It really just happened.”
In his role as president, Davis brought fame to now well-known artists such as Houston, whom Davis discussed at length at Friday’s event.
According to Davis, after Houston heard consistent negative feedback from critics, she asked him if she should be writing her own songs.
Davis said that he reminded Houston of the record-setting sales of her first two albums, which sold around 50 million copies in total, and told her that her biggest asset was the “genius” of her voice and not necessarily her songwriting ability.
Prompted by Minow, Davis concluded the event by briefly addressing recent changes to the music industry that have led to decreased record sales.
“The concept of music being free is abhorrent, is wrong,” he said. “The idea that creativity should not be rewarded is so antithetical to our culture.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year of playing catch-up to fellow Ivy League competitors, the Harvard women’s volleyball team stood two wins away this weekend from its first Ivy League championship since 2004.
Harvard didn’t let the opportunity slip away.
The Crimson dropped only one set on the weekend to clinch a share of the Ancient Eight title, finishing off Columbia in straight sets on Friday and ending the regular season with a 3-1 win against Cornell on Saturday. With these two wins, the Crimson forced a one-game playoff against defending Ivy League champion Yale to determine which team will represent the conference in the national tournament.
“It was pure euphoria,” sophomore Grace Weghorst said. “It was so amazing.”
After losing two of its first three conference games, Harvard swept its final 11 and will host the Bulldogs on Friday. The championship is the Crimson’s second in program history.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
Down to its last point, Cornell (6-18, 3-11 Ivy) tried to put a shot past juniors Jennifer Shults and Caroline Holte to extend the match. The Big Red had no luck. Shults and Holte emphatically blocked the shot to secure the third and final set for Harvard (19-4, 12-2), and were immediately mobbed by teammates.
“The game was full of emotion,” Weghorst said. “We came into it knowing that we absolutely had to win. If we didn’t win, we didn’t get the rings. It was definitely on our mind.”
The third set was not as one-sided as the final frame. The set featured 14 ties, including one at 22 points. Cornell had a chance to win the set at 25-24, but a kill from Weghorst sent the game to extra points. Another kill from Weghorst and an attack error from Cornell gave the Crimson a 2-1 advantage.
Victory was not always imminent for the Crimson. Cornell never trailed in the first frame, ultimately defeating Harvard, 25-20, without committing an error.
“We were tight and made a lot of errors in the first game,” Weghorst said. “We really think that we gave Cornell that game.”
The Big Red also took an early 2-1 lead in the second set, but three straight attack errors from Cornell and a kill by Shults shifted momentum back to the home team. These six kills were part of a 12-4 run that put the Crimson up, 15-6—an advantage that the team would not surrender.
Weghorst led the team with 16 kills, followed by 15 from co-captain Caroline Walters.
“It was definitely a very difficult game,” Weghorst said. “Cornell did not give us that win. We had to work for it.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 1
On Friday, Harvard dominated from beginning to end against Columbia (8-15, 4-10). The Crimson won in straight sets, each by at least five points, to keep on pace with Yale entering the last match of the regular season.
After the Lions won two consecutive points to bring the third set within five points at 24-19, Holte was able to secure a kill for Harvard and lift her team over Columbia, 3-0.
Harvard set the tone early in the match, jumping out to an early 11-6 lead and never letting the Lions get within five points after that point. The second set was contested early on, but after Columbia gained a one-point lead over the Crimson, 11-10, Harvard won seven of the next nine points, gaining control of the match and putting it one set away from finishing off the Lions.
Weghorst led the Crimson on Friday night, finishing with 11 kills. Sophomore Corie Bain fell two kills shy of completing a triple-double in the MAC, finishing with 20 assists and 10 digs.
“It was a crazy ride,” Weghorst said. “It was an absolutely amazing year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second year in a row, the NCAA Cross Country Nationals will have a representative from Harvard among its competitors.
Leading the Crimson with an 18th place finish at the NCAA Northeast Regionals this weekend, junior Tom Purnell was awarded an at-large individual bid from the NCAA committee. This will be the second year in a row that Purnell will compete in Terre Haute, Ind., after he was a member of the men’s group that qualified last season.
“The big highlight was getting Tom through to the National Championship,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “He’s continuing to get some great experiences against the nation’s best, and we’re pleased with the way that he has been developing.”
While both the men’s and women’s team looked to qualify for nationals as a team by placing in the first two slots over the weekend, Harvard ultimately fell short of its goal. The men finished sixth and the women placed 11th.
The men came in with a chip on their shoulders as they attempted to move on from a seventh place finish at Heptagonals.
“It was an open race,” Purnell said. “We had been training well, but we weren’t able to piece it together [at Heps].”
Purnell came down the finishing chute with a time of 30:46.12 and was followed by captain Will Geiken, who crossed the finish line with a time of 31:01.75, good enough for 25th place.
Junior Chris Allen clocked a time of 31:20.51 for a 41st place finish. Senior classmates Nephat Maritim and Daniel Milechman finished off the scoring contingent for the Crimson with times of 31:24.67 and 31:30.67, finishing 44th and 51st, respectively.
While the team was unable to nab one of two automatic qualifying spots for nationals, Harvard was able to exact some revenge on its Ancient Eight rivals. The Crimson finished ahead of Yale, Brown, and Dartmouth, beating three of the five Ivy squads present at the competition.
The only result with further postseason implications came a day later with the announcement of Purnell’s inclusion in the nationals field, building upon an already impressive season for the Second Team All-Ivy runner.
“It feels great,” Purnell said. “One of main goals for the season was to qualify. I had a good experience last year but I didn’t run very well, so I wanted to get another shot.”
Meanwhile, the women came into the event hoping to return to nationals after having barely missed out on an at-large bid following a third-place finish at regionals the year prior. This year the women’s team again missed out on qualifying for future play, as the women finished with a total of 283 points and an 11th place finish.
Senior Molly Refner led the Crimson with time of 20:54.81 on the 6k course, matching Purnell with an 18th place finish.
Fellow seniors Whitney Thornburg and Viviana Hanley followed with times of 21:23.45 and 21:34.58, good enough for 42nd and 56th. The scoring contingent was closed out by junior Paige Kouba and captain Alaina Alvarez, who both finished inside the top 85 of the 275-person field with times of 21:51.76 and 21:52.90, respectively.
Though the women did not manage to extend their season like they had hoped, Saretsky believes that the team performed well and was able to walk away with their heads held high.
“They competed well, competed hard, and left it all out there on the course,” Saretsky said. “Molly Refner had a great run, maybe her best cross country race during her time here.
Though the season is over for the women, Purnell now sets his eyes on nationals, while the rest of the team look to close out their seasons on a high note at the IC4A Championships next weekend at Van Cortland Park, N.Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a pair of wins to open its 2014-2015 campaign, the Harvard women’s ice hockey suffered its first setback of the season.
Kicking off a five-game road stint, the Crimson (2-1-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) couldn’t finish off a win in a pair of overtime contests, settling for a tie on Friday against Clarkson (9-3-1, 4-0-1) and dropping a 5-4 decision against St. Lawrence (6-5-1, 3-2-0) the following evening.
“[It was] obviously disappointing,” junior Miye D’Oench said. “You never want to walk away from a road trip with one point. Especially with two overtime games, we really felt like we were right there.”
ST. LAWRENCE 5, HARVARD 4
Facing a two-goal deficit midway through the second period, the Crimson mounted a strong comeback but could not come up with a win in its 5-4 overtime loss to Saints.
Harvard found itself in a 1-0 hole early off a power play goal by junior forward Jenna Marks. But Crimson co-captain Samantha Reber put Harvard right back in it ten seconds later with a strike of her own to even the score.
Sophomore forward Sydney Daniels added a score to put the Crimson up, 2-1, but St. Lawrence stormed back with three unanswered goals to give the Saints a 4-2 edge heading into the tail end of the second frame.
“We just had some bad bounces at the beginning of the game,” D’Oench said. “[We had] some defensive breakdowns that led to their opportunities. But I thought we put pressure on them from start to finish.”
Despite outshooting St. Lawrence, 13-5, in the second period, the Crimson could only muster one goal from senior Hillary Crowe, who netted her first of the season with four minutes to go in the middle frame to cut into the Saints’ lead.
“We didn’t panic,” Reber said. “We knew we had the ability to come back and hopefully win the game. In general, we just got better and better as the game went on.”
The Crimson continued to press the Saints, outshooting the home team, 8-6, in the final minutes of play. With less than two minutes in regulation, D’Oench scored the equalizer, sending the Crimson into its second overtime period in as many nights.
But Harvard couldn’t find the back of the net in the overtime, as St. Lawrence’s Kayla Raniwsky drilled in the game winner just over a minute into extended time, sending the Crimson home with its first loss of the season.
HARVARD 2, CLARKSON 2
After jumping out to a 2-0 lead, the Crimson settled for a tie in Potsdam, N.Y.
Freshman forward Haley Mullins got Harvard on the board less than 90 seconds into the first frame with an unassisted goal. The Crimson added another when Sydney Daniels scored her second of the season eight minutes into the second period.
But Harvard lost the early momentum with numerous penalty infractions in the second and third frames. The Crimson accumulated 23 minutes in the box, while the Golden Knights accrued just one two-minute infraction.
“We spent over a third of the game killing penalties,” D’Oench said. “It’s hard to get momentum back when you’re doing that. I thought five-on-five we absolutely dominated the game, but sometimes you’re going to get calls that don’t go your way, and you have to figure out a way to win anyways.”
Harvard was outshot by Clarkson, 14-5, in the second frame, as the Crimson played a man down for almost half of the twenty-minute period. Junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer came up with 25 saves on the night, but could not fend off Golden Knights’ late charge.
Junior forward Olivia Howe found the back of the net with less than thirty seconds in the second frame to bring Clarkson within one heading into the final period. A tripping penalty on Harvard junior Mary Parker gave the Golden Knights a man advantage. Clarkson capitalized on the penalty as junior Renata Fast slid on past Maschmeyer to tie the game at two-all just two minutes into the third period.
The Crimson outshot Clarkson, 3-1, in extra time, but neither side could put one away in the five minutes of overtime play.
“Although we didn’t come out with the wins we wanted, it was a good start to the year,” Reber said. “The things we need to fix are easy for us. It’s a good starting point.”

Revenge came a little too late for the Harvard men’s soccer team (11-4-2, 4-1-2 Ivy), which closed out its regular season with a 1-0 road victory over Penn (6-9-2, 2-3-1). The win left the Crimson eligible for the Ivy League title, but wins by Princeton and Dartmouth—which split the championship—pushed Harvard to a third-place finish.
“I thought that the guys very typically worked very hard and as the game went on we continued to get better and better,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “The group pressed really hard to get that goal…. home or road, we are really going to go after them [offensively].”
The setting at Rhodes Field was vastly different than the last time the two teams played. A year ago, Penn visited Harvard with the league title on the line. The Quakers, 2-0 victors on that night, remain the last squad to leave Cambridge with a win, after the Crimson finished a perfect 9-0 home slate last weekend against Columbia.
A year later, defense was again the story for the Crimson. Harvard had allowed more than one goal only once in six previous Ivy League contests coming in and the defense held up against a pressing Penn offense. The Quakers generated 20 shots for the game, including nine between forwards Louis Schott and Alec Neumann.
Junior goalkeeper Evan Mendez held steady all goal in game, however, earning his fourth shutout of the year with a season-high eight saves. He finished off the season with 56 saves, a new career high.
“Evan has done a great job of being a consistent voice for us in the back,” junior co-captain Mark Ashby said. “He always does a great job of organizing the defense and he seems to come up big in big games. Last night, he consistently came up with big save after big save, and it’s been a pattern over the last couple years. That’s why he is our guy in the back.”
Lehrer echoed Ashby’s praise of the junior keeper.
“Evan is fantastic with making improvements daily, looking at things to improve, knowing what his strengths are, and maintaining those as strengths,” Lehrer added. “That’s a sign more than anything else of someone who is admirably aware of what they do.”
While the defense held steady, the offense struggled to grab chances. Co-captain Kyle Henderson nearly snuck an early shot by Penn keeper Max Polkinhorne in the 22nd minute, but the Crimson was unable to generate any other substantial chances early on.
It wasn’t until late in the second half that the Crimson was able to convert. Starting in the 80th minute, the offense came to life. Consecutive shots by freshman midfielder Christian Sady and Henderson were blocked by Polkinhorne, but eight minutes late Sady was able to convert on an assist from junior Jake Freeman.
“Christian is exceptional with his passing; he is a pro-level passer as a freshman,” Lehrer said. “Any freshman who can come in and have five assists, that’s a pretty significant impact…. Christian has been a huge asset and he is only going to get better. As his defending improves, as his mentality of grittiness in how he defends improves, he is going to be one of the best players in the country.”
Unable to get the league’s automatic bid, the Crimson—which ended the season with 11 wins, its most since 2009—will likely be on the outside looking in for the NCAA Tournament. Harvard, which ranks no. 55 in the RPI, maintains a slim chance of earning an at-large bid to the 48-team tournament.
Lehrer noted that the team likely has to rise at least 10 spots in the rankings to secure an at-large bid. Although he noted that the team will likely rise after securing a solid conference road win, he was not optimistic about its chances Monday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swim and dive team touched the wall first to end the 2013-2014 season. On Saturday, the reigning Ivy League Champions were first off the block.
The Crimson claimed victory in its first meet of the season, earning nine first-place finishes to top the Big Red, 169-131, and the Big Green, 246-54, at Blodgett Pool.
“I thought the team performed incredibly well for this early in the season,” co-captain Mike Gaudiani. “We had some great swims and rose to the occasion to race a rested and suited Cornell and a competitive Dartmouth team.”
The Crimson had big shoes to fill, losing several seniors from the class of 2014, notably NCAA Championship qualifiers Danny Crigler and Chris Satterthwaite. However, a strong freshman class helped bridge the gap in the team’s first of three home meets this season in Blodgett Pool.
The freshmen out-swam some of the veteran members of the team. In the 200-yard medley relay, a freshman squad of Koya Osada, Shane McNamara, Steven Tan, and Ed Kim edged sophomores Jack Manchester and Eric Ronda, junior Jacob Luna, and co-captain Griffin Schumacher by .28 seconds.
"The freshmen have already significantly impacted the team from a performance and culture standpoint," Schumacher said. "They all swam very well [on Saturday] and are pushing us in practice every day."
McNamara, a USA Swimming Junior National Team member, also finished first in the 100 breaststroke by a finger length, beating Big Red freshman Alex Evdokimov by .21 seconds. Tan also reached the top of the podium with a win in the 100 butterfly, out swimming teammate sophomore Max Yakubovich by .7 seconds.
In one of the closest and most exciting races of the meet, Ronda defeated defeated Cornell junior Victor Luo by .02 seconds with a time of 1:58.69. Trailing after the first two laps, the sophomore pulled ahead during the final 50-yard stretch.
Senior Spenser Goodman claimed victory in the 200 freestyle with a time of 1:40.01. Goodman competed against his brother Slater, who is a freshman at Cornell and finished in 10th with a time of 1:45.68.
The Goodmans were not the only brothers competing in the meet, as Crimson sophomore Sean Satterthwaite faced off against his older brother, senior Cornell swimmer Tim Satterthwaite, in the first leg of the 400-yard freestyle relay, which the Big Red would go on to win.
On the boards, senior diver Mike Mosca picked up right where he left off last season as he swept both the 1-meter and the 3-meter competitions. In the 3-meter, the next closest competitor to Mosca was Harvard freshman Bobby Ross. Mosca finished the event with 432.60 points compared to Ross’ 331.65 points. Meanwhile on the 1-meter, it was Crimson freshman David Pfeifer who placed second, 302.25 points to Mosca’s 331.65.
With Saturday’s wins, the Crimson took its first steps toward matching its perfect record against Ivy League competitors last season. Harvard will have another chance to add to its win total next Friday against Columbia at Blodgett Pool.
"There definitely is a shift in mindset that comes with being the reigning Ivy League Champs," Schumacher said. "I think we’ve been doing a good job of staying away from complacency and drawing motivation from it instead. We know that the competition will be tough come February."

While Harvard stopped providing its students with build-your-own bomb shelters and an inescapable sense of dread decades ago, at least one Cold War relic has stuck around: the red phone. These crimson clunkers, lovingly placed in each room by Dorm Crew at the start of the year, go tragically underused. Luckily, we’ve come up with a few ways to warm up to your hotline.
1. Cockroach bludgeon. Pest problem? Smash away, but be careful: like a matador’s cape, waving the red phone around too much may further aggravate your roaches.
2. Double-sided spoon. Forgot to Annenburgle some silverware to go with those Frosted Mini Spooners? Your iPhone can't hold cereal like this.
3. An avant-garde accessory. It’s a real conversation piece.
4. Souvenir. Seniors, the red phone makes a great memento of your time at Harvard! Plus, you can pick up the line from anywhere in the world and hear HUPD demanding that you return it immediately.
5. Shower mic. Put down that bottle of shampoo, grab your red phone receiver, and belt out "Pocket Full of Sunshine" like you're at TD Garden and not in a three-square-foot stall. Note: do not plug the red phone in.
6. Emergency health care. Sick between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.? Give triage a try – the red phone can get you (exactly none of) the help you need.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Getting adequate health care, finding gender-neutral bathrooms, connecting with employers—those are a few of the problems faced by transgender people which six teams aimed to tackle through technology at the Harvard Innovation Lab over the weekend.
The teams of college students and community members from around New England participated in a “hackathon” aimed at generating technological solutions to issues facing the transgender community.
The event was organized by the San Francisco-based project Trans*Hack, in partnership with the numerous Harvard organizations.
Van Bailey, director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said that bringing Trans*Hack to Harvard was “part of a dream.”
According to Bailey, the event was originally conceived almost a year ago, when Bailey connected with Trans*Hack and realized the project was a “perfect fit” with the i-lab, which encourages innovation and entrepreneurship at Harvard.
“Oftentimes, I find myself at the office thinking of problems, but not knowing how to solve them,” Bailey said. “[Trans*Hack] is on the ground, and brings some really transformational people together in one place to handle them.”
Bailey added that in addition to producing tangible products to benefit the trans community, Trans*Hack also serves to provide inspiration and networking opportunities for the participants.
Participant Logan Henderson said the weekend had been affirming for him, as a queer person of color interested in computer science. A sophomore at Dartmouth, Henderson said he sometimes found his academic experiences alienating and discouraging, and he struggled to connect in classes with his peers, the majority of whom are white and male.
“I’m coding for a reason that I’m invested in, for an idea I’m passionate about, with people that I enjoy coding with,” Henderson said, as he described his experience at the event. “Because I have a personal stake [in it], it makes it easier to do—to ask for help, to branch out and be creative.”
Henderson was part of a team which proposed a website that provides a platform for queer campus organizations to record important actions and events. According to the team, the high turnover of leaders in any student group makes continuity in its work difficult, and past events are difficult to find on Twitter and Facebook. The website solves the issue by giving LGBTQ college activists a tool to create “institutional memory.”
Founder of Trans*Hack and queer and trans activist Kortney R. Ziegler called the event “something of a pilot test” for the organization. Ziegler said that while the project has hosted events in cities nationwide, this was the first time it organized one on a college campus. He added that the project’s “hackathon” at the iLab was also the first to have not only a focus on technology, but also on entrepreneurship.
A panel Friday highlighting transgender founders of technological and social enterprises prefaced the hackathon weekend, which concluded Sunday evening with demos from each of the teams.
The event’s Harvard sponsors included the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Harvard College Women’s Center, the Office of the Assistant to the President for Institutional Diversity and Equity, and a number of queer student groups including the Transgender Task Force, Queer Students and Allies, and Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 17, 2014, at 1:50 a.m.
University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira is expected to announce a 24-hour walk-in urgent care system to replace Stillman Infirmary when it closes next semester, according to top Undergraduate Council leaders.
The announcement would come after many students criticized the University’s decision to close Stillman in order to shift resources to other UHS services.
Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the Council’s vice president, said Barreira called him a few hours before the UC’s meeting on Sunday night. According to Goffard, Barreira said that after reading and responding to students’ emails and meeting with his team, he intends to announce a 24-hour walk-in urgent care center, ideally in the same location as Stillman.
“[Barreira] very strongly emphasized his understanding that there really needs to be a physical place where people can go to,” Goffard said.
While Goffard said the center would not have beds for students overnight, as Stillman currently does, there would be trained nurses to provide treatment and assess whether patients needed to be transferred to a local hospital. Students would be able to stay at the care center for a few hours, according to Goffard.
“This would be a place where students could bring their friends in emergencies such as alcohol intoxication, so that they could be checked,” Goffard said.
The in-person triage system is designed “essentially to replace” Stillman, Goffard said.
After Goffard informed the UC of Barreira’s impending announcement, the Council voted to express its disapproval of the infirmary’s closure and to formally request that Barreira respond to additional questions about the health service changes and incorporate student feedback in determining future changes.
The legislation called on the administration “to place their decision on hold and collect campus-wide input from students before going ahead with any further steps.”
Barreira and UHS administrators—in partnership with the UC and HealthPALs, a liaison group between UHS and students—will host two question-and-answer sessions this week.
Before the vote, the Council invited Taonga Leslie ’15, who published an editorial detailing potential problems with phone triage and co-authored the Council’s legislation, and Jack J. Huang '16, a HealthPAL representative, to discuss the recent health service changes.
Huang detailed student concerns he had heard, which included questions about the cost of ambulance rides to nearby hospitals and waiting times once they arrived. UHS officials are currently considering the possibility of a vehicle to provide transportation to Mt. Auburn Hospital, and are working with the hospital to streamline the process for Harvard affiliates who do not require emergency room care, Huang said.
Huang also said that the UHS pharmacy, currently housed on the first floor of the Smith Campus Center, will be relocated to another area of the building closer to other UHS services.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Goffard said that they were continuing discussions with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana regarding the possibility of a new grant that would draw in part from money currently used to fund Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Often clad in Wonder Woman costumes, one pair of Undergraduate Council contenders have branded themselves as a heroic alliance.
Presidential candidate Happy Yang ’16, a seasoned Council representative, and vice presidential hopeful Faith A. Jackson ’16, an outsider, say that their mission as superheroes is not leaping tall buildings in a single bound, but transforming the College’s student government.
Omnipresent in Yang and Jackson’s bid for the UC’s top leadership positions are the words “happy” and “faith.” Pharrell’s “Happy” has become their campaign theme song. Their slogan “Be Happy, Have Faith,” is a nod not only to their names, but to the ticket’s two broadest goals: If elected, Yang and Jackson hope to create a happier campus by increasing attention to student wellness, and to restore student faith in the UC.
Specifically, the two candidates call for more non-gendered and racially inclusive social spaces, increased student input in Harvard’s sexual assault policy, and a focused Undergraduate Council that appeals more to the general student body.
HAPPY & FAITH
Even though the two wear identical Wonder Woman-inspired costumes, their experiences with the UC—and their opinions of it—are distinct.
Their differences, the two said, would make their leadership of the UC more effective.
Yang and Jackson first met during the First-Year Urban Program in 2012. Though they have pursued different interests since then, they remained friends and ultimately decided to run together earlier this semester when Yang approached Jackson about the possibility of a campaign.
“We complement each other very well,” Yang said, citing her own knowledge of the inner workings of the UC, compared to her running mate’s familiarity with UC “outsiders.”
Yang, an economics concentrator in Currier House, was born in China and raised in San Francisco. She has been a member of the UC since her freshman year, serving first as a representative for Elm Yard and now for Currier House. She is also the director of the UC’s Student Faculty Committee.
Attributing her involvement in student government to her Chinese background, Yang said that “[in China], democracy doesn’t exist. After I came here, I realized how powerful it is to have a voice.”
In addition to her commitment to making her voice heard, she also makes a point to listen to others, said William Oh ’18, an Ivy Yard UC representative and the Council’s current parliamentarian, who has worked closely with Yang.
“She stops and asks ‘How are you?’ and asks about your day,” Oh said. “Listening is such a key characteristic in a leader.”
Jackson—an economics concentrator from Washington, D.C., and a resident of Winthrop House—has dedicated her time at Harvard to student activism as well as the Harvard Mock Trial Association and the Institute of Politics.
Jackson has no prior experience on the UC, which she and her campaign teammates see as a strength in the race, rather than a weakness.
Moriya Blumenfeld ’16, a core leader of the campaign and Jackson’s blockmate, said, “[Faith is] coming in with a fresh look on what are the things that could be done better, and she’s really acting on executing.”
KEEPING FAITH IN THE UC
Yang said that what sets the ticket apart from the rest of the candidates is their advocacy for change to the way the Council works for students.
The two have said that they plan to reform a body that they think currently does not serve as an appropriate intermediary between the student body and the administration. Specifically, Yang and Jackson plan to create specialized task forces for larger issues so that students have specific points of access to introduce their ideas and opinions.
“[The] UC has great access and organizing power, and that’s what I really want to uncover,” Jackson said.
Tapping into that potential, Yang said, would make the UC more useful to students.
“There are so many students out there on our campus who want to make a difference, but a lot of times they don’t see the UC as a channel for change,” she said.
Campaign manager Irfan Mahmud ’16 echoed this sentiment.
“You don’t have to work around the UC. You can work with the UC, leverage the UC’s voice with the administration, and then also have student input, student guidance, on issues that are important to the student body,” he said.
And while Yang and Jackson aim to forge a stronger connection between students and the Council, they have said that it is also important that the administration sees the UC as a legitimate institution.
If that were to be achieved, Yang and Jackson said they would leverage the UC leadership’s access to administrators to effect the changes that the student body desires. This, they said, is crucial to reestablishing the UC as a channel for student-administration relations.
BUILDING A HAPPY CAMPUS
While goals for reforming the UC dominate their campaign, Yang and Jackson have also indicated that they also plan to address more fundamental issues of student life. Namely, they have pointed to their hope of increasing student happiness by improving mental health and campus culture.
Noting that campus social life seems divided along racial and socioeconomic lines, Yang and Jackson said they want to provide inclusive social spaces for students.
“We all take the same classes, for the most part, but where we go on a Friday night can be a divisive issue,” they wrote in a statement on their campaign website. “There should a place any student can go for parties.”
Jackson said she has met with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana several times to discuss her idea for non-gendered social spaces, which she said Khurana seemed to support.
In addition to advocating for all-inclusive social spaces, Yang and Jackson are campaigning on a plan to provide a multicultural space for minority groups.
In campaign materials on their website, the duo criticizes the College for the fact that minority spaces are below ground: the Women’s Center is in the Canaday basement, and the BGLTQ office is in the basement of Boylston Hall. They advocate for a multicultural center in a more prominent location. On their website, they say that students should work with the administration now to secure a space in the Smith Campus Center.
Yang and Jackson also point to the importance of mental health as a determining factor for student happiness. The website says that they will seek to improve campus-wide mental health by creating  nap spaces for Harvard students where they will be able to alleviate stress and sleep deprivation.
In addition, their campaign proposes a mental health “Survivor” network, which would pull together organizations such as Harvard Student Mental Health Liaisons and Room 13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From Head to the Foot, the attitude is the same for the Radcliffe lightweight team.
A month ago, thousands of fans gathered along the Charles River for the world-famous Head of the Charles Regatta. This weekend, Radcliffe boats raced before less crowded banks at the Foot of the Charles, a 6000-meter race that includes the Head of the Charles course.
Despite the difference in publicity and name recognition, the Black and White did not take the race any less seriously.
“Head of the Charles is definitely the biggest race of the fall season just because so many international teams so many different collegiate teams come,” co-captain Olivia Henry said. “It’s just a huge weekend for all rowers. That being said, we work equally as hard coming up to Foot of the Charles because every race we want to make the best race ever.”
This mentality was evident this weekend for the Radcliffe lightweights. The Black and White’s first lightweight boat came in first for lightweights and fourth overall, with a time of 21 minutes, 28.3 seconds. Two other Radcliffe boats raced as well, coming in fifth and seventh for lightweights.
Northeastern’s heavyweights took first out of 23 boats with a time of 20:41.8, topping the runner-up Radcliffe heavyweights by five seconds.
“The fact that we were able to field three competitive eights shows that our team has so much depth, especially from our freshmen and seniors,” sophomore Katelyn McEvoy said. “Our seniors contribute to our depth, leading by example to create a culture on our team that emphasizes hard work, dedication, and camaraderie. Their years of experience are invaluable to us.”
But this year, even the most experienced rower had to make adjustments, as the race has been increased by half a mile. Apart from the new endurance aspect, the change allowed the rowers to row in eights instead of fours, as they had before.
The race was also a head race, meaning the boats were timed instead of racing side by side. This, along with the openweight field, sets a challenging race for the lightweight boats.
“Head races can be challenging when boats begin to pass one another and both want to take the inside of a turn, especially on a river as winding as the Charles,” McEvoy said. “The boats may become spread out, so another team could beat you by seconds without you ever realizing that the race was so close.”
Although this format tested the rowers, it also allowed the Radcliffe lightweights to pace themselves off he heavyweight boats. Guhan alerted her teammates  to the positions of competing boats throughout the race.
“As a coxswain, how I deal with [a head race] is I just continue to call out those other boats,” Guhan said. “It’s even more exciting if you can beat them because we’re not even supposed to be competing against them.”
The weather provided another challenge, as the race took place in 34 degree weather, with a 12 mph headwind.
“The weather conditions were definitely not ideal,” McEvoy said. “The wind-chill was uncomfortable, but the strong headwind proved to be much more of a problem for us. It made us lose our rhythm several times throughout the race.”
Despite the weather and format changes, racing on home turf proved an advantage for Radcliffe.
“The nice thing about going to Harvard is that we get to practice on this river every day,” Guhan said. “We know the course very well. We know exactly what to expect.”
Perhaps the most significant aspect of the regatta was that it marked the close of the Black and White’s fall season. Now, the rowers look toward winter training to prepare for their main season in the spring.
“We’re at a really good point right now,” Henry said. “We’re getting very motivated to stay focused during the winter months, and stay training so we can come back and have a great spring season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While this might be senior Wesley Saunders’s last time playing in TD Garden wearing a Harvard uniform, don’t be surprised if the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year finds his way onto the hardwood of another professional team next year.
On a night when many of his teammates struggled, Saunders was dynamic, showcasing a plethora of moves that could ascend to the next level. The swingman poured in a game-high 24 points, shooting 50 percent from the field and going five-of-six from the charity stripe. The effort proved to be not enough to put Holy Cross away, as his team fell, 58-57, at TD Garden on Sunday.
“I think they came out with a level of intensity that was higher than ours, and we never matched it,” Saunders said. “This is a big reason why they came out on top, along with the turnovers and forcing us into tough shots.”
After Holy Cross burst out to an 8-0 lead, Saunders found senior Jonah Travis, setting up Travis for the dunk. Despite the slow start, Saunders remained calm. After knocking down a jumper, the Los Angeles native then proceeded to drain a seemingly nonchalant three-pointer as he shrugged off his defender.
Following a seven-minute stretch in the first half during which no Crimson player managed to score a single point, Saunders ignited the Harvard bench with an acrobatic up-and-under reverse flip shot, drawing the foul and completing the three-point play. With less than eight minutes to go in the first half, Saunders accounted for all of Harvard’s points aside from his assist to Travis.
Similarly, following a 9-0 run by the Crusaders to open up the second half, Saunders was able to stop their momentum by penetrating the lane and drawing the foul, before knocking down two free throws.
Saunders’ ability to control his body and finish with contact was on full display Sunday night. Countless times, Saunders used his wide frame to attack the lane and draw contact, hanging in the air and finishing for the and-one.
The senior’s aggressiveness and ability to finish around the rim forced Holy Cross to collapse on him, leading to open looks for sophomore marksman Corbin Miller and freshman Andre Chatfield from beyond the arc.
Though Saunders has been the team’s leading scorer the past two seasons, his presence on the defensive end helped keep the Crimson close all the way on Sunday night. He recorded game-highs in rebounds and steals, 12 and four respectively, along with three blocks.
Despite Saunders’ brilliant effort on both sides of the court, it all came down to one play. With 10.9 remaining and his team down one, Saunders dribbled the ball at the top of the key.
Looking for just one more buck, the senior drove and spun, getting his man in the air on the pump fake. While the jumper did not fall, it is seriously doubtful that Harvard would have even had a chance to steal the game from Holy Cross without his standout performance.
THE ENERGIZER BUNNIES
If slow starts continue to be a trend for Harvard, expect to see a lot more of Travis and Chatfield. Though neither player has the ability to really take over a game, both have exemplified a knack for providing a big boost for their team when it’s needed it the most.
After coming off of the bench for most of the 2013-2014 season, Travis started for the second straight game on Sunday. The forward was incredibly efficient, going four-of-six from the floor for nine points.
Travis displayed a great ability to move off the ball, and was the recipient of two beautiful bounce passes from Saunders and junior co-captain Siyani Chambers for emphatic dunks. In addition, just as Holy Cross looked as if it may distance itself, Travis showcased some nifty footwork, knocking down a fadeaway jumper to make it a one-possession game.
The senior was also a force in the paint. Travis grabbed seven rebounds and showcased an impressive ability to alter shots despite being only 6’ 6’’.
Chatfield, too, has provided a key spark for his team at crucial moments throughout the first two games.
After Harvard struggled to break away from MIT early in its home opener, Chatfield brought Lavietes Pavilion to its feet with a memorable one-handed slam. On Sunday, as Harvard again struggled in the first half, Chatfield provided key minutes, knocking down a clutch shot from deep to give the Crimson a 25-23 lead with two minutes remaining in the first half.
Chatfield struck again in the second period. Following a defensive rebound with 10:30 to play, Chatfield ran the floor, spotted up, and knocked down another three-pointer in transition with zero hesitation.
“He made two big threes which were big shots for us and gave us a shot in the arm when we needed it,” Amaker said. “I was very pleased with his performance and his poise.”
The speedy guard has fit right in with the fast pace of Chambers, as he has shown an ability to run the floor and get out on the break. As a result, with the game on the line on Sunday night, Amaker kept the freshman on the court, a clear sign of confidence in the young player.
At 6’ 4’’ and only 185 pounds, Chatfield’s build is much like that of the Los Angeles Clippers’s Jamal Crawford: skinny, lanky, with great footwork. But despite his slender frame, Chatfield has done nothing but battle and contest on defense.
The freshman pulled down four big rebounds on Sunday night, to go along with the three steals that he recorded against MIT. Chatfield played 21 minutes against Holy Cross, the most of any player off the bench.
“I never envisioned him playing as many minutes as he did, but we needed him,” Amaker said. “I was very impressed with his minutes and his effort.”
GIVING IT AWAY
The difference in Chambers from Friday night—when he did not turn the ball over once—to Sunday evening was night and day.
For a veteran who earned preseason recognition as a top point guard in the nation, Chambers’s performance against Holy Cross was something of an anomaly.  Flustered by countless double teams and full court pressure, the former Ivy League Rookie of the Year amassed nine turnovers in the loss.
“Your point guard has nine of the 24 [turnovers]—it is very difficult to think that we are going to beat a very good basketball team,” Amaker said.
But it wasn’t just the double teams and full court pressure that caused Chambers to lose the ball. Midway through the second half, Chambers had the ball taken right from his arms as he attempted to call out a play. Then, up 55-54 with just under three minutes to play, Chambers again struggled to break the press, traveling and giving the ball back to Holy Cross. Finally, after the Crusaders failed to score, Chambers, with 2:27 remaining, again lost the ball on an errant pass, leading to two free throws by senior guard Justin Burrell to put the Crusaders up, 56-55.
The press seemed to get to Chambers, who wasn’t available for comment after the game. He overthrew Saunders on a full-court outlet pass with just 1:54 left, allowing Holy Cross to eat up a majority of the clock.
However, with about 43 ticks remaining, Chambers proved that he was able to deal with the pressure. Down 58-55, Chambers drew another double team, and found co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi for the dunk.
But it was too little, too late.
Though Chambers is the point guard and assumes a majority of the responsibility for taking care of the ball, turnovers plagued more than just the junior co-captain on Sunday. Harvard had 24 turnovers on the night, more than double its average from a season ago.
“It’s not like they were going to call the press off or the pressure,” Amaker said. “We were not sharp where we needed to be, which was inbounding it and getting it across the half-court line. It was mind-boggling that we actually turned it over in that fashion.”
Harvard’s turnovers led to 27 points for Holy Cross. Meanwhile, the Crusaders only turned the ball over 11 times, a statistic that proved to be a true difference maker in its upset over No. 25 Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 met Ema H. Horvath ’16 freshman year when he knocked on her Matthews Hall door as part of his first ever campaign for the Undergraduate Council. Realizing they both hailed from Kentucky, they bonded over a shared background.
While Kanuparthy began his tenure on the UC as an Elm Yard representative that freshman fall, Horvath spent her time on the stage, playing Katherina in a student production of “The Taming of the Shrew.”
Kanuparthy would later serve as the UC’s historian, secretary, and now as its treasurer. Horvath similarly expanded her theatrical pursuits as a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club.
When Kanuparthy began to seriously consider running for UC president this past summer, he said that he struggled to find a running mate. He said that he initially asked other UC insiders to run with him, but none were willing to run as his vice-president, instead opting to headline tickets of their own for the UC presidency.
“I actually did ask a couple of people on the UC to run with me,” Kanuparthy said. “They’re both currently running for president, but I’m still friends with them.”
When Horvath heard in September that Kanuparthy intended to run for UC president, she said she offered to manage her friend’s campaign, having no intention of being on the ticket itself but wanting to explore a newfound interest in politics.
Now the two aspire to represent the student body together as UC president and vice president. They claim their partnership brings both experience and a fresh perspective to the ticket.
As a UC insider and outsider, the pair say they aim to improve student life and administrative decision-making by delivering four proposals related to summer storage, house renewal, student group funding, and the Smith Campus Center.
“It’s important to have leaders who both have experience and at the same time can take a step back and look at it from a different perspective,” Kanuparthy said.
A Politician and an Actor
Accumulating years of experience on the UC makes Kanuparthy confident that he can lead the organization, while Horvath said that she can use the communication skills she developed as a performer.
Kanuparthy, who originally hails from Louisville, Ky., will soon switch to a chemistry concentration from economics and chairs the Kirkland House Committee.
Alexander F. Weickhardt ’16, one of Kanuparthy’s roommates, describes him as “one of those people who knows a lot of people in the House and is really outgoing.”
“He really wants to contribute to the Harvard community,” Weickhardt said. “He’s still really close to his PAF-ees from last year, and he had a big get-together with them and you can just tell that they loved him. At one point they just started chanting, ‘That’s my PAF!’”
In terms of his participation in the UC, Kanuparthy said that moving up the ranks of the Council, including directing four of its five committees, first helped him realize that he could have a bigger impact on the organization and its future as president.
“I decided that if I want to make an impact on the culture of this organization, if I want to make an impact on the student body, I might as well run and see where it goes,” he said.
Horvath, on the other hand, has never participated in the UC. As an actor on campus, Horvath describes her social group as generally uninvolved in student representation to University and College administrators.
Horvath, an English concentrator living in Quincy, has performed in plays including “The Thing About Air Travel” and “A Streetcar Named Desire” during her time at Harvard.
“I come from a constituency who never votes,” Horvath said.
But when last year’s presidential and vice presidential winners Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 succeeded in their joke campaign for UC leadership, Horvath said, she became deeply interested in the UC’s affairs.
Though some might question the relevance of her acting background to representing the student body, Horvath said she thinks the communication skills that she gained through performance will enable the pair to lead a successful campaign.
“Someone asked Ronald Reagan how an actor could be president, and he said he didn’t understand how a president couldn’t be an actor. I think that’s very true, in terms of being effective, and an effective communicator, and being adamant in what I want,” Horvath said.
Referring to her 12 years of experience with communication exercises in theater school, Horvath also said that fulfilling a leadership role requires adopting a confident facade.
“A lot of it is faking it. Not being unsure of yourself is extremely important, [and] presenting the image that you’re someone the administration should listen to and needs to listen to,” she said. “I know how to be a squeaky wheel.”
A PLATFORM THAT (HOPES TO) DELIVER
Kanuparthy and Horvath promise to bring undergraduates four “deliverables”: guaranteed summer storage in the Houses, the chance to review floor plans of Houses that will undergo renewal with an eye toward keeping in-suite common rooms, better funding for new and small student groups, and increased transparency during the ongoing development of the Smith Campus Center.
Horvath explained her frustration with the College’s current storage situation. Following renewal, Quincy no longer offers space for students to store belongings over the summer, a development which will likely affect all Houses as the renewal process continues. Kanuparthy added that Harvard does not cover the cost of external storage providers.
“Not every House has free storage…. That is unfair, that some students have free storage in their Houses and others don’t,” she said. “I had to pay $400 out of pocket this summer for storage.”
The two promise that if elected, they will work to ensure that all students can store items in their Houses or obtain reimbursements from the College for any storage costs incurred.
Addressing problems that he feels exist in the current UC funding process, Kanuparthy plans to expand funding opportunities for newly founded clubs and those with fewer members and resources.
“Currently, UC funding privileges larger groups and ones that can get big turnout for events, which may not be the case for a group working on establishing itself,” Kanuparthy said.
Kanuparthy and Horvath also advocate for the preservation of private in-suite common rooms. They argue that they will be able to influence House renovation plans that will be under review in the upcoming year.
“They’re getting rid of in-suite common rooms to have common rooms in the hallway, and we think that’s a really bad idea,”  Kanuparthy said. “There are not too many social spaces on campus that belong to students. You know, your suite. Unless you’re in a final club, frat, or sorority, these are the spaces that belong to you.”
Finally, the two promise to advocate for increased social space in the Smith Campus Center, which is currently under renovation and set to open to students in 2018.
“It would be great to have more undergraduate space there, which I don’t think is the current intention from what whispers come out of the secret Smith campus planning center committee,” Kanuparthy said.
Still, the duo realize that accomplishing their goals is easier said than done. To that end, they want students to vote for them as leaders, ideas aside.
“The issues that are big now may not be the issues that are big later. The platform things are probably going to go out of the window in the majority of cases,” Kanuparthy said. “I think what won’t change is the people who you elect are the people who are going to represent you for the next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 worked on their first big initiative together two weeks before finals last spring. Working on a collaborative project between the Undergraduate Council and the Business School, they had to persuade busy undergraduates to sign up for the school’s inaugural online course offerings on its new HBX platform.
One hundred thirty-nine College students—20 to 30 percent of the course’s total enrollment—ultimately signed up, and all “unanimously had a brilliant experience,” Goyal said. The UC also received at least $1,500 in compensation from HBS, and is slated to receive at least $3,000 this year for continued publicity efforts.
Half a year later, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal both cite this project as a formative experience in their partnership.
“When you see things like that,” Goyal said, “when you’ve worked with someone on such a big project before, it was really a no-brainer that we wanted to work together [again].”
Hoping to continue their partnership with Nasrollahzadeh as president of the Council and Goyal as vice president, the three-year UC veterans are campaigning on a platform that seeks to find new funding sources for students and increase the sense of community among undergraduates.
THE FOUR Fs
Although Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal’s platform focuses on perennial UC issues like funding, they argued that their tangible plan to improve student life sets their campaign apart.
That plan will address what they call the “Four F’s”: funding, food, freshmen, and fear of missing out.
One of the pair’s top priorities is securing a steady source of funding for student groups by leveraging  alumni donations. They argue that the University should allow alumni to earmark a certain portion of donations to go directly to the UC.
“While we will definitely continue conversations with the administration to increase student group funding, we recognize that at some point the administration is just not willing to budge on this issue,” Goyal said.
Nasrollahzadeh serves on the UC’s Alumni Relations team, and Goyal is involved with the Harvard Alumni Association, and both said they have spoken with alumni who have been supportive of the idea.
“I informally pitched this idea of them giving just a part of their usual donations to Harvard...to the Undergraduate Council,” Goyal said. “They’re very receptive to the idea, because they can actually see their dollars at work in a very tangible manner. [And so] there’s this wealth out there that the UC has never leveraged in the past.”
Rahul V. Pandit ’15, president of the Harvard College Microfinance Project, which endorsed the ticket, cited these ideas for achieving financial sustainability as key to his group’s endorsement.
“The campaign’s concept of [leveraging] alumni donations,” Pandit said, “was very new, was very innovative, and really caught our attention.”
The duo also say they plan to improve the quality of student life by increasing attendance at extracurricular events and providing more meal options.
Nasrollahzadeh said that students are often unaware of the many activities that the UC funds. The ticket plans to address this “information asymmetry” by using a free mobile app called Ventfull. The app, which has already been implemented at Brown University, would display events happening around campus that relate to a student’s personal interests, and student groups would be required to add their events to Ventfull in order to receive UC grant money.
“Students will find it not only user-friendly [but also] pertinent to Harvard and up-to-date,” Nasrollahzadeh said.
The ticket also wants to implement weekend brain breaks, add more vegetarian options to the dining halls, organize a food truck festival for the River Houses, and ban midterms on Housing Day.
Tarik A. Moon ’15, who worked on the campaign, said Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal would bring passion and experience to the positions.
“I think they’re great people, great leaders, and very friendly,” he said. “They’ll listen to you whenever you go to them, they’re very passionate about the student body…and they know how to get things done.”
“THE BIGGEST FOODIE”
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal have based their platform on their personal experiences in the UC and at Harvard.
For Nasrollahzadeh, one of the primary motivators has been food. She referred to herself as “the biggest foodie,” a passion that has inspired some of the work she has done for the UC. Last year, for example, she spearheaded a food truck festival, and plans on advising the process this year as well.
As Student Relations Committee chair, Nasrollahzadeh said, she also played a key role in the Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Sietse K. Goffard '15 administration, which has focused on improving outreach to students and promoting engagement with the UC.
Nasrollahzadeh recalled that, when she first joined the UC, she thought that the organization's communications were too formal and distant.
“Why,” she asked, “are we just hitting people’s emails? And why are we speaking in such a formal tone that students can’t relate to?”
She said that one of her biggest accomplishments as SRC chair was to make the UC more approachable. As examples, she cited the launch of a new UC website, an increased social presence, and last year’s Ghost Protocol initiative.
Fellow UC representative Eva Stojchevska ’15 agreed with Nasrollahzadeh’s assessment, stating that “she really transformed the SRC ever since she took on that task.”
Nasrollahzadeh, a Detroit native, lives in Pforzheimer House and is concentrating in molecular and cellular biology.
HOT MEALS, AIR MATTRESSES AND THE HONOR CODE
Like Nasrollahzadeh, Goyal started as a freshman representative on the UC, serving on both the finance and education committees. In his first year, he worked on what he calls his “three big projects”: the honor code and honor council legislation that has now been adopted by the Faculty Council, the UC’s air mattress program, and, perhaps his proudest achievement, the shift of Annenberg hours from 7:00-10:00 a.m. to 7:15-10:15 a.m.
“If my kid goes to Harvard thirty years later,” Goyal joked, “I’m going to tell him: If you have a 9 a.m. class and you’re getting hot breakfast after that, I absolutely did that.”
Another accomplishment, Goyal said, has been to increase enthusiasm for the Education Committee, which he has chaired for the last two years as a representative for Lowell House.
Nasrollahzadeh said that under Goyal, the committee has been able to produce tangible results.
“In the past, the Education Committee was considered to have very theoretical ideas,” Nasrollahzadeh said. “Dhruv Goyal mobilized, revolutionized the Education Committee. I’ve never seen it be so fruitful in my three years.”
Goyal said his achievements include the HBX project and two referenda on this year’s ballot, one for a section size cap and one for the return of the difficulty score on the Q Guide.
Goyal is a Mumbai native concentrating in economics and would, he said, be one of the first international heads of the UC. Stojchevska, who also serves as co-president of the Woodbridge International Society, which endorsed the ticket, characterized Goyal as having an unprecedented “level of care and passion for everything.”
“He takes everything that he commits to very seriously,” she said. “That’s definitely a vote of confidence, because I know that he will take that level of commitment to a higher level if [the ticket] wins.”
DAY ZERO
If elected, both candidates promise to resign from their roles in other organizations on campus, setting a “precedent” for future presidents.
“The UC is our top priority and we understand the role, responsibility and time commitment that it has,” Goyal said. Moreover, he added, resigning would prevent any potential conflicts of interest, as the UC funds several of the student organizations they are a part of.
The pair also promised to hit the ground running if elected.
“If we are elected on November 20,” Goyal said, “[that] night we party, and then November 21 we start. We start absolutely off the bat.”
The Ventfull app would be rolled out in the “initial stages” of their presidency, and conversations with administrators about alumni donations would begin well before the pair officially assumes the presidency.
“You can’t wait until January,” Nasrollahzadeh said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Do you support modifying Harvard's current sexual assault and misconduct policy to include affirmative consent?
Yes.
Do you believe the UC can increase its yearly budget by 50 percent or more by the time you graduate?
No. But we'll damn well try.
Do you support allowing the UC to fund alcohol through its general grants?
No. The last time we did this we got our funding cut off for a bit. The Office of the General Counsel at Harvard already decided in 2008 that the College couldn't condone the UC's funding alcohol.
What is a major way in which you will differ from Gus and Sietse’s approach to running the Council?
We're switching the roles of the insider and outsider. But seriously, we'd like to do a lot of the same things.
How often do you think students should have to sign an affirmation of integrity under the College’s new honor code?
On every major assignment: midterms, research papers, finals, large projects.
Would you have supported a referendum question calling on the Council to reform its structures and do away with electing representatives based on Houses and Yards?
It depends. Council structural reform is a topic that can mire an administration and requires serious thought. That being said, for right now, the house/yard representation seems like a pragmatic solution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Do you support modifying Harvard's current sexual assault and misconduct policy to include affirmative consent?
Yes. Harvard's current sexual assault policy is well behind that of many of the Ivies and other schools when it comes to affirmative consent. We feel strongly about creating a safe space of equal opportunity on campus, and affirmative consent is an important component of this.
Do you believe the UC can increase its yearly budget by 50% or more by the time you graduate?
Yes. We believe that attempts to get more money from the administration have proved unsuccessful (e.g.250K campaign), and therefore we need a new model of external funding. Alumni have been very receptive to giving a part of their contributions to improving student life—by helping increase student group funding. Therefore, we have a clear mission of increasing the budget by leveraging alumni donations.
Do you support allowing the UC to fund alcohol through its general grants?
Everyone loves a good martini now and then, but funding alcohol through general grants may not be the best way for us to create community. Also, in 2007, UC President Ryan Peterson tried to fund alcohol, but the administration made it very clear that it is not an option and pulled the plug on UC funding for a few weeks, until the UC agreed to back down. Therefore, we would not compromise funding for all student groups, in an attempt to fund alcohol.
What is a major way in which you will differ from Gus and Sietse’s approach to running the Council?
We acknowledge the fact that we are not as funny and would not be able to match Gus’ humor but we can deliver clear, digestible infographics to simplify complex issues. Check out our facebook page for an example of an infographic we made for the UHS Stillman case. Infographics are much easier to read relative to long 20 page documents.
How often do you think students should have to sign an affirmation of integrity under the College’s new honor code?
Since Dhruv has done research on this topic as chair of Education Committee, we think that students should sign an affirmation at the beginning of documents that they submit for a grade. This broadly includes lab reports, problem sets, papers or any variant of exams. They should sign the affirmation once for every document.
Would you have supported a referendum question calling on the Council to reform its structures and do away with electing representatives based on houses and yards?
No.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a dreary Wednesday afternoon outside of Annenberg, and Undergraduate Council presidential candidate Luke R. Heine ’17’s inflatable pool has sprung a leak.
As Heine hurriedly patches the hole, his running mate Stephen A. Turban ’17 sprints across the Science Center Plaza, without his signature bowtie but clutching campaign flyers for the horde of students about to file out of Computer Science 50.
Aside from the unexpected leak, the pool works perfectly. It wins laughs, stares, and a photo with former Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer ’77, who is visiting campus to announce a major donation. The pool is the latest in a series of stunts aimed to increase the ticket’s visibility, and Heine and Turban are basking in the attention.
“This is what dreams are made of,” laughs Heine, applying a thick white coat of sunscreen to his nose.
Though they’re both veterans of the UC, Heine and Turban are emphasizing their differences from the rest of the Council. The two sophomores say the UC needs to remember its mission by focusing less on its internal parliamentary procedures and more on the students it supports.
POWER COUPLE
Heine, a computer science concentrator from Minnesota, and Turban, an economics concentrator from Missouri, met each other visiting Yale University’s program in Singapore when they were high school seniors. Both joined the UC during their freshman year, and both have been active in extracurricular life. Heine is a First-Year Outdoor Program leader, and Turban is a counselor with Room 13 and a teaching fellow for CS50.
Heine’s friends called him a natural leader whose enthusiasm is second to none.
Heine’s roommate, Matthew J. O’Connor ’17, said that Heine’s genuine devotion to the student body differentiates his ticket.
“Because he cares so much, he will dedicate the time [to the UC], has dedicated the time, and I imagine he will always do so,” O’Connor said.
Turban’s friends praise his ability to seemingly give 100 percent of his energy to all his commitments.
“Whether it’s just getting an organization to be more efficient and run more smoothly or getting people to notice something, Stephen’s full of awesome ideas,” said Lily H. Zhang ’17, who worked with Turban to organize a multinational flash mob to raise awareness of malaria.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, whom both Heine and Turban cite as a mentor, said that the ticket shows promise “in a field of extraordinarily talented candidates.”
“I think they are high-energy, absolutely committed to making Harvard better, able to galvanize interest in their peers, and very thoughtful about initiatives that would make a real difference,” he said.
LEVELLING THE FIELD
Despite Dingman’s words of praise, Heine and Turban acknowledged that some may consider their ticket premature, as both candidates are sophomores in a race full of juniors. Still, Heine and Turban argued that their relative youth is not a disadvantage.
“I think the UC can be run by anyone who is willing to work hard, is someone who really cares about other people, and is someone who connects with administration,” Turban said.
While a two-sophomore ticket has never captured the presidency, Heine’s FOP co-leader Elizabeth W. Pike ’15 said that Heine’s ability to connect with students across all classes would benefit the UC.
“He comes at everything with fresh eyes, and is really excited to make everything better,” said Pike, an inactive Crimson editor. “He’s gotten to know so many people on this campus already that he’s tapped into many different perspectives.”
In a year when every other ticket includes at least one woman and one person of color, Heine and Turban also acknowledged that a pair of white males may seem unrepresentative of a heterogeneous student body. However, Heine argued that these criticisms overlook less visible aspects of diversity.
“When we constrain diversity to a race, a creed, a location, I think that is an oversimplified metric of what diversity is,” he said. “I grew up in northern Minnesota, which is a very rural location. I actually thought the Ivy League was pretty uptight and pretentious, and I was going to go wherever the financial aid was the best. Just because I’m a white male doesn’t mean I lived a life of privilege at all.”
Heine and Turban have advocated for a major change to UC policy that, they said, will encourage the type of inclusion that they’re working for: they want the Council to resume funding alcohol for student groups, a practice which ceased in 2008.
“It’s about building a more inclusive Harvard, which is one of the world’s most exclusive clubs as is,” Heine said. “We want to make inclusive spaces where people can have a good time, where people can really connect with their class and build a community.”
Heine and Turban hope to use UC-funded alcohol to lessen disparities in funding among social groups and clubs.
“I don’t think there should be a shadow of socioeconomic background in how successful your club is,” Heine said. “Harvard is all about levelling the playing field and making it a meritocracy.”
A LITTLE LEVITY
Watching Heine and Turban mug for a photo with a very amused Ballmer, one thing is clear: while their aims may be serious, the two plan to have a good time getting there.
“Our primary goal is not concerned with winning,” Heine said. “Turbs and I want to have a meaningful campaign, but we want to have a lot of fun doing it.”
The desire to entertain earned the disapproval of the UC Election Commission last week, when the candidates were fined $15 for replacing dining hall bulletins with copies containing watermarked campaign ads.
Heine said that the infusion of comedy was aimed at making the Council more approachable.
“Before [Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15] ran, I personally was not a huge fan of the UC. I thought it was a bunch of resume stuffing,” he said. “But by bringing humor into the equation, it became a conversation.”
Turban added that some of the Council’s procedures serve little purpose.
“We often vote on voting, which is a bizarre procedure in itself. There are plenty of great student groups that show that you don’t need a rigid set of rules to have a student organization,” he said.
O’Connor said that the pair’s unorthodox campaign strategies should not undermine the ticket’s legitimacy.
“I would say that this is very far from a joke ticket; it’s one of the more serious tickets going,” he said. “The UC is not going to get that much publicity unless you do slightly outrageous things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Do you support modifying Harvard's current sexual assault and misconduct policy to include affirmative consent?
Our ticket personally supports affirmative consent, as the current wording of Harvard’s Sexual Harassment Policy is far too vague.  It is imperative to get the student body’s opinion on this issue, so we can confirm and present the student body’s opinion. The sexual assault policy exists to protect students; if a majority of students support affirmative consent (as we believe they do), the school is obligated to reform its policy accordingly.
Do you believe the UC can increase its yearly budget by 50 percent or more by the time you graduate?
Given the unsuccessful 250k campaign, instead of trying to get more funds, we are fighting to better manage what the UC already has. By assigning liaisons to each club who will help with the grant application process, we will make it easier for clubs of all sizes, new and old, to understand and apply for grants.  We will also better publicize existing workshops where club treasurers can learn how to apply for grants.
Do you support allowing the UC to fund alcohol through its general grants?
In 2007, the administration took away the UC’s budget because the UC funded alcohol.  While alcohol grants may be an attractive idea, they are not not worth losing our budget.  We are fighting to create vibrant social life on campus in other ways like through an inclusive social space on campus, where anyone can have a great Friday or Saturday night.
What is a major way in which you will differ from Gus and Sietse’s approach to running the Council?
We appreciate how Gus and Sietse have improved the image of the UC, but students are tired of the administration setting up task forces and organizing townhalls after decisions have already been made (Stillman, the Q Guide, and the sexual assault policy are all examples of failed policies where students were not consulted), and we will fight to get student input included in the decisionmaking process. The university gets comfortable knowing we will only be in office for one year, so we will enter the presidency with defined goals, feasible asks, and a mindset that simply having meetings is not enough.
How often do you think students should have to sign an affirmation of integrity under the College’s new honor code?
We believe students should have to sign an affirmation of integrity each semester, as part of the online registration process.
Would you have supported a referendum question calling on the Council to reform its structures and do away with electing representatives based on houses and yards?
We support including a referendum question like that on the ballot, whether or not we think students should vote in favor of it.  The student body should be able to decide how the UC works, and a referendum like this would provide that opportunity.  Faith supported the referendum’s proposed changes, while Happy did not, but we both feel that it is an important question to bring to the student body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Do you support modifying Harvard's current sexual assault and misconduct policy to include affirmative consent?
We definitely believe that the majority of student opinion is behind including an affirmative consent clause. We both have friends who have felt like the university has not treated their instances with the responsiveness that they deserve. To a large extent, we think that including affirmative consent will make the university more responsive when these reports are put forth.
Do you believe the UC can increase its yearly budget by 50 percent or more by the time you graduate?
Increasing the term bill by 40 dollars per a student (from $75 to $110) is entirely reasonable. This is comparable to many of our peer institutions (Stanford, Yale, MIT) who have activity fees that range from $100-$220 per a student. This should be a serious priority of the Undergraduate Council and the administration, for students clearly see extracurricular as a large part of their Harvard experience.
Do you support allowing the UC to fund alcohol through its general grants?
We believe that clubs should have the choice to throw whatever social event they feel fit. From the early ’90s until 2008, the UC did fund alcohol through its general grants (called a "party grant"). This policy was intended to create a more diverse social scene at Harvard (where the UC helps smaller clubs throw the social events that they'd like).
What is a major way in which you will differ from Gus and Sietse’s approach to running the Council?
The both of us are very interested in rearranging some of the procedures/structure of the UC. Though Gus and Sietse have changed the outward face of the UC, they haven't done much internally (we still follow by parliamentary procedure, we have the same meeting structure, etc.). If we want to make the UC work for the student body, we have to make the UC work for the UC members.
How often do you think students should have to sign an affirmation of integrity under the College’s new honor code?
So, there is a lot of research that shows that signing an affirmation of integrity agreement before taking a test reduces cheating. Similarly, however, there is research that shows that if you sign an honor agreement publicly at the beginning of the year this often increases the amount of academic dishonesty. To be realistic, signing an affirmation of integrity before every major test seems like a good middle ground between the two proposals.
Would you have supported a referendum question calling on the Council to reform its structures and do away with electing representatives based on houses and yards?
This is a fascinating piece of legislation that raises an interesting question: how do we identify ourselves on campus? We think this is a really interesting conversation to have, though we do have one contention. If we do restructure how we elect representatives, we have to also think about logistics, and the advantage of having one smaller area that you represent means that you can get to know the people you represent and you know who exactly to campaign for.

The Harvard Art Museums invited schoolchildren, seniors, and other Cantabrigian art lovers to celebrate the opening of its newly renovated facility over the weekend.
“It’s like visiting old friends,” said longtime Cambridge resident Ellen Kramer as she viewed the museum’s old collections rearranged in remodeled galleries during a community reception Saturday. The event featured remarks from the museum’s director and the superintendent of Cambridge Public Schools as well as musical performances from Harvard student groups and local musicians.
“I think [the renovated museum] brings Harvard to engage in better dialogue with the Cambridge community,” said Peter J. Atkinson, a facilities director for the museums.
The high-profile architect of the renovated museum brought many locals to the event, including Judy Townley, who earned a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1973 and still lives in Cambridge. “I am very interested to see how Renzo Piano integrated the components of this building,” she said, referring to the renowned Italian architect who led the redesign of the museums.
Many of the attendees expressed enthusiasm not only for the architecture, but also for the promise the new space offers community members of all ages, especially because admission is free to Cambridge residents.
“I have no doubt that this space will become a community hub,” said Jeffrey Young, the superintendent of the city’s schools.
“We wanted to thank Harvard for building a really nice annex to our high school,” laughed Young, referencing Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, which sits just down the street from the museum.
The proximity of the museum to several local schools makes it an attractive destination for field trips, noted Judy Clapp, a volunteer math tutor. “My little kids in first and second grade would really have their eyes opened by seeing art like this,” she said.
In addition to attracting Cambridge educators and schoolchildren, the museums’ opening drew visitors from Greater Boston, including Sophia Martinez, a second-grader from Belmont who made the trip with her mother to see the museum’s collection of Impressionist paintings.
“I think everyone who knows even just a little bit about art is excited that the environment is a little better for the pieces,” said April D. Edrington ’91, Martinez’s mother, who works at the Harvard School of Public Health.
On Sunday, crowds gathered for the official opening of the renovated museums, which had been under construction for years. The museums, which are now open to the general public, had offered Harvard students a preview of the new space at a Nov. 6 soiree.

Your Oct. 30 article in Fifteen Minutes about interracial dating on Harvard's campus, "With or Without Discrimination, Subverting Stereotypes Through Dating," presents the opinions of our experiences as a black-white couple as a series of critiques solely coming from the Harvard black community; in fact, our experiences with black students are only a part of our experiences here at Harvard and this article has falsely presented the black community as a monolithic entity with one negative voice regarding interracial relationships.
The way that this article is formatted presents our negative experiences as the main topic of the article. This is not what we agreed to do. We were approached by The Crimson, and after consideration, agreed to be featured, due to the fact that we love this campus, and genuinely believe that it can do better, and wanted to productively and positively contribute to the conversation. We were under the impression that we would be one of many couples of many racial combinations interviewed, and would have never agreed to do an expose on our qualms with Harvard black students alone, although this is what the article presents to readers.
Dami was emailed by Fifteen Minutes asking if we would be interested in being interviewed for an article about interracial relationships at Harvard. We agreed, and asked how many other couples would be featured, and were told the goal was three or four. Granted, three couples were featured, but there is a huge difference between dedicating a third of an article to each couple, and dedicating over half of a piece to one couple in particular, especially when the two couples barely written about are Asian and white, and the couple that is mainly highlighted is black and white, due to the strained history of race in the United States. When we sat down for the interview, we asked what the story was going to be and were told that although there wasn’t a story yet, it would arise from the comments of couples in the interviews. We are appalled that more sensitivity was not applied in portraying our comments with the nuances that we provided.
We do not regret doing this interview, nor are we apologizing for our experiences or pretending that they did not happen, but we do regret how our interview was represented. We talked about so much more than experiences with black students; we spoke about comments and experiences from the white side, in addition to telling a story about how Julie lost a close white friend during her time at Harvard due to her interracial relationship. These stories and experiences with students who are not black are either skimmed over or not mentioned at all, leading to a skewed and inaccurate portrayal of what we opened up about regarding our experiences on campus.
We believe that there is not enough nuance in portraying our story; if we had been interviewed by the The Crimson regarding our experiences as an interracial couple in general, our answers to questions would have been extremely different. We would have talked about instances that have occurred back home, with people who are much, much older than us. But that is not what our interview focused on: we were asked to talk about our experiences at Harvard, and we tried to open up best we could, and feel as if only bits and pieces of our responses were highlighted with no context provided.
Due to our experiences with loved ones back home, we recognize that racism is a multifaceted, complex thing and that many times, well-intentioned, good people of all races can still say problematic or hurtful things. We care about many of the people that we spoke about in this article, and that is why we were ambiguous with refusing to provide identities when telling these stories. We did not want any individuals to be publicly implicated, especially since many of them are friends. But by trying to avoid specifics, we feel as if the unintended consequence has been for the The Crimson to lump black students at Harvard into one angry, unsupportive group. Considering the heated and sensitive nature of race-related topics, and the courage and vulnerability that it took for us to come forward and interview about our experiences in the first place, we are disappointed in the coverage of our story.
We regret that the The Crimson has fumbled an opportunity to address an important topic, considering that according to 2010 Census data, 18 percent of heterosexual unmarried couples in the United States are of different races, and 21 percent of same-sex couples are mixed.  We feel that due to our sentiments being misrepresented, an opportunity for healthy dialogue concerning anxieties surrounding black-white relationships within the context of Harvard's campus has been lost in translation, resulting in understandable hurt and anger from many people that we care about on campus. Rather than becoming an article highlighting different couples at Harvard and their experiences, this article unfairly stereotypes an entire community as resentful towards us, which is the last thing we wanted to do, especially concerning the stereotypes that we have encountered as a black man and white woman who are romantically involved with one another.
As students, we fear that this misrepresentation will silence our peers in speaking out about their experiences, due to fear of being portrayed in an unfair manner. As a university committed to diversity and inclusion, we should be running more articles like this, facilitating discussion about what many students do not publicly talk about. But in order to do this, we must provide the whole story, not just isolated bits and pieces, especially considering the centuries of pain associated with race relations in this country.

One Harvard sophomore is apparently having trouble juggling all-important final club initiations with other commitments. The anonymous student, who self-identifies as “a sophomore punching a Harvard final club,” has posted an ad on Craigslist soliciting a “secretary” to “deal with all my administrative work.”
“Anything from responding to basic emails, picking up dry cleaning, confirming appointments and turning in homework could be asked,” the ad requests. Reasonable, you might suggest: Wearing a yellow sweatshirt all week surely renders you unable to collect your laundry.
And this overwhelmed neophyte isn’t requesting help for nothing. Compensation, according to the ad, will be by hourly wage, provided that you submit your resume, any other “relevant material,” and sign a non-disclosure agreement “in order to maintain privacy.”
We wonder why this sophomore would want to keep this cry for help private. We’ve seen bolder calls on Craigslist, after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Classical music has a long, outstanding, and institutionalized history at Harvard. The Pierian Society, now known as the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, was founded in 1808 and is the oldest musical organization in continuous existence in the United States. John Knowles Paine, a seminal composer in the American classical scene and a renowned organist, set much of the current Music Department’s core curriculum while teaching there as America’s first music professor. Today at Harvard, we have four full orchestras, performance-based classes, a society for pianists, and countless opportunities for aspiring musicians to show off their art.
But what of punk, rock, or soul? Hip-hop, R&B, or funk? Where is the place for other types of music at Harvard? Where is the legacy of folk legend Pete Seeger ’40? Why is the influence of figures like Rivers Cuomo ’06 of Weezer fame today lacking while his housemate Yo-Yo Ma ’76 teaches masterclasses to future generations of Harvard classical musicians?
Because of classical music’s long-standing history of assimilation within the academic structure at Harvard, small groups of classical musicians have networks of support and paths to performance. The Music Department offers academic courses for ensembles, as well as opportunities to perform. However, according to members in non-classical bands, no similar systems for musicians in other genres seem to exist: while the department does not focus as much on other genre music, as Harvard is not a music conservatory, the possibilities of performing are slim. Without the department or the school’s help, the musicians struggle to secure funding, performances, and perhaps most importantly, stability.


CLASSIC ROUTE
Chamber music groups are often more informal than full orchestras such as the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra or the Bach Society and have therefore historically not been included as much in the educational structure of the Music Department. Recently, however, the department has been offering chamber groups opportunities to perform both on campus and for credit, unlike non-classical music groups.
“[Classical] music performance as a graded class was a big breakthrough about six years ago,” says Federico Cortese, who served as the director of chamber music for the department until this past year. “Originally, there was a chamber music program designed for HRO members. This was then expanded for everyone and became a graded class in chamber music performance.”
As Professor Robert Levin, who taught the chamber music class, retired this past year, the Music Department brought in as Blodgett quartet-in-residence the Parker Quartet, a renowned chamber music group, to lead the class, now labeled Music 189: “Chamber Music Performance.”
However, since Harvard’s Music Department focuses on classical music, curricular opportunities for those outside the classical are hard to come by. Ben G. Blumstein ’15  has personal experience with this disparity as one half of the duo band entitled “Bared Grillz,” which draws its name from the TV personality and adventurer Bear Grylls. “[Bard’s] music department has music production classes and things like that that a part of myself coming to Harvard wished was here.” Blumstein originally wanted to concentrate in music, but upon arrival, [he] was disappointed in its offerings for students outside the sphere of classical music. “There isn’t a spot in the Music Department here for me to make the kind of music I want to make,” Blumstein adds.




NOT NOW, NOT EVER?
For non-classical bands, the lack of departmental support seems to translates into lack of resources. Office for the Arts Director Jack Megan states that interactions between small independent student music groups and the OFA are minimal at best, noting that most interactions are centered around logistics such as practice spaces or spare amplifiers, with hardly any direct funding going out to the groups. Both Bared Grillz and another band, the Cantab Cowboys, however, have applied for Artistic Development Fellowship grants, and both have been rejected.
However, Megan says that just being aware of bands and student musical groups on campus that exist outside of the current institutional infrastructure is a hard task. A general issue with the prevalence of bands on campus, Megan says, is the problem of continuity. He notes that unfortunately, while non-classical groups often form and try to stay active, they inexplicably fade away. He stresses lack of continuity due to the nature of band structure as a large problem. That is, the members who are a part of the music group graduate after four years, oftentimes necessitating the end of that band’s legacy at Harvard. A larger community or overarching structure that could connect bands or musicians could potentially ameliorate issues of lack of support from other areas at Harvard. “The pattern I’ve seen in terms of the lifespan of these organizations [rock bands] is that they come and go,” Megan says. “I think the other pattern one sees is that periodically students come along who try and found umbrella organizations to foster a community in the pop rock student world.”
Megan points to an application for OFA funding on his desk. The cover page is entitled The Harvard College School of Rock, in the spirit of previous organizations such as the Harvard Rock and Roll Alliance. “Every so often, a student comes along and says, ‘There is really no home for pop and rock here. We can’t book rooms, we can’t get grants, we don’t have the equipment we need, and we have no way of networking and finding each other.’ And every so often a student group will be formed to try and address that problem,” Megan says.
And this lack of OFA resources leads to lack of exposure for certain music groups. Ethan I. Simon ’16  of the Intrinsics, a Harvard student soul band describes the difficulty that student bands face in securing opportunities to perform on campus. “There’s no scene at Harvard at all. There’s support for live music, but for a band our size, there are certain economic mandates that require a scene that’s more expansive to support a 10-person group playing around,” Simon says. “We’ve made it a policy not to play for free, which is pretty rare among college bands. That makes it really hard to continue playing around Harvard.”


BEYOND NOTATION
However, some groups have managed to find a way to resolve the issue of continuity. The Nostalgics and The Intrinsics, though unrelated in their music and most of their group composition—a notable exception being saxophonist Rachel Horn ’14, who was both one of the last members of The Nostalgics still at Harvard and a founding member of The Intrinsics—shared a fund formed by The Nostalgics to promote the existence of bands at Harvard.
Along with Alex Cherenfant Jr. ’13 and Charles G. Gertler ’13, former Crimson Arts editor Benjamin Nadaff-Hafrey ’13 founded The Nostalgics as a soul group in his freshman year at Harvard. “In part, the idea was that there was no real common social space on campus, and so often parties would happen in final clubs or in people’s dorm rooms,” Nadaff-Hafrey recalls. “We thought that if we could create a band that would be basically a mobile social space, or wherever there would be a Nostalgics party people could gather and dance to good music, we could form something that would be a good contribution to the campus.”
The Nostalgics thought of the continuity issue as well, and they began charging money for their gigs for an endowment for a future soul band. Upon graduation, the money was left with Horn, who then went on to found The Intrinsics. As student bands do not easily get funding from the OFA, this fund was a boon for The Intrinsics.
Though The Intrinsics are also a soul band, Simon comments that the two are very distinct. “Our connection to The Nostalgics is actually pretty minimal,” Simon says. “We basically took some of their leftover funds and their OSL student group status and made the Intrinsics. But except for [Horn], we are an entirely new band.”


CREATING A NEW TONE
Yet perhaps the Houses are transcending the issue of support for non-classical music groups in their own way. The Houses themselves have started to change the interactions and support that student music groups of all genre receive. In Cabot House, Alan M. Toda-Ambaras ’13, one of the organizers of the Quad Chamber Players, is extending the support and availability of performance opportunities to all types of musicians with the advent of the Thursday night community dinners this semester. Every Thursday, Toda-Ambaras sets up a performance of live music, regardless of genre, by a musician in Cabot. Similar programs showcasing House  music exist elsewhere as well, such as in Lowell, where students have the opportunity to perform once a month. Toda-Ambaras believes that bringing music into the dinners helps to add to the sense of House community. He says, “The big theme for our program is inclusivity, and showing how music can serve as a participatory means by which to really form community on the one hand and represent it.”
Meanwhile, programs such as Chamber Music at Mather House and the Quad Chamber Players enable groups to be under a sort of systemization, recruiting interested musicians around the community to form ensembles. The groups perform in concerts and foster a supportive community for small independent classical music groups.
Toda-Ambaras feels that House-run and extracurricular programs like these are fundamental for promoting music in the local communities. “The program seeks to insert itself into the life of the quad community not only through independent recitals but also by showcasing the student ensembles at quad dinners, Masters' open houses…venues that already operate as focal points for the community,” Toda-Ambaras explains. “Contextualizing the music this way, we think, allows for the performances to have the most meaningful impact.”


PLAYING IT FORWARD
For some, a way forward with music is very set, very clear, and very easy to access. For many others, though, especially those in the tradition of Harvard rockers such as  Tom Morello ’86 of Rage Against the Machine or Bonnie Raitt ’70, establishing a successful independent band is still an uphill battle. “Pop rock was always exciting because it seemed to break all the rules culturally and couldn’t be neatly packaged or fit into anything, which fits into Harvard,” Megan says. Despite the correlation, however, non-classical bands still find it difficult to establish a system of support at Harvard. This lack of a neat packaging makes it difficult for bands to keep their continuity or to establish academic or extracurricular venues for support and success.
But despite the difficulty, many students are still finding their ways to perform. It is to the spirit of folk and rock that these students appeal: recreating the band’s legacy in iterations but maintaining a strong, active, vibrant core—a culture created by filling in the spaces around the establishment, always on the edge.
