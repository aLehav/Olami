After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fanelesibonge S. Mashwama ’17 and Bo Seo ’17 overtook hundreds of opponents to win the 2016 World Universities Debating Championship Sunday, becoming the second Harvard team to clinch the title in three years.
Hosted in Thessaloniki, Greece from Dec. 27- Jan. 4, the 36th world debate championships featured students from more than 250 institutions. Mashwama and Seo’s victory marks the third time a Harvard team has ever won the international competition according to debate coach Joshua P. Zoffer ’14, and comes just two years after Ben D. Sprung-Keyser ’15 and Zoffer won the title in 2014. Harvard sent three pairs of debaters to the tournament.
Mashwama described the sensation of winning as “an odd mix of relief, exhaustion, and excitement.”
“You’re asking your body to do a lot, like concentrat[e], think very fast, b[e] anxious between decisions, so I think we just collapsed,” Mashwama said. “It is physically exacting.”
The tournament followed a British parliamentary style format and competitors received debate topics 15 minutes in advance of each round. In the final round of this year’s championship, Seo and Mashwama  argued that “the global poor would be justified in pursuing a Marxist revolution” Seo said.
“I do political theory at school, Fanele is a philosopher, and so we at least knew what the big central ideas were,” Seo said. “But we certainly hadn’t prepped for the poor having a Marxist revolution as a topic.”
As sophomores at the College last year, Mashwama and Seo were finalists in the same competition, an experience that Seo said helped them in this year’s debate. Sarah M. C. Balakrishnan, a Harvard graduate student and one of the team’s coaches, said making it to the finals last year gave Mashwama and Seo an advantage over the other debaters.
“When it came to the end and one team had to shine before the judges, Bo and Fanele had a sense for what went wrong last year, and conversely, what to do this year,” Balakrishnan said.
Fellow debater and president of the Harvard College Debating Union Dhruva Bhat ’17 also competed in the tournament, and said that the debating union was “with them every step of the way, cheering them on.”
Seo also attributed his and Mashwama’s success to the pair’s diversity. Seo and Mashwama are both international students, Seo from Australia and Mashwama from Swaziland.
Zoffer, who won the 34th World Universities Debating Championship with teammate Sprung-Keyser and is a team coach, said Mashwama and Seo form a powerful debating duo.
“They complement each other as debate partners” Zoffer said. “They work incredibly well together...it’s no surprise that they won the World Championship.”
Mashwama and Seo met through debate before even attending Harvard. They first came to know each other in South Africa during high school at an international debate competition.
“I met Bo in Cape Town originally where the 2012 World Schools Championships were...and then in 2013, we met in the finals in Turkey,” Mashwama said. “He was representing Australia, I was representing Swaziland. He ended like first on the tab, I ended second on the tab...so that’s where we met,” Mashwama added, referring to the debate’s ranking system for preliminary rounds.
Mashwama said that he decided to come to Harvard in part because of the College’s debate team; there he decided to form a pair with Seo. Balakrishnan said Seo’s and Mashwama’s debating strategies complement each other well.
“Bo is a really eloquent and probing speaker who is great at excavating big ideas; Fanele, on the other hand, is best at attacking the opposing side's claims and exploring in detail the arguments on the table. Their chemistry is truly amazing, and I've never seen them not on the same page,” Balakrishanan said.
“We’ll be close friends for the rest of our lives,” Mashwama said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Trial by fire. Dropped in the deep end. Thrown to the wolves. Pick your adage to describe Harvard men’s volleyball’s start to the 2016 season, as the Crimson faced off with last year’s national runner-up, No. 8 Lewis (2-0), in its season opener at the Outrigger Resorts Invitational in Honolulu.
Harvard (0-1) fell 3-2 to the Flyers, winning the second and third sets, which were bookended by losses in the first, fourth, and fifth frames. After the winning the third set, 25-23, to push Lewis to the brink, the Crimson suffered 25-14 and 15-8 losses in the final two sets, respectively.
“A few people described it as a roller-coaster game,” said senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman, who recorded 12 kills, four digs, and three total blocks. “I’d say that’s pretty accurate. But it was our first game of the season, and I thought it definitely looked like our first match of the season with the ups and downs, but... we’re happy with the way we played.”
Harvard, ranked No. 22 in last season’s final RPI poll, was in for a tough test after losing star outside hitter DJ White ’15 and middle blocker Caleb Zimmick ’15 to graduation. In their absence, captain Branden Clemens and Schlossman are expected to pick up the slack, which they did on Thursday night to mixed results.
“I’d probably give myself a B, to be honest,” Clemens said. “I think I started slow and didn’t end the game very well, but I was really happy with play in sets two and three. I definitely think there is always room for improvement, and I definitely want to do a lot better.”
The duo combined for 26 kills, 83 total attacks, and 17 digs, but also 27 total errors.
“We’re going to look to those guys a lot,”  coach Brian Baise said. “Branden is our captain, has been on the court for us for four years. We kept setting them the ball at the end, so we’re going to need that all season from them. I think they’re ready for that and want that.”
After falling behind, Lewis got into a rhythm in the fourth set. The Flyers went on a few mini-runs that recaptured any momentum lost in the middle two sets, taking advantage of the Crimson’s sloppy play. After playing confidently on offense and recording 35 kills to 14 errors in the first three sets, Harvard committed 17 errors with only 10 kills over the final two.
While it was the first match of the season for the Crimson,  Lewis had already shaken off its first game nerves with a victory over UC Santa Barbara to open the year. The Flyers are once again favorites to challenge for the national title this season.
“We were passing really well in the first three games,” Schlossman said. “And then the last two, we let them go on a few serving rounds, our passing wasn’t as crisp, our offense was really predictable... they were able to get blockers out early on the hitters.”
Scott, who played varsity football in the fall as a punter, came in right away and started all five sets for Harvard. Despite missing numerous practices during the preseason because of his football obligations, the 6’4” Illinois native enjoyed a promising start to his collegiate career, recording three blocks.
“Spencer was ready. He is as composed a freshman as I’ve seen,” Baise said. “It’s a tough environment to come into, he blocked really well. He made some great defensive plays for us even though he was under quite a bit of pressure.”
