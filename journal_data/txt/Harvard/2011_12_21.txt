After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University will open the gates to Harvard Yard to the public on Thursday, nearly six weeks after it limited entrance to people with Harvard IDs because of security concerns connected to the encampment of the Occupy Harvard movement.
The decision, which follows Occupy Harvard protesters’ decision last week to remove their tents, will allow the general public to access the Yard between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
Harvard affiliates first erected tents in front of the John Harvard statue in early November to show support for the Occupy movement that swept the nation this fall. Even with the tents gone, former campers say they will continue to work to forward the message of the protest. Further, a weatherized geodesic dome—initially erected as part of the movement’s occupation—will remain in the Yard.
In an email circulated to members of the Occupy Harvard movement, the University stated that it would continue to evaluate its regulations regarding Yard access as the situation evolves, outlining a number of conditions that Occupy Harvard protests would be required to meet.
The email banned erecting new tents and sleeping overnight in the remaining dome or allowing individuals not affiliated with Harvard to utilize it. The University has also told Occupy protesters to ask the City of Cambridge to inspect its remaining tents to ensure that they meet safety codes.
Although it has not taken steps to expel Occupy Harvard’s presence in the Yard, the University expressed its desire that the group move elsewhere.
“It is the University’s strong preference that Occupy Harvard dismantles the remaining tents and pursues its educational and outreach objectives through established mechanisms afforded other student and staff groups on campus,” Lars P. K. Madsen, special assistant to University President Drew G. Faust, wrote in the email. “The University would be happy to help facilitate access to space for these activities.”
Madsden also reminded protesters of the University’s recent announcement that it would evaluate its investment in the controversial company HEI Hotels and Resorts—an investment which Occupy Harvard members have demanded that Harvard pledge to cease.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In  light of a Yale University investigation over the accuracy of football  coach Tom Williams’ resume, the three-year Bulldog coach resigned  Wednesday, finishing his career at the school with a 16-14 record.
 
In  the weeks leading up the The Game—which for the fifth-straight year,  Harvard won, 45-7—Yale quarterback Patrick Witt garnered national  attention for having to decide between a final interview for the Rhodes  Scholarship and playing in the annual Harvard-Yale contest. As the  storyline unfolded, Williams remarked that he faced a similar dilemma in  having to choose between his own final interview for the Rhodes and NFL  tryouts on the same day.
 
After  the Rhodes committee noted that it had no record of Williams’  application for the prestigious scholarship, Yale University launched an  investigation into the claims of its head coach.
 
“On  the Rhodes Scholarship issue, I was encouraged to apply by the Stanford  Fellowship office, which identified me 'as the kind of student who  demonstrates the intellect, energy and commitment that the Rhodes  selection committees seek in their applicants,'” Williams said in a  statement. “I considered the opportunity, sought advice and was  encouraged to apply by faculty members and my coach Bill Walsh, but I  did not apply.”
 
In  his Yale University bio, Williams was listed as a member of the 1993  San Francisco 49ers practice squad, a claim which he also said was  untrue in a Wednesday statement. 
 
In his final season at the helm, Williams led the Bulldogs to a 5-5 record. He never won a game against Harvard.
 
With Williams’ resignation effective Dec. 31, Yale promised to promptly begin its search for a new head coach.
 
Williams  is the second Ivy coach to leave his post this offseason after Columbia  fired its head coach, Norries Wilson. In Wilson’s six-year tenure, the  historically lackluster Lions went 17-43, and their 1-9 mark in 2011  prompted Wilson’s dismissal. On Dec. 11, Columbia introduced Pete  Mangurian, a former offensive line coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,  as Wilson’s replacement.
 
Williams—the  first African-American coach in the program’s history—and Wilson had  been the only two African-American football coaches in the conference.
 
NEW ENGLAND COACH OF THE YEAR
 
The  day wasn’t all bad for Ivy League football coaches. Early this morning,  Harvard coach Tim Murphy was named the New England Coach of the Year  after leading the Crimson to a 9-1 record and its first Ivy League title  since 2008.
 
It  was a historic football season for Harvard and for Murphy. As a team,  the Crimson set a modern-era record for points scored in a season and,  for the first time in program history, clinched the Ancient Eight title  outright with a week to go in the year.
 
And  after a victory against Columbia, Murphy passed the late Joe Restic,  Murphy’s predocessor, as the all-time wins leader in Harvard football  history.
 
Since  the end of the season, Murphy’s name has a emerged as a possible  candidate to replace former Penn State head coach Joe Paterno, though  Murphy denies any contact with the university. The Nittany Lions have  yet to announce who will replace the legendary former head coach, though  a decision is expected soon.
