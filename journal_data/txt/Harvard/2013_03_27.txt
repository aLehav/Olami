“Spring  Breakers” is not a camp classic. It hasn’t billed itself as such, but a  quick glance at the credits will convince anyone that it is. The film  stars two Disney Channel mainstays, one “Pretty Little Liars” alumna, a  dreadlocked James Franco, and the perpetually incarcerated rapper Gucci  Mane. Its soundtrack features Ellie Goulding, Waka Flocka Flame, and  Skrillex (who composed original music for the film). Its director,  Harmony Korine, is known for such semi-classics as “Trash Humpers.” But  still, “Spring Breakers” is not a camp classic; it’s not a masterpiece  either, but it’s far closer to the latter. Korine’s sharp eye and  focused direction has transformed the admittedly kitschy material into a  dark, affecting, and thoroughly enjoyable piece of filmmaking,  bolstered by strong performances from unlikely sources.
 
The  plot is slight: three girls (Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Rachel  Korine) hold up a fast-food restaurant to pay for their spring break.  Joined by the more straight-laced Faith (Selena Gomez), the four make  their way down to St. Petersburg, Florida, where a drug raid lands the  four of them in jail. All is not lost, however: the enigmatic rapper  Alien (James Franco) bails them out, drawing them into his bizarre and  threatening circle. Though the film offers little in the way of complex  plot twists, the setup does provide a variety of places where Korine can  show off his visual acumen. And though “Spring Breakers” evinces a  decidedly less schizophrenic approach to film stock than his earlier  work—his 1997 debut “Gummo” featured footage shot on VHS, Polaroid, and  35mm, 16mm, and 8mm film—Korine has lost none of his power to create  haunting and beguiling images. Indeed, his choice to restrict the hazy  video effects to a number of drug-addled scenes only proves how sharp  his eye truly is. “Spring Breakers” is filled with images that feel  instantly iconic, such as a simple and stunning shot of a bloodstained  finger plinking at a single piano key. 
 
What’s  more, the images Korine creates are also exceptionally communicative.  The stifling atmosphere of college life is established with just one  shot: a lecture hall full of students poised in front of their glowing  laptop screens, which change simultaneously as the professor drones on.  The film’s uneasy marriage of nihilism and kitsch is summed up with a  shot of a candy-pink pier stretching into a seemingly infinite darkness.  Most striking, of course, is the opening montage of spring break  debauchery. Set to Skrillex’s “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites,” the  sun-drenched antics quickly become discomfiting. By the time the viewer  watches beer violently collide with a pair of undulating breasts, Korine  has successfully introduced brutality to the “Girls Gone Wild” ethos—or  perhaps he’s just exposed it. Crucially, “Spring Breakers” neither  glamorizes nor moralizes. Instead, it simply refuses to hide the fact  that violence, often of a sexual nature, hovers over every frame of this  film. Eventually, each character must accept that fact and what it  might imply, and the reactions of the four heroines form the grim heart  of the film.
The  performances are, on the whole, entirely convincing and powerful.  Again, the credit for this must go to Korine; he’s clearly aware of his  actors’ respective strengths, and the film’s elliptical style means he  can deploy them so we only see the actors at their best.
Gucci  Mane, for instance, is required to be little more than an avatar of  destruction, but his deadened stare and mush-mouthed drawl allow him to  pull it off well. Franco impresses the most, however; at various times,  Alien is required to be charismatic, tender, vengeful, and hyperactive,  and Franco delivers on all counts.
 
In  the end, of course, this is Korine’s show—it is he who took these  admittedly kitschy elements and sculpted a film filled with dread and  fear, a film that dares you to forget that Gucci Mane tried to change  his name to Guwop or that Vanessa Hudgens dated Zac Efron. Somehow  Korine knew that Vanessa Hudgens was capable of erupting with shocking  violence, that there was a darkness in Skrillex’s whizzing synths, and  that James Franco is the only American actor talented and brave enough  to play a character as challenging and mystifying as Alien. These  flashes of insight are in themselves a coup, but what they enable is  even more impressive: they have allowed “Spring Breakers” to become one  of the most powerful films of the year.

On a hazy afternoon last summer, I sat listening to John Coltrane with a friend in Brooklyn. This friend, who is a drummer, and I had gotten together to play some duets and before we played he put on a 1958 Coltrane record called “Soultrane.” Aside from being a very swinging record, the album is significant because in its liner notes, the critic Ira Gitler coined the term “sheets of sound.” The phrase is tossed around here and there in jazz history classes, but in practical terms it refers to Coltrane’s rapid-fire sequences of notes, which cascaded in groups of regularly ascending or descending tones.
You can hear this approach on any number of late ‘50s and early ‘60s Coltrane (e.g.,“Blue Train,” “Stardust,” “Giant Steps”), but my friend wasn’t as interested in the “sheets of sound” as he was in Trane’s rhythmic precision. As Coltrane played run after run on the loping medium-tempo track “Good Bait,” my friend mantrically repeated, “He’s playing what he means. He’s playing what he means!”
Jazz improvisations, by their spontaneous nature, have no intrinsic textual antecedent—that is, if you want to take a look at the notes and rhythms a musician performed on a given night, you can’t ask for a score as you might after an orchestra concert; instead, you usually have to do the work of transcribing, or slowly notating the pitches and rhythms, the recording. On “Good Bait,” you’ll notice how many of these “sheets of sound” rarely fit neatly into the metrical subdivisions usually suggested by Western music notation. In his book on the recordings of the Miles Davis quintet '65-68 studio recordings, Keith Waters aphorizes, “Discrete equal-tempered pitches temporally placed along a time line of equally spaced beats create convenient fictions or half-truths.”
Although this is generally acknowledged, a more important issue, I think, is how we consider whether it matters if Coltrane intentionally played with such a micro-rhythmically expressive relationship to the time, the rhythmic pulse. What my friend meant wasn’t only that Trane “meant it” in the emotional sense—that he was playing without a shred of superficiality—but also that Trane “meant it” in a technical sense: that these groups of notes might lay 4.5, 5, 5.5, or any microdivision of notes against each beat rather than in a neat 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 note-to-beat ratio.
If you believe Coltrane meant every rhythm and pitch that he played in a technical sense, then he’d be the undisputed master of the music with regards to control: a supreme technician expressive to the microlevels of rhythm and pitch. This is a pretty scary thought. Although it might not seem plausible, it’s certainly a helpful thought experiment because it requires you to confront the role of intentionality in art.
On the topic of intention, there’s one fascinating little detail among the thousands of other fascinating little details in James Joyce’s “Ulysses” that comes to mind. Near the end of the novel, a character is locked out of his home at 7 Eccles Street in Dublin and decides to climb over the railings. He lowers “his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement” and then lets himself down. Joyce could have easily made up the height of the railing, but we know from his letters that he taken the trouble to write his aunt Josephine in Dublin to ask precisely whether one could climb over the railings of the real 7 Eccles Street, then lower oneself until “within 2 or 3 feet of the ground and drop unhurt.” It would seem, in this case, that Joyce really meant what he wrote with regards to the facticity of this minute episode. But this still doesn’t answer the question of what it means that he meant it, or what he himself might have meant by it.
If we believe that Coltrane really did mean, in a technical sense, all that he played on “Good Bait,” there would be no counterargument for those who criticized Coltrane for “chaotic playing” (Philip Larkin, the lauded poet, was one of these detractors. He wrote in a review: “After Coltrane, of course, all was chaos, hatred and absurdity”). As a saxophonist, though, I’d prefer not to believe that Trane was consciously considering the microexpressive gestures and stylistic decisions that mark his style. This is partially because believing so would set an impossibly high mark, but primarily because, although there are attested anecdotes of the conscious preparation Coltrane undertook (writing substitute chord changes on lead sheets before recording sessions, for instance), intention doesn’t dictate how I appreciate and learn from his music.
Just as there are some connections to be made in Joyce that seem intentional while others might not, I think it makes sense to approach recordings in a similar way. How much do we really care that Joyce intended the detail of 7 Eccles Street to map onto reality? Not all microscopically precise details might be intentional in a performance, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t aspire to cultivate the kind of disposition and flexibility to create art with such subtle and, sometime initially unapparent and unintended, beauty.

SimCity is in a State of Emergency.
Three weeks ago, everything looked to be perfectly in place for Electronic Arts’ first major installment in the series since 2003’s SimCity 4. The marketing was massive and, if the number of pre-sales and digital downloads was any indicator, working. Critical reception, too, was mainly positive, praising the game for maintaining its predecessors’ strengths while adding features to appeal to both seasoned virtual planners and first-time digital mayors. There was only one potential spanner in the works: in the interest of combating online piracy, EA built SimCity to be “always online,” or permanently connected to the company’s servers.
Thus fell the first domino.
In the usual first-day rush that accompanies a major release, the servers crashed under an enormous influx of players, who suddenly found themselves unable to access the game for which they had waited so patiently (not to mention paid $60 for). This wasn’t itself surprising; the freeway always slows to a crawl at rush hour. What was surprising was how crowded the road remained well into the sleepy hours of the night: as errors persisted, it became clear that EA was fatally under-equipped for the game’s day-to-day server demands, so much so that Amazon stopped selling the game altogether due to customer complaints.
Things only get worse from here. As of this writing, EA is taking a self-destructive route to “solving” the problem: they’re adding servers, but they’re also sloughing off features to streamline the game’s server demand. Critics haven’t taken to this too kindly; gaming website Polygon.com, for instance, retroactively dropped the game’s score from a stellar 9.5/10 to an abysmal 4/10. Players aren’t happy, either, to the tune of mass demands for refunds; but when so much of a game’s content is digital downloads, the program is hard to return, and EA isn’t honoring customers’ requests. Perhaps most damning is that EA has pulled the game’s marketing campaign—the problems are so bad that the company is actively trying to slow down the game’s sales. And to top it all off, CEO John Riccitiello has announced that he will be resigning at the end of the month. Unless SimCity pulls out of this nosedive soon (and that doesn’t seem very likely), it looks like SimCity might be going the way of Atlantis.
What’s most interesting about the implosion is that it was entirely avoidable: EA’s “always online” feature was not only self-imposed but part of an active attempt by major game companies to make the anti-piracy measure a new standard for computer games. The first big-name game to do so was Blizzard’s Diablo III last May. The launch came with similar system overloads, spawning the infamous message, “The servers are busy at this time. Please try again later (error 37).” But in a critical difference, Blizzard easily weathered the onslaught—and therein lies the rub.
If the “always online” model is the next big thing in games, as major companies are pushing for it to be, this could be one of the first major developments in gaming history to favor independent developers over big-budget studios. For EA and its ilk, massive production costs make each new release a “go big or go home” proposition; but if they don’t build huge amounts of online infrastructure, and fast, we could be seeing a lot more big games go up in flames like SimCity has. Small studios, on the other hand, simply never have to account for a server-crashing frontloading of players. And for those that do grow to rival their big-budget counterparts—Riot Games’ League of Legends comes to mind—they do so by building slowly, developing the hardware to accommodate millions of players over time rather than all at once.
To a certain extent, that’s how Blizzard was able to survive Diablo III’s opening day onslaught. Though the company was already well established before its iconic online game World of Warcraft was released in 2004, the fan base still grew incrementally, peaking at 12 million players in October 2010—a full six years after its release. Over more than a decade, Blizzard has established itself as the gold standard in online computer games with flagship series like Diablo and StarCraft, the latest expansion for which landed without any major hitches on March 12. Where EA tried to hit the ground running and tripped out of the starting gate, Blizzard’s somewhat softer start gave it the opportunity to bulk up over time.
Though I won’t pretend to understand all of the nuances of the situation, this news certainly gave me cause for speculation. Unless major studios find a way to stop shooting themselves in the feet, the advent of “always online” gaming could be a watershed moment for small-scale developers. Of course, as EA is learning the hard way, success is never certain; but the way the chips are currently falling, we could soon see a major shift beginning in the video game industry.

In her poem “Questions of Travel,” Elizabeth Bishop asks, “What childishness is it that while there’s a breath of life / in our bodies, we are determined to rush / to see the sun the other way around?” I boarded a plane to South America last Thursday with Bishop’s poem in my canvas bag. My journey to Brazil is the latest of several cross-continental undertakings that have led me, in less than three years, to Jerusalem and Glasgow and Venice and Krakow and Budapest and New York and Berlin and São Paulo. I’m graduating in two months, still looking for a job, and utterly unconvinced that globetrotting is the answer to my most pressing questions. But I can’t stop traveling.
Perhaps my excursions into the global wilderness spring from the childishness that Bishop identifies in her poem. Bishop, a true citizen of the world, asks questions of travel that reflect years of exploration. She grew up in Nova Scotia, spent half her childhood in Boston, graduated from Vassar and traveled Europe while living in New York, moved to Key West, relocated to Brazil for 14 years, and then taught at Harvard upon returning to the States. She stayed in places long enough for wonder to pass, doubt to emerge, and wisdom to triumph.
As I travel through Brazil this week, Bishop’s voice accompanies my thoughts. I visit Iguassú Falls and remember the line she wrote about waterfalls, calling them “those streaks, those mile-long, shiny, tearstains.” The Brazilians I hear chattering in Portuguese at the beach become her “strangers in a play / in this strangest of theatres.” In Ibirapuera Park, the banyans pose at sunset, and I think of her description of trees “gesturing / like noble pantomimists, robed in pink.” All along, her questions pulse through me like a heartbeat: “Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?” “Where should we be today?” “What childishness is it…to rush to see the sun the other way around?”
Bishop’s poem arrives at a simple answer. We travel because “surely it would [be] a pity not to.” It would be a pity, Bishop writes, not to hear the “music of the fat brown bird” and not to ponder the “whittled fantasies of wooden cages.” The value in the sights, sounds, and thoughts of the traveler’s experience outweighs the value of staying at home and imagining. Marveling over Brazil’s atemoya fruits and surprising black swans, I agree with this conclusion.
But I think there is a truer answer—an answer that comes not directly from Bishop, but from the traveler who appears as a character in her poem’s last stanzas. Bishop’s traveler opens her notebook to pen the final permutation of the poem’s question: “Should we have stayed at home / wherever that may be?” Wherever that may be. Wherever “home” may be. Home, it turns out, is as uncertain as the traveler’s next destination. Perhaps the childishness, lack of imagination, and dream-chasing that Bishop links to travel is better understood as the effort to seek the familiar in the exotic, to find a home in the foreign—to become, against all conventions, a resident of the entire world.
As I ask myself what I want to do next year and where I want to be, I know that my choice of home has broadened beyond Cambridge, New England, the United States, and North America. Home can be reading on the grass by Berlin’s Museum Insel, navigating the sixteen side streets leading to the best roasted duck in Venice, or ordering carrot-coriander soup at Budapest’s newest bookstore. I like to think that it’s not childishness so much as embrace of vigor that compels my journeying. If there is something vitally human about “rushing to / see the sun the other way around,” then I want to possess that quality. And so, to answer the question of Bishop’s traveler before I close my own notebook: No. No, we should not have stayed at home, wherever that may be.

When HBO announced last week that  it would not renew “Enlightened” for a third season, television viewers everywhere wondered: What is “Enlightened”? The show had a small fan base, to the say the least, but we true devotees aren’t quite ready to say goodbye. So, in the tradition of “Arrested Development” fans of past, I’d like to throw one final plea in the ring: Please bring back “Enlightened” and let more people see the quiet show that achieved some of television’s greatest feats.
On the surface, “Enlightened” is about Amy Jellicoe, a corporate employee trying to take down her morally corrupt company from within. But as Todd VanDerWerff at The A.V. Club notes, one of the show’s biggest issues—one that most likely cost it potential viewers—is that it’s nearly impossible to describe. I spoke with someone recently who’d seen every episode and still told me she couldn’t quite figure out the show: “What’s its mission statement?” It’s a valid question. “Enlightened” will regularly dictate a moral philosophy in an introductory voiceover and completely challenge it by episode’s end. If anything, the series is about the limits inherent in offering a single point of view. Its mission is to not come down on one clear side of anything.
“Enlightened” achieves this first through its protagonist, Amy, who desperately wants to enact change for moral “good.” Played by series co-creator Laura Dern, Amy is a familiar type. She’s the person who talks about “taking down the man” without irony, the one who’ll throw herself in service of a social issue she learned about on the evening news. Her violent will often leaves her blind to social cues, and the series is rife with cringe-worthy moments. But while  intense, Amy is a relatable character. Her pursuit is just a heightened version of a Capital-B Big question we’re all trying to figure out: How does one live an ethical life?
In real life, it’s hard to know, and we often make missteps in the smaller aims we set in service of this big one. Co-creator Mike White—who plays Tyler (Amy’s coworker) on the show and wrote every episode—masterfully captures this reality in slow-simmering episodes that erupt in singular, charged moments. In the first stretch of season one, viewers sympathetically follow Amy’s headstrong pursuit to create a women’s group at her company, Abbadon. In the fifth episode, Amy’s ex-assistant Krista, who has struggled with the effects of her boss’s oblivious idealism, invites Amy to her baby shower. Amy stands up to give a speech, and in a moment that would traditionally call for attention toward Krista, instead makes her plea for the women to join her civil service group. Here, the show effectively shifts the way we view Amy’s goal:  As she gives her speech, we’re not on the edge of our seats, rooting for our protagonist to prevail in convincing the women. Instead, we’re suddenly wondering if she should be trying to convince them in the first place. In the fallout that follows, we feel for both Amy and Krista. Amy meant well, but failed in execution. Krista has reason to be upset, but her lashing out goes too far. The beauty of “Enlightened” is that it doesn’t come down on either side.
These expansions of perspective are, more than any of its plot developments, what “Enlightened” is about. They don’t happen every few episodes. They happen multiple times in every single one. The effect is an empathetic lens on realistic situations—one that we often lack while living through their real-life counterparts.
The show’s title is “Enlightened,” but its characters are people who can’t see past their very narrow points of view. The real enlightened ones are its audience members, who gain a nuanced understanding of human relationships by watching White’s fictional ones play out on screen. Let’s join our friends in the Twitterverse and urge another content producer to pick up the show. If we speak loud enough, maybe Netflix will see the light.

“I like to think my birth parents believed that this lake would hold me, keep me safe, but I don’t see how that could possibly be true, for it turns out I come from a long line of people swallowed by these waters,” says the protagonist, Alice, in Abi Maxwell’s debut novel. Despite its clichéd premise of the search for love—in this case found in the backwoods of the New Hampshire Lakes region—“Lake People” promises to be so much more at its start. In the first chapters, the novel alludes to stories of families broken and united, of intermingled lives and unwritten histories, all centered around the mystical power of the titular lake. Yet perhaps such a mission was too much for Maxwell: rather than coming off as an interwoven work that threads together the lives of generations of Lake People through one girl’s search for love and her past, it reads as disjointed to the point of losing its intrigue and leaving the prose puzzling rather than compelling.
Set in rural New England over the span of six generations, “Lake People” examines abandoned child Alice’s life on the lake as she searches for a love she can never seem to find. Structurally, the split sections of past, present, and future vary enormously in coherency. Maxwell does a wonderful job in setting up Alice’s “Lake People”  past that begins with her Swedish great-great-grandmother, Eleanora. Maxwell beautifully weaves the tale of Eleanora’s time on the island in the middle of the lake—as well as the stories of Eleanora’s children and grandchildren—in a surreal, almost Beowulf-esque mythical style that presents not only the inexplicable draw and power of the lake over the lives of Eleanora and her descendants but also the chain of effects in Eleanora’s line that will—the reader hopes—play out in Alice’s life.
In the progression to part two, “History became legend. Legend became myth. And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost,” to appropriately quote J. R. R. Tolkien. In a similar manner, Maxwell fails to fulfill the expectations that she promised in part one. The lake is almost completely forgotten at this point. The stories presented in part one that seemed relevant turn out to have been small interludes in a family history that seems to be going nowhere fast. The heart-wrenching anecdote of Signe—Alice’s great-great aunt who could never come out to herself as gay, let alone to her family, and was lost in the lake—remains only an anecdote with hardly any relevance to the work as a whole. Instead, Maxwell turns to the topic of class struggle, as Alice is the illegitimate child of Eleanora’s line and the Hills, the ultimate underclass of New England society. When Alice finally meets her grandmother Sophie, Alice does not focus on the titular Lake People; rather, she reflects on her other, poorer line of ancestry: “Hill hands… the same long, straight thumbs, too, and the same blunt nails that will never be shaped into something delicate and beautiful, as Sophie’s are.”
The rapid changes in point of view and temporal setting in parts two and three are also too confusing to appreciate their craft. The action begins with the funeral of Signe and transitions to Sophie and Alice’s lives. Signe leaves the property on Eleanora’s island for Alice, Signe’s only real tie back to the lake that was so prevalent in the opening of the book. The changes in narration from limited omniscient to first person vary chapter by chapter, are not consistent in any means, and function to further obscure the progress of the novel rather than to elucidate points, connections and the characters’ feelings. Whereas such a strategy works in “The Yellow Birds” by Kevin Powers, as the fractured nature of the narrative reflects the fracturing effect of war, here it only seems to obfuscate Maxwell’s original goals.
The lake’s lack of influence, though, is the most striking disappointment following the promise of the novel’s beginning. After its powerful description at the beginning of the novel, in which it takes the lives of Eleanora’s children yet is also strangely loved by her and the other inhabitants of the island, the latter portions of the book are largely devoid of any such active and strong descriptions of the lake and its influences.
However, Maxwell partially redeems the book in the end, when Alice finally undergoes some type of catharsis in the lake. While Maxwell used more active imagery of Ida, Eleanora’s daughter, suddenly sinking into the lake—only to be replaced by a series of rock formations and a bear, killed by the lake’s rocks, on the exact spot of Ida’s death—Alice’s baptism is quiet, short, and not fully described. The reader knows all Alice knows, and with sufficient mysticism Alice tells us later, “I do not know what became of me in that water.” However, in the end, Alice’s life returns to the idyll represented by Eleanora in the beginning—not in the lap of luxury, to be sure, but calm and happy. Alice is finally united with the man who fills the void she’s felt through the whole novel. In this, Maxwell manages to somehow salvage the fraying threads of the middle of the book and tie them into an ending somewhat consistent with the promises made in the beginning.
Though Maxwell does manage to convince both the reader and Alice of the power in the lake, the loss of compelling storyline and coherency as the book progress disappoint in a debut novel with so much potential. Simply, it does not have a forward push, a driving factor to take it from its mystical beginnings to its realistic end. The death of Signe and her siblings certainly pull the heartstrings, but it is hard to empathize with Alice as she muddles her way through her life in the middle in an emotionless and confusing manner. The opening is beautiful, promising, and the ending is synthesized wonderfully. But the void that is the middle lacks a reason to even put in the effort of wading through.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Finality is a difficult concept to grasp when you’re young. Every piece of time felt like an eternity, and “forever” was a word tossed around like a plaything.  And at the same time, everyone was changing so quickly, spreading out and growing up—which meant that no matter how tight our hands could hold, things ended and we had to keep on growing.
For a long time, I didn’t understand the title of Iron & Wine’s  “Our Endless Numbered Days.” I dismissed it as a pretty string of words and moved into the album itself. I was greeted by Sam Beam’s lovely, but troubled vignettes. Again, I didn’t understand the truth of the album right away. The songs were pretty, beautiful even, and that was enough. I wrote the line, “She says if I leave before you darling / Don’t you waste me in the ground,” in my notebooks without really comprehending what Beam was saying.
I found this album when I was falling in love.  I learned “Love and Some Verses” and I sang it for another, and I meant it. I understood this song before I understood the rest, and when I sang, “Love and some verses you hear / Say what you can say / Love to say this in your ear / I’ll love you that way,” I imagined that every waver in my voice was matching one of Sam Beam’s own. Beam’s most powerful lines are often his most gentle, with heavy ideas tied to light imagery. I was 15, but when I sang, “Love is a dress that you made long / To hide your knees,” and ended the song with “May I be weaved in your hair?” I felt truly shaken. Beam often associates love with simplicity and youth, and I found in those sunlit lyrics a shape for my own feelings.
Most of the songs on “Our Endless Numbered Days” are not so pure in their descriptions of love, however. Much of the album centers around a narrator’s struggle to reconcile continuing feelings of love with a disappearance. It would take some experience with endings before I could see that. I rediscovered this album when I was crashing out of love. I would revisit “Naked as We Came” and find the other half of the line I loved so much, “I lay smiling like our sleeping children”—“one of us will die inside these arms.”  I began to see that what this album accomplishes so beautifully is a portrait of love and death as inseparable partners. It does not set up death or endings as barriers to love; rather it uses them as backdrops. Sam Beam ends the song by singing, “One will spread our ashes round the yard”—the lovers in the song speak of death in light of love, and the peace with which they discuss so final an end illuminates the fullness of their devotion.
The second half of the album is breathtaking, both musically and lyrically, to the point that it is easy to miss the melancholy between the notes. Heartrending lyrics rest lightly upon Beam’s delicate and dazzling finger-picked rhythms, and for a long while, I let their beauty obscure their meaning. “Radio War” is an angelic song about a war widow’s grief, and there is pain in every word when Beam whispers, “And the beast, never seen / Licks its red talons clean / Sara curses the cold / ‘No more snow, no more snow, no more snow.’” Directly following this song is “Each Coming Night,” in which the narrator is asking his lover what he or she will say after he has passed. Beam sings, “Will you say to them when I’m gone / ‘I loved your son for his sturdy arms / We both learned to cradle then live without.’” Again and again, Beam uses death as a relief in order to show the depths of love. He paints lovers in moments of grief and contemplation, separated by death but still much bound by love. As I listened, I started to feel more and more at peace with endings as a piece of a complete story—a piece as important as any other.
Sam Beam’s quiet depictions of romantic love are powerful in their reserve. He sings passionately about love colored by rain and by bougainvillea blooms, saying everything that needs to be said with honesty, without an ounce of melodrama. In the grippingly tender “Fever Dream,” he sings, “Some days, like rain on the doorstep / she’ll cover me with grace in all she offers.” His romances are not painted in bold strokes of scarlet adjectives, but rather shaded with careful imagery, and this makes every rise and fall of his narratives feel as real as his voice murmuring in your ear. Every tale that he slowly spins, then unravels stings fresher for its simplicity, its genuineness. In “Sodom, South Georgia,” when Beam murmurs the lines, “Papa died smiling / Wide as the ring of a bell / Gone all star white / Small as a wish in a well,” he whispers because he has no need to shout.
Growing up felt like a series of endings that I was never quite ready for. I would leave one school for another, I would leave some friends for others, or I would leave one identity for another. I remember when I finally understood what the phrase “Our Endless Numbered Days” meant. I had reached the last song of the album, “Passing Afternoon,” in which Beam carries us through four seasons of a romance, deftly weaving in many of the ideas he establishes throughout the record. I thought of each song, each with its own romance and its own bittersweet ending, and I thought of all the ends I had felt, one after the other. I thought of how many goodbyes I had had, and how many of those had actually been good. I thought of how many I must have already forgotten and how many there were to come. I thought about growing up and growing apart from the people I knew. I thought that I finally understood what Beam was trying to tell me: that there are things that drift away, like our endless numbered days.

Hey Marseilles, a seven-piece band from Seattle, write catchy folk tunes that fall somewhere between Noah & The Whale’s sunny stomp and Arcade Fire’s big-band bombast.  On top of it all is frontman Matt Bishop’s boy-next-door tenor. Since their album release tour is soon bringing them to Boston, The Crimson spoke with Bishop about HM’s new album, “Lines We Trace,” as well as the joys and challenges of working with a large ensemble.
The Harvard Crimson: How do you feel Seattle itself influenced your sound?
Matt Bishop: I think we benefitted a lot from being in Seattle because the Seattle music community is really strong. It’s pretty diverse—obviously alternative rock has a history there, and most recently it’s been folk, with Fleet Foxes, and the Head and the Heart, et cetera. In Seattle, there are people who’ll support you no matter what kind of music you’re interested in. [Debut album] “To Travels and Trunks” concerns itself with moving around, whereas “Lines We Trace” is very much about staying in the same place.
THC: What changed personally for you that led you to look at things this way?
MB: When I was writing the lyrics to “Travels,” I was a bit younger, and interested in the idea of going somewhere else. And then the years just passed. It’s a lot easier to try and find community and joy and the definition of home where you’re at, as opposed to always looking elsewhere. So I think that’s reflected in the lyrics of “Lines.”
THC: You mentioned that the sound has matured a lot—it’s a little bit less celebratory, but a little bit more controlled. How did you guys come into this sound?
MB: [On “Travels,”] were learning how to write music together. The first record was, as I mentioned earlier, songs that I might bring to the table or that other guys might bring to the table. This record was very much about learning how to write a song collaboratively, and how to create a record collaboratively. That kind of intentionality and focus resulted in that kind of restraint that you referenced—being really aware of how every note is being played at a certain moment in a song, not necessarily letting it get beyond our control or beyond what we want it to be.
THC: What are the challenges of arranging for a huge, seven-piece ensemble?
MB: The primary challenge is a multitude of opinions—as it is with any large organization. That can be challenging, but when you finally come to a decision, it’s a lot easier to feel good that you’ve made the right decision.
THC: So what are the challenges, if any, of being around each other all the time?
MB: I think it’s comparable to hanging out with anybody you spend a lot of time with. When I was a kid, I used to travel across the country to visit family—and I had a big family—so I just compare it to that. You know the personalities of each individual and you know when to give them space. It’s a really healthy relationship, by and large.

She is a designer for the Harvard Advocate, the art director of the Harvard Lampoon (a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine), and one of The Crimson’s 15 Seniors You Should Meet Before You Graduate—and she just hosted her own solo art show at the Harvard Monday Gallery on March 11. Kayla A. Escobedo ’12-’13 incorporated part of her thesis for her concentration in visual and environmental studies into a show entitled “KaylaTV,” which featured a series of three-second GIFs of one of her cartoon characters acted out by a person wearing a larger-than-life mask. "KaylaTV" is the third show as well as the first solo exhibition in the Harvard Monday Gallery, which Escobedo founded with Danny R. Bredar ’14, Avery A. Leonard ’14-’15 , Meryl F. Natow ’13, and Oliver Luo ’13 last spring.
Escobedo made all of the aspects of the video from scratch and modeled the main character after an old cartoon character of hers. The clips were then projected onto a series of textured surfaces placed around the room, from an armchair to plexiglass to a TV.
After having worked with the same character in comics, Escobedo was drawn to the idea of looped, animated clips to express herself. “I became interested in GIFs after I began thinking about a series of 3D comic cubes I had made. These cubes were meant to be read in the round and had a loop to the narrative, so you could walk around in any direction and there could be meaning or disjointed narrative gleaned from the experience at any point," Escobedo says. Her inspiration was clear in the show, as the viewer could walk around and view the GIFs in their projected orientation—from looking at the video projected onto the textured surfaces—and then sit in the armchair and observe a GIF's mirror image reflected in the plexiglass. "This idea of my character being stuck in a loop was then transformed into the character being glitched in technology, which was when the GIF came about as the perfect form to facilitate the evolution of these ideas,” Escobedo says.
Though the show represents a large part of her thesis, Escobedo cites different groups of artists as inspirations for "KaylaTV" and for her thesis. For "KaylaTV" in particular, she was influenced by artists such as  Vito Acconci and Tony Oursler, she says. Her thesis, however, was partly inspired by a somewhat different source. “I also watch a lot of daytime television, which directly influences my ideas,” Escobedo says.
The two projects differ not simply in their inspirations, however: "KaylaTV" is affected by its mode of presentation. “The show was more of an exploration of a specific group of pieces from that project, responding to the gallery space. While the work in the show is a part of my thesis, I saw the show itself as taking on a more independent form more closely related to the expansion of ideas and experimentation within the Harvard Monday Gallery,” Escobedo says.
As a graduating senior, Escobedo plans to take time off before graduate school, moving back to her home state of Texas to continue her art there in her own studio. However, she does plan on investigating the art scene on the West Coast as well, perhaps interning in a museum or working as an artist assistant. “Plans tend to change, but I’m hoping to go to graduate school after a few years of doing my own thing,” Escobedo says.

Ewan H. Foster ’15 will step onto the stage at the World Irish Dancing Championships this year for the fifth time in his dancing career. The Leeds native has been dancing competitively for 10 years and somehow still finds time to be a full-time Harvard student. On Saturday he’ll be on the stage in Boston, ready to wow thousands with his love of Irish dance.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you first become involved with Irish dance?
Ewan H. Foster: My little sister, she always did dancing. Because my mom’s Irish I think she just forced her into it, and because we didn’t have much of a family around I would get dragged along and I’d have to watch and stuff. And then one night the dancing teacher’s mother got drunk, and she was a real strong Irish lady and apparently—I can’t remember this, but she wouldn’t let me leave until I said I’d come and try out…. So I tried out.
THC: What do you look forward to most about this upcoming competition?
EHF: I don’t know, really. I guess it’s just fun to do it. You don’t really think about it. It just feels special. It just feels like something else when you can just dance and everybody’s watching. You’ve got a couple thousand people watching you, and it’s just great. It’s like I get to show them what I can do.
THC: How do you find time to compete and excel in Irish dance while dealing with the Harvard workload?
EHF: I struggle with that one. It’s really hard. As my dad always says, it’s all about spinning the plates. There will be weeks at a time when I can’t go to training because I’ve got midterms and exams and things, and there are times I’ve had to reschedule exams and miss classes and I’ll just go practice. I think you just have to kind of commit yourself to both at the same time. It’s hard because dancing is in Norwood, so it’s about an hour away, so the journey time adds a lot to it. I don’t know—I think you just have to love them both enough that you’ll make it work.
THC: Do you have any other hobbies outside of dance?
EHF: I volunteer at the Cambridge fire station, so that’s something. And I’m hoping after the Worlds to start doing boxing quite seriously, so that will be something to pass the time. Not too much really. I guess I just hang out with my mates.
THC: What is your favorite memory from years of Irish dancing?
EHF: That’s a hard one. I guess when I won the regionals for the first time. This [was] in England, I was fifteen or sixteen, and I went from last [place the first time I went] to the second year [winning] first. I felt good doing that. It was great. You come off the stage, and the crowd is still smiling. I like that feeling.

 An upside-down white tree, suspended from the ceiling at the opening of the Boston Ballet's latest show "All Kylián," set the stage for an innovative and striking performance. The show was performed at the Boston Opera House from March 7-17.
  "All Kylián," which was named after its choreographer, Jiří Kylián, featured three dances that blended traditional and contemporary choreography and incorporated breathtaking sculptural set pieces. Like the floating tree, the dances themselves were avant-garde and eccentric, innovative and different. The show’s staging, choreography, and timing produced a wealth of stimuli on which the audience could focus, while masterfully highlighting key moments. This quality contributed to the show’s innovative and immersive feel.
 “Wings of Wax,” the show’s opening number, provided multiple points of interest to latch onto, but included a central focal point at all times. In this case, it was the tree that anchored the audience's attention. The curtains opened on the suspended tree that seemed to float in the middle of the stage. A searchlight on a dolly rotated around the tree and illuminated it from above as the dancers performed below. While the tree was unexpected and the light never stopped moving, neither detracted from the choreography. As the dancing picked up, the light slowed; and over time, the tree the background and filled the open ceiling space.
 
 Bradley Schlagheck, the soloist in the dance “Wings of Wax,” contributed to the piece’s eccentric and innovative feel through his unique and striking dancing. Before Schlagheck entered, the smooth classical music cut abruptly to a repetitive and minimalist Philip Glass soundtrack, and the corps of female dancers on stage froze mid-motion. As each dissonant and disjointed tone sounded, the dancers contorted their bodies every so slightly. They continued to move in slow motion as Schlagheck entered and danced between them, the frozen women dancers functioned as a nearly motionless corps de ballet. Throughout this portion of the performance, Schlagheck partnered with each of the female dancers, and as he approached them, they came to life, danced for a brief lift or turn then reverted back to their slow-moving state. This section of choreography successfully blurred the lines of a solo and a larger company piece. Thus the women, like the tree, served to fill the stage and offer compelling focal points without drawing the audience’s attention from the soloist’s beautiful dancing.
 The second piece, “Tar and Feathers,” followed with similarly arresting set sculptures, including a 10-foot-tall piano and an interiorly lit coffin made of bubble wrap. The piece’s choreography and music worked in a complementary yet contrasting fashion to create a nightmarish experience. The piece paired dissonant music with aggressively sharp turns and body isolations, and matched classical Mozart compositions with fluid partnering and dance moves.
 As the music cycled through these two extremes, a deafening lion's roar was overlaid, punctuating the choreography. This heightened the oddly harmonious yet cacophonous effect produced by the piece.
 Other sound effects contributed to the dance’s unnerving feel. Contemporary pianist Tomoko Mukaiyama played live on stage at the piano. Throughout her musical interludes, she banged the keys and dragged her fingernails across the strings. The dancers also popped bubble wrap to contribute to the unconventional and jarring motif. At the dance’s climax, an old man’s haunting voice over overtook the music, and Whitney Jensen, the final soloist, danced in a frantic manner as if trapped in his dying nightmare. As she twisted her body in attempts to escape, she danced towards the lit coffin and stepped on the bubble wrap. The music slowly waned to silence, and the stage faded to black as she stepped slowly offstage on a pathway of bubble wrap. Through the silence, all that could be heard was the jarring and unsettling sound of popping.
 While the first two pieces pushed the limits of the audiences’ perception, the final piece, “Symphony of Psalms,” followed suit but offered little new innovation. While the choreography was beautifully constructed, the dance did not feature engaging set pieces or dissonant music to follow the themes in the prior pieces.
 The male company section was especially spectacular when performing in canon. Each dancer got a brief chance to showcase his powerful sous de chat—a dynamic leap in which the dancers separate their legs in midair—in succession. The duet section was similarly constructed as every couple took turns performing unique duets that all revolved around the shared theme of embrace with a repeated flexed foot phrase. 
  However, after such innovative and spectacular choreography and set designs, “Symphony of Psalms,” the program’s most traditional piece, came across as tame and somewhat stilted. Furthermore, its lack of comparatively avant-garde set and music design highlighted the importance of these structural components in the collective program. Overall, “All Kylián” provides a host of captivating choreography, set pieces, and sounds, and it masterfully balances these by highlighting key stimuli to create an entirely immersive and engaging dance experience for its audience.

 For someone lost in pitch darkness, a flicker of light can make a huge difference. Wednesday at CGIS South, the Andes Initiative at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies is organizing an opening reception of a photography exhibition with the artist Santiago Escobar Jaramillo, a Colombian photographer who uses this metaphor of light and darkness to represent in his photographs the hope of a better future for the Colombian people.
 For the past five decades, many Colombians have suffered from violence and forced displacement due to political turmoil and a power struggle within the country. The artist says he lost his uncle-in-law as a child. This personal history inspired him to launch an art project in support of the people of Colombia.
 Founded in 2010 by Escobar Jaramillo, Tierra de Luz is a project whose name means “land of light” in Spanish. The artist was inspired while travelling across the country for Villegas Editores, a Colombian magazine. “I could see not only the [Colombians’] sadness but also their spirit, their hope, and beautiful landscape,” Escobar Jaramillo says. This drove him to organize a symbolic show of support for his people through the medium of photography. “Light does not only give evidence to how space is constructed or how things look,” Escobar Jaramillo says. “Light is also a powerful metaphor of hope, family, heat, about protecting each other. Light it is there to fill up our souls, dreams, and happiness with a bright future.”
 As an architect-turned-photographer, he thought photography could be a powerful tool in the project. “Being a photographer gave me new perspectives on how we could change [things],” Escobar Jaramillo says. According to him, photography serves as a direct witness to reality. At the same time, it also has the capacity to present a solution. In one of the series, for example, Escobar Jaramillo installs light in empty post-displacement villages to symbolize repair and healing.
 “To give support to victims—it is not only to give them a house or write down laws,” Escobar Jaramillo says. “But we also have to think about symbolic acts—metaphor, art, culture, education as means of expressions to get to the heart of the victims, to heal wounds.”

Pieces to be performed March 28-30 at 8 p.m.
Choreographing new dance pieces is important both as a means of dance education and a way of furthering the conversation about what dance is and can be. The Harvard Dance Program achieves these goals through classes for Harvard students.
 
 This weekend, student dancers who were chosen through auditions will perform three original pieces at the Dance Program Spring Performance. Two of these are commissioned works by guest choreographers Pontus Lidberg and Andrea Miller. These works are the most recent of 11 new works the Dance Program has commissioned over the last two years. A third piece was created by Jill Johnson, Senior Lectuer on Music and Director of Dance, in collaboration with the students in her class “Master Work: The Choreographic Process of William Forsythe.” 
 “It’s a different process for students to learn about dance through making their own work and having work made for them, as opposed to doing repertory pieces,” Johnson says. “It’s a different kind of engagement in dance making and understanding.” Inviting guest artists to choreograph works [with] Harvard students gives [the students] this experience and exposes them to the differing approaches of players in the today’s dance world.
 The piece from Johnson’s class, called “Dog in a Sweater,” was created by close examination of the entire choreographic process, from conception to performance, of one work by acclaimed choreographer William Forsythe. It took under consideration the ideas and tenets of that process. “Each year [the class] renders a different piece. This year we’re really focusing on the development of themes and what themes can look like,” Johnson says.
 Johnson has worked previously with both Lindberg and Miller. Lindberg is both a choreographer and a dance filmmaker, which according to Johnson is a rare combination. “What he brings as a dancer to filmmaking is a really wonderful perspective that I was very interested in exposing students to,” she says. Miller was once herself a student of Johnson’s. “I really like her [artistic] voice as well and wanted to expose students to these two diverse voices in the field,” Johnson says.
 According to Johnson, the intention of the performance is for the audience to be struck by key moments that resonate with them in unexpected ways. “Dance isn’t necessarily about understanding one version of what’s presented; there isn’t only one story. You can come to the theater and have it be a break from our hyper-digitized work day and see what it looks like when the body is thinking,” Johnson says. “Dance is about articulating things for which there are no words.”

As Bob Dylan iconically declared, the times, they are a-changin’—and so are our mediums of expressing discontent. Dylan is today not only recognized for his distinct, throaty melodies, but also for his protest songs, which gave a voice and a persona to protest movements across 1960s America. While his songs are still repurposed for a variety of contemporary social ills, Dylan’s music is only one form of protest art that has captivated and mobilized activism throughout American history.
“The way that I define protest art is some form of art, literature, or music that offers some kind of critique of something wrong in the culture, something troubling to the artist or writer, and often that seeks explicitly or implicitly to offer a solution,” says Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a program director at Harvard’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. McCarthy recently co-taught a General Education class on American protest literature with English and African and African American Studies Professor John Stauffer. What differentiates protest art from art that simply makes a statement, he says, is a certain element of political intentionality.
That intentionality results in what Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas calls “finger-pointing songs.” Thomas taught a freshman seminar focusing on the literary and cultural impacts of Bob Dylan’s music, and he believes that one of the key features in a successful work of protest art is its ability to connect emotionally with the masses. “A protest song appeals to the group mentality....which is working towards something that it’s obviously crying out against,” Thomas says, “Some either real or perceived injustice.” This connection, he says, allows the viewer or listener to link the artist with the message being shared.
The very nature of protest art, which is meant to influence or effect change in society in some manner, lends itself to changes in form as well. With the expansion of social media, mediums of modern protest art have changed greatly in appearance and function from older art forms such as protest literature. Protest art has evolved not only in the mediums used but also in the manner of production, shifting from the work of renowned artists to a mass-driven instrument of change that has flourished in the digital age.
 
PREACHING TO A DIFFERENT CHOIR
 
While it may not be recognizable at first glance, American protest art has existed since the foundation of the colonies. “If you go back to the Puritans, some of the Puritan sermons that were preached in the early 17th century have a Jeremiah tradition,” McCarthy says. “These were meant to be sermons that both critiqued the things that were wrong in society.…but also [were] a kind of celebration of the possibility of society living up to its heavenly ideals and aspirations.” Limited literacy meant that these protests were predominantly oral, and were thus able to reach a wide audience within the community.
Beginning in the mid-18th century with the growing availability of printed materials and a higher literacy rate, however, the oral tradition of protest art shifted to a focus on literary publication, such as the works of Thomas Paine and Walt Whitman. Of particular note is the case of Upton Sinclair, McCarthy says, adding that Sinclair is a perfect example of the sometimes unintentional impacts of misinterpreted protest art. Sinclair’s “The Jungle” was originally meant to incite conversions to socialism by raising awareness of the working man’s plight. However, instead of focusing on the main character’s struggles, as Sinclair intended, readers were more interested in the repulsive conditions within the slaughterhouse, which led to expanded regulation of the meat and drug industry. Sinclair famously said of his book’s reception, “I aimed at the public’s heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach.”
Despite the rapidly growing literacy rate, literature as a form of protest art was and is limited in its impact. “I tend to think that the genres that have the most impact are those that are readily accessible and impactful to the broadest possible public,” McCarthy says. “Whether or not you interpreted it in the way it was meant to be interpreted is another question.
“Songs, sermons, speeches and visual art of all kinds, particularly visual art that is available to a broad public—not visual art that is rarefied and placed on display in a museum and costs you $25 to enter—those forms are the most impactful,” he adds.
 
PEOPLE’S ART
 
 Part of the process of making art available to a wider public is the democratization of the art-making process itself. One group working towards that end is the Guerrilla Girls. Since their first protest of the Museum of Modern Art in 1985, these women have been donning gorilla masks and protesting the absence of female artists in many museums across the country. Their 2012 protest against Boston’s own Museum of Fine Arts is a prime example of publicly displayed art outside the walls of an institution. Instead of making a series of paintings about sexism in the art industry, the group posted a billboard in front of the entrance reading, “Do women have to be naked to get into Boston museums?” and displaying a nude figure reclining while wearing a gorilla mask.
  Democratization of American protest art may link back to the development of a “people’s art” in the 1930s. “In the 1930s there was a movement to make a ‘people’s art’....This was also at a time when the ideas of [philosopher] John Dewey were very popular,” Patricia Hills, an art history professor at Boston University, says. “His conception of art is that art should be for the people, it should relate to the people, and that everyone should learn how to be an artist and develop their own creativity through the arts.” 
American society continued to influence the way art was created throughout the rest of the 20th century. To combat unemployment during the Great Depression, President Roosevelt implemented the Federal Arts Project, designed to pay artists for their work in visual art, music, theater, and writing. Although the Federal Arts Project was eventually abandoned after the Depression ended, and many artists were being condemned during the concurrent Red Scare, American artists continued to create protest art. “In the 1950s there were certain artists who protested the Cold War,” says Hills, who is also currently a fellow at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research. “Many artists just became abstract artists, because if you were an abstract artist, no one could see what your subject matter was.”
  Following the end of the Federal Arts Project, there seems to have been a distinctive shift in art forms away from traditional methods such as painting and writing. This shift may have been the result of the rapid development and dispersion of new technology, such as personal cameras, which allowed anyone to create art in a shorter amount of time. “I would say that a lot of the artists today are photographers and filmmakers. You have documentary filmmakers, and you see very strong, powerful statements against the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,” Hills says. “There is also a certain amount of performance art, of street art. You don’t see a lot of oil paintings that have to do with protest [anymore], but you do see some.”
  The rise of photography as a form of protest art has been crucial in expanding the genre to the wider public. “There was an enormous amount of great photojournalism that was taken and published during the busing crisis in Boston, which of course was an extension of the larger civil rights movement and black freedom struggle,” McCarthy says. “There was one photo in particular of a guy named Teddy Landsmark, who was an African-American who was literally stabbed with an American flag through his stomach. It’s a terribly grotesque but also deeply moving picture.”
Part of the growing weight of photography and filmmaking in modern protest art is a product of new technology that has created channels of mass distribution more than changes in the methods or subjects of protest. “So much of the art and protest that we see is emerging in our contemporary movement right now is happening through social media, where images are produced and disseminated and consumed through Instagram and on Facebook, and printed text is part of that too,” McCarthy says. Today, in an era where nearly every phone comes equipped with a camera, almost anyone who witnesses an event he finds troubling can make his own form of protest art at the touch of a button. If his image achieves the balance of emotional connection and aesthetic appeal, the image may go viral—all with very little effort from the artist himself.
  The immediacy of social networking in conjunction with art raises serious questions for the value and impact of the art itself. “It’s probably made it sort of too easy—in a way too generic, less convincing,” Thomas says. “It depends on the context.” McCarthy poses the same question as Thomas about the impact of social media on protest art, but his outlook is more hopeful. 
“I think that it’s hard to predict because every generation creates its own form of protest art for its own protests, for its own political realities,” he says.  “I hope that your generation produces its own sort of outstanding protest art.... Based on historical precedent, I predict that your generation will produce these things.” 
 
ART OR ACTION?
 
One of the major values of expanded social media is its ability to quickly unify and organize large and diverse groups. This impact has spilled over into protest art, notes Carrie Lambert-Beatty, professor of History of Art and Architecture and of Visual and Environmental Studies. “I would say [social media] is crucial in mobilizing groups of people,” she says, but adds that she feels the term “protest art” in itself is misleading in the modern context. Lambert-Beatty suggests that modern protest movements, such as the Occupy movement, focus more on creating alternatives to problems than on explicitly pointing out social ills. “It’s not really so clear that protest is the most useful term, because then the question is, ‘Protest what?’” she says. “The motives for social unrest and critical expression of this time takes the forms like modeling an alternative community, which is pretty different than writing a song that tries to change your mind about something.”
One of the key examples Lambert-Beatty notes is the Yes Men, a group of activists started by Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos. Most notably, the Yes Men conned their way onto BBC news in 2004, impersonating representatives from Dow Chemical Corporation. During the BBC interview, the Yes Men claimed that Dow intended to liquidate Union Carbide, which had caused a major chemical disaster, to use the profits to reimburse victims’ medical care. This form of media intervention, says Lambert-Beatty, falls inside the growing realm of staged activism that is developing as a form of protest art in itself. “There seems [to be] a lot of effort now to develop constructive practices rather than protest. [These practices] imply a model of trying to stop something, and that’s a pretty palpable shift,” she says. “An expanded model of performance is really important to thinking about what protest art can look like now.” The expanded model Lambert-Beatty discusses suggests that modern protest art is as much about action as it is about the art itself. “The idea of intervention is something that came up in the early 2000s as an important crossing point for the idea of performance and activism,” she says.
This does not mean, however, that the old forms of protest art are dead. According to Thomas, Bob Dylan songs such as “Masters of War” remain popular because they are timeless. “[Protest music] evolves so it’s appealing to the music of the moment aesthetically, and its message therefore is being helped by that medium, which is a medium that changes,” he says. While the traditional forms retain their impact, the very act of recreating and re-appropriating these songs and images to renew their relevance suggests a continued responsiveness of art to the people. Dylan’s songs, after all, were still being covered during the recent Occupy protests across the country. In some ways, the very act of changing the art may even be a protest in and of itself—a protest of historical stagnation in artistic meaning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Statistically, one billion women who are alive today will experience physical or sexual violence. This shocking figure catalyzed the creation of One Billion Rising, an organization that endeavors to revive global sisterhood and demands that the outrage of women and men alike be heard.  One of the cornerstones of the movement is V-Day events, events conceived of by One Billion Rising that are carried out by various groups around the country and that range from dances to walkouts. The events aim to increase awareness and raise money for causes benefiting victims of violence toward women. On March 14, the Girls’ Education Initiative, a feminist group associated with the Graduate School of Education, elected to host a V-Day event in Longfellow Hall. The event consisted of readings of monologues from “A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant, and A Prayer,” an anthology of stories and other writings that concern violence against women. The anthology was edited by Eve Ensler, the writer of “The Vagina Monologues,” which is a well-known series of monologues that address the feminine experience.
The group actually considered performing the “The Vagina Monologues,” but ultimately decided that “Memory” was a better choice. “It’s fresh,” says LaJoi Royston, a student at GSE who performed the monologue “In Memory of Imette.” This was particularly important as the Master of Ceremonies, GSE student Erin Murphy, indicated that the experience was not intended to be comfortable. The first three monologues dealt with particularly disconcerting material—gang rape, murder, and the condemnation of young girls to brothels—and were delivered by actors who became visibly upset during their performances.
Though none of the first three monologues were delivered by men, “Untitled,” which concerned a Cambodian brothel, was written by journalist Nicholas D. Kristof. The action of men, as it turned out, was actually a pivotal component of the night. The performance bridged the gender divide through the use of three male actors in addition to the eight female ones. “I was really honored in particular [by] the three men who chose to join us as well, and it was really special to me to have both men and women participate,” says Julia Ando, a GSE student who delivered the monologue “Club.”
One of the goals of the night was indeed independent of sex: to raise funds to aid the one billion women of the organization’s name. Ando believes that everyone has a reason to contribute to the cause. “Violence against women unfortunately is something that affects all of us,” she says. In addition to the action that One Billion Rising hopes to incite, Harvard’s V-Day event took donations to the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.
The positive effect that assistance can have on victims also became a central part of the evening. “I was compelled by [my character’s] hopeful recollection of a story of…a bad day that became a better day as time went on and as somebody intervened,” Ando says. This hopeful attitude was underscored by the event’s media crossover: a short video piece featuring women rebelling from violent and oppressive events, such as female circumcision and domestic abuse. The event culminated in the actors, no longer in character, sharing why this movement was of personal significance and everyone, audience and actors alike, standing, holding up One Billions Rising’s symbol—a single finger pointing up.
People involved in the production this year were optimistic about V-Day events being held at Harvard annually. “I that this show will be done in future years at Harvard, and I hope that it will be a way for us to all come together and do some positive things as a result,” Ando says.

Playwright  Lorraine Hansberry spent her childhood watching her father fight an  expensive and exhausting legal battle in order to allow their family to  move into a neighborhood that was at the time closed off to  African-Americans. Hansberry’s experiences would inspire her most famous  play, “A Raisin in the Sun,” which is now playing at the Boston  University Theater through April 7. Set against the background of  postwar Chicago, “A Raisin in the Sun” centers around a family whose  dreams far exceed the narrow limits of their reality. Directed by Liesl  Tommy, Huntington Theater Company’s production is no less relevant over  50 years after the play’s publication—the  cast’s complex portrayals of their characters convey the pain and  ignominy of coming up against a system that is determined to thwart any  hope of escape.
The  Youngers are a multigenerational African-American family crammed into a  too-small apartment in Chicago. But a check in the mail provides the  promise of escape: family matriarch Lena (Kimberly Scott) plans to use  some of the money from her husband’s life insurance policy to purchase  the family a new home. To add to the complication, her son Walter (LeRoy  McClain) has dreams of opening up a liquor store, and his sister  Beneatha (Keona Welch) needs the money to get through medical school.  Walter’s wife, Ruth (Ashley Everage), captures all facets of her  character’s complex personality: she conveys Ruth’s tender, loving side  even while scolding her son and dealing with the stress of moving into  an all-white neighborhood. The Youngers hope that this move to a  prosperous neighborhood will provide them with greater happiness;  instead, they become embroiled in arguments among themselves and with  the neighborhood association.
The cast is extremely capable, and the acting is almost universally excellent—the  many relationships are rendered evocatively to create a mood of  constant tension. Welch captures Beneatha’s sense of self-entitlement at  the beginning of the play—with her family clearly strapped for cash, she indulges in one expensive hobby after another—as  well as her gradual shift away from egotism. And Scott as Lena, the  family’s anchor, rolls with the punches as they come, too distracted by  attending to the troubles of others to deal with her own pain. Each  actress’s disposition plays out most elegantly in the scene where Ruth reveals that she is pregnant—Beneatha  smiles unconvincingly but cannot conceal her selfish anger, Lena tries  desperately to smooth everything over with comforting words, and Ruth  sits in stony silence before breaking down, crushed by the fact that her  life has spun so completely out of her own control.
Though  incredibly strong overall, the acting was not without hiccups. At the  start of the play, McClain’s Walter lacks the ease that the other actors  have with their characters. He is too gruff, too quick to raise his  voice—so  much anger so soon in the play is off-putting and prevents his  character from being sympathetic. But he smooths this out later on,  tapping into Walter’s kinder side when, for example, he and Everage  dance together in the kitchen. After this scene, Walter has demonstrated  his best side, and it is all the more affecting when he acts his  meanest later on. Though his performance started off rough, McClain’s  portrayal of Walter does succeed in creating sympathy, and his rendering  of Walter’s disintegration is truly harrowing; despite his shouted affirmations of being fine, the fact that he is broken-spirited is clear. 
The chemistry between Walter and his mother Lena gives their conflict many layers. McClain  and Scott play well off each other; in one of their best scenes  together, Scott mourns the generational gap that she sees emerging  between herself and her children, lamenting, “Now you and Beneatha talk  about things we ain't never thought about. You ain't satisfied or proud  of nothing we done.” Had McClain and Welch failed to give their  characters depth, these lines would have come off as a straightforward  complaint about the failings of the new generation. But the actors’  interactions and intensity reveal a deeper meaning in the line: as angry  as Lena is, she’s also desperately afraid of being left behind.
One  of the play’s most striking directorial choices was something that,  while not called for in the script, fit into the play as perfectly as if  Hansberry had written it herself. The ghost of the father, whose life  insurance payment sparks the play’s dramatic action, soundlessly wanders  the stage throughout the scenes. Possibly the most poetic moment of the  play comes when he finds his wife surveying their empty house: tenderly  but wordlessly, he drapes her coat over her shoulders. The ghost’s  presence provides a physical tether to the past, from which the play’s  plot springs. Much of the time, he fades into the background, but at  other times, his presence adds a sense of menace and heightens the  tension in the apartment.
Throughout  the three-hour play, the cast delivers a dynamic performance that  traces the characters’ evolution and never flags in its vitality. The  skilled cast leaves the audience with a searching portrayal of the cost  exacted from those who dare to rise above their circumstances.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent times, Prof. Michael J. Sandel has come under fire for his public lecture “What Money Can’t Buy,” where he questions the claims of many economists that their discipline by itself is sufficient for addressing the moral problems involved in the market transactions of controversial items such as body parts. Sandel furthermore asks those economists to consider moral philosophy, stressing that without that discipline’s insights economics is limited and cannot provide an adequate solution to the problems of marketization. After the lecture was given, critics of Sandel, including some students of Harvard, at once protested against what they perceived to be a groundless attack on the dignity of economics, and a Crimson columnist even went so far as to suggest that Sandel’s arguments constitute a “return to the mind of a Luddite,” a reactionary phenomenon which simply is to be laughed away in the modern world.
But does Sandel consider himself a sworn enemy of economics? Far from it. The only concern that his arguments are trying to address is that in our age where increasing specialization in modern education has brought about a narrowing of the horizon of thought, economists are losing sight of the limits of their discipline as well as the necessity for communication between it and moral philosophy. Master economists in the past, who had an integral sense of the scope of their discipline within the knowledge of the whole, always warmly acknowledged that necessity. For instance, Adam Smith and David Hume held an intimate correspondence of ideas throughout their lives. It is then only from a sincere desire to restore the unity of knowledge that Sandel challenges economists to reconsider the limits of their approach.
It would not surprise me however, if a modern critic should regard the very attempt by Sandel, a humanities scholar, to challenge economics in this supremely rational and objective age, as a sign of a regress to backward irrationality, wayward subjectivity, and most lamentably of course, “the mind of a Luddite.” He would come to such a conclusion because he is convinced that the current edifice of economics as a “value-free” science has achieved an absolute progress from Sandel’s moral philosophy. But such a conviction rests on an unexamined modern prejudice, namely the prejudice for whatever is new, treating the superiority of modern economics to old-school philosophy as a self-evident fact not in need of any examination by reason. For under such a prejudice, whether an argument is right or wrong is not decided by the judgment of reason, but by how much it conforms to progressive notions which equate the new with the right, and the old with the folly of Luddite’s mind.
Yet my way of evaluating a Luddite’s mind necessarily differs from those for whom it seems buzzwords like newness and progress settle all questions, for I judge the truth of ideas solely by reason without regard for their temporal sequence. Whereas for some there is no doubt that the emergence of a value-free framework in economics away from normative moral philosophy constitutes an indubitable proof of its self-sufficient ability to solve the moral questions of the market, I would instead point to the “old” ideas of Hume and Kant who long ago revealed the problem of fact-value distinction, the idea that the fact that something ought to be done cannot be derived from what is done. According to this distinction then, as a value-free science dealing with facts, economics excludes itself from considerations of normative values, and leaves a gap which only normative philosophy can fill. Therefore any objection to Sandel that does not confront the fact-value distinction on which Sandel bases his whole argument in my judgment would fail to do justice to Sandel.
All that Prof. Sandel asks of economists is to hearken to the voice of a discipline which dates back to the days of Socrates and which is home to some of the greatest minds in the Western tradition. For some however such a request is a priori denied by the authority of empirical science. But how does the scientific principle of empiricism, which requires investigating phenomena without a priori biases, warrant such a priori denial in the name of a buzzword like progress, which is certainly an unexamined prejudice? Rather would not someone who studies the problems of the market in a truly empirical spirit soon come to realize what Crimson columnist Sarah Siskind stated so exquisitely in her recent piece, that “government is not a science,” and that the study of political things by nature depends on both the humanities and the sciences? Let us remember then to keep a spirit of humility to the wisdom of the great thinkers of the past, lest we fall for the danger that Edmund Burke warns of, that “people will not look forward to posterity who never look backward to their ancestors.” Let us acknowledge that we can still learn from our ancestors’ timeless minds, and yes, even from the mind of a Luddite.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I plan every waking hour of my day. I plan meals, exercise, work, and activities. I start assignments far in advance, and I do not do work after dinner. I categorize every activity as “need medicine for” or “able to do without.” This is the way I live my life, because I have Attention Deficit Disorder.
ADD is a disorder defined by inattentiveness, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. The condition persists into adulthood for nearly 30 percent of all children diagnosed: I am one of these.
Having ADD had never been a significant problem in my life before college. I took my medicine, went to school, played sports in the afternoon while it wore off, and occasionally took a shorter dose at night. My regimented routine worked for me. It was only after coming to Harvard that I was forced to relearn how to manage my ADD. For the first time in my life it truly felt like a disability.
I could not join my peers in Lamont for all-nighters before a paper was due. Work after dinner was a concept I was not used to or capable of doing. It required medicine, which required planning my day around it. The medicine would last four or eight hours, so I would need to squeeze my work into the bounds of that ticking time clock. It appeared that everyone else could handle everything on their plate with ease—with what seemed like much more schoolwork and commitments than my own. No one else hated being busy. No one else talked about needing downtime. No one else needed to fit new interests into the allotted eight hours of medicated concentration a day.
My solution to my new unregimented lifestyle was simply to take more medicine, so that I would be medicated every waking hour. I felt enveloped in pressure to join worthy extracurriculars, seize every exciting opportunity that came my way, and do it all with ease and a smile.
I quickly realized I could not do this.
By the end of September my freshmen year, I was involved in no clubs: all my energy was directed toward my schoolwork. I couldn’t take advantage of Harvard, meet the demands of comp processes, be social, and do well in school all at the same time. I was convinced that having ADD was making me fall behind my peers. Maybe I just wasn’t cut out for Harvard after all.
These worries—compounded with taking too high of a medication dosage—launched me into a rapid downfall. Before I knew it, I was struggling to simply make it through every day without a breakdown. Memories of my new friends, exciting academic experiences, and fun college events that comprised my first few months here are still clouded by the whirlpool of misery I found myself slowly sinking into.
When I remember my first semester here I think of nights when I would search the Square and campus for a private place to cry. I remember walking along the river and seeing Cambridge twinkle in the darkness, wondering why I couldn’t connect with my new home. I think of the time when I ended up on the steps of a church, and even the church doors were locked, and breaking down until a stranger off the street found me.
I’ll never forget the night when I was close to rock bottom, and hanging onto my phone-call with my parents for dear life because I didn’t know what to do once they hung up. The next day, my parents were in Cambridge. They had driven seven hours through the night because they knew that even after my reassurances, I was not all right.
I felt that having ADD hindered my ability to function like a normal Harvard student. I felt dysfunctional while not on the medicine, and I began to truly believe that this disability would prevent me from succeeding here. As much as I loved Harvard, I could not see myself belonging to this intense environment. Transferring schools became a real option.
I knew, at least, that something had to change. I joined the Bureau of Study Council’s ADD group. I began the process of reframing my condition—and my life—into something that could flourish at this college. In the group I felt comfortable talking about my ADD, and all of my negative (and positive!) ADD moments with students who understood.
I went on a lower dosage of my medicine, which was one of the best decisions I’ve made. I started focusing on things that were important to me—nothing more. I surrounded myself with people who supported me and did not make me anxious with their intensity. I called my parents and friends from home more often to vent, chat, and talk honestly about life. I reminded myself how well I actually was doing. I found something that worked for me, and I stuck with it.
Three years later, I continue to struggle with managing my ADD amid the unregimented lifestyle of college. I still suffer from intense depressive mood swings and feel overwhelmed by everyone else’s busy schedules. But I’ve realized that Harvard is a home we each have to create. Now, with the help of Harvard’s extensive resources, my unfaltering support system, and a House that will pforever be my home, I understand that I am a true Harvard student—all because I am different.

A sticker price on a lipstick tube or a jar of wrinkle cream encapsulates a lot: the expenses of research and development, production, staffing, marketing, and more. But it ignores one non-pecuniary outlay: the cost of animal cruelty. This month, however, the European Union took a decisive and welcome step to circumvent that loophole, in the form of a comprehensive ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics. The United States should do the same.
The recent E.U. policy move culminates a concatenation of smaller actions, from a marketing ban in 1993 on animal-tested items, to a proscription on animal testing for finished products in 2004, to a 2009 ban with some exemptions. Thanks to those efforts, cosmetic animals tested in the E.U. dropped from over 5,000 in 2005, when it was rising, to fewer than 2,000 in 2010. The current law should bring that toll to zero. In an especially potent aspect of the prohibition, imported cosmetics are held to the same standard: Their safety must be certified through alternative means, not animal testing. With the E.U.’s cosmetic industry standing at €70 billion, or $91 billion, that component should help diffuse the E.U.’s shift to humane products beyond its borders.
A ban on animal testing for cosmetics comports with a basic sense of dignity. Victimized mice and rabbits may not be the loquacious fictions of Stuart Little or Watership Down, but they do feel pain. They do suffer. Wrinkle cream and lipstick are petty alibis for assigning them torment or death. And besides, the animals’ necessity for testing has waned. While the E.U. made its decision cognizant that full alternatives to animal testing are still yet to be realized (the ban grandfathers in current products), significant strides have been made. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals lists over a thousand companies in industries with animal testing that bring their products safely to market sans animal cruelty.
Regrettably, PETA’s “Do Test” list, while shorter than its opposite, is not short enough. That illustrates the impotence of raw consumer pressure in eliminating animal-tested products, and the strength of corporate opacity in sustaining them. For companies, animal testing remains the easy path. That means government action is a needed remedy. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises “cosmetic manufacturers to employ whatever testing is appropriate and effective,” and that includes animal testing. While less draconian policy than the Chinese government’s policy, which mandates animal testing, the FDA’s sin of omission is little better. Instead, the U.S. should follow the likes of the E.U. and Israel, which implemented a ban earlier this year, in prohibiting animal testing for cosmetics. That would bring the U.S. cosmetic market to bear, alongside the E.U.’s, as a global influence against animal testing. It would also affirm a belief that we can elevate the caliber of our own humanity through virtue toward those who do not share it.

“We sound increasingly out of touch,” bemoaned a self-flagellating report released last week by the Republican National Committee, endearingly dubbed the election autopsy by the national media. Although it seeks to remedy the Republican Party’s alienating, self-destructive zeal for ideological purity and near religious commitment to obsolescence, the report proposes disappointingly few policy changes, faultily focusing on the electoral mechanics of fundraising and primaries.
The Republican Party, firmly fixed in an echo chamber where dissent is anathema, is content with blaming the messaging rather than the message.
Some within the conservative commentariat praise the report’s unsparing candor, and indeed some admissions will edge liberal schadenfreude towards euphoria. Deliciously, the report commissioned by five establishment insiders for RNC Chairman Reince Priebus begins by cautioning, “The Republican party needs to stop talking to itself.” Then comes the acceptance that it is increasingly seen by the public as the party of “stuffy old men” that is “scary, narrow minded, and out of touch.”
The few substantive policy recommendations made by the autopsy include more moderate positions on immigration and marriage equality. Both are sensible and pragmatic, however resistant the base may be. But given the deification of recalcitrance currently in vogue in Republican circles, change seems unlikely even in the face of demographic shifts. As if amnesiac, the report expunges any mention of the recent, shameful campaign of needlessly restrictive voter identification laws, and instead incredulously wonders why minority voters so lopsidedly favor the Democratic Party.
Unreflectively, the report makes no mention of the alienating hardline positions on abortion and reproductive rights when discussing the party’s disconnect with women voters.
Republicans refuse to let their soundly rejected pet philosophies die, obsessively resuscitating failed ideas like the draconian and disingenuous Ryan budget into increasingly grotesque zombies. Michelle Bachmann mindlessly preaches that the Affordable Care Act will “literally kill” vulnerable women, children, and senior citizens, while Senate Republicans have unsuccessfully attempted to repeal it thirty six times.
The Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual pilgrimage for conservatives to bask in hagiographies of Ronald Reagan, ostensibly functions to anoint future leaders of the party. So what promising upstarts with fresh new ideas were showcased at the convention? Along with the tired bromides of Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum, came the expected inane babblings of Bachmann, and yes, Donald Trump. Actually forward-thinking Republican leaders, who still retain a modicum of relevance, like Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia, were snubbed for appearing too insufficiently conservative.
Not maintaining a charade of obstinate hatred for President Obama or the other bêtes noires of the modern Republican Party is apparently enough to make a truly admirable leader persona non grata.
More disconcerting than who was not invited to CPAC was who showed up.
In keeping with the party’s fashionable obdurate groupthink, presidential hopeful and Florida Senator Marco Rubio exclaimed in his wildly applauded peroration, “We don’t need a new idea…The idea is called America. And it still works!” Meanwhile Texas Senator and Republican wunderkind Ted Cruz calmly asserted, “We’re winning right now.”
The RNC’s frantic report urging progress beyond the endless gridlock championed by Congressional Republicans seems to recognize the reality of a fast descent into mediocrity. Such a sentiment could not be found among the gleeful patrons of CPAC, more in the throes of reaffirmation than needed reformation.
Peggy Noonan, the conservative Wall Street Journal columnist and former Reagan speechwriter, rightly pointed out the stifled state of debate in the modern Republican party. She quoted Joe Scarborough, who attributes the atrophied intellectual character of the party to “conservative groupthink over 30 years that’s become more and more narrow,” as compared to the vibrant debates of the nineties.
In order to avoid crashing off the cliff of sanity and landing in an abyss of obsolescence, the Republican Party must quickly veer from its currently trajectory. Instead of hunkering in trenches and fighting the inexorable enmity of an increasingly alienated public, Republicans should critically address the substantive reasons for their recent electoral failures. Nothing short of a substantial redesign is required for its survival.
The Republicans must focus on their product rather than its packaging. The current unofficial slogan, The All-New GOP (Now With 25 Percent Less Crazy), simply will not do.

In Hemingway’s “To Have and Have Not,” the protagonist Harry Morgan, a contraband runner between the Florida Keys and Cuba, foretells the future of Key West. “What they’re trying to do,” he says, “is starve you Conchs out of here so they can burn down the shacks and put up apartments and make this a tourist town.”
“You talk like a radical,” his friend replies.
When Hemingway was writing “To Have and Have Not” in the ’30s, he was living with his second wife Phoebe in a rickety two-story with lime-green shutters, within walking distance of Sloppy Joe’s bar on Key West’s Duval Street. There was once a boxing ring behind the house, but while he was in Spain with his correspondent mistress (later wife number three), Phoebe replaced it with a massive swimming pool, the biggest on the island. She filled it with salt water because there was no freshwater available, then paid the price by scraping algae off the pool’s side every few days.
The radical may have been right. When Hemingway was in Key West the place was rough, outback-y, fishermen and sailors elbowing the stray wealthy speculator for room at the bars. Today his house is open for tourists who peer into his bed and his bookshelves (Thomas Mann and Proust and forgotten adventure novels) and kneel down to pet the 40 cats, all descendants of Snowball, the cat Hemingway’s son Jack clings to in a photo on the wall. Families with babies elbow college-aged Spring Breakers and stickered senior tour groups for room on Duval Street, the island’s main drag, and on the cramped manmade beaches, all in anxious pursuit of warmth and of fun. “Welcome to paradise,” said the concierge as he handed us our keys.
“I’ll go anywhere warm,” I’d told my mom from my dorm room in Cambridge, sleet beating the windows, wind whistling over the Charles. Left to her own devices, I should have learned by now, she would invariably plan a vacation with, one, a road trip and, two, archetypal Americana. So we rented a red Mustang in Miami and drove down to Isla Morada, where the nicest restaurant boasts a winking mermaid on its sign, and then through the strip malls and RV Resorts, over the seven-mile bridge (vertigo in the middle, when you can’t see where you’re going or where you’ve been), to the southernmost city in the continental United States.
“This is your country,” my mom told me, as she had at Illinois’ Corn Palace, at Graceland, at Mount Rushmore. This she repeated, encouragingly, as we passed the Hard Rock Café with cocktailed 20-somethings hanging off the balcony, as we walked through the dock for the nightly sunset festival where enterprising salesmen had packed the boardwalk with snacks, magicians, guitarists strumming James Taylor, and tarot card readers. The sunset itself was its own side show.
There were characters now, as there were in Hemingway’s day, though instead of rummys and smugglers they’d become drag show hosts and tour guides. How Key West evolved from wilderness to tackiness: There’s a book Hemingway never had the chance to write.

As the U.S. Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments on same-sex marriage on Tuesday, at Harvard and in the Boston area, advocates demonstrated support for marriage equality.
 In an advocacy movement initiated by the Human Rights Campaign, Facebook users across the country changed their profile pictures to red equal signs meant to indicate that same-sex marriage is equal to straight marriage. William F. Poff-Webster ’14, the Vice President of the College Democrats of Massachusetts who is also an inactive Crimson editor, was among them.
“This is one of the important changes that my generation can make to help improve society,” he said. “I wanted to show my support.”
In Boston, activists decked out in rainbow colors gathered on City Hall Plaza for a rally hosted by MassEquality, a group that fights against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
Menino greeted ralliers with an enthusiastic speech, saying that American ideals of equality demand that gay couples enjoy the same rights as straight couples.
“Supporting marriage equality has always been an easy call for me,” Menino said. “It should be an easy call for the Supreme Court today, and tomorrow.”
Christopher K. Frost ’14-’15, who is taking time off from Harvard to work as an intern at the Center for American Progress, attended the rally.
“The most important and significant part of the rally was people responding to the anti-equality rally sponsored by the National Organization for Marriage,” he said, referring to a march that took place in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. “The response to their false claims about the lesser value of same-sex relationships was both respectful and powerful.”
Both demonstrations came in response to the start of the Supreme Court cases on same-sex marriage.
Tuesday’s case is an appeal of a lower court’s decision on the constitutionality of California’s Proposition 8 which banned same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will address a case challenging the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman.
Ivel Posada ’14, one of the co-chairs of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, did not attend the rally. He chose to review the case and listen to the Supreme Court oral arguments on his own.
“I’ve been watching the gay marriage cases since I was little,” he said. “It’s always something I experienced alone.”
Posada was disappointed by the oral arguments, saying he thinks it seems like the Supreme Court will dismiss the case and rule on it very narrowly. But, like Frost, he was hopeful about Wednesday’s case and for the future of marriage equality.
“We’ll probably have a lot more luck there,” Posada continued, “because it doesn’t raise the question directly of the constitutional right of gay marriage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since federal and state officials ordered the low-cost Chinatown bus carrier Fung Wah to suspend operations at the end of February, some Harvard students say their trips between Boston to New York have been more difficult to plan.
For Desta S. Lissanu ’13, the end of Fung Wah “made everything more chaotic, and a heacache.”
“After they shut down, prices have gone through the roof,” said Lissanu. “It’s been really frustrating since Fung Wah closed, because demand has stayed really high.”
Lissanu recounted that when she came back from New York three weeks ago, many carriers had sold out tickets three or four days in advance.
“It used to be that you could just show up 15 minutes before a bus left and buy a ticket,” she said.
Fatma K. Akcay ’16 said that while she will ride Lucky Star in the future, in her experience trips with Fung Wah have always been faster.
“Fung Wah drivers drove really fast, to the point that you always got where you needed to be in exactly four hours,” said Akcay.
But many students interviewed for this article said that for them, Fung Wah’s closing has caused few problems.
Alexandra M. Kiley ’15, who traveled to New York over spring break, said that she has not found it any more difficult to book a trip to the city.
Students are not the only ones adapting to a changing bus markiet. Since Fung Wah closed in February, other bus lines have altered their travel offerings.
Lucky Star, a low-cost bus carrier that offers trips from Boston to New York City, increased its minimum fare from 16 to 25 dollars on March 11, according to a Lucky Star call center operator, who declined to comment on whether the price increase was related to Fung Wah’s closure.
According to Peter Pan Bus Lines Executive Vice President Robert Schwarz, the demand for Peter Pan bus rides increased by between 11 and 33 percent per day for the month of March, as compared to last year’s sales data, prompting the company to increase the size of their bus fleet in order to expand passenger capacity.
Schwarz added that the bus line’s fares have not deviated much from previous years’ averages.
In order to capture the part of the market left unserved by Fung Wah’s closure, Yo! Bus began servicing the Boston to New York route two weeks ago, going from South Station to Manhattan’s Chinatown, where Fung Wah use to drop off passengers. Peter Pan and Greyhound bus lines jointly launched Yo! Bus in December,
“After Fung Wah closed down, there was immediate demand for buses going specifically to Chinatown,” said Schwarz.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two undergraduates wrote a computer program Tuesday night to access a hidden promotional image of rapper Tyga on yardfest.org just hours before the website said it would reveal the artist set to perform at the annual spring concert in Harvard Yard.
Tyga, known for the hit “Rack City,” has already been booked to perform as an opening artist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Spring Fling concert on April 12. Harvard’s Yardfest will be held on April 13, according to the Mather House calendar.
Emails sent out over House lists Tuesday evening publicized the website, which featured a ticking clock counting down to a reveal of the 2013 Yardfest artist at 8 p.m. Wednesday night. The website was sponsored by the College Events Board and the Harvard College Concert Commission.
When Kirkland resident Kendall L. Sherman ’15 saw the publicity email sent out over her House list, she set to work trying to crack the website’s code in order to determine the identity of the artist. She was soon joined by her friend Balaji Pandian ’15, a computer science concentrator, who helped write a script  to comb through the site for evidence of the Yardfest artist’s identity. Reasoning that the website’s coder had likely named the file that would ultimately reveal the artist in a discoverable way, Pandian wrote a script that scanned through potential file names of photos on the site. Pandian discovered the Tyga photo after running his program for approximately 15 minutes.
Shortly after midnight Wednesday, Sherman sent an email over several House lists revealing the search’s findings.
“Couldn't you guys have not been tools about it so we didn't have to do this? Props to Balaji Pandian,” she wrote.
Sherman said in a phone interview early Wednesday morning that no one from the CEB had reached out to her or Pandian since they disseminated their discovery.
Larson C. Ishii ’15, Secretary of the CEB and a member of the Yardfest Committee, wrote in an email to The Crimson early Wednesday morning that the CEB was “currently looking into the matter to figure out exactly what has happened.”
He added that the CEB was “unable to confirm or deny who the Yardfest artist is” due to contractual obligations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team opened its home season with two wins in a doubleheader over Rhode Island. In a dominant pitching display, the Crimson prevailed by scores of 11-1 and 2-1.
Times have been rough recently for Harvard (7-12), which was riding a four-game losing streak into the twinbill. However, it appeared that this recent form could not have been further from the players’ minds as they came out all guns blazing.
“I think we came out with a lot of fire,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “I think we came out really ready and attacked early.”
HARVARD 2, RHODE ISLAND 1
For all that offense was the name of the first game, defense dominated the second encounter.
It was a very tight affair throughout as strong pitching by both sides kept the other at bay. The poor fielding from the Rams (5-15) that had amplified Harvard’s explosive start remained into the second game. Three errors from Rhode Island allowed the Crimson to score two runs in the first inning off just one double from sophomore Katherine Lantz.
While it appeared that another big win was in the cards for Harvard, Rams pitcher Erika Szymanski kept her team in the game by holding Harvard scoreless for the next five innings.
“ [Szymanski] was really effective against us,” Allard said. “We didn’t make adjustments throughout the game, and that’s why we didn’t score more runs [in the second game].”
Harvard certainly had its chances to take the game away from Rhode Island but were unable to convert. In both the third and fifth innings, two players were left on base but after the disastrous opening inning, the Rhode Island fielding had tightened up and was no longer committing any errors.
The stage was set for a dramatic seventh inning as freshman closer Jamie Halula came in to pitch.
“We weren’t worried,” Allard said. “We knew Jamie could close it out and she did a good job, she has great movement on the ball, [and] she remained poised throughout.”
Halula only gave up two hits and one run, earning a save for herself and a win for the team and starting pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz.
“You’ve just got to hit spots,” sophomore pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz said. “It’s patience. It’s not even how fast you throw it, it’s not what you’re throwing, you’ve just got to throw the ball where they can’t hit it.”
HARVARD 11, RHODE ISLAND 1
By the end of the second inning, Harvard had already all but put the first game to bed. After a walk and a hit in the first inning, junior Kasey Lange launched her third home run of the season over right field to start things off for the Crimson.
That was only the beginning of the Harvard onslaught. The Rams were forced to pull their opening pitcher after she gave up two more hits, two more walks, and hit a batter without getting any more outs in the second inning. And yet the tide was still not stemmed as Harvard’s batting lineup went rampant.
Sophomore Katherine Appelbe eventually grounded out to third to end the run, but the damage was already done. Harvard had scored six runs on three hits in a monster inning taking the score to 9-0.
Harvard’s attack cooled after that, going scoreless in the third before freshman Alyssa Siegmann hit a two-RBI single in the fourth. Errors cost the Rams the ability to stay competitive, committing eleven in the four innings of the first game.
This relentless offensive performance was complemented by a complete defensive effort from the Crimson. Freshman pitcher Morgan Groom gave up five hits but no runs in the first four innings and senior Jess Ferri kept Rhode Island to a solitary dab on the scoreboard to ensure that Harvard did not have to bat again.
“[Morgan Groom] was hitting her spots, moving the ball around the zone and I think it was hard for them to settle in on what she was throwing where,” Allard said. “She just had a really good performance today. And then Jess Ferri came in and she hasn’t got a lot of time on the mound, so it was nice to have her come in and get some innings of work, too.”
“I think today and all of our preseason preparation has been good for us,” Allard added. “We know what we need to do and I think we’re just ready to get league play started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A trio of relatives led the University at Albany as the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (4-4, 1-1 Ivy) struggled to a 16-7 loss at Soldier’s Field Tuesday night.
The nation’s top-rated attack sustained the Great Danes (5-3, 0-0 America East) throughout the contest as three Thompsons—brothers Lyle and Miles and cousin Ty—combined for nine goals. Albany held a commanding 8-3 lead by the half.
“We got outplayed,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik. “Albany executed better in most areas of the field. I thought that we came out of the gates with energy, but turnovers and transition offense really hurt us.”
Attack Lyle Thompson, who entered the game ranked second in the nation in points per game and first in assists per game, opened the Albany onslaught two and a half minutes into the match. The sophomore has been the most effective member of the family and finished the night with a game-high four goals and four assists.
Harvard responded quickly with a goal by sophomore midfielder Murphy Vandervelde to tie the game, and only a minute later, the Crimson’s leading scorer Alex White caught the ball at the top of the box, drove straight past his defender and buried the ball in the cage to give Harvard its only lead, 2-1.
But from there, it was all Albany.
To start, junior attack Miles Thompson backed down his defender before taking a no-look shot that made it past Harvard goalkeeper Harry Krieger 5:45 into the first. Lyle then followed that with two straight goals. The youngest Thompson closed out the first quarter with a successful underhanded rip and opened the second with a one-on-one with Krieger after a Harvard failed clear and turnover in its own end.
The Crimson’s woes continued as senior Great Dane defender  Jack Nickla (1 goal, 1 assist) picked up the ball at the top of the Albany box and ran it all the way across the field for a goal. Junior attack Ty Thompson then added another to extend Albany’s lead to 7-2.
After the Great Danes were assessed a tripping penalty, Harvard tried to reclaim some momentum. Vandervelde received a pass from junior attack Peter Schwartz about 12 yards from the cage before finding the back of the net.
But the Great Danes would score again before halftime, as senior attack Will Fuller isolated himself on a Crimson midfielder behind the goal and before feeding sophomore teammate Tim Cox for the final goal of the half.
“We knew they had a great offense,” said captain Jason Gonos. “We struggled to stop them early on and they got some momentum that we couldn’t really stop.”
Albany came out strong in the second half as Fuller scored two minutes into the half. Ty Thompson added his second goal six minutes later after a rebound landed right in his lap.
Harvard responded with a blistering shot from about 15 yards out by White, his second of the game and 14th of the season, on a man-up opportunity that resulted from an Albany slash. It was followed by a goal by Schwartz to bring the game within five.
Albany did not allow the game to get any closer. Lyle Thompson backed down his defender and drew separate penalty flags for holding and for slashing before feeding one of his teammates for a wide open goal. Lyle assisted Miles for another goal 30 seconds later during the ensuing man-up chance.
In the fourth quarter, Vandervelde scored his third of the game, and freshman midfielder Brendan Newman struck for the Crimson. But both were overshadowed by four Albany goals as the game came to a close.
Tuesday night’s loss marked Harvard’s largest margin of defeat of the season. The Great Danes had nine fewer turnovers and finished the night with a 42-33 advantage in shots and a 31-22 advantage in ground balls over the Crimson.
“We have to get better between the lines,” Wojcik said. “[We need to improve] picking up ground balls and hustling.”
In addition to Lyle’s eight points, Miles Thompson had three goals and two assists. Ty added two goals.
Vandervelde, who entered the game with one goal on the year, turned in the best performance for the Crimson. The sophomore scored the first hat trick of his collegiate career but left the field unsatisfied.
“I would rather a win with no hat trick and no goals at all than to lose like that,” Vandervelde said after the game. “Looking forward, we’ve got Duke on Saturday and we’re going to really stick it to them. This was a wakeup call.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTIONS: March 28, 2013
The headline of an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the location of Harvard's game against the University of Albany. In fact, the contest took place at Soldier's Field, not in Albany. The article also incorrectly stated that a trio of three brothers led Albany to victory against the Crimson; in fact, two brothers and a cousin combined for nine Albany goals.

Sometimes, crimson and blue make a purple-ish color. Other times, crimson and blue make a book about changing the world.
Nina Vasan '06, now pursuing a degree at Harvard Medical School, recently published "Do Good Well," a more-than-500-page guide for students and anyone interested in changing the world, with co-writer Jennifer Przybylo, a graduate of Yale University.
"I feel incredibly lucky to be a student at Harvard at a time when creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship are celebrated as ways to solve social problems next door and across the world," Vasan wrote in an email to the Crimson.
The tale of "Do Good Well" goes back to high school, when the co-authors met at the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards in Washington, DC. Seated next to each other at the first ice breaker, the two quickly became friends and made a point of reuniting every year at the Harvard-Yale game.
During her college years, Vasan was approached by a publisher asking her to develop a how-to book on inspiring, creating, and leading social change. Vasan had discussed this topic with Przybylo many times since their first meeting in high school, and decided that Przybylo would be the "perfect partner," she wrote.
"Do Good Well," true to its handbook role, combines case studies, advice, exercises, and more. The book is ultimately meant "to give students a comprehensive and practical roadmap for turning their idealism into impact," Vasan wrote.
100% of Vasan's net royalties from the book will go the Do Good Well Fund, a social impact fund that invests in young entrepreneurs and leaders with creative ideas and solutions.
People who are interested in the concept of Do Good Well can contribute by being part of the "Share What Works" contest.

Dear Harvard,
We know its midterms season and times are tough. From all of us at Flyby, here's something to put your mental anguish into perspective.
If you are:
1. Bored out of your mind...
2. In need of bureaucratic hilarity...
3. Curious about the counterculture against "Occupy Yale"...
4. Curious to know what issues the Yale College Council puts its blood, sweat, and tears into resolving on campus...
5. Curious to know which residential college at Yale has the crunchiest crouton...
...Or all of the above, then do read... The Salad Report.
Some schools just have bigger things to worry about.
