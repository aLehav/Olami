After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
As an alumnus of Harvard, I am writing today to express my disappointment, and to be frank, outrage, at the University’s decision to sanction students who are members of single gender clubs. Discriminating against students for legal activities they do on their own time, outside of the University, is not only unjust, it also is in complete opposition to the kind of free and open exchange of viewpoints that a university should promote. I have given Harvard money every year since I graduated, but I will no longer make any donations to the school until this policy is changed. (And by the way, I was not a member of a final club.)
Sincerely, Stephen G. Lookner '93

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
Kudos to President Faust and Dean Khurana on their bold decision to take action against these scions of the status quo: unrecognized single-gender social organizations. In the fullness of time, this policy of perfect inclusion will doubtless notch a page in the annals of the small triumphs of democracy. But any fool can praise; the trick now lies in how to consolidate the gains of the new policy.
Wisely, President Faust and Dean Khurana have left the scope of “unrecognized” single-gender organizations vague. Why not advance against single-sex organizations of all pernicious stripes: single-sex book clubs (surely the nourishment of a worthy book should be shareable with all Eves and Adams), single-sex singing societies (the joy of song should extend to all voices, not just the lower registers), single-sex rooming groups (for what can impress a young mind more than the society of one’s roommates), and the mother of exclusion, single-sex sporting teams, to name but a thimbleful?  Single sex card gatherings, exercise groups, gaming guilds—the possibilities could fill the stacks of Widener.
And let the punishment fit the crime.  While the administration must begin incrementally, the institutions in its crosshairs—final clubs—need a lashing they won’t forget.  My concern is that the ban on leadership positions and top fellowships will do little to prejudice their activities (members of these clubs typically aspire scant beyond their atavistic ways).  Surely under the rubric of “leadership” we can conjure broadly: captains and co-captains, presidents and treasurers, coxswains and strokes, quarterbacks and strikers.  In time, we can extend it to all starters, reserves and even club teams. Ultimately however, the punishments must be more draconian—a banishment from on-campus housing and, eventually, summary dismissal.  But I have little fear but that over time President Faust and Dean Khurana will employ the new policies to squeeze these benighted institutions until their pips squeak.
Sic semper tyrannis!
Yours in Veritas,

To the Editor:
The decision to put pressure on the final clubs to open their membership to both sexes is one that makes me question whether Harvard is an organization that deserves my support. I never belonged to a final club, but never felt left out of all the things that Harvard offered. But now I am more inclined to donate to a final club than to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 9, 2016, at 8:41 p.m.
In a joint statement Monday, officials from a variety of umbrella groups for national Greek organizations criticized a new Harvard policy that, starting with the Class of 2021, will bar members of unrecognized social groups from holding leadership positions in College clubs and disqualify them from Harvard endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
The statement—from leaders of the National Panhellenic Conference, the North-American Interfraternity Conference, the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations, and the Association of Fraternity/Sorority Advisors—expressed broad agreement with Harvard’s aim of “creating a safe and equitable environment for students,” but wrote that Harvard “mistakenly assumes the way to achieve those ends is to punish students for participating in single-gender organizations.”
Harvard’s policy announcement and accompanying opposition came at the end of a turbulent year for Harvard’s single-gender social organizations. While Greek organizations have managed to remain, for the most part, out of the spotlight, Harvard’s unrecognized final clubs drew ire from administrators, who pressured to reform their membership policies. In the fall, two historically all-male clubs added women to their ranks for the first time.
The authors of the Greek organizations’ statement—Dani Weatherford of the National Panhellenic Conference; Francisco Lugo of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations; Judson Horras of the North-American Interfraternity Conference; and Mark Koepsell of the Association of Fraternity/Sorority Advisors— also criticized the policy on grounds that it denied students “the basic right of free association.”
In a statement from College spokesperson Rachael Dane, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana responded to the Greek organizations’ collective message, writing that Harvard is “committed to building an inclusive campus community” and that “we have the obligation to establish general regulations and standards that shape our Harvard community in a manner that is consistent with our educational philosophy."
In addition to the joint statement, leaders of each Greek organization submitted their own statement. All statements were compiled in a message sent by Jonathan Coffin, a spokesperson for the National Panhellenic Conference.
Weatherford, the Executive Director of the National Panhellenic Conference, urged Harvard“ to consider the ramifications this policy shift will have on programs and opportunities for women on campus.” Undergraduate women in sororities and female final clubs were particularly aggrieved by the new policy, with many taking to Facebook to criticize the new policy for what they considered a lack of consideration for women’s perspectives.
“While we support efforts to forcefully address sexual assault on every campus, punishing women for being members of single-gender organizations is not the answer,” Weatherford wrote.
Lugo, the Commissioner of Member Services for the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations, wrote that “culturally-based fraternities and sororities,” —those composed of underrepresented minority students— “are also punished by Harvard’s policy.”
“[I]f Harvard is seeking to make campus more inclusive and equitable, removing opportunities for these students goes directly against that goal,” Lugo wrote.
Horras, President and CEO of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, wrote that the policy distracted from “real issues around campus safety.” Koepsell, Executive Director and CEO of the Association of Fraternity/Sorority Advisors argued that Harvard’s longstanding policy not to recognize fraternities and sororities “has been a disservice to students in those groups” and that the new policy “ misses the mark on how to improve campus safety and inclusivity.”
While none of the statements included mention of legal action, Jonathan M. Pierce, a national spokesperson for the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, did not rule out legal action. In an interview with The Crimson Friday, Pierce said that AEPi would “be forwarding this to our legal counsel and be reaching out to our partners at other Greek organizations and other clubs. We believe [the regulations are] unfair, likely to be unconstitutional, and we will work to fight it any way we can and we will reach out to others impacted.”
National parent organizations discourage undergraduate members of sororities and fraternities from talking to the press. But at least one demonstration, organized by a group calling itself the Crimson Women’s Coalition, is set in response to the new policy.
In an email alerting journalists to a scheduled Monday protest outside of University President Drew G. Faust’s Massachusetts Hall office, the group wrote that they “want the college to return to the drawing board and create policy that acknowledges the necessity of women’s spaces on campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing to mount pressure on administrators, more than 200 women rallied in front of Massachusetts Hall Monday against a new Harvard policy that will bar members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from holding leadership positions in official clubs and receiving top fellowships.
The rally, organized by a group calling itself the Crimson Women’s Coalition, featured four brief speeches from undergraduate women, a march around Harvard Yard, and chants defending all-female organizations.
 The event marks the latest in a series of negative responses to Harvard’s newly announced sanctions against single-gender social organizations, which will first affect freshmen matriculating in the fall of 2017. Many graduate leaders of male and female final clubs, national greek organizations, and undergraduate women have expressed frustration and opposition to the announcement.
Compared to final clubs, Greek organizations endured relatively little administrative pressure to update their membership policies this year. In the wake of the policy, members of Greek organizations have been particularly critical of the move.
According to Rebecca J. Ramos ’17, who helped organize and plan the rally, Khurana met with representatives of Greek organizations Sunday, though she said attendees “haven’t received much clarification on the policy yet.”
College Spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on a possible meeting. Dane wrote in an emailed statement that administrators “have received messages of support from many members of the broad College community” along with “messages of concern and opposition.”
“As we noted Friday, change is difficult and is often met initially by opposition. That was certainly true with past steps to remove gender barriers at Harvard, yet few today would reverse those then-controversial decisions,” Dane added. “We continue to believe that gender discrimination has no place on Harvard’s campus. At the same time, we support the right of every community member to express their views."
Women began gathering Monday around 5 p.m., holding signs that ranged in tone from somber to lighthearted.  One read “Sexual Assault Is Not Our Fault,” and another read “I should’ve gone to Bryn Mawr,” referencing the Pennsylvania women’s college that University President Drew G. Faust attended.
Ramos kicked off the event, emphasizing that speeches came “from individuals, not from any particular organization,” as one woman used a hockey stick to secure a banner with the phrase “#HearHerHarvard” from the upper floor of Massachusetts Hall. Several sorority members, beholden to restrictions from national parents organizations, declined to comment.
“By removing… spaces for women, Harvard is making our campus less safe for women,” Ramos said. “The College may have discussed this extensively with the male organizations, but they have only included female organizations as an afterthought.”
In a public letter last week explaining the policy, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote that administrators had “developed… recommendations with careful deliberation.”
Ramos argued that the policy had “taken away our place to speak openly about women’s issues and actively empower each other and other women, and in doing so, they effectively turn back the clock on all of our progress.”
Ramos ended her speech, as most speakers did, with a call and response to the crowd of “Hear her, Harvard.”
Whitney S. Anderson ’16, another speaker, said her women’s organization “has been a source of mental health support, a place to address sexual assaults.”
After four speeches, women marched once around Harvard Yard, chanting “Hear her, Harvard” and “Sexual assault is not our fault.”
Before the rally, Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña, who observed the protest, declined to comment on whether the College may amend the policy, although she said administrators “continue to invite… conversation.”
Faculty Dean of Lowell House Diana L. Eck, who arrived at the rally shortly after the end of the speeches, said that she was “sympathetic to the sense that [the policy] may need to be more nuanced.”
“I’ve heard of many women, like these women here, who feel that it comes down unfairly on their rather new attempts to establish clubs and spaces,” Eck said, adding that she believed in the “gist of the policy.”
Eck also said “some of these clubs are not in keeping with the Harvard that has emerged over the last 50 years” though she added said that, in her opinion, women’s clubs were not among them.
Ramos said she hoped the rally would spur further meetings with administrators before the end of the week.
“We want the College to return to the drawing board and create policy that acknowledges the necessity of women’s spaces on campus,” the Crimson Women’s Coalition wrote in a statement notifying journalists of the rally.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 10, 2016, at 11:55 p.m.
Latanya A. Sweeney, a professor of government and technology in residence,  and Sylvia I. Barrett, a lawyer, will take over as Currier’s two new Faculty Deans beginning next academic year.
Their appointment marks the first time Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has selected new Faculty Deans since he assumed his role in 2014. Sweeney and Barrett will replace Faculty Deans Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross, who served as Currier Faculty Deans—formerly known as House masters—for eight years. Wrangham and Ross announced late last year that they would be stepping down from their roles.
Sweeney was a visiting professor of computer science at Harvard from 2008 to 2012 and before that taught at Carnegie Mellon University. She is the editor in chief of the journal Technology Science and she is the founder of the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard.
Sweeney began her undergraduate studies at MIT, but left school to manage a technology startup. In 1995, she graduated with a degree in computer science from the Harvard Extension School. In 2001, Sweeney became the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. in computer science at MIT.
Barrett, Sweeney’s partner, is a private lawyer. She also began her undergraduate studies at MIT, but left after her junior year to work with Sweeney at the technology company. She graduated from the Extension School in 1995 and earned her J.D. from the Pittsburgh School of Law in 2002.
Khurana wrote in an email that he is excited about the appointments.
“Students and house leadership described them as inspiring and wonderful listeners,” he wrote.
According to Interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67, a search committee was convened in January to search for potential candidates. The search committee, headed by College administrators, sought advice from faculty members, current Faculty Deans, and students in Currier House during the decision process.
“Actually visiting Currier and meeting with the students on the search committee felt electric to us,” Sweeney wrote in an email. “The more we talked with the students, the more our excitement and enthusiasm mounted.”
Barrett and Sweeney were selected from a pool of around 12 candidates, Dingman said.
“Of course, we want Currier to be a house of explorations and opportunities,” Sweeney wrote. “We hope to provide students with ongoing ways to explore new technologies, new activities, new ways of thinking, and many other ways to grow.”

Last week, when we heard the news about final clubs and the Harvard administration, we turned to our most trusted source for all things Harvard: the Yale Daily News. With rumors about protests and cover photos of Alpha Phi sorority squats flooding our newsfeeds, we were eager to learn the facts. What was all this hubbub about the clubs?
The Yale Daily News, as ever, was a reliable source. The headline read: “Harvard moves against finals clubs, greek organizations.” Immediately, we were confused. What is a “finals club?” Is it different from a final club? Does it have to do with our exams? In fact, what exactly is a final club, anyway?
To our dismay, the Yale Daily News story answered none of our pressing questions. Beyond the erroneous reference to “finals clubs” (which was eventually corrected), the story does not make clear a number of key facts. What exactly is a final club? What are their membership policies? Can women join final clubs? Why does Dean Khurana think they are exclusive? How are final clubs different from “Greek organizations” (by that we assume you mean fraternities and sororities? And not the Harvard Classics Club?)
Instead of answers, we, the curious readers, were treated to a healthy, if not clarifying, dosage of verbiage and vageuties. Apparently, final clubs are “organizations.” Thank you, YDN.
Just when we thought we had reached the nadir of our confusion, the YDN hit us (or, rather, Dean Khurana) with the most passive-aggressive sentence we’ve seen since the last community update on mumps.
“Rather than sanction all Greek organizations or senior societies, Yale has attempted to expand their inclusivity and oversight,” the author writes.
The moral of the story here, dear reader, is that if you ever find yourself in need of information about what is happening on Harvard’s campus, turn to The Crimson, not outside media sources. They may not get it quite right. And YDN, in the immortal words of The Social Network’s Mark Zuckerberg:  “Final clubs… not finals clubs.”
