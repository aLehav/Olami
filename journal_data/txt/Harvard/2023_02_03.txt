After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, I joined a sizable group in a Freedom Liturgy organized by Restoring Justice, a nonprofit I’ve been a part of for over four years. Starting at their office in downtown Houston, we walked about ten minutes to the Harris County Jail, a stout brick building perched on the edge of the White Oak Bayou, with narrow, dark windows staring out from its facade. Outside the steps of the jail, a chorus of prayer, song, and spoken word demanded the release of those incarcerated not twenty feet away, all in the name of God.
It may feel strange to use Biblical language and prayer to advocate for the abolition of prisons, especially given media narratives surrounding Christianity and politics. But listening to the prayers of people moved by tenants of faith to fight for restorative justice reformed my own understanding of religion. Religious belief does not forecast one specific action; rather, religious tenets create a framework for understanding the world, a moral worldview which varies person to person, generating a range of diverse reactions.
Throughout my own life, my faith has oscillated between a dependable lifeline and something as thin and imperceptible as a strand of hair. When meeting people for the first time, I often joke that there are only three things you need to know about my childhood: My dad was a pastor, my mom a therapist, and I lived in Texas.
Religion, belief, and action have been intertwined all my youth. Living in Texas, the philosophical inquiries — and arguments — I brought to the dinner table were actively unfolding everywhere I looked. Religion — something conceptually concrete to some, yet elusive to others — has always been tied to motivations, whether my own or others. I could talk about it for ages.
Harvard was the last place I expected to discover the plurality of religion and genuine faith. I assumed Harvard’s campus would push me away from faith and religion, since a portion of my hometown community classified it as a machine of liberal secularization. The cliché “I can’t wait to grow in college” felt like the inevitable transition from a faith-guided mentality to an alternative path.
What I was missing, and what I now know, is what I realized on the county jail steps in Houston, what I see on this campus, and what I hope to show you in this column: Prediction, categorization, and quantification are overused methodologies in the study of religion, faith, and their actors.
This column, “A Leap Into Faith,” is meant to capture the diversity of Harvard’s rich and complex discourse on the sacred, using real observation rather than rote assumption. The only mentality required is an open one.
The definition of religion that I’d like to explore is one articulated by Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein, who explained to me that “religion, in a more nuanced view, complex view, is the tradition and the community and the deeply held moral and ethical worldview that we build to give human life meaning and purpose.” Religion is everywhere, and, as Epstein continued, “it can, in many cases, be experienced as divinely inspired and guided — it need not be.”
Speaking with Epstein was refreshing. He spoke on how, ever since Harvard College’s establishment, learning how to live a moral life was integral to its founding mission — a mission that continues today.
At Harvard, Epstein said, “there is a sense that there are multiple possible paths to a good and ethical and meaningful and moral life.”
This is the reality for many students on campus. Harvard is a place of immense diversity, and religion is a significant aspect of that. Daryush D. Mehta, a representative of the Zoroastrian Association, spoke to this plurality in relation to the various chaplaincies at Harvard.
“We have over 35 individuals who represent the spectrum,” he said. “We don’t have every little part of the spectrum but we have a lot, which is amazing, to have a seat at the table as a Zoroastrian, and Greg [M. Epstein] being the A and me being the Z, we say from A to Z, we have atheists, agnostics, humanists, to Zoroastrians.”
What is the best way to understand and appreciate that diversity? What is the best way to understand — truly understand — religion on Harvard’s campus?
I believe the answer is simple: by listening to individuals and understanding how they articulate their experiences of the sacred. When religion is regarded in a narrative form, in the words and style of someone guided by lived experience, it becomes alive and accessible.
From listening, this is what I’ve learned.
For Leah R. Baron ’25, an Orthodox Jew, faith is — and always has been — a steady foundation, one that involves both internal and external dedication.
“There’s kind of two ways of dividing that line, of things that I do that are obvious to the people around me and things that directly affect either the way that I dress or I eat or the way that I spend my time,” she said. “And then things that more present an overarching principle of how I would wish to live my life.”
For Baron, a Crimson Editorial editor, Shabbat — the Jewish day of rest — holds a special significance.
“In my mind, there is no Saturday, like Saturday is just Shabbat, like Saturday is not a day of the week,” she added. “It exists in an entirely different dimension of existence, just because for my entire life, every single Saturday, the exact same thing happens. The entire world stops, all technology stops, no writing, anything, you just spend time with the people around you and that’s kind of it.”
The Harvard lifestyle is often frantic, so to have a sacred, untouched time is particularly admirable.
Sophia N. Downs ’23-’25, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and a Crimson Magazine editor, also speaks about the sanctity of time, framed around her experience serving a mission for her church in Tacoma, Washington.
“A major focus point, we’ll say, of serving my mission was one that you’re — to the best of your ability — a representative of Jesus Christ,” Downs said.
As she recounted her mission, Downs returned to Luke 8: the story of Jesus stopping to heal a sick woman even though there was a huge crowd around him, clamoring for his attention.
“I thought about that story a lot on my mission, where it was emphasis on, ‘Yes, we have meetings, we have appointments to get to, we have things to do, but you are never too busy to stop and serve someone,’” Downs said.
For Aiden J. Bowers ’26, a Protestant Christian, faith is a personal, intellectual endeavor.
“I’ve always had this relationship with my faith and my religion where I just ask questions,” he said.
For Bowers, a Crimson Arts editor, science and religion do not inherently clash; it’s actually the intersection of the two that he finds fascinating. He is exploring this junction in Freshman Seminar 63E: “Religion, Neuroscience, and the Human Mind.”
“Listening to this very real overlap between anatomy, psychology, physiology, that sort of thing, and this religious theological take on us as human beings and our purpose, and how we come to be, is something that is endlessly fascinating to me,” Bowers added.
I had an incredible conversation with Gred Braho ’24, a Muslim student who converted to Islam after identifying as a Greek Orthodox Christian for most of his life.
“After reading the Quran, after reading the first few pages, I just had this feeling inside of me, like this is something I’ve never read before,” Braho said. “You could say like, at least from my knowledge, it’s the only holy book that doesn’t give you direct commandments, but it’s written in the form of dialogue, and it pushes you to think and it pushes you to kind of undergo your own spiritual journey.”
As a convert, Braho was not certain that he would be welcomed in the Muslim community on campus, but he was quickly accepted.
“Everybody in the community welcomed me, and they started inviting me to their social events,” Braho said. “Ramadan also came on campus and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Imagine waking up at like 4 a.m. because we have to eat pre-dawn, so imagine waking up at like 4, 4:30 a.m. with all your friends, all of you cooking together.”
Braho laughed in his interview with me, remembering some of the stories of cooking and eating before the sun rose. For him, Ramadan was a time of community building and orientation.
“I didn’t know what my position was in the Muslim community, and Ramadan helped me figure out who I want to be and what kind of image I want to give out as a Muslim student,” Braho said.
Faith and religion do not look like one specific thing. They are worldviews, connecting a community and the individual.
It can be very easy to place religion in a box, to see it as a one dimensional relic from the past that has no role in the modern era — that’s what I did. But events like the Freedom Liturgy — where faith and religious tenants were used to advocate for prison abolition and against racial injustice — and stories from classmates and peers, with their diverse perspectives, have rewired my mind.
Religion is an orientation to life, but that does not stop it from being problematic. Religion can be a tool to fight injustice, and also a reason for the injustice itself. The jail in Houston and the carceral system that runs through the South as a fungal remnant of slavery are being brought down by an ideology that was also central in its construction.
For this reason, religion is frustrating — maddening, even — to think about. My column this semester is meant to acknowledge the overwhelming array of intentions and outcomes of religious peoples. But what I want, more than anything, is for this first piece to convince you not to solely study religion as a quantifiable rule: Muslim/Catholic/Hindu/Agnostic individuals believe in X and act in Y manner because of their religion. This incessant, compulsive hunger to categorize, to predict, to assume, flattens personal and communal experiences.
Faith and religious beliefs are real: They shape the world, our perceptions, and our coping mechanisms, and they help form the rhetoric we use to make sense of our positionality. Religious tenants can be used to advocate for freedom, like in the case of Restoring Justice, and they can be used to remind us of our duty in life.
So as you go forward thinking of religion’s role in your own life and others’, I leave you with one final experience: the Zoroastrian worldview according to Mehta: “It’s to be good every day. And to help people every day. That’s it. That’s the essence of Zoroastrianism. And to be good and do good, you have to know how to be good and do good and the onus is on the individual.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As school districts across the country rush to ban ChatGPT, a free-to-use AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, other education stakeholders including Salman Khan, founder of the well-known free internet learning platform Khan Academy, have expressed concerns regarding such blanket bans.
Speaking at a webinar at the Graduate School of Education, Khan said that banning ChatGPT completely is the “wrong approach,” calling it “transformative” for the future of education. We agree with Khan to the extent that a blanket ban on ChatGPT does not suffice.
As a board, we are organized around and greatly cherish the principles of deep engagement, critical thinking, discourse, and writing — principles whose importance is seriously threatened by the development of AI. At first glance, ChatGPT mimics these virtues. It often writes well, can generate a logical analytical essay faster than a human can title their Word document and even crack jokes. However, the writing and pseudo-thinking that ChatGPT does, even when the product is nearly identical to human handiwork, loses something essential.
Writing is more than arranging words on the page in order to convey information. Writing is the physical manifestation of human thought — everso essential to critical thinking and intellectual discovery. It is an arena in which vague, embryonic notions transform into precise, developed ideas through bursts of prosaic creativity. The process of writing is just as important as the end result, as many of the ideas that enrich our work are only developed through the mundane endeavor of articulation.
If we outsource to ChatGPT, we won’t simply be shipping away the busy work like pulling quotes and smoothing out paragraph transitions — we will also be mutilating our own generative abilities and atrophying our creative muscles, contrary to the skill augmenting case often made for ChatGPT.
Our second area of concern, although not unrelated to the first, has to do with the current lack of response from the Harvard administration regarding this technological development. Right now, ChatGPT appears relatively innocuous — a source of novel meme content or a headache for instructors, at most. But given Moore’s law, which posits that computing power will double every two years, we can only assume that the speed and capability of AI applications will increase in the coming years — and one thing that we can be sure of right now is that Harvard, having released no College-wide policy on AI in the classroom, appears to be woefully unprepared.
The age of AI is upon us; we have no time to lose. Harvard should begin an intense evaluation of the manifold ways in which the development of AI can be channeled towards greater human flourishing without compromising the holistic cultivation of students as thinkers. On a pedagogical level, Harvard must immediately establish a working group on the role of AI tools in pedagogy, with an eye towards the implementation of methods like long-term projects, in-class work and discussions that are relatively insulated from AI tools and can be can be applied to all educational levels from elementary to graduate school. Moreover, finding domains in which AI can offer genuine skill augmentation without shortchanging users of learning will be important as further applications are developed.
Harvard should also fund development of more robust tools to detect the residual “fingerprints” left by the use of AI tools so that instructors may implement individual classroom policies that, while respecting a University-wide policy of not outright banning AI tools, are ultimately commensurate with the nature and goals of their respective courses.
As we have previously argued, the prospect of Artificial General Intelligence whose values do not align with that of humans may represent an existential risk to humanity. AI development as a field is not immune to the profit incentivizing nature of corporate America, which may compel companies to roll out AI products as fast as they can without thoroughly considering potential consequences. There is still limited understanding of the intricacies of how AI models make decisions, and as such, AI research should advance with precaution and the highest standards of ethics. Funding for such research should be independent and not exclusively stem from donors with pecuniary incentives related to the success of AI products.
To many of us, AI still remains a nebulous concept, and mis-education regarding its future abounds. Nonetheless, we are confident that a blanket ban on ChatGPT would not advance education at Harvard. Schools that are too trigger-happy with bans on AI will run the risk of placing their students at a serious educational and competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to other countries that may be more receptive to AI than our own. Education must prepare young people for the future — and the future seems to involve a great deal of ChatGPT.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I believe one of the greatest inventions of all time is the Internet. Online, I can access a plethora of information at my fingertips — something unimaginable just a few decades ago. But too often, I stumble across a groundbreaking tidbit of information and see an unwelcome message: $29.99 to finish reading this academic article.
Really? Another paywall?
Paywalls hide information behind a monetary barrier, either fully blocking content or offering limited access, perhaps by revealing only a paper’s abstract. Many require subscription to their service, subscriptions that are oftentimes insurmountably expensive for access to only one journal on one topic. Since larger journals also produce niche publications that require separate subscriptions, access to all information from just one publisher can cost thousands of dollars.
As a student in a public high school that could not afford subscriptions to such services, paywalls made doing research and learning from primary sources extremely difficult. I was limited in what I could access, and as a result, I often felt my work to be incomplete. My experience has been remarkably different since coming to college, because Harvard subscribes to a host of journals and publishers. In 2012, the University reported spending $3.75 million on journal subscriptions alone to accommodate its wide assortment of fields of study. This fee is difficult for many universities to front — some, including Harvard, have canceled subscriptions to journals due to rising costs.
Lack of access to journals can have a significant negative impact on research. Publishing research is designed as a way to communicate findings and techniques; it is cumulative, as new research builds off older findings, and knowing which methods work can save valuable time and resources. Take the incandescent lightbulb, for example, which, although often attributed to Thomas Edison, was built off the work of many scientists. In today’s climate, perhaps Edison would not have been able to pioneer his model, because a paywall might prevent him from accessing the designs of his contemporaries.
For students, reading publications is one of the best ways to learn about new fields of study; it helped spark my interest in biology. But without access to reputable information from scholarly sources, it becomes difficult to explore interests and pursue research of our own.
While working to publish research from my science fair project in high school, I needed to read many articles about my topic, but found it a challenge to access more than a quick summary because I simply could not afford to pay for every article individually. Utilizing cited sources within the primary literature and review articles allowed me to finish my research, but I had to spend many frustrating hours digging through sources to find the necessary information. Rather than spending time writing, and polishing my analysis, paywalls forced me to use that time looking for loopholes on the Internet.
Despite its unavailability, many students require scholarly information to succeed in their studies. As a result, many use sites like Sci-Hub, through which moderators download articles to which they have paid access and make them available for free. The use of such sites is often illegal in the United States, as downloading articles from them can break copyright laws. This is disadvantageous for everyone involved, including researchers who lose their intellectual property, and is not an adequate solution to the paywall problem.
One way researchers and journals are beginning to combat paywalls is through publishing data and research open access — that is, free of charge and accessible to everyone. Several journals have made their whole catalog open access. Other journals have given researchers the option to make their articles open access if the authors themselves pay an additional sum of money on top of other publishing fees. This model, which relies on researchers’ existing funding, can be even more profitable for journals than a standard subscription model, as they can charge unrestrictedly high amounts of money to publish open access. But the same problem arises — since many research institutions struggle to find funding, this system incentivizes researchers to publish behind a paywall.
The reluctance publishing companies feel about removing paywalls is understandable, but there are many alternatives for earning money on digital platforms. Relying on donations, like Wikipedia, or including advertisements are possible solutions. Although it may be inconvenient for users to view advertisements in the middle of an article, this could allow research to be shared more widely. Journals could alternatively employ student discounts, offer free subscriptions for educational institutions, or allow free viewing of articles for a limited time to help promote opportunities to learn.
We are no longer limited by location and access to books or libraries to learn new things. Rather than treating publicly shared research as a commodity, journals should consider removing paywalls to make education more equitable. Everybody deserves the opportunity to engage with the cutting edge of human ingenuity, and removing paywalls is an important first step in that direction.

The search for the next dean of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has officially kicked off, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean and University President-elect Claudine Gay announced in an email to SEAS affiliates Thursday afternoon.
Gay announced a 13-member faculty advisory committee tasked with spearheading the search process. The committee will “gather community feedback” to assist Gay in assessing the candidates.
Gay also invited all SEAS members to share their thoughts and recommendations by March 10 on “the challenges and opportunities” at the School and “the most important qualities needed in the next SEAS Dean.”
Francis J. Doyle III will step down as dean of SEAS on June 30 to become Brown University’s next provost. Thursday’s announcement comes as three other Harvard deans are set to depart their roles at the end of the academic year.
In her email, Gay praised Doyle’s contributions during his tenure.
“I’m deeply grateful to Frank for his ambitious and forward-thinking leadership of SEAS, his collaborative efforts across the University and beyond, and his energy and enthusiasm,” Gay wrote.
Gay said she is looking forward to the next chapter for the School.
“This is an exciting moment to identify a dynamic new leader for SEAS, who will build on the important successes of the past several years,” she wrote.

Kashish Bastola ’26 has never experienced a “shopping week.” So, like many students, he decided to make his own.
“It’s been rough,” said Bastola, who attended nine courses since classes began. “I spent way too much time inside of a classroom last week.”
Following years of fierce and public debate, Harvard faculty voted in May 2022 to eliminate shopping week, a now-defunct period at the beginning of each semester where Harvard College students could sample classes without having to formally enroll in them.
Harvard instituted course pre-registration for the first time in fall 2020 after the pandemic caused the school to move its classes online, opting for a modified shopping period where faculty posted trailers to course websites prior to the start of the term.
Shopping week’s permanent replacement, a previous-term course registration system, will require students to enroll in courses at the end of the previous term. The new system goes into effect for the spring 2024 semester.
Still, some students have found a workaround by enrolling in or attending several classes before settling on a schedule.
Sarah E. Burn ’23-24, who experienced shopping week as a freshman in 2019, said she now enrolls in six classes and attends classes she is not enrolled in before finalizing her schedule.
“It’s just about finding things maybe you didn’t find by yourself sitting online during winter break surfing my.Harvard,” she said.
Diana S. Shaari ’24 said she feels many students are doing something similar.
“I’ve talked to a bunch of people, at least the first week of classes, who, even if it wasn’t on their Crimson Cart, would go to ten different classes and just see,” Shaari said.
Still, some say a “Do-It-Yourself” shopping strategy is not a perfect replacement for the formal shopping week model.
“The fact that we don’t have shopping week anymore implies that if you change your classes you get behind,” Julia Santos de Alvarenga ’26 said. “So you have to catch up, and that’s the bad side of doing shopping week by your own.”
Opponents of shopping week had long argued that the uncertainty over the number of students enrolled in a class posed serious logistical problems that especially impacted graduate students who serve as teaching fellows for those courses.
Supporters, however, said that shopping week was an important part of the Harvard undergraduate experience and helped advance the school’s commitment to the liberal arts.
Sasha Agarwal ’25, an inactive Crimson Editorial editor, said she has been attending seven classes — of which she is enrolled in five — in an effort to determine which courses would best suit her double concentration in Economics and Statistics.
“This week’s been a little bit of a rough week because I have got six, seven psets to do,” Agarwal said. “It would have been nice to maybe have shopping week.”
Nevertheless, she said her past experience working as a course assistant helps her understand the logistical challenge shopping week poses for hiring course staff.
“It’s probably hard to figure out exactly how many members of supportive teaching staff you need, or TFs and CAs, stuff like that,” Agarwal said. “So I can completely understand that rationale.”
Julie A. Buckler, a professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures, said enrollment in her course Slavic 132: “Russia’s Golden Age: Literature, Arts, and Culture” appears to “fluctuate every day.” Since the start of classes, according to Buckler, enrollment in the course rose 30 percent.
She called the College’s course preview period a “reasonable compromise.”
“Before we had course pre-registration, you would prepare a course and have absolutely no idea how many students would take it. And you know, this is brutal for faculty,” Buckler said, citing the difficulty it posed to graduate TFs as well.
“This just feels more balanced on both sides,” she added.
Considering the extensive array of Harvard’s academic offerings, Bastola said, it was hard to choose just a small handful.
“There’s just so many cool classes at this school, and I want to make sure that I’m giving each of them a fair chance,” Bastola said.

Radio stations could potentially fill the gap in local news left by the decline of the newspaper — but only if they are given more funding, according to a study by Harvard Kennedy School Professor Thomas E. Patterson published last week.
Patterson’s study collected data from 215 National Public Radio member stations through online surveys. The surveys consisted of questions about the station’s staff size, average funding and income, and conditions of local news in their area of coverage.
Patterson said his search for a potential alternative to the “crisis at a local level” was prompted by observations of declines in newspaper popularity dating back to 2000 and its detrimental effects on local neighborhoods.
“We have a crisis at the local level in many communities, as the newspaper either shuts its door or gets hollowed out to the point where it’s just a shallow former self,” Patterson said in an interview.
“What we know from good studies is that what happens in those communities is that they stop acting like communities, the social trust diminishes, participation in local elections goes down, the accountability of local officials weakens,” he added.
After analyzing the data, Patterson said he was surprised by the extent to which many radio stations are understaffed and the impact this has on the station’s type of coverage. According to Patterson, understaffed stations produce fewer local stories and instead “carry the national programming.”
“What the study shows is that the smaller your staff, the less local you do,” he said. “If they want to, pretty much through the day, they can carry the national programming.”
Patterson said that though he sees the value in exploring alternatives to fill the gap in local news, such as newsletters or television, the production cost for radio is much lower than the cost for other forms of media.
“If you’re talking about production costs, you can do a lot of radio for much less than you can do television,” he said. “You can be telling the same story on television that you’re telling on radio, and it costs many times more.”
Mark Jacobs, former metro editor of the Chicago Tribune, said the news scene in Chicago strongly supports Patterson’s conclusion. According to Jacob, the Chicago Public Radio Station WBEZ, after merging with the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper, has since become “one of the most influential — if not the most influential — news sources in Chicago.”
“Public radio is indeed an area that could help rescue local journalism from the widespread disinvestment we’ve seen in recent decades,” Jacob said.
According to Patterson’s research, using radios to fill the gap in local news coverage can only be achieved with government funding and a “national fundraising campaign directed at major private donors.”
“We need more poured into local news because of information deficits at the local level,” Patterson said.
“All sorts of players, they need to think harder about what happens when information about the community begins to dry up — that can be a democratic crisis,” he added.

WakuWaku Ramen & Sake celebrated its grand opening yesterday in an event featuring live music from a DJ and futuristic decor.
Located on 33 Brattle St., the Harvard Square location launched in a soft opening last Tuesday and is the second WakuWaku ramen establishment ever built. The first WakuWaku restaurant opened in the spring of 2021 in Boston’s Chinatown neighborhood.
Along with a diverse selection of ramen and sake, the restaurant’s offerings include shaved ice, specialty salads, and chicken karaage.
On opening night, customers entered through the restaurant’s black curtains before being transported to what they called a “unique” and “cyberpunk” space adorned with neon lights. Local resident Efim Karlson wrote in a statement that it “felt like a full-size celebration” and that the food was “phenomenal.”
Classic electronic dance music hits played before DJ Tao, a Boston-based entertainer, took the stage later in the evening.
With a DJ setup on the second floor, Dixon Leung, operating partner in charge of Harvard Square’s WakuWaku, said that the restaurant has plans to host a DJ around two times a week.
“We are trying to provide a different vibe,” Leung said. “Younger, more futuristic, more nightlife-y — all mixed together.”
Leung said that Harvard Square was the ideal location to expand the restaurant chain because of its busy “college and tourist area.”
The Harvard Square location features a slightly different menu from the WakuWaku in Chinatown. Exclusive to the Harvard Square location is WakuWaku’s Lobster ramen, which Leung described as a “must-try.”
Jiaqi Zhu, a server at WakuWaku, said her favorite part of the job is the food. She particularly enjoys the restaurant’s gyudon, a Japanese beef rice bowl.
Hannah Tam, a research assistant at Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a customer on the day after opening night, described the food as “not stellar, but okay.”
The restaurant felt like a nightclub but “in a weird way, because it’s 6 p.m.,” per Tam.
Leung said WakuWaku’s ramen is prepared in a “different” way from other ramen locations in the Square. The chicken and pork broth are boiled for 16 hours, without the use of MSG.
WakuWaku is also the only ramen shop in the Square which stays open until midnight.
When asked about his goals for the new restaurant, Leung said he hopes to “attract more people to hang out at WakuWaku, instead of just eating and going.”
Leung shared that the chain is looking at opening new locations in Central Square, Quincy, and potentially Allston.
The WakuWaku Ramen website mentions plans to build a chain of 500 locations in the United States in the next decade.

Scholars and activists discussed reparatory justice movements for Black Americans and the legacy of reparations pioneer Callie G. House at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Thursday evening.
The panel, co-hosted by the IOP and the William Monroe Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice, was part of a campaign calling on President Joe Biden to issue a posthumous pardon for House, known as “the foremother” of the slavery reparations movement.
Cornell William Brooks, a Harvard Kennedy School professor, moderated the discussion, which featured University of Pennsylvania history professor Mary Frances Berry, reparations researcher Dreisen Heath, and author and folklorist A. Kirsten Mullen.
The conversation began with an overview of House’s legacy as one of the first leaders of the movement calling for reparations for formerly enslaved people and their descendants.
“I think she ought to be honored,” Berry said of House, commending “the courage she showed,” “the sacrifices that she made,” and her willingness to “put her body and soul in this movement.”
Speakers called for the implementation of a reparations plan that would end the United States’ racial wealth gap.
“I argue that any true reparations plan must eliminate the nation’s huge Black-white wealth gap,” Mullen said. “Black Americans, descendants of U.S. slavery, represent about 12 percent of the nation’s population, but possess less than 2 percent of the nation’s wealth.”
The panelists also said it was important to acknowledge the federal government’s role in “the creation and maintenance of the racial wealth gap.”
“In the 20th century, the federal government advantaged whites with the G.I. Bill — subsidies for home mortgages and building enterprises — while actively disadvantaging Blacks,” Mullen said.
During the panel, Mullen also discussed how statistics from the Covid-19 pandemic are a consequence of systemic discrimination against Black Americans.
“Nationwide, 146,108 Blacks have died from Covid-19, a mortality rate 1.7 times that of whites,” Mullen said.
The panel talked about the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, in which a white mob attacked the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma — an area known for its affluent Black American population.
“We’re talking about post-Reconstruction era Black wealth,” Heath said. “That’s a target for the white folks in the surrounding neighborhoods who conspired with the city, the county, the state to destroy this community.”
Heath also said many Black Americans have concerns about local harms, and she called on the U.S. government to address these harms at the federal level.
“They want a federal reparations program,” Heath said. “They have specified specific harms within their communities perpetuated by local leaders in conjunction, maybe, with private companies.”
Mullen said the feasibility of a federal reparations program is more dependent on public willingness to create change rather than the program’s possible expense.
“We certainly know that the United States has the capacity to pay a debt of that size,” Mullen said. “The question is, do we have the will to do it?”
“In 2000, only 4 percent of white Americans thought that reparations — cash payments for Black Americans — was a good idea,” Mullen said. “Now we’re looking at a number that is slightly over 30 percent.”
Reflecting on this increase in support, Mullen expressed hope for the future of the reparations movement.
“The trend is moving in the right direction,” Mullen said. “I don’t have a crystal ball, so I don’t know if it will continue to move in the right direction, but I’m very encouraged.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Medical School committee voted last month to embed climate change into the school’s curriculum.
In a meeting early last month, the HMS Educational Policy and Curriculum Committee voted unanimously to officially add climate change and health as a theme in the HMS M.D. curriculum. The effort was led by Gaurab Basu, the new climate and health curriculum theme director at HMS, and a group of students from the HMS organization Students for Environmental Awareness in Medicine.
The new climate change curriculum will examine the impact of climate change on health and health inequality, applications of these impacts to clinical care, and the role of physicians and health institutions in arriving at climate solutions.
Climate change’s negative health effects include the increased spread of infectious diseases, “heat-related harm” during extreme weather events, and lung disease due to pollution, according to HMS student Julia R. Malits.
The curriculum change aims to integrate climate change themes throughout students’ medical school education rather than creating new courses specifically around climate change.
“We framed it not as just adding a ton more, but rather enriching the content that’s already there,” said HMS student Natalie M. Baker. “Just adding small points here and there, an extra sentence here to make the connection for people.”
Caleb J. Dresser, a Climate and Human Health fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, said students and faculty have been pushing to incorporate climate change into the HMS curriculum for years.
“This is an ongoing process,” he said. “It’s been developing for years, as more and more medical students and faculty members have started to engage with this issue and to see it as a really important context in which we are all practicing medicine.”
HMS student Benjamin Grobman said despite the logistical and coordination challenges of adding new curriculum elements, the initiative has been met with a positive response.
“Every course director we’ve met with has been really supportive, enthusiastic, and we’ve been able to embed it into every course that we’ve attempted to in the first year of medical school,” said Basu.
Dresser said he believes the new curriculum prepares students to shape the future landscape of health care upon graduation.
“Many graduates of Harvard Medical School go on to leadership positions in medicine and beyond,” Dresser said. “It’s going to be increasingly important for people in leadership roles in healthcare and other industries to integrate climate change and climate-related hazards into their strategic decision making as they lead organizations.”
Basu said the current changes are in development and will become a “fully curricular theme” on July 1, 2023, when the new academic year begins.
Still, Grobman said changes in the Medical School’s curriculum are just one step toward addressing the impacts of climate change on health care.
“It has to go beyond that, and I think that’s something that hopefully we can start to do in the future,” he said. “But I think curriculum is essential because it really lays the groundwork for people to be thinking about these issues.”
HMS student Madeleine C. Kline said though medical education remains outside of her core passions, the potential for enhanced patient care has motivated her to push to modify the curriculum.
“Every student who comes through the Medical School will leave with an understanding of what climate change is and what it means for their patients,” she said. “I think it is going to mean a lot for their patients.”
Malits said she hopes the successful push to include climate change in the curriculum inspires other students to pursue advocacy.
“For those interested in medicine, or human health, you don’t have to wait until you come to medical school to advocate for curriculum development that focuses on the health impacts of climate change,” she said.

On the afternoon of Jan. 4, 20-year-old Sayed Faisal, a Cambridge resident and Bangladeshi American college student, was shot and killed by a Cambridge Police Department officer.
His death has thrown Cambridge into an uproar, leading to protests across the city, confrontations with city officials at public meetings, and the storming of Cambridge City Hall. Some demonstrators have charged that Faisal’s death was an incident of police brutality, racism, and Islamophobia.
Protests over the fatal shooting of Faisal come amid a national reckoning on policing, marked by outrage against systemic racism and police violence brought on by high-profile police killings. Just days after Faisal’s death, 29-year-old Tyre Nichols was beaten and killed by Memphis police, sparking nationwide outrage and demonstrations that reached Harvard’s campus.
Faisal’s case has come under an international spotlight and ignited scrutiny into CPD practices, while activists and some local leaders have renewed calls for police reform and public safety alternatives, arguing that police are ill-equipped to respond to mental health crises.
Two days after Faisal’s death, the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement from his parents, Sayed Mujibullah and Mosammat Shaheda.
Faisal — whom they called Prince — was “loving,” “generous,” and “deeply family-oriented,” they wrote.
“Prince was a normal law-abiding citizen who had no record of any kind with law enforcement. He was never violent towards anyone,” they wrote. “We want to know what happened and how this tragic event unfolded.”
At 1:15 p.m. on Jan. 4, a 911 caller reported that a man — later identified as Faisal — had jumped out of a window and was harming himself, according to a CPD statement.
Following a foot chase through five blocks of Cambridgeport, Faisal allegedly moved towards officers wielding a knife, and an officer shot him with a non-lethal sponge round.
When that failed to stop him from advancing, a CPD officer fatally shot him.
There is no body camera footage of the shooting, as CPD officers are not equipped with cameras. Surveillance footage released by the department shows a shirtless Faisal being chased by at least four officers.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an emailed statement that Faisal’s death marked the first fatal officer-involved shooting by Cambridge Police in more than 20 years.
Warnick also shared that the officer who shot Faisal is a seven-year veteran of the department who has never received a complaint before.
The killing is currently under investigation by Middlesex County District Attorney Marian T. Ryan, while the officer has been placed on paid administrative leave.
Following the shooting, Cambridge Police Commissioner Christine A. Elow pledged full cooperation of CPD with the investigation.
City officials have opted not to release the names of the officers involved in the killing, citing department practices. The names of the officers and the police reports corresponding to the incident are expected to be released upon completion of the district attorney’s investigation.
In the month following Faisal’s death, Cambridge has been rocked by protests railing against police violence. Outrage against city officials culminated in the disruption of an otherwise ordinary Cambridge City Council meeting on Jan. 23.
As public comment came to a close, dozens of protesters simultaneously rose from the gallery and began chanting “Release the names,” “No justice, no peace,” and “Send those killer cops to jail.”
The Council immediately motioned to recess.
Boston Party for Socialism and Liberation organizer Suhail P. Purkar, who led the council meeting protest, said in an interview that Faisal’s killing “hit very close to home.”
“We can’t allow them to have business as usual,” he said. “So we need to have some sort of disruption.”
Demonstrators marched from the Council chamber to Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui’s office, confronting her and demanding she release the officers’ names.
Purkar said he takes issue with the City’s decision to wait until after the investigation to publicize the officers’ names, adding he has “no faith whatsoever” in the investigation.
“If the names of the officers aren’t released, and members of the community don’t have the opportunity to come forward and say, ‘This happened to us,’ how can we say there was a full investigation?” Purkar said.
Activists have repeatedly called for the officers involved in Faisal’s killing to be named, terminated, and ultimately prosecuted.
Cambridge’s wave of protests began outside City Hall on Jan. 5, the day after Faisal was killed. Demonstrators returned on Jan. 9 — some carrying a large hand-painted portrait of Faisal — rallying for justice and reform on the same day that protesters in Dhaka, Bangladesh, formed a human chain to protest his killing.
Rallies spilled into Cambridgeport — the site of Faisal’s death — on Jan. 11, Harvard Square on Jan. 14, and the district attorney’s office on Jan. 21.
Throughout the demonstrations, protesters have voiced demands for police demilitarization, public safety alternatives, and reallocation of police funding. These demands were delivered directly by protesters to city officials at Cambridge Police headquarters on Jan. 29 at the conclusion of a nearly two-mile march from Somerville High School, Faisal’s alma mater.
Several organizers entered the police station in hopes of delivering their demands to Elow directly.
“They’re calling to see if Police Commissioner Christine Elow is here and if she’s brave enough to actually face her own community,” Purkar told attendees.
After being informed that Elow was not available to speak with them, organizers left their written demands and led chants of “We’ll be back!”
Faisal, an only child of Bangladeshi immigrants, leaves behind a city in grief.
His family came to the United States roughly a decade ago, according to the Boston Globe. Faisal then enrolled at the Winter Hill Community Innovation School, a pre-kindergarten to eighth grade public school in Somerville.
Sara Halawa, an organizer with Safe Schools Somerville, said Faisal was involved in several organizations for immigrant youth. He contributed artwork to the Mystic River Mural Project, an environmental art project spanning more than two decades, according to Halawa. He also spoke at a Center for Teen Empowerment Peace Conference and served as an interpreter at Somerville’s Welcome Project, which provides language learning and civic engagement services for immigrants.
“This was someone who worked hard — who participated in the community,” Halawa said.
At an emotional Harvard Square demonstration, organizers read statements from Faisal’s friends and teachers.
According to one friend’s statement, Faisal enjoyed customizing shoes and would spend days perfecting them. Faisal, a computer engineering student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, hoped to pursue a career creating video games.
“He had hopes and dreams, and the Cambridge Police stole that away from him,” the statement read.
Mujibullah, Faisal’s father, said through a translator that Faisal “was a very meritorious student” in a Jan. 5 interview with WCVB, adding that he had hoped his son would become a doctor or engineer.
“Now, all hope is gone,” he said.
Maria Khwaja, who taught Faisal at Somerville High School, said she couldn’t believe it was him when she read news of the shooting.
“I sat in my garage, and I cried for 30 minutes because this kid should have been okay,” she told protesters. “I have never lost a student like this.”
On the steps of Cambridge City Hall, Amtiaz Uddin broke down in tears as he reflected on his best friend’s life, recalling days spent playing cricket, riding bikes through the city, skateboarding, and going to the gym together.
“Someone can never hate him,” Uddin said. “No one can feel uncomfortable around him.”
At a Jan 11. vigil held at the Cambridgeport corner where Faisal was killed, community leaders directed prayers in different faiths — Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Christianity — as residents held candles and laid flowers at an altar created in his honor.
In the wake of Faisal’s death, the Bangladeshi Association of New England launched a GoFundMe to support his family. As of Thursday, the campaign had raised more than $70,000 of its $100,000 goal.
“I’ve struggled to find the words to address everyone amidst this tragedy,” Siddiqui told residents at a Council meeting the week following the shooting. “As your mayor, as a South Asian immigrant deeply connected to the large Bengali community here in Cambridge, I offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Sayed Arif Faisal.”
Before Faisal, the last police killing in Cambridge took place in 2002, when CPD officers fatally shot a man armed with a hatchet in his East Cambridge home.
Daniel Furtado, a 59-year-old with a history of mental illness, allegedly charged at officers after they fired tear gas into his house and broke down his door, leading officers to open fire.
In the intervening years, the department has repeatedly faced calls to change its response to health emergencies.
In April 2018, CPD arrested a Black Harvard undergraduate after the College’s Yardfest concert, sparking allegations of police brutality. Harvard University Health Services had transferred 911 callers reporting a naked man standing in Massachusetts Ave. to CPD.
Videos and an official report later released by CPD showed that officers tackled the student — whom they believed to be under the influence of narcotics — and punched him five times in the torso. Following the arrest, the student was bleeding and was transported to a local hospital.
Three days after the incident, then-CPD Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. defended the officers involved in the arrest.
“I absolutely do support the officers,” he said. “You have to judge their actions within the context of a rapidly evolving situation and not within an ideal construct.”
The incident led to significant public backlash, including protests against the department on Harvard’s campus and the creation of an office within CPD tasked with monitoring racial bias and use of force.
An independent review of the arrest found that officers did not violate department policy and there was “no evidence” of excessive force.
But hundreds of Harvard students and affiliates viewed the incident differently, calling on Harvard to develop a “medical emergency response team” that would respond to drug and alcohol-related calls — and remove CPD from the process entirely.
CPD has also faced calls to demilitarize. In July 2020, the department released a report detailing the extent of its armory at the direction of the City Council. The report revealed that the department owned numerous assault weapons and one Lenco BearCat.
The BearCat — a $350,000 armored vehicle — was previously used at a Black Lives Matter prayer march in 2016 as CPD officers wearing military gear observed a rally with the vehicle parked in front of protesters.
Under the leadership of Bard, CPD made strides toward demilitarization. In 2021, the department agreed to eliminate 20 percent of its long guns and end the use of camouflage uniforms for its officers. CPD also changed its policies to ensure that the BearCat could only be used with the police commissioner’s direct approval.
Warnick wrote in a statement that CPD will release an updated inventory for 2022 next week and confirmed that the BearCat is still in the department’s inventory but needs the commissioner’s approval to be deployed.
The surge of protests around Faisal’s killing came almost exactly a year after Elow’s appointment as CPD’s permanent commissioner in January 2022. In a CPD press release at the time, Elow said she hoped to make the department “the model for policing” in the United States.
In a Feb. 16, 2022, interview with The Crimson, Elow said she viewed the Yardfest arrest as a learning experience, adding that she hoped to work with universities to offer “amnesty” to students in crisis.
The search for alternatives to policing in Cambridge had been years in progress when Faisal was killed.
In response to the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, the Cambridge City Council looked to create changes to public safety.
Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan called for the reallocation of police funding to programs to “better support young people, especially Black youth.”
Ultimately, city councilors passed a policy order calling on the city to reexamine its approach to public safety, leading to the establishment of the Cambridge Public Safety Task Force.
In May 2021, the task force released their final report, writing that while CPD was “looked to as a national leader in proactive, progressive, community-based policing,” it was necessary to reconsider “what the best practices in public safety truly ought to be.”
The primary recommendation of the report was to create the Cambridge Department of Community Safety, which would respond to some 911 calls, such as emergencies involving mental health crises, substance abuse, and unhoused residents.
As the city weighed the department’s creation, the City Council passed a policy order considering funding for Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team, an independent public safety organization first proposed by The Black Response, a group that supports police abolition.
In an interview, Stephanie Guirand — who serves as president of HEART — said frustration with Cambridge’s approach led her and others to create HEART as an entity outside the oversight of the city.
“We asked a city councilor to put in a policy order for task force transparency and it failed, so at that point we doubled down on creating a very, very public process that we would facilitate ourselves,” she said.
Last year, the City Council considered action on both the Community Safety Department and HEART, but ultimately opted to fund the former with $3 million for fiscal year 2023. By contrast, CPD was provided $73.5 million in funding, up from $69 million in 2022.
The Community Safety Department remains in its implementation process. In the interim, Elizabeth M. Speakman, who serves as coordinator of domestic and gender-based violence prevention for the city, is leading the emerging department.
Purkar expressed concerns about the newly created department’s proximity to the police department and current emergency response system.
“They do collaborate closely with the police department, and that is essentially where the calls get rerouted to,” he said. “So that’s actually something that we don’t support whatsoever.”
Guirand said following the killing of Faisal, HEART’s call volume has “almost tripled,” adding that the team hopes to add additional responders, as it only has seven at present.
The City Council has also taken up consideration of changes to policing practices at several special meetings in the wake of Faisal’s killing.
At a Jan. 18 meeting, following questioning from councilors on the city’s use of force policy, CPD officer Cameron Deane said lethal force is sometimes necessary, adding that pursuing suspects without lethal force “can’t be the only option.”
Zondervan called for disarming CPD officers.
“The problem is not the training. It’s the gun,” he said.
At a Jan. 25 continuation of the Council’s special session, councilors debated implementing body cameras for CPD. Six councilors spoke in support of body cameras, while Zondervan opposed them out of privacy concerns.
Massachusetts legislators reintroduced a proposal for a Medical Civil Rights Act on Jan. 20. The act would require police officers to “immediately request emergency medical services” during any medical crisis.
The right to medical care has never been guaranteed by law in any state. Advocates of the bill, which has also been introduced in Connecticut and Maine, say that it would help protect individuals — particularly those experiencing mental health crises — when interacting with police.
Zondervan said during a Jan. 9 Council meeting days after Faisal’s killing that the city needs to “drastically change” its approach to public safety.
“We’ve heard that Cambridge is special and that our progressive approach to policing sets us apart,” Zondervan said. “Yet here we are somehow trying to process the reality that a Cambridge Police officer shot and killed a young man from our community while he was experiencing a crisis.”
“It’s a dark moment in Cambridge’s history that we will never forget,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 Harvard Law School alumni and current affiliates have signed an open letter calling for changes to the school’s Low Income Protection Plan, which subsidizes loan repayments for graduates pursuing public interest jobs.
The program, primarily intended for graduates who work in government, nonprofits, or academia, has come under scrutiny in recent years from recipients who say the program failed to grant them sufficient support.
The open letter — released Wednesday by a group of Law School alumni and addressed to HLS Dean John F. Manning ’82 — proposes several changes to LIPP that would “make it consistent with Harvard’s claim that it prioritizes financial independence for its student and alumni communities.”
The letter requests that HLS amend the program to fully cover student loan payments for graduates earning a salary of $90,000 or less. Currently, participants who earn more than $55,000 are required to contribute a limited portion of their income to LIPP payments.
In addition, the letter calls on LIPP to “change how assets and cost-of-living are accounted for,” as the program incorporates home value and retirement savings in determining payment amounts and does not account for high health care costs.
Finally, the letter urges HLS to “make spousal considerations fair.” Under the current version of the program, if a graduate earns more than their spouse, their payment amounts are not decreased, despite a potentially increased financial burden.
“While we hope HLS will act immediately to support public interest alumni in making the above improvements to LIPP, we expect an express commitment to do so by March 1, 2023,” the letter reads.
The program allows participants to use the lowest valuation on their home and considers any “extenuating circumstances” when calculating loan repayment aid, HLS spokesperson Jeff Neal has previously told The Crimson.
In an emailed response to the letter obtained by The Crimson, HLS Assistant Dean for Student Financial Services Natasha D. Onken explained that the school “engages in a comprehensive and multifaceted planning process” each academic year when planning the budget.
“The perspectives you have shared, alongside many others, will be considered in the broader context noted above,” Onken wrote. “As decisions are finalized regarding the school’s plans for next year and beyond, they will be shared directly with affected community members.”
In response to a request for comment, Neal provided The Crimson with the same statement issued by Onken.
This action follows a November 2022 open letter by HLS affinity groups and student organizations demanding that the school improve both LIPP and “front-end” financial aid.
Brendan Schneiderman, a 2021 HLS graduate and the primary author of the letter, said his goal was to hold the school accountable.
“Alumni are suffering with people moving wedding plans around because of their inability to meet their loan payments, or people staying in jobs that they are uncomfortable with or unsatisfied with because leaving would impact their loan situation,” he said.
Neal has previously pointed to assistance programs at peer institutions, which also consider spousal income and assets.
According to Schneiderman, prospective students who feel reassured by Harvard’s claims of LIPP’s generosity are often surprised when they learn about the technicalities of the program.
“We have made clear through our organizing that we will no longer tolerate HLS’s bait-and-switch,” the letter reads.
Following calls by students and alumni, HLS announced plans in May 2022 to increase LIPP benefits due to increased inflation.
Still, Schneiderman said this reform does not address claims in the letter that LIPP is less generous than loan repayment assistance programs at peer law schools.
“If Harvard is going to claim to be on par from an academic perspective with schools like Yale and Stanford, then it should also be on par with them in terms of its support for public interest fields,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may have come as a shocker when the College Squash Association announced the pre-season rankings a couple of months ago. The Harvard women’s squash program, the seven-time defending champions, who at the time had not lost a match-up since 2015, found themselves relegated to the second spot. Ranked ahead of the Crimson was a Trinity College lineup with uncertain prospects after a disappointing 2022 Howe Cup campaign that saw the second-ranked Bantam fail to make the finals.
Fast-forward to Sunday, January 15–the Murr Center is so crowded that a second row of spectators cranes its necks in the upper standing area to catch glimpses of the one versus two showdown taking place between Harvard and Trinity College. The Bantam made it immediately clear that its players were not there to be steamrolled like many of the teams that have played Harvard in the past five years. To put it in context, the Crimson only faced one close encounter–a win by a margin of just one game–last season. This took place on a road trip to New Jersey in January of 2022, where No. 1 Harvard narrowly defeated No. 3 Princeton thanks to a strong fifth-game from then-first-year Habiba Eldafrawy. Despite the close call against Princeton, there was little doubt all season as to whether the stacked 2022 Crimson would come out on top. With the way the team was poised and the ability with which its players maneuvered so smoothly on the court, Harvard was clearly a team used to winning.
Something seemed different in the Murr Center against Trinity College. Egged on by a boisterous crowd that had ventured to Cambridge for the competition and that outnumbered the home-team supporters, the Bantam attacked out the gate. Each bout was incredibly hard-fought with many games going into extra points. But, after the dust of the first three matches had cleared, the Crimson found itself in a very unfamiliar place: down three to nothing.
Sophomore Eldafrawy, who has been a reliable number three this season, swept her opponent to keep Harvard’s hopes alive. This would not be enough, though. The individual victories the Bantam claimed were by no means convincing–three were decided in a close fifth game—and the anticipated bout between the number one players for each team ended with junior Marina Stefanoni securing another match victory for the Crimson. Nonetheless, Trinity College ended the afternoon up seven on Harvard’s two, ending a historic 102 match win streak. The Bantam has answered the question that teams have been wondering for years: can the Crimson be beat?
Many other questions arose from this defeat of a college sports giant. How will the team respond? Will Harvard win another title? Are there other teams that can beat the Crimson?
The two weeks that followed the Trinity College encounter were packed with squash action for the group of Harvard women looking to reestablish their dominance on the court. The Crimson, still undefeated in Ivy League play and looking to claim a seventh straight Ivy crown, needed to ensure it was at the top of its form as it faced off against conference opponents No. 4 Princeton, No. 9 University of Pensylvannia, No.6 Cornell, and No. 8 Columbia.
The Tigers were dispatched with confidence by a strong and determined Harvard side. The Quakers met a similar fate at the hands of the Crimson, and Harvard posted a familiar 9-0 result against Penn thanks to strong lead games from Eldafrawy, sophomore Brecon Welch, and senior Charlotte Orcutt.
Stefanoni also recorded her seventh win in seven games played this season, against the Quakers. An essential element to the Crimson’s soaring successes last year playing the number two, the Darien, Connecticut native has really come into her own this season taking up her racquet as the team’s number one.
One of the big unknowns coming into the season for Harvard was the roster gap left by a graduated Hana Moataz ’22, and how the Crimson would fare shifting its athletes up a rung on the ladder. But part of what made last year’s team so successful was the sheer depth of its roster. In 2022, Harvard had three different players win matches at the number one–Stefanoni being one of them–, three players win at the number two, and five players win while taking a turn playing the number three. So when the time came to take the court this season as a new roster, Stefanoni fit into the role of the new number one seamlessly.
Harvard’s penultimate Ivy League match-up, against the Big Red, proved the Crimson’s depth, but also served as a too-soon reminder to this roster’s mortality. Although Harvard ultimately won the duel, the top three players on the ladder–Stefanoni, first-year Saran Gregory-Nghiem, and Eldafrawy–lost their individual match-ups to challenging opponents. The responsibility of the victory then fell to players four through nine on the roster. Dropping only three sets between the six of them, Harvard’s lower rung players rose to the occasion, emphasizing the importance of having strong players across the roster in order to experience team success.
The New York road trip ended in New York City, where the Crimson played the Lions, its final conference opponent, with a chance to clinch the Ivy League title. Harvard was pushed to the brink against a surprisingly equipped Columbia squad.
Welch opened the scoring for the Crimson, sweeping her opponent at the five position. Junior, Binney Huffman added to the tally with another sweep. After these two promising victories, though, the Lions turned the tables. Locked in an intense duel in the one spot, a few well placed shots marginally handed Stefanoni her second loss of the season. As more of the day’s matches started to play out to a close, one by one, Harvard noticed it was not adding any more points to its score. The six, the seven, and the two matches all finished, and the Crimson found themselves down two overall points to Columbia’s four.
With the Ivy title potentially on the line, Harvard returned to the fundamentals that had won it so many games in the past. The Crimson has outplayed opponents with pure skill and shot selection many times before. However, when opponents also hold the ability to make excellent shots and challenge each possession, Harvard tends to excel physically. A key to the team’s training has always been fitness and conditioning. Being able to win long rallies and games gone into extra points is crucial to overall success. As the day drew on and the Lions started to fatigue, the Crimson was able to continue to win long rallies and chase down difficult balls, giving it an upper hand.
Two victories in the four and nine spot tied the overall score at 4-4, leaving only one final deciding match. In this encounter, Eldafrawy showered her opponent with a medley of different shots, forcing them to burn unnecessary energy in transition. The Cairo native, with poise, closed out the match in a clean sweep to the roar of Harvard teammates.
With the defeat of Columbia, the women ended their conference play with a perfect record and claimed their seventh-straight Ivy League title. To accompany a hard-fought women’s Ivy crown, the men’s squash program, which is currently undefeated, also secured the Ivy League championship with its win over Columbia on the same day. The number-one-ranked men, who missed out on the Ivy title last year as a result of a narrow loss to Penn., reclaimed the conference title with an 8-1 win.
Both the women’s and men’s squash programs have seen enormous success already this season. Nevertheless, there are still high-stakes competitions to prepare for. This upcoming week features an all-Cambridge road trip for the Crimson as it takes on Tufts, St. Lawrence, and Drexel. And once season games conclude, the CSA title-contending Crimson will be looking forward to team nationals in Philadelphia, PA for the women, and Hartford, CT for the men. Here Harvard will be hunting even more hardware for its trophy case as it seeks to, yet again, show itself as the top squash school in the nation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard track and field’s men’s and women’s teams made history during the annual Harvard-Yale- Princeton (HYP) meet at Gordon Track on Saturday, January 28. Though Harvard took second place over, five members of the Crimson broke school records both on the track and in field events.
It was the throwing team that set the victorious tone for the clash of these Ancient Eight schools, setting new school records as well as winning four out of the five events. Senior thrower Stephanie Ratcliffe won the women’s weight throw, breaking the previous school record by one meter at 21.84 m. Senior captain Cammy Garabian, senior Estel Valeanu, and first-year Michaela Denson had honorable mentions, securing the third, fourth, and fifth places respectively.
The men’s throwing team did not disappoint the winning standard set by the women’s team’s throwers. Sophomore Kenneth Ikeji won the weight throw with 21.59 m, breaking the school record which he had previously held. Even more, senior Alexander Kolesnikoff broke the shot-put school record, setting the new mark at 19.83 m.
“It was Alexander who broke the shot-put record, and seeing him and Kenneth doing that week after week, breaking their own records is really cool,” said junior distance runner Maia Ramsden in reference to the team’s successes. “I feel like this generation of Harvard track athletes is rewriting that record book.”
Ramsden also played a key role in Harvard’s impressive performances on the track, setting another school record with her win in the 1000-meter race, posting a 2:43:03 time.
“I’ve never run the 1000 meters before, so I knew I was going to PR since I didn’t have any other time,” Ramsden said about her race. “I really wasn’t sure what was going to happen – it was a really pleasant surprise, I’d say.”
Sophomore Victoria Bossong led the sprint team, winning the 500-meter dash with a personal best of 1:11.96.
“I was excited going into my 500-meter race. It was the first time I had run that race since the Ivy League Championships of February 2022, and I was determined to earn myself a good seed time before running the event at Ivy League Championships later this month,” said Bossong reflecting on her win.
“I was blessed to run a PR by over half a second — faster than I had run to earn myself the 500m Ivy League title last year.”
The rest of the underclassmen sprinters also had success with their races. Sophomore Izzy Goudros won the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.55 seconds. First-year Mfoniso Andrew took first place in her heat of the 200-meter dash in 24.60 seconds, a performance that was enough to win the entire event. First-year Jackie Okereke ran a 57.05-second 400-meter dash, earning her third-place finish in the event.
The Crimson women ended their night with a dominating 4x400 relay team made up of Bossong, first-year Chloe Fair, Andrew, and Okereke. The team won the race by a close seven-second margin.
“Within our sprint group, it has been especially impressive to see how much growth the first years have made since the fall,” reported Bossong. “Training with other talented 400-meter ladies has been beneficial for us all as we have been able to push each other every day at practice as well as in competitions.”
The men’s team made remarkable statements on the track as well. Sophomore Graham Blanks won the 1000-meter race with a 2:23.16 time. In an exciting 60-meter hurdle dash, senior Samuel Bennett also broke a school record at 7.84 seconds. For their teammates, the excitement from each consecutive win helped fuel motivation for racing.
“It’s just so inspiring, and being able to watch Sam hurdle before I ran, I think it is really fun and creates this culture of success,” Ramsden commented. “You know, like my teammates are doing this – I can do this.”
In the 800-meter run, Harvard’s Vivien Henz – the only first-year in the event – posted a 1:51:22 time mark to take second place. To end the day in a nail-biter, the Crimson’s men's 4 x 400 relay team was unable to surpass Princeton by 0.160 seconds, putting them in second place.
For the Crimson, the most crucial aspect of its training is making sure they’re in the best racing condition when it matters the most, understanding that it can come down to less than two-tenths of a second in the end.
“Our coach is pretty keen on us peaking at the right time,” Ramsden said. “I think that at first, that means on the scoreboard – Princeton beats us, but in the long term, it’s better because we’re learning to adapt to new races.”
“That means when you put us in our good track events, like the Ivy League Championships, for example, we’re going to see this big jump.”
Ramsden, who hails from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, reflected on the competition that Princeton tends to bring toward the start of the season. Princeton took home the HYP trophy this year, with the women’s team tallying 159 points on the board to defeat the defending Harvard champions.
“Sometimes they teeter off, which is not something we’re known for. Usually, we have the opposite trajectory – I think it’s good to have a little fire under you at the start of the season.”
Looking forward, Harvard track and field will split between two meets this weekend, hosting the Crimson Elite and Multi at Gordon Track, while some runners will cross the river to Boston University for the Scarlet & White Invitational.
“There’s no team stakes on the line, there’s no title on the line, it’s really just a chance for everybody to have a really good opportunity to improve their personal bests and racing strategy,” Ramsden said.

While America runs on Dunkin’, Harvard runs on Peet’s. You are what you drink, and sometimes, overhearing someone’s Peet’s order tells you all that you need to know about them. Everyone has a go-to drink, and here’s what some of them say about you. Take this with a grain of salt, or sugar. ;)
Cold Brew Coffee
You have progressed past the need for sleep. Who needs sleep when you have a cold brew? You are unstoppable when the cold brew hits, and dare I say that even Math 55 is no match for you. You are getting that degree, no matter what! C’s get degrees, but only A’s get praise. You’re getting that homework done, even if it means studying at Lamont 24/7/365! That being said, if you really are a cold brew regular, you might be dead inside. In that case, please seek some help. You could also get a stronger cold brew, but in that case, you might need to seek some professional help for that self-destructive behavior.
Chai Latte
So you’re mentally stable? What’s that like? The polar opposite of your cold brew peers, you get this drink not for a caffeine fix but for its sweet, spicy taste and creamy texture. You are laid-back and chill and always down for a late-night Jefe’s run after the pset grind at MQC because you enjoy the little things in life. You recognize that life is about more than just scrambling to get assignments in on time. You happily take on the role of being the friend group’s personal therapist, when needed. You’re just as sweet as your drink!
Caramel Macchiato
You know that you can’t go wrong with a caramel macchiato because it tastes like a yummy dessert, and the iced edition looks cool and totally Instagram-worthy. You know just how to romanticize life, and you inspire all of us. You love your color-coded Google Calendar and elaborate Notion layouts and the feeling of checking things off your to-do list. You choose quality over quantity in friendship, and you enjoy going on adventures with your friends, whether it be renting the Harvard Outing Club cabin for a weekend or getting out of the Harvard bubble to visit Boston and blow some money at Newbury Street just to feel something. Good for you for living life to the fullest while getting your laundry done before the crowds on the weekends. Doing laundry at Harvard is survival of the fittest, and you’re definitely making the cut.
Tea
You are as wholesome as the iconic Dean Rakesh Khurana himself. You are calm and composed and always try to be nice to others, like a ray of sunshine. It’s very likely that you have your life together in the “in bed by 9 p.m. and up by 6 a.m.” way, and you purposefully enrolled in 9 a.m. classes five days a week. Maybe, you’re an international student staying strong against the major American coffee culture. Don’t let the accessibility of coffee anywhere and everywhere defeat you.
On the other hand, if you are as bitter as your unsweetened tea and always have to make it known that you hate coffee and constantly proclaim that it is unhealthy, then you are a disgrace to the wholesome tea drinkers out there. We don’t need that negative energy, Karen.
Any seasonal drink
You are a creature of habit, and you sure are dedicated. You eagerly wait all year for your time to indulge in a pumpkin spice, caramel apple, or sweet cinnamon drink, and it sure spruces up the otherwise bland routine of going to Sleep Gen Ed lecture, going to IOP meetings, and working at The Harvard Shop. You are a child at heart and adore traditions that make you feel warm and fuzzy, so you might find yourself bringing out the Harvard spirit and going all out for the traditions of The Game, Housing Day, and getting up close and personal with the John Harvard statue. Your enthusiasm is contagious, and although you can sometimes be overzealous, your optimism rubs off on the rest of us. In other words, you embody Kirkland. Go big or go home, am I right?
The extensive lines that form at Peet’s at 8:45 a.m., 10:15 a.m., 11:45 a.m., and 1:15 p.m. (the worst times to go, don’t even think about it) make it clear that Harvard students really, really love Peet’s and look forward to securing their special drink. After all, more espresso = less depresso. I hope that your drink of choice gave you some insight into your soul, or at least your personality. If not, only taking Flyby quizzes can solve your existential crisis.
