As reading period progresses and each of us experience our own quarter-life crises, we would do well to put things into perspective. Who knew that musical theater could be the perfect therapy? With sweetness and humor, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “Nine,” which ran this weekend at the New College Theatre, took a director’s creative blockage—something many of us can relate to—and turned it into a laugh-out-loud tale of temptation, confusion, love, and show business.Inspired by Federico Fellini’s self-referential film “8 1/2” and transformed into a Broadway musical by Maury Yeston, “Nine” follows womanizing film director Guido Contini as he sings his way through a search for clarity in his interwoven professional and personal lives. The sole male among a cast of women, Jonah C. Priour ’09 played an excellent Contini, portraying both pathetic midlife desperation and creative obsession all in a convincingly Italian accent. Attempting to take his mind off his troubles, Contini checks into a posh Venetian spa with his wife Luisa, but his worries persist. Refusing to confront his failing marriage and mired in artistic self-pity, he fantasizes about the other women in his life—his mistress Carla, his muse Claudia, the prostitute Sarraghina who taught him how to “Be Italian!” His apprehension about growing older is similar to that of nine-year-old Guido, played enthusiastically by the young Julyano Silva.The musical, accompanied by a live orchestra, moved seamlessly from heartfelt ballads like “My Husband Makes Movies,” sung beautifully by Rachel E. Flynn ’09, to raunchy song-and-dance numbers and back again. It’s a testament to both Yeston’s playwriting and the direction of Barry A. Shafrin ’09. While the choreography could have been executed more gracefully, the staging was creative and particularly enjoyable in “The Bells of St. Sebastian,” where candles carried by singers in tightly rehearsed blocking formations added visual appeal to the song. The cast moved on a large, white double staircase that, despite its ambitious design, ultimately detracted from the show by revealing stagehands and by providing unstable terrain for the stiletto-clad female cast members. Lighting was also often complicated and distracting, but the performance of the cast members was captivating enough to render these elements mostly irrelevant.“Nine” conveyed a clear message: appreciate what you have when you have it. Though this moral is earnest, and the show ended on a sincere note, the real strength of the production lay in its comedic moments. Alison H. Rich ’09 played Contini’s wonderfully frightening producer Lillian LaFleur; with gaping smiles, shrill screams, and impeccable timing, her character stole the show with “Folies Bergeres.” Other highlights were confidently sexy Carla (Jordan A. Reddout ’10) and her “A Call From the Vatican,” as well as Sarraghina’s innuendo-driven “Ti Voglio Bene/Be Italian!,” a tarantella that Jen C. Sullivan (’09) obviously enjoyed performing. In all, “Nine” did great justice to the Tony Award-winning musical and served as an exciting preview for the film version (directed by Rob Marshall of Chicago fame) set to premiere in December 2009. “Nine” was good, old-fashioned entertainment, and with catchy melodies and solid performances by leading cast members, a midlife crisis has never been quite so entertaining.

Laramie, Wyoming was just like any small Western town: a tight-knit community, says its resident limo driver Doc O’Conner (Brian Cass) in “The Laramie Project,” where “everyone knows everybody else’s business.” But the town was shaken to its core when a homosexual student at the University of Wyoming, Matthew Shepard, was found severely beaten nearby. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production, which ran at the Agassiz Theatre this past weekend, details the reactions and thoughts of Laramie’s citizens in the aftermath of Shepard’s death. Interviews conducted by Moisés Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project in Laramie—as well as statements made during the trials of the accused murderers, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson—comprise the entirety of the script. Each actor played multiple characters, which ranged from members of the Tectonic Theater Project to police officers to the murderers themselves. The actors were able to switch between characters with ease. Sam L. Linden ’10, in particular, strikingly portrayed two very different characters: Jedadiah Schultz, an eager university drama student who learns about his own prejudices against homosexuality and works to correct them, and Fred Phelps, a conservative minister from Kansas who preaches against homosexuality at Shepard’s funeral and his attackers’ trial. Linden successfully captured both Schultz’s desire to be tolerant and Phelps’ invocation of “God’s wrath” for homosexuals. The production used the Agassiz Theatre to effectively emphasize different scenes in the play. The space in front of the stage was often used for character interactions, literally bringing the audience into the dialogue. Scenes took place in the balcony, depicting phone calls between members of the Tectonic Theater Project and their interview subjects. Shepard’s funeral was especially impressive; cast members walked into the aisles of the audience and prayed for Matthew before returning to the stage while singing “Amazing Grace.” “The Laramie Project” as a play is most interested in exploring discrimination against homosexuals, not only in Laramie but throughout the entire country. Jacqui J. Rossi ’12 gave a stunning performance as Rulon Stacey, CEO of Poudre Valley Hospital, where Shepard was taken after being severely beaten. Stacey’s monologue announcing Shepard’s death brought herself and the audience to tears. After the monologue, Stacey talked about the letters she received after Shepard’s passing; some of them had condemned Matthew for his sexuality. “I didn’t understand the magnitude with which people hate,” she said. Understanding the power of hate and remedying its effects are central goals of “The Laramie Project.” The characters lead the audience to a number of realizations about the world of Laramie. As a play, “The Laramie Project” strives to reveal the evil that resides in America; by owning up to prejudice against homosexuality as a society, it suggests, this evil can hopefully be corrected. Most of the townspeople refuse to accept that Laramie is homophobic—it’s “just not that kind of place.” However, one student—a Muslim girl named Zubaida Ula (Leslie Rith-Najarian ’12)—disagrees. “We need to own this crime,” she said. “We are like this.” Although Ula was referring specifically to Laramie, her words can be applied more broadly to the current American social culture, and they inspire the audience to become aware of these prejudices in order to change them.

Sixteenth century Brits sure knew how to have a good time. Their holiday “partying” traditions are showcased in “The Christmas Revels,” an annual show by production company Revels, Inc., with this year’s theme inspired by Thomas Hardy’s novels and set in Wessex, England. Playing at Sanders Theatre through Dec. 30, “Revels” includes everything from clogging to caroling to serpent playing (the serpent being a snake shaped, British musical instrument of yore). Though jaunty and lighthearted throughout, the show ultimately asks the audience to question why tradition is so easily forgotten. The show employs the talents of the Mellstock Band, Casterbridge Children, and Village Quire, musical groups that play and dress as musicians would centuries ago and who come together to preserve tradition and create a spectacle of Christmas cheer. The show ties together 33 theatrical, song, and dance numbers celebrating Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the Winter Solstice with a common plot line: the townspeople must use their acts to convince the village pastor to stop meddling with tradition. For anyone with Scroogelike tendencies, this show will be sure to dispel all negative thinking. “Revels” is bursting at the seams with Yuletide spirit, transporting the audience back to simpler times in the quaint English countryside. The balcony of Sanders Theatre is adorned with strings of evergreen to add to the festive air; children and hankie-wavers frolic upon the stage.Though not always exciting, “Revels” is consistently successful at crafting a homey, close-knit setting that conveys the feeling of the era and season. The cast of characters create a strong sense of community and aim to include the audience with their interactive caroling and dancing. The first of several joint ventures between the viewers and performers is a rendition of “O Come All Ye Faithful,” which imparts a wonderful added feeling of unity to the show.This warm sensation continues as both the vocally deficient and vocally gifted attempt to sing “The Lord of the Dance,” a catchy tune that propels the program into intermission. However, instead of having people simply stand up and leave the theatre, the “Revels” actors come gallivanting through the aisles, fetching families, and leading chains of people to the exit. These effusive personal touches add to the already buoyant and lively atmosphere in Sanders. At times, the acts can be a bit slow and similar in material, but there are other moments of pure fun and innovation found in the dances by the Pinewoods Morris Men and the clogging of Gillian Stewart.The Morris Men make several appearances, sometimes with jingle bells attached to their knees, other times with swords. Stewart demonstrated her unique clogging abilities, skillfully jumping in the air, clicking her heels together, and spreading the light-heartedness of the act, even in her heavy shoes. The Casterbridge Children, the youngest group involved, were also impressive. They held their own with the adults while harmonizing perfectly and performing old-fashioned comedic skits about animals.In addition to the acting, the fashions of the characters also made quite a statement throughout the show. Bonnets, capes, shawls, top hats, and vests were abundantly on display; all actors were impeccably clad in plain, plaid, and floral patterns.The production’s truly carefree live music was provided by the Mellstock Band and Cambridge Symphonic Brass Ensemble. From oboe beats to clarinet trills, the players are adept at creating a joyful, holiday mood with their modern and old-fashioned musical instruments. One of the main debates over tradition and change in the show emerges from the addition of a new musical instrument to the church’s store of objects: some are eager to embrace the “new-fangled harmonium” while others anxiously await its impending presence. The question of having Mummers perform a skit during the Christmas festivities is another debate over abandoning tradition for something new. As these issues are brought up, it becomes evident that “Revels” is rooting for tradition to be saved and cherished. The show itself is attempting to preserve the traditions of a time long forgotten, demonstrating that the joys of the holiday season transcend hundreds of years and thousands of miles.The program embodies a jubilant lightheartedness of celebration that is best appreciated when experienced with family, rather than college-age friends. It takes everyone back in time, but remains more quaint than edgy. Even so, with talented actors leading rounds of “Alleluia” and members of the audience cheerily singing along, “Revels” has proved itself worthy of being a tradition in itself.

Flowers are placed upside-down in a vase, a mouse drags a dead cat, and laundry is doused by a watering can; a cast member climbs a curtain that appears too weak to hold his weight and another falls into holes that aren’t really there. “Aurélia’s Oratorio” is full of such bizarre moments, which combine to create a poetic and wonderful production. Aurélia Thierrée’s practically one-woman show, written and directed by Victoria Thierrée Chaplin and running at the American Repertory Theatre through Jan. 3, is a surreal evening of intricate choreography, acrobatics, and optical illusion. At the start of “Oratorio,” the stage is dominated by its red velvet curtain and a large chest of drawers, offering little hint of the spectacle to come. Shortly after the house lights dim, though, a voicemail message plays in French and the top-left drawer opens. A pale, lithe arm extends into the darkness, a lit cigarette in its hand.The next few minutes are simultaneously hilarious, disturbing, and beautiful, and they aptly set the tone for the rest of the show. An impossible series of limbs reach out from within the drawers to dress each other, light a candle, and pour wine. Finally, Aurélia emerges from the center drawer. It seems too easy to cite Thierrée’s family as an influence, but the comparison is inevitable. Her grandfather is Charlie Chaplin, and her great-grandfather Eugene O’Neill. “Aurélia’s Oratorio” is itself the brainchild of Thierrée’s mother, Victoria Thierrée Chaplin, who is widely considered to be responsible for the rebirth of the modern circus. In what may be a family tradition, the play is largely wordless, except for Martinez repeatedly calling Aurélia’s name. This, combined with the plaintive male tones of the phone message that precedes the show, vaguely suggests an unexplored romantic storyline. The “Oratorio” would benefit from choosing one of two directions—either further developing the underlying plot or abandoning the storyline altogether and indulging in pure imagery. The common thread of these spectacles is one of reversal and of questioning impossibility. But the conceit never grows stilted or predictable. Sure, the idea of someone walking on her hands isn’t particularly unique in and of itself, but in “Aurélia’s Oratorio,” the figure also carries a hat and purse on her elevated feet. There is a strong sense of wonder to the production, but it maintains a dark undercurrent that makes it more the stuff of Edward Gorey than Dr. Seuss.And so “Aurélia’s Oratorio” manages to stay pitch-perfect, with a few exceptions. In one of the weaker moments, a disco ball appears onstage, and the generally unobtrusive score switches to an accordion-inflected circus song with fairly raunchy lyrics. The segment is too patently weird, and it belies the elegant and understated nature of the rest of the production. But even here there is a moment of genius; with the aid of creative costuming, Martinez bends over to appear as both the male and female lower halves of a pair of dancers.Another highlight comes when Aurélia’s head is quite cleverly made the star of a puppet show for...puppets. But the puppets’ appearances extend beyond that vignette and become a little too creepy. Their presence seems random and not as satisfyingly counterintuitive as the Oratorio’s other reversals—like when Aurélia buys an ice cream cone that’s boiling hot.One of the most interesting parts of the show was the varying responses elicited by each of Aurélia’s feats. One particularly stunning trick inspired both the collective gasp of the audience and the persistent guffawing of solitary man.As the show deserved, though, the audience response was overwhelmingly positive, if somewhat difficult to verbalize. I found the reaction of the woman sitting in front of me to be appropriately vague in its enthusiasm: “That was...awesome.”

Ballet enthusasists track the passage of time in terms of a ballet company’s spring season, winter season, and “The Nutcracker.” For those folks who instead rely on a calendar, the general consensus is that the opening night of “The Nutcracker” is the official beginning of the string of ensuing holidays. It is a time capsule of magic, warmth, and joy—for adults, a foray into childhood and innocent dreams; for children, an escape into an extraordinary land in which one can be transported by hot-air balloon into the Land of Sweets where imagination can triumph. It is virtually impossible to destroy, thanks to its timeless Tchaikovsky score—the “Sugarplum Fairy” variation surely has a higher play count than even the most standard of Christmas tunes—and its precious characters. Thankfully, Mikko Nissinen, artistic director of Boston Ballet, has not ventured into the common practice, as of late, of creating some innovative, delirious hallucinogen with no ties to the original, beautiful children’s tale that was E.T.A. Hoffman’s “The Nutcracker and the King of Mice.” In his production, which runs at the Boston Opera House through Dec. 28, Nissinen sticks, for the most part, to the tried and true formula, and the few innovations he does risk add charm to a story that will never suffer from superfluity.Nissinen surely took inspiration  for his first scene from George Balanchine’s interpretation, arguably the preeminent version stateside. There is the hustle and bustle of lavishly-dressed Christmas guests making their way to the Silberhaus home, and there is the same wind-up Harlequin and Columbine—an almost eerily perfect Melissa Hough, whose triple pirouettes, wide unblinking eyes, and general look of tart, wooden sweetness was even more ideal than that of an actual porcelain doll. Rather than a toy soldier, though, Nissinen gives a virtuoso turn to a life-size bear danced brilliantly by Paul Craig in a costume that seemed impossibly restricting until he whipped out several 180-degree split saut de chats. Josephine Pra and especially Altankhuyag Dugaraa were an entertaining Grandmother and Grandfather, respectively, each pulling out the stops with regards to various pensioner maladies. The parallels begin to fade, however, with the end of the first scene. For one thing, the fairy Godfather Drosselmeier takes on an entirely new appeal. As danced by Yury Yanowsky, he is a campy Latin Byron—a sexy sorcerer with a dark purple cape and matching tights to boot. For another, while Balanchine’s Nutcracker is in actuality Drosselmeier’s nephew, Nissinen’s Nutcracker is the much older Cavalier to the Sugarplum Fairy, come from the Kingdom of the Sweets to rescue Clara and bring her to their magical empire. This has the overall effect of simplifying the plot, but it also takes away the charm of two beautiful kids falling in love on Christmas Eve. Alexandra Heier as the young Clara more than made up for this with a sweet and amiable demeanor, and effortless movements that were the epitome of grace. The same can be said of the rest of the cast of well-schooled Boston Ballet youngsters on whom the ballet rests. The Battle of the Toy Soldiers and Mice was inventively choreographed by Daniel Pelzig. The large mice and growing Christmas tree were familiar; the Middle Eastern Mouse King who fancies dancing the Trepak, on the other hand, is an original character. But all’s well that ends well—the Mouse King is killed and the Nutcracker prevails. He takes Clara to the Enchanted Forest ruled by the Snow Queen and King, danced by Lia Cirio and Pavel Gurevich with wonderful virtuosity and panache. The sets by Helen Pond and Herbert Senn were well worth the price of admission and generated audible awe at the rise of the curtain for the second act. The second act might be the one realm in the ballet trajectory that is familiar to almost everyone. Anyone can hum along to the Russian dance, even as Jared Redick wows with a series of split jumps reaching extraordinary levels of elevation and flexibility. An implausibly hyperextended Kathleen Breen Combes in the Arabian dance was sultry and intoxicating, as was her partner, Jaime Diaz. And was there ever a Dew Drop who lived up so greatly to her name as Misa Kuranaga? Backed by a corps de ballet of lanky, tall flowers, the slight Kuranaga seemed to float among them like a drop of mist. Not every performance was as stunning, however. As the Sugar Plum Fairy, Larissa Ponomarenko was very pretty and precise, but a bit too elusive, and her chilled rapport with Roman Rykine as her Cavalier did not help. Nevertheless, there is something about seeing a glittering pink tutu and satin pink pointe shoes amidst a cornucopia of confections, delicacies, princes, and enchantment that never fails to win one over, no matter one’s age, gender, cynicism, and overall faith in the existence of magic. In a world full of not only civil strife but also “Giselles,” “Manons,” and “Romeo and Juliets,” “The Nutcracker” reveals that ballet can still bring one to a state of complete bliss and oblivion; that innocence can be found and not only interminably lost.There’s art for you.

After six years serving as masters of Winthrop House, Stephen P. Rosen and Mandana Sassanfar announced plans to step down at the end of this academic year.They informed the House community in an e-mail Wednesday, citing personal reasons for the decision.Though Winthrop residents said the announcement didn't come unexpectedly—Rosen and Sassanfar have children, some of whom will soon be attending college—they said the Masters would be missed for their warmth and welcoming nature."To me, the most important thing about them: They're just kind, normal people that you want to be around," Caitlin v.V. Crump ’10 said.In his e-mail, Rosen individually addressed sophomores, juniors, and seniors—a reflection of what Crump called Rosen and Sassanfar's emphasis on House community.The Masters serve food in their residence to undergraduates every Sunday, and they've attempted to get to know as many sophomores as they can, she said."People in the House like them because they do more than manage the House—they try to know and become friends with the students," Stephen R. Barchick '09 said.Rosen, the Beton Michael Kaneb Professor of National Security and Military Affairs, is perhaps more widely known for his career accomplishments, which span academia and government.He has advised national military organizations—serving as the Director of Political-Military Affairs in the National Security Council and participating in the Gulf War Air Power Survey—and has written numerous award-winning books, including Winning the Next War: Innovation and the Modern Military.Sassanfar, who is a professor of biology at MIT, has delved into science education throughout her career. She is the Director of High School Science Outreach at MIT, directs the Massachusetts Junior Academy of Science, and consulted with the Massachusetts Department of Education from 2000 to 2001.But Rosen and Sassanfar aren't just fixtures in academic settings. They both sit in on House Committee meetings, which are run by undergraduates, and provide input, often about raising funds for HoCo projects.Barchick, the outgoing HoCo secretary, said the House community will miss Rosen and Sassanfar's active participation in House life."I know they have a really difficult job, managing a lot of different things," he said. "But they've been doing a good job for the past six years, and people have been really pleased."The Masters are also self-professed Strauss Cup aficionados. In fact, Rosen alluded to the intramural grand prize in his e-mail."[J]ust a warning: nobody graduates if we do not win the Strauss Cup (soon to be in the display case in the dining hall) again this year," he wrote.According to Crump, who was commissioned by the Masters to spend last summer making artwork for Winthrop, Rosen and Sassanfar have made an effort to place art throughout the House, especially when it is Winthrop-centric.Rosen and Sassanfar's departure announcement follows Pforzheimer House Masters Sue and James J. McCarthy's in November.And other House Masters may soon follow suit. In an interview last month, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said more might retire in the next few years. She also said she hopes to recruit minority members of the Faculty to fill vacated positions.Neither Rosen nor Sassanfar could be reached for comment.—Staff writer Ahmed N. Mabruk can be reached at amabruk@fas.harvard.edu.
