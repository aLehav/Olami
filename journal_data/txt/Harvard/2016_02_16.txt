Let’s get this out of the way: The Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show is the greatest 13 minutes in human history. Okay, maybe second to the moon landing—that was pretty impressive. This show was the second-greatest 13 minutes in human history. I’m one hundred percent serious. An unequivocal triumph of choreography, aesthetic, production value, unabashed sentimentality, and hope, it fried whatever part of my brain is in charge of finding beauty and meaning in the world. That’s right. It’s the heroin of beauty and meaning. So get off your high horse, New York Times; if you thought Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, and Chris Martin singing “Fix You” and “Up&Up” over a montage of the greatest Halftime Show acts of the last 50 years was just more of Coldplay “fill[ing] huge spaces with blank, occasionally amiable rumble,” you really died years ago.
We at The Harvard Crimson Arts (with the exception of Music Exec Amy J. Cohn ‘18) love Coldplay, but we happily concede that the show’s first five minutes are its weakest. Sure, Chris Martin euphorically leaping around a stadium exploding in intricate color patterns is a breath of fresh air in our bleak postmodern experience, and sure, “Viva la Vida,” “Paradise,” and “Adventure of a Lifetime” are perfectly suited to this venue. But something is missing, even if we can’t quite put our finger on it.
With the first bass note of “Uptown Funk,” we realize that something was the boldness and sheer showmanship that define the best and most memorable halftime shows. With “Uptown Funk”—quite possibly the song of the decade—it becomes clear that this is not going to be just a Super Bowl Halftime Show. It is going to be the Super Bowl 50 Halftime Retrospective, a 13 minute sampling of the best America has to offer.
And then, in a burst of fireworks, behind marching-band drummers—oh my God, Beyoncé. “Okay, ladies, now let’s get in formation,” she announces to the country. After finishing the first verse, she stares down the camera with a grin that says, “I’m about to make you forget every piece of entertainment you’ve ever seen before this moment.” (She was right. To even review the first half of the show, we had to find it on YouTube, which is harder than it sounds.) Talk about “boldness and sheer showmanship.” Singing lyrics like “I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils”? Dancing like that, on grass, in heels? People call her “queen” for a reason.
Upon finishing her all-too-short segment, Beyoncé gets in a musical theater-style showdown with Bruno Mars. Like the Sharks and Jets sequence from West Side Story, each camera cut builds excitement, and each dance move is cooler than the last. When they invite Martin back, the 112 million watching at home remember that Coldplay was once involved in this show. But even if Twitter thinks he looks a bit awkward between Mars and Beyoncé, “Uptown Funk” is the perfect way to unite the disparate elements—a universal musical celebration.
But why stop at uniting just three Super Bowl acts in joyous nostalgia? Coldplay’s beautifully wimpy “Clocks” and “Fix You” then serve as sonic complements to clips of iconic moments from Super Bowl Halftimes of yore. Yes, it’s oversentimental—unless we realize that the Super Bowl is our true national holiday. Unimposed by governments, accessible to the nonreligious and religious alike, it is the only time each year that the entire country unites for one event—an increasingly rare and valuable thing in the splintering world of news feed algorithms and Netflix. And, fittingly, the great Super Bowl Halftime Shows are ones that bring us together. Even a hardened cynic, if he’s honest with himself, finds a little bit of relief from the world’s existential loneliness when Bruce Springsteen hollers, “Is there anybody alive out there?” Who doesn’t feel a little familiar comfort in Paul McCartney’s still-earnest crowd banter? Who doesn’t tear up at the classic back-to-back silhouette of Bruce and the late Clarence Clemons as Martin sings “Tears stream down your face when you lose something you cannot replace?” Michael Jackson grabbing his crotch, the Stones’ tongue-shaped stage, Bono backed by the post-9/11 American flag—these images are indelibly burned into our cultural retina. The Halftime Show is how we have all experienced our cultural heritage together for generations.
So when Martin, Mars, and the Queen sing, arms around each other, “We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower, woah,” the lyric sounds not like bombast but like genuine hope—hope that the fractures that still plague the West will heal with the salve of the music, humanity, and love we share. And perhaps to remind us that that’s possible, the camera zooms out to reveal tens of thousands of fans holding up colored cards to display a message: “Believe in love,” over a rainbow background. Maybe it was the gayest halftime show ever. It was certainly one of the best.

Chillwave may no longer still be with us, but Neon Indian, the once veritable king of the genre, is still at it, packing mid-size concert venues while exploring new-ish sonic territory. Neon Indian’s Jan. 28 show at the Paradise Rock Club, which sold out the BU-catering, Comm. Ave venue, featured a lively and energetic performance that did not disappoint the 900-some gathered audience members.
Neon Indian is the electronica project of Alan Palamo; when performing live, Palamo, who composes the music, is joined by a four-piece backing band, currently composed of Drew Erickson, Jason Faries, Jorge Palomo, Max Townsley. Palomo is a lively and charismatic frontman: He sings, dances, and occasionally plays synths or drums. He is well complemented by his band members, who perform tight, energetic, and muscular versions of his creations.
Palomo takes nostalgia as his subject and his method. While his three albums (2009’s “Psychic Chasms,” 2011’s “Era Extrana,” and 2015’s “Vega Intl. Night School) vary with regard to tone, content, and sound, all are involved in his overall project of refashioning the musical and sonic innovations of the early ’80s into contemporary-sounding pieces. His earlier work drew more heavily on the bleeps and bloops of early video games, sounds of his childhood that he spun into tracks chronicling the adventures of a slightly aimless “Terminally Chill” early adulthood—stoned summers, missed acid dates, and the like.
Given that the current tour is in support of Neon Indian’s new album, little material from the band’s first two LPs were played, to the seeming disappointment of some audience members, if overheard post-concert chatter is anything to go by. When earlier material was performed, however, the response was almost rapturous. For instance, as Palomo closed the set with a rendition of “Deadbeat Summer”: The closest thing to a hit song from his debut album “Psychic Chasms,” he often held the mike out pointing away from himself to capture the audience’s joyous singing along. Similarly, when Palomo and band returned for the encore—a two-song set that they opened with a performance of “Polish Girl,” the chip tune-ish lead single from their second album—the crowd responded with comparable excitement. For a moment, one could well imagine Neon Indian becoming a very different sort of nostalgia act. The strength of Palomo’s new material, however, suggests that this possibility is not a current probability.
Palomo’s latest release, the excellent “Vega Intl. Night School,” draws on high-’80s pop, disco, and Caribbean dance music, as filtered through the lens of a Carnival Fantasy Cruise. It is a more obviously adult album than his previous two, with its explicit sexuality and interest in exploring urban rather than suburban landscapes and the audience responded in kind. There was much quaffing of PBR, and from the balcony one could spy the odd plume of vapor wafting up above one head or another.
This party-like atmosphere attests to the nature of Palomo’s most recent music. While Palomo’s latest offering is certainly sexed-up compared to his first two releases, the elfin Palomo rarely performs with an overt physical sensuality. His shoulders seem to be the locus of his bodily energy and the center of his movement. When he dances, he begins by hunching over a bit and then beginning to sway these shoulders—the rest of his body following suit, especially his arms, which he swings gleefully akimbo, elbows flying proudly, defiantly out. When he is especially absorbed in a song, he lets the movement go a little further down, sometimes even into his hips, or even lower—he is prone to the odd spot of fancy footwork. His dancing is not of the stereotypically sexy variety, if you will, but rather dad dancing par excellence, as fine as anything Drake has offered up lately. It’s defiantly uncool in a way that is, of course, wonderfully cool. In this way, Palomo uses his physical presence to temper the loucheness of his new material with a goofy, comic sweetness.
This makes sense, as in many ways Palomo’s latest music can be understood as a childhood or nostalgia-inflected envisioning of adulthood and adult sexuality. The kind of seamy masculinity that Palamo performs through his new music is inherently a little sweetly silly, a little comic. In this way, Palamo seemed to have much in common with one of his set pieces—a cardboard cutout of an anthropomorphized saxophone leaned up against a brick wall, with a tongue lolling out cartoonishly. As a result, some of the most affecting moments of the evening were those in which he blended a graphic adult sexuality with a more nostalgic romantic innocence. As he sang in his final closing song, “News From the Sun”: “We're all just waiting for something,….Till love touches you like a hand in the dark.”

“I just had a lot of laughs in me, man,” Robin Baytas says, his laughter echoing those of his three other bandmates. The four make up Great on Paper, a local band that derives its music from jazz and just released their debut album. The topic currently eliciting their amusement is the rehearsed introduction that they are delivering to the camera. As the band members chuckle, classical music seeps through the walls of a corridor in the New England Conservatory. Despite the orchestra’s considerable volume, the members of Great on Paper continue to capture all attention during the interview with their vibrant dialogue and interactions—a dynamism that carries into their songs.

Great on Paper is a self-described “improvised four-person party that goes into musical situations without an exit strategy.” The group met each other about five years ago at the NEC when the members first began their partnership by holding informal jams. After auditioning into the NEC Honors Ensemble program in 2013, however, they moved to more serious work as a team, even teaching some masterclasses. While structurally a traditional jazz quartet, the members do not label their music as exclusively jazz, giving little thought to classifications. “I don’t know if we think too much in terms of genre,” saxophonist Kevin Sun ’14, a former FM exec, says.
Bassist Simón Willson agrees. “We’re just thinking in terms of ‘is this good or bad,’” he says. “Sometimes we try stuff that’s not very good. Sometimes we try stuff that is successful. We don’t really get stuck on the semantics, but more of the idea of sound.”
The exact nature of this sound is difficult to pinpoint, partly due to the wide range of musical interests held by the individual bandmembers. Willson prefers the older forms of jazz, including bebop and ragtime, while Baytas and Sun like listening to current mainstream jazz. And what makes Great on Paper successful is its ability to use these distinctions to drive its music. “There’s some common ground [musically] for sure,” Baytas says. “But there’s definitely a lot of differences that each person has.... We bring that together, and over time, our friendship and trust in the musical setting allows us to feel more comfortable.
“A good analogy is the idea of democracy,” Willson says. “We do a lot of different things, and depending on who wrote the piece, it’s like venturing in a different world… but we’re all going in the same direction.”
The band’s philosophy regarding music becomes evident when considering their eponymously titled debut album. Recorded in March 2015, the album came together under unconventional circumstances. After receiving a sudden offer from a recording studio, with only three to four days’ notice, the members immediately booked tickets to New York to perform. “We hadn’t really played a gig together since the fall, so we just threw all of this music together, came to the studio, and hit record,” Sun says.
The result is a mishmash of various compositions that speak to the eclectic style of Great on Paper. For instance “Torsion,” described in the digital booklet as a “heraldic melody” that represents “real modern jazz,” epitomizes the band’s investment in creative camaraderie—one in which members build on one another’s quirks and talents for expression. According to Isaac Wilson, the quartet’s pianist and the composer for “Torsion,” he wrote the song with Baytas in mind. “The anchor of the piece is this vamp that Robin really just shines over,” he says. “It’s a bass figure that has a lot of chords in it, and there’s a drum solo at the end…. Every time we play, [the song] can be an explosion of drumming.”
And then there is the band’s rendition of “I Hear a Rhapsody,” an addition as unexpected as the album’s formulation itself. As the story goes, with some time left in the recording studio, the members suddenly started performing the song. It was an impromptu occurrence, the origins of which remain unknown.
“Did you call it?” Sun asks Wilson.
Wilson responds, “Who called it?”
Such moments, which abound whenever the band discusses its music, only affirm the spirit that defines Great on Paper. It is a spirit of growth and awareness among the band members—one that favors spontaneity and fosters creative adaptation of the jazz tradition. “What this band is great at is going beyond what is on the page, creating stuff that totally lifts beyond the materials that we originally start with,” Sun says. And as Great on Paper keeps collaborating and producing, it continues to prove itself a new and exciting addition to the Boston jazz scene.
“Great on Paper” was released on Feb. 11 via Endectomorph Music.

The River
Charles was his name, and he acted as a barrier between Peter’s world and the other.  Very little of importance lay on the other side of the Charles: BU was there, as was Fenway and the rest of Boston outstretched. Emily and Sheldon were out there, and Federico’s friends whom Peter had met over the summer on an excursion to Machine, but they crossed over often enough. “Stay there,” he seemed to say as he washed down his muddy banks toward elsewhere. “Safe. There. Home.” People jumped off the Weeks Bridge to prove something—jumped into the Charles. Every time Peter passed the river, his heart shivered, temporarily submerged in the chill of the surging water. He remembered how Virginia had done it.

The House
The room was perfect, but they needed a calendar. Raquel would buy one from Staples tomorrow, like the one the girls downstairs had pinned up last year—large, with a floral border that reminded Peter of church programs. Two common rooms, seven bedrooms, one connecting bathroom between the common spaces. Gabriel screamed as he ran between the rooms, Snapchatting voraciously, “Welcome to paradise!” While Samson and Michael were searching for poster gum, Peter snuck into the bathroom and twisted the nozzles of both showers. Water flowed plentifully,  to his giddy delight, and he kept it running for a few minutes. It was wasteful and eccentric, but he wasn’t in California anymore, Toto.
“N+2 housing,” a friend would explain to them later. “As sophomores? Fucking fantastic!”
“The best thing about living here is that you don’t have to look at it,” another would laugh, pouring Fireball into a shot glass shaped like a camera lens. Peter felt the gravel-lined window of his single. His window looked out onto the courtyard, at its centerpiece: The large tree encircled by a hexagonal bench. Over the next few weeks, the leaves would all change from deep green to vibrant red. The crown jewel of the house was a ruby.

Noah
Peter sat in the hammock pretending that he didn’t recognize the limp red futon being transferred across the courtyard towards the elevator. Sam Spade was being implicated by the police yet again, and Peter was desperately interested. He pretended not to notice that Noah’s mom had dyed her hair in another attempt at disguising her graying roots. He pretended not to realize that his father was probably still at home recovering from knee surgery. He pretended not to make eye contact with Noah. Peter swung and forced himself down the whale’s throat, skin sticky from the September heat, into the intrigue of Maltese falcons. There was an entire department at this college formed around the concept that, if we don’t learn from it, history is bound to repeat itself. Peter thought of the many nights he spent in high school staring at an open APUSH book, too tired and removed to comprehend it. Repetition is the highest form of flattery, he thought to himself.

The Text That Evening
Noah: Hey, sorry, I was getting settled so I didn’t have time to say hello, k? Talk soon.
Peter: (two hours later) Did you move in today? I thought juniors couldn’t til tmoro. Anyway, welcome back to campus!

Babel Storage Co.
Delilah and Uriel were the last to arrive—on the same flight from New York. They stood in the center of the common room and marveled at their luck, ignoring their towers of storage boxes. It’s so big! We have couches! Three more years! Both women went around the room hugging the other five roommates, who had all congregated in the common room. As they disassembled the towers, their excitement built into a single cacophony. Language did not matter now, only their oneness.
“Watch the the doorstop,” Peter shouted over Delilah’s box. “The bedroom doors lock if you close them.”
“Peter,” Delilah said, turning and looking up at him through warm, hazel eyes. “I’ve missed your voice so much.”

Keys to the Kingdom
“Can you grab my keys? They’re in front of my mirror.” Raquel quietly tapped her boot on their door. The other four were already at the restaurant. Peter ran upstairs, struggling to get his arm through his jacket, stretching his open palm and the dangling crimson lanyard towards her.  “Actually, can you hold them? These pants don’t have pockets and I’d like not to bring a bag.”
“Sure, as long as we’re coming back together—”
“Women’s pants are dumb,” Uriel announced, ascending the final step. “We should just wear slacks, always.”
“I can hold your keys too.”
“Would you?”
“Shall we?”

4 A.M., Two Weeks Later
Peter entered and saw them first in the steamed bathroom mirror. Her hands were full of his hair. The water was running. Peter dropped his keys.

For many, Amazon’s “Transparent” is a televisual revelation of what has for so long remained hidden. I’m inclined to agree, but not for the reason most people would expect. To me, “Transparent,” beyond portraying poignant stories of LGBTQ+ identity, looks more deeply and fully into Jewish identity than almost any show I’ve seen on TV.
Jill Soloway’s story about a trans woman’s journey through changing notions of family and identity is beautifully told, if flawed in some ways. “Transparent” traces the aftereffects of a retired political science professor’s coming out, weaving in the personal and sexual struggles of her family. Telling the story of a trans woman so openly is important, but the casting of a cis man to play her is questionable at the very least. But that’s a larger issue that would take far more than a single column to address.
The scenes that have stuck with me most since binging “Transparent” over winter break are not its multitudes of powerful queer female scenes (though the scene in which Ali, Maura’s capricious youngest daughter, makes out with Carrie Brownstein in a bowling alley is certainly one for the annals of queer TV history). The moment that most captivates me is a deeply personal moment completely independent of discussions of sexuality.
In a library doing research, Ali begins to explain to best-friend-turned-girlfriend Syd that Jewish women were forced in the middle ages to wear very specific kinds of shoes to identify them. She furthers this discussion with the concept of epigenetics--the idea that trauma can be generationally transmitted. In a later episode, Ali sees herself wearing these very shoes in a living embodiment of the epigenetic trauma in her history.
It is this simple moment that fully drew me into this world. While of course I, as a bisexual woman, relate to the Pfefferman women’s struggles with sexuality, it was in this distinctly Jewish moment that I saw myself on screen. This confluence of past and present, this strange yet immediate sense of history, this ease of the incorporation of trauma into a current reality, this lightheartedness with which it is sometimes addressed—these are the tableaux that perfectly capture the subjective feel of modern Jewish identity.
Until this show, I hadn’t realized that much of what was being depicted on television simply wasn’t aligning with my experiences. I’ve seen Jewish characters, certainly— Willow from “Buffy,” Monica and Ross of “Friends,” Paris from “Gilmore Girls” —but these characters are Jewish in name only, their religious identities used only to support the occasional quip or crack about family. Their Judaism is otherwise irrelevant to the essences of their characters.
The question of Jewish identity has been on my mind a lot recently. It’s not just a religion, not just an ethnicity, not just a culture. It is all of these and more, marinated in thousands of years of persecution and the inevitable collective consciousness that develops in the face of that persecution. Jews operate distinctly in the world, these operative methods manifesting even more strongly in groups. The Jewish family is an entity unto itself, and it is one frequently neglected by mainstream television.
The Pfeffermans were the first TV family I saw that looked like mine. The perpetually chaotic gatherings punctuated with Yiddish, the discussions of theology, the jokes—these all looked familiar. I’d seen these images before. The Pfeffermans perfectly capture the limbo faced by many American Jews: an uncertainty about the proper performance of ritual combined with a reverence for it, the pressure to assimilate while remaining distinctly tribalistic, the struggle to reconcile centuries of history with a present that is still not sure what to do with you.
“Transparent” succeeds in portraying Jews where other shows fail for one main reason. It allows them to interact. Judaism is an inherently communal, interactive identity. To portray a Jew alone is to show them missing limbs; the picture is incomplete. For much of my life, I have lived in such isolation, a Jew in a sea of Texas Christians. The joy I feel in communities of Jews is a joy of actualization. I am able to enter fully into my identity and revel in it. I become more than jokes about my nose or uncomfortable moments with friends who say I’m going to hell. Jewishness is interplay. It is the talk of G-d and the banter between Jews. It is the uncertainty about a prayer’s proper melody and the quiet moments following the kaddish. Judaism is performed, and it is performed collaboratively.
There is a game Jews like to play: As soon as we met another Jew, we start asking if they know this person from this place, etc. and so on. Jewish geography, it’s called. It is timeless proof of the theory that all Jews are in some way connected. Perhaps that’s why I have a love for the Pfeffermans that runs deeper than I can explain. Perhaps we’re just a degree or two of separation apart.

Around 500 students gathered in Sanders Theatre on Friday for a two-hour-long discussion on arts and education between Drew G. Faust, President of Harvard University, and Conan O’Brien ’85, late-night host, 1985 Harvard College graduate, and former Mather House resident. O’Brien certainly cracked a few jokes—but he also offered more serious advice to students based on his experiences at Harvard and in the entertainment industry.
Although he encouraged students to pursue their passions, when asked about the pressure to do something more grandiose with a Harvard education, O’Brien commented that it is best to seek a balance between academic endeavors and the arts. “We don't want all of our best and brightest to be coming up with funny ideas and sketches,” he said. “But I think those things sort themselves out: People that are meant to be doing [creative work] end up doing it.”
O’Brien also discussed the question of funding for arts education. “Art sometimes flourishes when it is not fed that much,” he said. However, he said that opportunities in entertainment and the arts at Harvard—especially his own active role in the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, as an undergraduate—helped start him on his own career. “Harvard is always going to have a great arts program,” he said. O’Brien added that a wide-ranging education is crucial to the development of students and said that he would not encourage his own children to focus only on the arts while in college. “I want my kids to receive the same kind of [broad] education I did,” he said.
In keeping with his emphasis on the importance of breadth in education, O’Brien admitted that his biggest regret during his Harvard career was never having taken an economics class because he was intimidated by it, and he advised the audience to not follow his example. “Liberate yourself a little bit,” he said. “Allow for mistakes; allow for problems. I’ve had my career blow up on me about two different times, and I’m still here and quite grateful and learned a lot during those moments and wouldn’t really change a thing about any of it.”
O’Brien also made reference to the insecurities that many students feel at Harvard. “I think [that at] Harvard, as great as it is—and no one is telling you this, it’s just subliminal—students too often think, ‘I have to do great things, and I need to succeed,’” he said. “You just have to be willing to screw up and not freak out when you do screw up, because you will survive.”
Instead, O’Brien encouraged students to try new pursuits and to accept difficulties. “College is when you should actually get about as lost as you can get, in terms of expanding what you know,” he said. “Go places. Think about things that you would not normally think about.” He added that even success does not cause insecurities to disappear. “It’s an illusion that people in my situation have figured something out. It is a constant struggle,” he said.

"One paints and one draws to learn to see people, to see oneself,” Pablo Picasso said in 1956. The newest exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, “Visiting Masterpieces: Pairing Picasso,” offers viewers an opportunity to experience the many ways in which Picasso saw people.  The exhibition, which opened on Feb. 13, combines works on loan from private collections and from the Foundation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland. The exhibition successfully brings into focus both Picasso’s fascination with the human form and the diversity of pictorial styles that he developed to represent it.
The exhibition brought into conversation two distinct contexts in which Picasso represented the human form: his personal relationships and his political activism. The gallery contained paintings, drawings, and sculptures of women in Picasso’s life, including his lovers Françoise Gilot, Marie-Thérèse Walter, Fernande Olivier, and Dora Maar. These women served as the inspiration for many of his works, and the exhibition gives works depicting these women a prominent place. Particularly of interest were the two paintings of Gilot, and a sculpture and sketch depicting Olivier. The two representations of Gilot, “Woman at the Window” and “Head of a Woman,” both painted in 1952, initially seem to depict the same pensive woman. Yet the placement of the works next to each other also invites the viewer to look longer and deeper, searching for subtle differences in expression or points of similarity. In the two works depicting Olivier, the viewer confronts the same woman represented in vastly different media. The sculpture, “Head of a Woman” of 1909, gives a three-dimensional view of the head as a concrete form in space that the viewer can see from multiple perspectives. The sketch, “Fernande Olivier,” executed in 1905-1906, is by contrast much simpler and less fully realized, but seems to come to life in its own remarkable way.
A highlight of the exhibition were the two paintings revealing Picasso’s more political side: “Rape of the Sabine Women” of 1962, and another painting of the same title and subject from 1963. The exhibition presents these paintings as statements against the political turmoil and Cold War hostilities of the 1960s. The gallery thus sets up an interesting contrast between Picasso’s representations of the women he loved and his response to darker aspects of human life. They reflect Picasso’s interest in representing the communal as well as the personal aspects of human experience, and his investment in giving visual form to the suffering and loss associated with war. In the version from 1962, Picasso uses a limited and dark-toned color palette to depict the people within the composition. In the 1963 version, however, Picasso’s use of more colors and more defined shapes brings into sharper focus the anguish of the women and children.
“One cannot truly follow the creative process except through a series,” Picasso said in 1964. This exhibition offers viewers a valuable opportunity to follow Picasso’s creative process through his series, through subjects and sources of inspiration to which the artist returned multiple times. The viewer has the chance to chart Picasso’s own artistic development, to see visual evidence of his constant experimentation, and to marvel at the infinite permutations of color, line, and texture in his exploration of the human form.

“You can never write a novel—or do anything in art—without some pressing concern from now,” novelist Colm Tóibín says, sitting on the other side of a coffee table from Claire Messud, novelist and professor in Harvard’s English Department. A prolific author, Tóibín has written eight novels, including “Brooklyn,” which has recently generated a buzz of publicity due to its well-received Academy Award-nominated movie adaptation. On Monday, Feb. 8, the Mahindra Humanities Center presented the talk between Messud and Tóibín at the Harvard Art Museums as the inaugural event of their “Writers Speak” series, which brings prominent writers to Harvard to talk about the craft and their own work.
Messud offered an informative introduction to Tóibín’s work, which was followed by Tóibín’s reading of his work in progress. The event concluded with a conversation-style question and answer session between them. Messud praised Tóibín highly in her introduction: She spoke of his generosity of spirit, which extends to the portrayals of characters within his novels. Tóibín’s novels are often dark and complex, but Messud contended that he accepts his characters’ flaws and portrays them in such a way that the reader can accept them too. She described his style as patient and classically simple. Finally, she noted that while she didn’t want to cause his head to swell, she believed his work warrants description as a genius.
Tóibín then read extensively from a work in progress, a version of the story of Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, Electra and Orestes. This reworking of historical material echoes his 2012 novella “The Testament of Mary,” which employed a similar style. He noted that he did not want to compete with existing narratives, so his interest in this particular story was guided by a gap spanning about a decade in Orestes’ whereabouts before he returns in Electra. In his own own rendition of the myth, Tóibín tried to play out a central, compelling question: the battle between people who believe that autonomous free will guides human decisions and those who do not. According to Tóibín, any story, no matter how old, has continuing relevance as long as a present, central concern guides it.
In the question and answer session, Tóibín delved further into his beliefs about what drives the production of novels. “I don’t believe in anything,” he said when humorously describing his stint on an Irish late-night TV show called “The Meaning of Life.” “I see chaos, not order, and even when I see order I’m not sure it comes from anything other than nature itself,” he said. Tóibín said that the novel is an inherently secular space.  Even though the section of his work that he read operates within the realm of Greek mythology, he said that it is the human aspect of loss—paired with his lack of belief in an afterlife—that holds his creative attention and captivates him deeply.
Continuing his discussion of the driving questions behind his work, Tóibín said that there are probably only one or two things that interest a particular person. Authors, he said, just vary the tone of their most fundamental concerns in each new work they write.  He described how the idea for his most recent novel, “Nora Webster,” came from watching his mother in the years following his father’s death and from his subsequent need to preserve the emotions he saw in her, which he knew would fade. “It isn’t as though writing novels is a form of therapy,” Tóibín said, with perhaps a hint of irony.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Deadpool” is very much a Marvel film. It contains the same barely subverted damsel-in-distress trope, poorly developed villain, and barest skeleton of a plot that have always characterized the superhero movie cookie cutter. Whereas in an “Avengers” film these elements would account for a good three quarters of the movie, in “Deadpool,” they are refreshingly insignificant in the face of the film’s overwhelming focus: Deadpool himself. Cut out every frame of the film that does not feature Deadpool (perhaps T. J. Miller’s Weasel and Leslie Uggams’s Blind Al should also be given passes), and what remains, over 90% of the movie, is much nearer the quality of “Daredevil” or “Jessica Jones” than any other Marvel film has been—witty, gritty, and incredibly inventive.
The lion’s share of the credit goes to Ryan Reynolds. Not only did he fight to grant the film an R rating—without which “Deadpool” would have lost a great deal of its appeal—but in a role as the titular character, he sheds his heartthrob reputation and proves himself a genuinely good actor with impressive comic delivery. His dialogue is a constant stream of sarcastic jokes and fourth wall-breaking, but nevertheless Reynolds does an impressive job of modulating the tone and emotional valence of his delivery. This versatility is most evident while Wade Wilson is undergoing torture in order to awaken the supernatural abilities that will ultimately enable him to become Deadpool. He never stops poking fun at his torturer, but his delivery and expressions reveal how affected he is when he hears another victim wheeled away, presumably to his death. Deadpool is inherently a sympathetic character because of the way in which he lampoons his genre and establishes camaraderie with his audience, but Reynolds elevates that connection to an entirely different plane.
Nor is this lampooning itself inconsequential—when Deadpool lampshades the trappings of the superhero genre, he is making the film’s worst qualities almost bearable. Particularly disappointing is Ajax, the “big bad”: He is impressively one-dimensional, and his motivations are entirely inscrutable. Each time Deadpool teases Ajax for his real name, Francis, and the absurdity of his chosen alias (“He got Ajax off a dishwashing liquid!”), Ajax himself becomes markedly less groan-worthy. Similarly, the stereotypical romance included in the film is trite and boring from a storytelling perspective, but the interactions between Wade and his girlfriend, Vanessa, are actually quite refreshing. An entertaining and memorable sequence early in the film shows Wade and Vanessa having sex on various holidays and culminates in a role reversal that is infrequently shown in movies—“Happy International Women’s Day,” says Vanessa. Though admittedly crude, the moment shows willingness to transcend the traditional boundaries of superhero films. The frequent references made to Reynolds’s prior appearances in Marvel films, too, work well and reward comic fans for enduring the horrible “Green Lantern” and “X-Men Origins: Wolverine” to arrive at a film as well executed as “Deadpool.”
Granted, the average superhero movie is fun, but it is also rather far from good cinema in every aspect. “Deadpool” is certainly not a universally fantastic movie in the same way “Jessica Jones” is a universally fantastic show, as the film too heavily relies on standard action tropes––the threatened romance, the cartoonish villain––to tell its story. Luckily, with its innovative storytelling techniques and enthusiastic leads, “Deadpool” far surpasses all of Marvel’s other silver screen attempts. While Deadpool’s creators are primarily responsible for his originality and unique appeal, Ryan Reynolds and director Tim Miller deserve acknowledgement for their faithful representation of the character and successful execution of the ever-tricky page-to-film adaptation.

To the editor:
The views recounted in Molly Roberts’s recent pieces on Hillary Clinton and millennials are deeply disappointing. This is not purely a gender issue; rather it reflects a failure by young women and men to appreciate history, the difficulty in achieving progress, and the tentativeness of success.
Abortion was illegal in most states until Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 shortly before I graduated. Gender discrimination in hiring and compensation was commonplace. The few women who succeeded in climbing male-dominated ladders did so at huge personal sacrifice. They overcame great hostility and gave up much in the process. If today these gray-haired citizens have amassed some money after all they have done, they should not be criticized for it. They earned every dime many times over.
Progress is not linear. No immutable law protects the gains women and men have won over the past decades. Every Republican presidential candidate wants to reverse advances progressives have achieved over the past 50 years. Our country is one or two Supreme Court appointments away from a return to the 1950s. Many members of the House and Senate are already there.
Progress is incremental. Incrementalism is not as much fun as revolution. Revolutions don't tend to happen in countries like ours because people are careful, thoughtful, and concerned about unexpected consequences. Income inequality is a very serious problem, as is the dominance of money in politics. But these problems will not go away simply by political fiat or by politicians demonizing specific groups, be they immigrants, Muslims or Wall Streeters. We could try to deport all illegal immigrants, ban all Muslims, and break up the banks (at a loss of thousands of good jobs for college-educated Millennials). But simplistic "solutions" like those won't succeed.
My grandmother was a suffragette. She practiced law in New York City before she could vote. Those who worked hard to make the successes of the past 100 years a reality deserve our respect. I put Hillary Clinton in that group. She doesn't want to get rid of government like the Republicans or double its size as Senator Bernie Sanders has suggested. She wants to work with what we have to make it better and preserve the gains that have been achieved. As far as I'm concerned, it's got nothing at all to do with gender.

If you told me five months ago that I would dedicate an hour of my life to streaming a motionless fashion show on my brand new Tidal subscription, I would have shown concern for your health. I neither understand nor truly care about high fashion. Despite my undying devotion to Jay Z, I think that Tidal amounts to little more than a cash grab from a group of super rich artists. Yet on one beautiful Thursday, Kanye put the world on notice that he defines the culture.
Yeezy Season 3 is Kanye’s heat check. Commonly used to refer to basketball players in the middle of a hot streak, a heat check is when someone tests the limits of their momentum. In Kanye’s case, “The Life of Pablo” and Yeezy Season 3 test the grip of Kanye’s stranglehold on the public consciousness. After dominating Twitter for weeks, performing on SNL, and finally releasing a finished album, Kanye just put up a three from the logo and started jogging back with his hands raised to the heavens like Swaggy P.
At this point in his career, Kanye has truly outgrown comparison. As a culture, we do not genuinely have the appropriate frame of reference for Kanye. No artist has transcended his or her art to dominate a new one like Kanye does. While many cringe at his self-comparisons to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs, only these figures have managed to fundamentally alter their fields as Kanye has.
Lets take a step back to truly appreciate the significance of Yeezy Season 3. Simply selling out Madison Square Garden for a marquee concert would qualify as an artist’s greatest accomplishment. But Kanye sold out MSG for a fashion show in the middle of a brutal New York winter. Unlike most high fashion designers, Kanye welcomed the masses into the world of fashion week.
Many artists, rappers in particular, have become moguls before. Jay Z and Diddy are just two rappers who have parlayed musical success into fashion lines. But none have managed to break into the highly exclusive world of high fashion. Basketball players have sported sneakers named after them for decades, but few had any role in the designing process. The mere fact that Kanye has broken these barriers puts him in a category all his own.
On Thursday, Kanye exhibited complete control and comfort while orchestrating an incredibly complex production. All at once, the show displayed the larger-than-life quality to Kanye and made it feel like we had the privilege of sitting in on his studio session. As Tidal continued to crash from the enormous site traffic, Kanye conducted the mass listening party more like a summer cookout amongst friends. In an oversized long sleeve and with all his famous friends, Kanye simply rolled into MSG and hopped on the AUX cord as if the presentation was not the most anticipated musical events of the year so far.
And while the show was billed as an album debut, “The Life of Pablo” was only part of a much broader experience. After watching the show, I had little to no idea how I felt about the album, and I certainly could not distinguish between any of the songs.
After dedicating the better half of a long weekend to listening to the album, I think it’s utterly forgettable. Potential classics like “Ultra Light Beam,” “Real Friends,” and “No More Parties in LA” mark high points on an album that feels otherwise lackluster and disjointed. A potent combination of a lack of topical depth and lyrical sparseness makes it clear that Kanye focused more on the production than rapping, which is perfectly fine. By no stretch of the imagination is the album bad. I simply do not see myself listening to it in three months. But even this seems besides the point. Music has not only become secondary to the genius of Kanye, but his sheer cultural control will likely make this album significant anyway.
Far more than just playing the album for the world, Kanye manufactured a moment with himself squarely as the focus. For over an hour, Kanye held us all enraptured as he molded culture. Kanye may have finally begun the paradigm shift away from pigeonholing artists into small boxes that he has so loudly advocated. Today, he designs the hottest sneakers in the game, has the most heavily hyped album released of the year, convinced 20 million people to stream a fashion show on a service most of them had to take the time to download, and married into the most successful reality TV family in the country. Considering Mr. West a rapper alone for the first time seems irrefutably inaccurate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The battle over the relationship between drinking and campus social ills reemerged at Harvard last week when Mather House banned hard alcohol consumption in its Junior Common Room, a frequent campus party space, with a goal of making parties “safer.” Students and House administrators met in the wake of this decision, but the House heads and resident dean implemented the policy without first consulting students.
While encouraging safer parties is clearly an important goal, we believe that Mather erred in both the conception and implementation of this initiative. Banning hard alcohol is not likely to lead to safer partying, and the decisions to enact such a ban demands far more student input than occurred in this case.
It is no secret that the College faces serious problems with student social spaces. The entrenched presence of final clubs and the lack of similarly well-appointed alternatives both on campus and off make for a less than ideal social dynamic.
Over the past two years, Harvard administrators have acknowledged as much, particularly by focusing on Harvard’s exclusive off-campus social spaces and promoting more inclusive alternatives. Mather’s new ban on hard alcohol in its JCR, however, will only impede the creation of the inclusive social settings that its authors are striving to promote.
For better or worse, hard alcohol plays a significant role in college social life. Banning its consumption in the Mather JCR will discourage students from hosting parties there and work against the growing desire for a thriving, House-centered social experience. This result is especially concerning given the College’s emphasis on the House system as a pillar of students’ social experiences. If true to its values, Harvard should be looking to bolster the House social experience rather than limit it.
Granted, hard alcohol brings with it serious safety concerns. But if anything, the safest places for consumption are House common spaces. These are often more easily accessible for security and in view of other students. Alternative drinking spaces, such as students’ dorm rooms, pose much greater risk.
Beyond the substantive issues of Mather's new policy, the decision to devise and announce it without soliciting student input is also concerning. Students are at the forefront of this issue and  have a significant stake in any initiative that seeks to regulate on campus social life. Consultation after the fact is no substitute for making students partners in the decision making process.
Ultimately, Mather's more limited hard alcohol ban shares the same basic flaws of sweeping policies at peer institutions like Dartmouth: It risks making student alcohol consumption more unsafe, not less. At Harvard, this policy also discourages the use of more inclusive social venues. In the future, we hope that administrators will be skeptical of such changes, and at the very least consult students before adopting initiatives which may undermine shared goals for campus social life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School affiliates remembered alumnus and Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia, who died Saturday at age 79, for his vibrant, fiery personality and his substantial contributions to United States law.
Scalia, an alumnus from the Law School’s class of 1960, was renowned as a leading conservative legal theorist, staunch constitutional originalist, and sharp debater who maintained close connections to the school throughout his life.
“Justice Scalia will be remembered as one of the most influential jurists in American history,” Law School Dean Martha L. Minow wrote in a statement. “He changed how the Court approaches statutory interpretation, and in countless areas introduced new ways of thinking about the Constitution and the role of the Court that will remain important for years to come.”
Then-United States President Ronald Reagan appointed Scalia to the Supreme Court in 1986 after former Chief Justice Warren Burger retired. At the time of his death, Scalia was the longest-serving member of the current court, where he presided for 29 years.
His judicial career was characterized by his strict adherence to originalism, a doctrine of constitutional interpretation based on rigid compliance with the framers’ historical intent. Scalia’s originalist opinions often aligned with conservative policies and principles, leading many to view him as a conservative icon, and he was famous for his acerbic dissents and sometimes playful, sometimes biting cross-examinations in the courtroom.
Scalia displayed his enthusiasm for intellectual sparring as a student at Harvard Law School in the late 1950s. In a Crimson article from 1986, the year he was appointed to the court, Law School classmates recounted Scalia’s work ethic, humor, and sharp intellect. Classmates said that as a student, Scalia displayed the aptitude for oral argument that would define his judicial career, as he challenged his peers to lively debates.
In recent decades, Harvard Law professors have often engaged with Scalia and his theories, publicly weighing in on his legal opinions and sometimes debating him face-to-face. Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz, who knew Scalia personally, often found himself squaring off against the justice.
“He was a very innovative, creative person. We had debates about everything,” Dershowitz said. “I disagree with almost all of his opinions, but I found him to be a formidable intellectual adversary.”
Their debates—which took place in Dershowitz’s classroom, in private letters, and in the rooms of the Supreme Court—confronted issues ranging from capital punishment to the contentious 2000 presidential election. Dershowitz said that while the two always argued, afterwards they “always talked fondly.”
“I’ll miss him personally, and I think the country will miss his intellectual contributions to the law,” Dershowitz said.
Law professor Charles Fried, who has written extensively on Scalia’s judicial stances, wrote in an email, “I knew him in so many ways over so many years.  I am very sad about this great man's death.”
In the days immediately following his death at a west Texas ranch, Law School faculty have publicly paid tribute to Scalia and analyzed his legacy. Law professor Richard Lazarus penned an op-ed in the Harvard Law Record extolling Scalia’s contributions to the art of oral argument. In a Bloomberg View piece, columnist and Law professor Noah R. Feldman wrote, “Antonin Scalia will go down as one of the greatest justices in U.S. Supreme Court history -- and one of the worst.” Law Professor Laurence H. Tribe commented in Politico Magazine, “To say that Scalia will be missed is an understatement.”
Scalia remained a faithful Law School alumnus throughout his life; Dershowitz said Scalia “felt a very deep connection to Harvard.”
The justice returned to the school several times to deliver speeches and attend events. In November 2014, he judged the school’s annual Ames Moot Court Competition and attended the inaugural address of the Scalia lecture series. The series, funded by an anonymous donor, invites legal experts each year to discuss the Constitution’s founding principles. Current Supreme Court Justice and former Law School dean Elena Kagan delivered the 2015 Scalia lecture.
In her speech several months before his death, Kagan predicted Scalia’s legacy as a justice.
“The fact of the matter is, you wake up in 100 years and most people are not going to know most of our names” Kagan said. “I think that is really not the case with Justice Scalia, whom I think is going to go down as one of the most important, most historic figures on the Court.”
In her statement following Scalia’s death, Minow emphasized her appreciation for Scalia’s contributions to the Law School.
“At Harvard Law School we are deeply grateful that he returned so often to meet with our students, to judge our moot court competitions, and — as he so loved to do — joust with law professors and students alike,” she said. “He will be greatly missed. We are so proud to host the annual Scalia lecture series, and we will honor his legacy in that way and others in the future.”

Students expecting a child in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences can now also expect far more financial support and leave time: $6,264 and 12 weeks off, to be exact.

GSAS administrators announced last week the school will ramp up its Parental Accommodation and Financial Support Program, which since 2013 had provided a stipend of $3,100 and six weeks of time off to expectant and adoptive parents.
With the intention of providing flexibility to the leave, the program will now allow students to spread 12 weeks off over the course of a year, instead of having to take the time off in one continuous block immediately after the birth or adoption of a child.
GSAS Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana wrote in an email the change resulted from a reassessment of the program and from students advocating for greater support.
To establish the initial program in 2013, administrators worked with the Graduate Student Council and Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering. McCavana said he credits the new change to feedback from graduate students.
David A. Romney, co-chair of the GSAS Student-Parents Organization, said he is pleased with the generous increase in the stipend, but said the group had not officially met with GSAS administrators and credited in large part their efforts in making the change happen.
“As far as I know, it was of their own volition. We had plans to go talk to them and kind of evaluate how things were going with the current stipend, but we hadn’t met with them yet,” Romney said. “We were just as surprised as anybody by the news.”
Romney, along with other graduate students, responded positively to the increase in parental leave time and stipend.
“We really are really grateful for this; it’s amazing,” Romney added. “And especially since they did this without any pressure from us.”
However, Ph.D. student Nancy A. Khalil, a supporter of the efforts by graduate students to unionize, said she thinks student organizations have placed some degree of pressure on GSAS.
“I think in general these efforts of organizing—including the attempt to unionize—have been putting pressure on the administration, and they as a result have started to reconsider some of the benefits that they offer grad students,” Khalil said.
Khalil gave birth to her youngest son in 2011, before the GSAS implemented the parental accommodation program.
“It was just generally physically taxing. Time-wise I felt very crunched,” she said of her time attending the school with a newborn.
McCavana said expectant and adoptive parents have used the funds on everything from “buying an airplane ticket for a grandparent to come from overseas to help at the time of birth” to “purchasing supplies and baby gear, and paying for childcare.”
Romney said he used his $3,100 stipend to cover the cost of dependent health care for his now 18-month-old daughter under the Harvard University Health Services plan.
McCavana wrote that 51 students used the program last year, and he expects a larger number this year.
“As someone who, along with my wife who was also a Ph.D student at the time, had a child while in graduate school at Harvard, I understand the importance of this program,” McCavana wrote. “I was delighted to be a part of putting it in place and now to see it expand.”
Romney said the parents group still intends to continue conversations with administrators about family matters. The group’s most pressing concerns include child care subsidies, subsidized family housing, and coverage of dependent health care. But he sees the revamped program as a major step forward.
“Harvard beforehand had been kind of lagging in this area in particular,” Romney said. “I think especially double the time [off] begins to put us on par with the policies of other graduate schools of Harvard’s caliber.”

Following the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia on Saturday, faculty from the Kennedy School of Government predicted a difficult confirmation process for whomever President Barack Obama nominates as a replacement, but were doubtful it would have a large impact on the upcoming presidential election.

Scalia’s death leaves the Supreme Court divided ideologically, with four justices who tend to vote liberal and four who tend to vote conservative.
Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen said Obama will face an “uphill battle” to get his nominee confirmed in the U.S. Senate, which Republicans currently control.
“He doesn’t have the votes,” Gergen said. “He’ll need a way to break away a number of moderate Republicans to have a chance of seeing his nomination go through.”
Echoing Gergen, Kennedy School professor Alex Keyssar ’69 said he thinks “it’s very unlikely” the Senate will confirm any nominee.
The professors referenced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s assertion that the Senate would not approve any of Obama’s nominees when discussing the likelihood of a nomination being confirmed. On Saturday, McConnell said the “vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.”
Maya Sen ’00, an assistant professor at the Kennedy School, said “it’s unusual for the Senate to move along presidential appointments during an election year.”
The political implications of the Republicans blocking Obama’s nominee are unclear, although such an action could decrease the GOP’s popularity in the upcoming Senate elections in November, according to Matthew A. Baum, professor of global communications at the Kennedy School.
The Republican-controlled Senate blocking Obama’s nomination “may not be popular in some of the more moderate states, where the Republican candidates aren’t that secure, especially in the Senate,” Baum said. “It could possibly have repercussions more broadly for moderates and independents who may not like the standoff.”
Kennedy School lecturer Richard J. Parker agreed that the gridlock could prove dour for Republicans’ prospects for election to the Senate.
“If McConnell follows through, this will alienate a lot of independents from the Republican party,” Parker said.
As far as the presidential election  is concerned, “Scalia’s death has touched off a political firestorm that is likely to grow in the months ahead,” Gergen said, adding that this election season is unique because all three branches of government could see a shift in party and ideological control.
“It’s not inconceivable that it could cost the Republicans the Senate or cost the Republicans the presidency,” Baum said. “I don’t think it’s likely but it is possible.”
While Scalia’s death could potentially affect the composition of the federal government, Keyssar doubts the nomination process will affect the presidential race to a large degree.
“I don’t think it will affect the election very much,” Keyssar said. “It will provide a focus for an already bitter and sharply partisan election...but I don’t think it will make a particular impact.”

The Undergraduate Council voted unanimously to establish mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, and social spaces as compelling interests for the year during its general meeting Monday.
The four topics will comprise the year’s priorities for the rebranded version of the Bridging and Belonging Grant, a $30,000 fund that former UC President Gus A. Mayopolous ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 established in 2014. The Council rebranded that grant, funded jointly by the UC and Office of Student Life, and will allocate resources to students and student organizations that organize initiatives in alignment with the year’s compelling interests.
UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 pushed for the rebranding last week in an effort to address issues with the fund’s publicity and utilization.
“It was completely underutilized,” Banks said. “We’ve only spent a few of those thousands of dollars in the last few years.”
The new grant will be named the “Open Harvard College Grant,” reflecting the “Open Harvard” slogan that Rather and Banks used during their campaign. Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, who ran against Rather and Banks, expressed his support for the change during the meeting.
“I think it works with what the mission is,” Greenlaw said. “It doesn’t matter what you call it, as long as it gets done.”
Under the new grant, the UC President and Vice President determine, with the consent of the Dean of the College, a set of compelling interests for the year. Student organizations can then apply for funding from the grant for initiatives that align with one or more of the compelling interests.
Prior to the UC’s general meeting, Council leaders notified Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana of the proposed interests, Rather said.
“We want new events and creative events on campus,” Banks said.
The UC is still working to establish an application process for the grant, which will consist of a structured rubric that will allow the UC to evaluate funding proposals.
“This could be parties, or a media campaign, or it could be a new resource, like Indigo,” Rather said, referring to a new mental health counseling service.
UC representatives widely supported the compelling interests included in Monday’s legislation.
“I think this is fantastic,” Student Initiatives Committee Chair Madeleine H. Stern ’18 said. “It allows the Council to go after what students need and want, and it connects students with the UC.”
During the meeting, the UC also voted to allocate $5,281.07 in grants to student organizations on campus. That figure is a slight increase from the $5,021 that the Council allocated last week, but represents less than the amount the Finance Committee had originally intended to spend.
“We had budgeted about $11,000 this week,” Greenlaw said. “We’re going to investigate how communications have been running.”

Members of Harvard’s largest employee union praised the details of a recent agreement with the University that features significant changes in health care benefits and wage compensation.
The tentative contract with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—which was finalized nearly four months after the expiration date of the previous contract—introduces larger copayments on the part of union employees instead of deductibles, a potential feature many union members feared would be implemented in light of a controversial health care benefits package for non-union staff Harvard introduced in 2014.
Danielle Boudrow, a program coordinator for the Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School and a member of HUCTW, said she was “very happy” with the changes to health care included in the new agreement. She said she thought Harvard provided an improved option that “doesn’t include the most dangerous parts” of the 2014 non-union employee package, whose introduction of deductible and coinsurance payments some professors argued would unfairly burden junior faculty members and faculty with families.
In lieu of including such payments, the most recent HUCTW agreement provides for moderately increased patient copayments. Sarah E. Hillman—a local area representative for HUCTW and an employee at Harvard Medical School—said she believed the larger copayment “definitely represents a compromise” between the initial goals of the union, but that she is nonetheless pleased with the outcome of the negotiations.
Hillman also praised what she described as the thoughtfulness of  union and Harvard negotiators and the resulting round of wage increases set to activate in Oct. 2016 and 2017. The tentative contract also includes retroactive wage increases for the 2015 fiscal year.
“I appreciate the fact that the University and the mediators involved in these negotiations were able to push past just the straight [Consumer Price Index] data and look at the actual cost of living in Boston,” Hillman said.
For Hillman, who said that, for the past three years, the cost of renting her apartment in Brighton has increased annually, the wage increases are helpful.
Union members will officially vote on the contract on Feb. 25. Ahead of that vote, HUCTW has hosted lunchtime information sessions to help clarify more complex details of the contract. Additionally, Bill Jaeger, executive director of the union, said that HUCTW set up a hotline for union members with specific questions about the contract. He said he believes most union members will vote to ratify the agreement.
Members of HUCTW said they had hoped the negotiations would have happened more quickly, but they appreciated the thoroughness of the talks.
“It's more important to get the best possible agreement rather than the fastest agreement,” Boudrow said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the erection of a 500-ton tower crane in December, construction crews on Harvard Kennedy School’s campus have begun placing the steel beams that will form the structure of the school’s three new buildings and raised courtyard.
The $126 million project, which began in May 2015,  is proceeding on schedule and on budget, according to John A. Haigh, executive dean at the Kennedy School, and Janney Wilson, chief financial and administrative officer for the Kennedy School.
The Kennedy School, which plans to finance the entire project through fundraising, has already accrued 90 percent of the total renovation costs, according to Haigh. Part of that fundraising comes from donors whose names will adorn the new buildings, though administrators have not yet released those individuals’ identities.
“There are people who have given us money and have asked us to remain anonymous for the time being,” Haigh said.
Haigh said he expects all of the new structural beams to be in place—a milestone known as “topping off”—by early this summer. The school hopes to complete the construction and open the new buildings by January 2018, according to Haigh.
The construction includes three new buildings that will connect the existing Belfer, Littauer, Rubenstein, and Taubman buildings in addition to creating six classrooms, a new dining space, and new social and study areas.
“We want it to be open and inviting, so the main level of the new gateway building will be a student lounge,” Haigh said. “It will be open and well lit into the evening.”
As workers ramp up construction, Kennedy School administrators have tried to keep faculty and staff happy throughout the process, which has closed off the campus’ main courtyard and caused “a fair amount of noise and vibration” during the summer, Haigh said.
“Our approach on communication has been to be very open and very transparent in order to give people notice of what's coming so that they're not surprised,” Haigh said. “Faculty members said to me, ‘If you just keep us informed and let us know what’s happening, we’ll be supportive. If we’re surprised, we’ll just be angry.”
Kennedy School administators have also offered solutions to faculty who have been bothered by the ongoing construction.
“We have swing space,” Wilson said. “We would hand out Bose headphones to whoever wanted them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lightning has struck yet again for the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team. With wins over Brown and then-No. 4 Yale this weekend, the Crimson (10-0, 7-0 Ivy League) closed out a perfect regular season with its 20th Ivy League title in program history.
HARVARD 9, YALE 0
After dropping two conference games earlier in the month, Yale (11-4, 4-3) rebounded with a decisive 9-0 win against now-No. 9 Dartmouth on Friday. The Bulldogs looked to be gaining momentum, and with a win over the leader of the Ancient Eight on Sunday, the hosts could have forced the Crimson into a tie for the championship with No. 2 Penn. But Harvard would not settle for sharing.
Freshman Sabrina Sobhy clinched her seventh win in the No. 1 spot at the Brady Squash Center with a 11-8, 11-7, 11-2 victory over Yale’s Celine Yeap. With the win, Sobhy finished the regular season undefeated in Ivy League play.
Senior Michelle Gemmell and co-captain Saumya Karki also remained undefeated with their sixth and ninth wins, respectively, as the two finished their seasons with sweeps over their opponents. Gemmell topped Jennifer Davis, 14-12, 12-10, 11-8, while Karki picked up an 11-4, 12-10, 11-2 win over Jocelyn Lehman.
Junior Katherine Tutrone and sophomore Sue Ann Yong picked up their fifth wins on the season, and junior Dileas MacGowan recorded her eighth. Sophomore Alyssa Mehta also came out with a win.
Freshman Sophie Mehta had the longest match of the day in New Haven, Conn., playing four games against Bulldog junior Madeline Tomlinson in the No. 9 spot. After trading a pair of games with Tomlinson, Mehta took control of the match in the third stanza, going on to decisively win the next two games. Tomlinson was the only person to win a game for Yale on the day.
This is the 18th time that the Crimson has finished the regular season undefeated. The team has now won the Ivy League championship four times in the last seven years. Harvard has the most Ivy League titles in history, with 14 more championships than the team with the second most titles, Princeton.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
Friday’s match against Brown (6-8, 0-7) marked the Crimson’s last home game. The Bears, who entered the contest without an Ivy League win on the year, had their hands full with a Harvard team that had been rolling. At stake in the match for the Crimson was a share of the Ancient Eight title, which was still up for grabs.
It was a bittersweet day for the seniors, who played their last regular season game at the Murr Center—bitter, for this marked the beginning of the end of their senior season, yet sweet, because they ended it on a stellar note.
“These two matches mean a lot to us,” MacGowan said. “Friday's match against Brown was the last squash match the seniors will ever play on their home courts. Regardless of the history with the opposing team and any expectations we have regarding outcome, we were as motivated as ever for these last two matches because we wanted to give it our all for our seniors.”
Both Harvard co-captains made appearances on the courts and helped lead their team to a share of the championship. At the No. 5 position, Karki easily handled Brown’s Katrina Northrop to earn her eighth win at the position. Dowling, who was playing through a cold, did the same in the eighth position, earning her first win in that spot. Gemmell also won at the No. 3 spot.
The Crimson’s freshmen had a strong showing at the match, with Sobhy and Sophie Mehta making quick work of their opponents in the first and seventh positions, respectively.
Yong, Tutrone, MacGowan, and junior Caroline Monrad also contributed to the Crimson sweep with straight-set victories.
“The team worked really well together, and each and everyone of us were really mentally strong today,” MacGowan said. “Michelle and Katie both had some games with really close scores, but they were both able to win their matches 3-0 due to their mental strength and ability to play those clinch and crucial rallies really well.”
Harvard ended its home slate taking all 27 games against Brown. With the two weekend wins, the Crimson finished the year with six 9-0 sweeps in seven tries against Ancient Eight opponents. With the win over Brown in particular, Harvard maintained its perfect record (47-0) in the all-time series with the Bears.
“I think we are all at a good and confident place,” Yong said. “We want to work on maintaining the focus and fitness we've had thus far throughout the season and hopefully defend the national title."

No. 6 Harvard (5-5, 5-2 Ivy League) missed its opportunity this weekend to win a share of the Ivy League title. Starting the weekend at home in Cambridge, the Crimson soundly defeated the No.16 Brown Bears (5-10, 0-7) before losing a heartbreaker against No. 2 Yale Bulldogs (12-2, 7-0).
“From the match [against Yale] it was just realizing that we’re up there with all the other teams and there isn’t a lot that separates from the other teams,” sophomore Seif Eleinen said. “It’s just a matter of all of us bringing our A-game on the same day and leaving it all out there.”
YALE 6, HARVARD 3
With a chance to earn a share of the Ivy League title the Crimson fell in New Haven against the Bulldogs at the Brady Squash Center. Coming into the weekend as the second seed, the Crimson needed a win to claim a share of the Ivy League title with Yale, but the Bulldogs earned their first win over Harvard since the 2012 season to win the outright title.
Ryan, Koh, and Murray each notched victories for Harvard, but it wasn’t enough to push past Yale. Ryan and Murray earned a pair of sweeps for the Crimson. Ryan picked up his fourth win of the season at the No. 1 position, while Murray earned his fifth at the No. 5 spot.
Koh meanwhile, had to go to limit as he came back from being two games down against senior Sam Fenwick to earn his seventh victory of the season.
After McLaughlin suffered a dislocated shoulder during his first game, the match ended in a default despite the fact that McLaughlin was ahead of Yale sophomore Max Martin, 2-0.  Following the injury, McLaughlin’s absence was felt by the rest of the team.
“It was definitely going to be a tight match, but with Devin out plus lots of the matches could go either way, it was just tough” Elenein said.
While Eleinen was swept in his face off with junior Liam McClintock, Gosset fell by just one set, 3-2, to sophomore Pierson Broadwater. Prior to this weekend, Eleinen was the only Harvard player with an unblemished match record.
“Today some people played the best they played all season but some other people just had bad matches,” Eleinen said. “We were never able to play our best squash at the same time.”
Despite the loss, many on the team feel confident that they can do well at the CSA Team National Championship in New Haven.
“It’s just a matter of all of us bringing our A-game on the same day and leaving it all out there,” Eleinen said. “It’s just a matter of picking ourselves up and doing what we need to do.”
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
The Harvard men earned their fifth victory in the Ivy League for this season with a 9-0 sweep over Brown Friday night at the Murr Center Squash Courts on Senior Night.  This was Harvard’s second sweep over an Ivy League foe this season.
Harvard picked up its 26th straight victory over Brown and dropped only two sets en route to the sweep.
Sophomore David Ryan earned his third victory of the season competing at the No. 1 spot, sweeping sophomore Thomas Blecher, 3-0.
“We were pretty consistent against Brown. We all played decent squash…and got business done” Ryan said. This was also Ryan’s first victory at the No. 1 spot.
Sophomore Bradley Smith and junior co-captain Bryan Koh picked up their fifth and seventh wins competing at the No.2 and No.3 spot, respectively, in the contest against Brown.
Sophomore Madhav Dhingra and Junior Dylan Murray both had their fourth victories for the season at the respective No. 4 and No. 5 positions, while junior co-captain Devin McLaughlin had his sixth win of the season at the No. 6 spot. Freshman Alexi Gosset earned his fourth win at the No. 7 position, and Sam Goldberg picked up his first win of the season at the No. 8 position.
Matt Roberts completed the sweep for the Crimson at the No. 9 spot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson (7-4) bounced back from two tough losses last weekend to restart its winning streak, topping Brown and Roger Williams, 25-10 and 38-3, respectively, on the Bears’ home turf.
“I think yesterday was a great way for us to get back on track,” sophomore Josef Johnson said. “Last week we wrestled really well but came up short. It was really good for our confidence to be able to bounce back after that and to get some momentum back as we look to close out the season.”
HARVARD 38, ROGER WILLIAMS 3
The Crimson broke the match open early against Roger Williams, eventually finishing the victory with a score of 38-3. Four different Crimson wrestlers notched major decisions, while Preston, Gobbo and senior Jeffrey Ott notched a pin and two technical falls, respectively.
“I felt a little bit conservative in my first match,” Gobbo said. “So I really tried to open up in my second match, which worked for me pretty well since I was able to get that [technical] fall.”
Senior Patrick Hogan bounced back from a loss earlier in the day against Brown to grab a major decision against Carter Merecki. With this 9-0 win, the senior extended the Crimson’s lead 18-3.
The only win for Roger Williams against the Crimson came at the heavyweight position, as Adam Patsun won by decision against Cowell. The bout was tightly contested for a final score of 2-1.
“After losing last week, we made an active effort in practice to just ramp up the intensity,” Johnson said. “And I think you could really see the difference it made especially in this match. Our guys bumped up the intensity and were really aggressive in general.”
HARVARD 25, BROWN 10
The deciding factor of the match came from No .19 Devon Gobbo’s performance. The Bears were creeping back into contention up until that time, but the senior managed to silence the home team, as he notched the win at 165, 7-2.
“[Devon] really stood out yesterday,” Johnson said. “We saw him taking risks and opening the match up. It’s a beautiful thing when Devon is wrestling at 100 percent, and you could really see that he wasn’t afraid of anything.”
No.9 ranked captain Todd Preston continued his solid performance from last weekend on the mat, notching a major decision, 18-4, against Brown’s Charles Banazcak at 144 lbs.
“Todd just did what he does,” Johnson said. “He really turned the heat up, and brought a ton of intensity yesterday. When Todd lets loose on a match like that, it’s really only a matter of time until his opponent breaks.”
The Crimson had a shaky start to the meet, as sophomore Angus Cowell dropped the first match of the meet to Brown’s Joshua Durso-Finley, putting Harvard down 3-0 at the start. Freshman Nolan Hellickson quickly responded, putting Harvard on the board and knotting the team score at 3-3.
“I think Nolan is really coming into his own,” Johnson said. “One of the things that the coaches have been stressing this year is wrestling aggressively from the top position, and Nolan has been able to open up on matches by doing that. He’s trusting his offense, taking shots, and just taking direction really well. It’s great to have a reliable guy like him in the lineup.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field teams concluded the weekend with a number of impressive performances in Boston, Seattle and New Mexico, the last meets the team has until the Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal championships in 12 days.
DAVID HEMERY VALENTINE INVITATIONAL
After competing in the Scarlett and White Invitational a week ago, the Crimson returned to Boston University where they concluded the day with strong performances in a number of events.
For the women, sophomore Marlena Sabatino and junior Raegan Nizdil finished the day with top finishes in the pole vault and high jump, respectively. Sabatino claimed first place by clearing 12’ 9.5” (3.90 meters), while Nizdil also took home the gold medal with a high jump of 5’7” (1.70 meters).
“I felt really good at the end of the day because it was the highest that I’ve ever entered a meet,” Sabatino said. “It was important to get comfortable opening higher, especially because the Ivy League is very competitive. ” Freshman Nicole Trenchard finished third for Harvard in the pole vault, with a jump of 11’11.75” (3.65 meters).
Elsewhere, senior Emma Payne ran a personal-best 16:46.55 in the 5,000-meter run on her way to a ninth-place finish – also good for ninth-all time in Harvard history.
On the men’s side, the Crimson landed a plethora of seventh place finishes from sophomore Jay Hebert, freshman Myles Marshall, and junior Brandon Price. Hebert finished the day by matching his career best mark in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.12 seconds. Marshall ran the 800 meters in 1:50.05, while Price recorded a new personal best in the 3,000 meters with a time of 8:00.07. Price’s time in the 3,000 meters is the fourth fastest in Harvard’s history.
Elsewhere, senior Mark Hill took sixth in the long jump after recording a career best 23’0.5” (7.02 meters) from the stripe.
“We had some guys do really well, and we have other still coming back from injury or getting used to their first indoor season,” Hebert said.
HUSKY CLASSIC
Harvard’s performance at the Husky Classic, hosted in Seattle at Washington University, was highlighted by strong performances from sophomore Courtney Smith and senior Paige Kouba.
Smith finished third overall in the 5,000 meters with a time of 15:46.44, good for the eighth-fastest run in the country and fourth-best in Ivy League history. The run was also a significant personal best for Smith.
Kouba experienced similar success, running the mile in 4:43.77, good for 15th overall and fifth-best in Harvard history. This is also Kouba’s best- recorded time this season, and is less than a second off her career-best.
DON KIRBY INVITATIONAL
In New Mexico, Freshman Gabby Thomas (55.1), Seniors Autumne Franklin (52.7) and Christi Scott (54.2) and junior Jade Miller (53.1) wrote their names in the Harvard and Ivy League record books in the 4x400 meter relay, placing fourth in 3:35.14 in a time that marks a new Ivy League record.
Miller also placed third in the 600 meters, running a personal-best in 1:31.48. She also set a personal best in the 60 meter hurdles with a time of 8.66. Thomas had two more top-10 results, taking sixth in the 200 meters with a time of 23.72 and seventh in the 60 meters in 7.46 seconds.
It was another freshman, though, who tallied the Crimson’s top marks in the 60 meter dash. Freshman Ngozi Musa ran a 7.40 in the semifinals – second in program and Ivy League history, behind only Thomas’s run last week in 7.38 seconds – and a  7.41 in the finals, good for fifth place.
With the strong performances this weekend, many on the team are looking forward to the Ivy championships in two weeks.
“You can see that lots of the teams have some heavy hitters, but I think that our guys feel good,” Hebert said. “Right now… we’re in a position to score more points than the Harvard team has in years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard skiing team endured the bitter cold at the Dartmouth Carnival this weekend, competing against a field full of U.S. National Ski Team and top non-collegiate racers. With career-bests from both junior Rachel Hampton and senior Hannah Barnes, the team clinched its fourth consecutive top-10 overall finish and tallied 264 points.
Given the weather conditions, the Nordic races were moved to Craftsbury, VT., and the Nordic team only managed to compete for one day of competition. Dealing with chills consistently below -30 degrees, the Harvard women’s Nordic skiers led the Crimson, placing sixth overall out of 11 teams.
“Being in the top six was our goal for the season,” Hampton said. “So being able to do that was a big step for us.”
Hampton posted a career-best eighth place of 61 competitors in the women’s 15K with a time of 45:56.
“It was a tough race out there, but I just went for it and was aggressive,” Hampton said. “I think this was a big step for me confidence-wise to get that finish and I hope that it continues to translate for the rest of the season and NCAAs.”
Senior Hannah Barnes also finished with a new career best, clocking in at 47:48 to take home 25th place in the 15K. Freshman Nina Armstrong came in 36th, followed closely by sophomore Charlotte Cole and freshman Hannah Hardenbergh.
In the men’s 20K, junior Ian Meyer led in 33rd place and junior Devlin Shea and co-captain Soren Anderson finished in 45th and 48th, respectively.
On the alpine women’s side, freshman Molly Leavens led the way in Friday’s Giant Slalom in 45th, with junior Kaitlyn Gibson placing 52th and senior Samantha Udolf coming in 58th.
University of Vermont freshman Laurence St. Germain, who recently returned from representing Canada on the World Cup circuit, won both women’s alpine races, while Colby College junior Mardene Haskell was the top American finisher for both days of alpine racing.
“It was fun having Laurence St. Germain back to add an additional intensity to the race,” said Haskell. The presence of top-tier skiers added another layer of competition to the races.
In the men’s GS, sophomore Pieter Weemaes finished first for the Crimson in 54th in 1:59.10, followed by junior James Stevenson and sophomore Kalvis Hornburg.
After falling on Friday in the GS race, sophomore Kelly Steeves came back strong on Saturday to take first for Harvard with 26th place in the Slalom.
“I was pretty disappointed with my result on Friday. My ski popped off [early in] the first run so I didn’t really get a chance to ski it. I was looking to redeem myself on Saturday,” Steeves said. “I wanted to…finally put together what I’ve been working on in training, and it all came together.”
Steeves was followed by Leavens in 43rd and Udolf in 50th. In the men’s Slalom, senior Dan Rittenhouse led in 54th place, trailed by freshman Dennis Bao and Hornburg. Given the presence of top-ranked non-collegiate racers, the Harvard men started their runs after many skiers had already raced down the course.
“It was challenging for all of us starting that far back, but we pulled through and supported one another through it,” Steeves said.
The team will again take on tough conditions at the Williams Carnival next weekend. The Nordic Races were moved to Lake Placid in New York due to conditions and the Alpine team will be racing in Western Massachusetts at Jiminy Peak and Berkshire East.
“We got to race at Berkshire East last weekend…. So [we] are feeling confident going into the slalom because we know the hill a bit more,” Steeves said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the road in Princeton, N.J., the No. 15 Harvard women’s water polo team completed another tournament sweep using more stifling defense and timely goals.
Despite playing a pair of ranked opponents, the rising Crimson (8-1) pulled out close win after close win and is off to its best start since 1995.
Harvard opened its Princeton Invitational slate by outlasting No. 23 Cal Baptist, 8-4, before squeaking past No. 22 Wagner, 7-6, by way of shutting out the Seahawks’ offense in the fourth quarter. The Crimson closed out the tournament by surging offensively in the fourth quarter to take the victory over Villanova, 11-9.
“Playing the competitive teams that we’ve been playing, we knew that producing a lot wins was something we were capable of,” junior attacker Melissa Balding said. “And this year, to actually do it, has been pretty good.”
In posting a 3-0 tournament record, Harvard finished undefeated at the Princeton Invitational for the first time.
HARVARD 11, VILLANOVA 9
By the end of the third quarter of the bout between the Crimson and the Wildcats (3-5), the 8-8 deadlock made it clear that February’s rematch would be a much a different animal than Harvard’s 14-4 season-opening victory over the same Villanova team.
The Crimson’s most consistent scorers, however, ensured that Harvard still came out on top. In the final frame of play, Balding notched her fourth goal of the game to give the Crimson a 9-8 lead, which was then followed up by goals from senior attacker Yoshi Andersen and freshman attacker Kristen Hong to seal the victory. Coming into weekend play, the trio had accounted for over half of Harvard’s 71 goals on the season.
“We’ve been working a lot in practice on different end-of-the-game situations that have prepared us to be mentally and physically aware in close games,” Balding said.
On the other end of the pool, freshman goalie Sam Acker tallied nine stops in goal in her third start of the season.
The Crimson’s season sweep of Villanova marks the second year in a row that Harvard has taken both games from the Wildcats, going 4-0 in those contests.
HARVARD 7, WAGNER 6
Another closely-fought and oft-tied game proved to be no problem for the Crimson.
Sophomore defender Hollis Jomo played the role of unlikely hero, scoring her first goal of the season late in the third quarter to put Harvard ahead, 6-5, after it either tied or trailed the No. 22 Seahawks (7-7) all match long. The Crimson used the spark to hold on to the win by the slimmest of margins, 7-6.
Wagner tied the game briefly on a goal by freshman attacker Erica Hardy, but senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix pushed Harvard out front for good no less than 13 seconds thereafter. The one-goal lead heading into the final frame held firm as both offenses were held scoreless in the fourth.
“I’ve said it all season long, everything we do starts on the defensive end,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We were able to shut them out in the fourth quarter.”
Neither team led by more than one goal at any point during the 32 minutes.
As part of its success, the Crimson was able to hold senior attacker and reigning Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) Offensive Player of the Year in senior attacker Jesse Lundgren to just one goal on the game.
HARVARD 8, CAL BAPTIST 4
Both No. 23 Cal Baptist (7-5) and Harvard entered Saturday morning’s bout having won five of their last six matches, but the Crimson knocked off the Lancers to preserve its own winning streak.
Sophomore goalie Cleo Harrington anchored a defense that held the Cal Baptist offense quiet for most of the match. Harrington would go on to make 22 stops in goal on the day.
On the offensive end, Harvard’s lineup of goal-scorers gave Harrington sufficient support in the form of three goals from Hong, and a pair each from Andersen and junior attacker Michelle Martinelli.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling to No. 60 Cornell (3-6) in the semifinals of the ECAC Division I Indoor Championships, Harvard men’s tennis (8-4) returned to the courts on Sunday and claimed a decisive comeback victory over Penn (3-6) for third place overall. The Crimson also took down rival Yale (4-4) in the first round.
The team traveled to Philadelphia, PA., as the number one seed going into the ECAC Championships, and returned home with a 2-1 record for the weekend.
“A lot of times when we play teams we either see ourselves as underdogs or as favorites to win,” co-captain Nicky Hu said. “Sometimes you just need to get rid of that and go out and play whoever is on the other side of the court and play like there is nothing to lose…. That’s something we need to work on.”
PENN 5, HARVARD 2
In the final round of the ECAC Championships, the Crimson took on the University of Pennsylvania on the Quakers’ home turf.
The players did not let the team’s previous loss to Cornell hinder its performance.
“It was good to see how the guys today chose to bounce back with a strong lead early in doubles against Penn and then also a strong showing in singles as well.” Hu said.
Harvard took an early lead by winning the doubles point. Seniors Kelvin Lam and co-captain Conor Haughey eased past Penn senior Vim De Alwis and sophomore Blaine Willenborg, 6-3, and Harvard junior Sebastian Beltrame and sophomore Kenny Tao narrowly beat their Quaker opponents 7-6.
In the singles competition, Hu defeated Penn freshman Kyle Mautner in straight sets, 6-3, 6-1, while freshman Andy Zhou overtook Penn freshman Dmitry Shatalin, 6-3, 6-2.
Adding to the singles’ momentum, Tao supplemented the lead with a three-set win, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, and Lam, with his 7th consecutive triumph, secured the 5-2 victory over Penn and a third-place showing overall.
“Personally I had made some adjustments from last weekend against Vandy and Memphis, and I thought I executed it really well this time around. Coaches asked me to focus on certain things, and I thought I made good first steps towards that.” Tao said.
CORNELL 4, HARVARD 1
On Saturday, the Crimson fell to Cornell by a 4-1 score in the semifinals with Lam posting the only point for Harvard of the day in a stand-alone singles match at sixth singles. Lam came back from an early deficit to take the match 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Lam and Haughey also claimed a doubles win, overtaking Cornell sophomore Karim Arem and freshman Karlo Lozic 6-3, but the victory was not enough for the doubles point.
Tao, who won his first set 6-3, almost bested Big Red junior Chris Vrabel at fourth singles. Vrabel came back, however, earning a point for Cornell by defeating Tao in the final two sets, 6-3, 7-5.
“Individually I can definitely work on closing matches out. I had a few match points against Chris Vrabel of Cornell, but wasn’t able to finish it off.” Tao said.
The semifinal upset was a hard loss for the Crimson, who took the ECAC title last year.
“It was tough to take that loss to Cornell,” Hu said, “But Cornell is a very good team and they have definitely improved a lot…. It’s always tough to lose to a conference rival but I am really proud [the team was] able to shake off the loss.”
HARVARD 4, YALE 1
Harvard’s first match of the weekend came against rival Yale on Friday, seeded eighth.
Hu and Yeung went undefeated in both doubles and singles. Together they defeated Bulldogs sophomores Fedor Andrienko and Stefan Doehler 6-2 in doubles. Individually, they swept their Yale opponents in straight sets.
Beltrame and Tao clinched a victory at third doubles, and Lam’s 6-3, 6-1 win over Doehler in the singles competition secured Harvard’s lead.
With this victory, the Harvard men’s team ended the Bulldog’s four-match winning streak and advanced to the second round of the ECAC Championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a weekend that saw the Harvard women’s basketball team drop consecutive contests to Penn and Princeton, the Crimson responded with a record-setting road trip.
On Saturday, Harvard did the near-impossible against Yale, notching the fourth-largest comeback in Division I history. The Crimson erased a 23-point deficit to take down the Bulldogs (11-14, 2-6 Ivy League), 72-69.
The largest comeback in program history extended Harvard’s win streak against Yale to eight games, and came on the heels of a victory over Brown (13-9, 1-7) on Friday. After starting the game on a 15-0 run, the Crimson proved too much for the Bears. Harvard never dropped the lead despite a late surge from Brown in a 87-79 win that saw two Crimson players log more than 20 points.
With the two wins, Harvard (10-11, 5-3) remains undefeated on the road in Ivy League play.
HARVARD 72, YALE 69
Down by one with two minutes on the clock, senior guard Kit Metoyer drove into the lane for a tough layup. After her shot rattled off the backboard, classmate Shilpa Tummala grabbed the offensive board and threw it in for the go-ahead bucket. The Crimson had trailed for the near-entirety of the contest, but it would not trail again.
“We played our hearts out in the second half,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “What we were trying to do was do a better job of playing as a team both offensively and defensively, which we did not do very well in the first half. We had to chip our way [back], and we were trying to do that with teamwork. We were not trying to do that separately.”
And what a comeback it was.
After a first quarter that saw Yale shoot 57 percent from the field and a first half where the Bulldogs missed only three out of 11 times beyond the arc, Harvard seemed down and out.
“Unfortunately we started slowly, and that coupled with Yale being on a shooting run like I haven’t seen before, we dug ourselves a deep, deep hole,” Delaney-Smith said. “Everybody was just draining threes. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
After going down by 23 with two minutes left in the half, the Crimson began its run at history. A three from freshman guard Sydney Skinner with 1:56 remaining in the second began a 14-0 burst that brought the Crimson within nine at the half.
In the second half, Harvard continued its run. After the Bulldogs opened with a quick four points to start the third quarter, Harvard responded with eight unanswered points to come within six.
From there, the two teams matched each other point-for-point until a jumper from junior forward Destiny Nunley and a three from freshman guard Madeline Raster finally tied up the game, 60-60, with 5:26 left in the fourth.
After trading free throws and layups in the dwindling minutes of the fourth, Tummala’s layup sealed the deal as the Crimson made three trips to the line in the game’s final minute to finish the epic comeback, 72-69.
“Our team has some really strong resiliency,” Tummala said. “This isn’t something that we didn’t think could happen. We never wavered in our faith to be able to win the game.”
HARVARD 87, BROWN 79
Facing off against a struggling Brown squad on Friday, Harvard took an early lead that proved to be enough to defeat the Bears in Providence.
The game began with a barrage of scoring as seniors Tummala, Metoyer, and co-captain AnnMarie Healy combined for 20 of the Crimson’s 24 first-quarter points.
“We had a lot of people step up and hit some big shots—from our freshmen to seniors,” Tummala said. “It was just all about attacking and being in that attacking mentality. It was just knowing that our teammates are going to attack and [then] just being there to gather up and recover anything our teammates miss.”
After out-rebounding Brown 27-6 in the first half, the Crimson took a 44-26 lead into the break.
In the second half, the Bears made another push. After matching Harvard point-for-point in the third, Brown came within eight after a 12-point run early in the fourth.
After trading shots for much of the quarter, a long three from Bears guard Shayna Mehta put Brown within six of the Crimson with a little over a minute left on the clock.
Despite the 32-point frame from Brown, however, Harvard held on in the last minute thanks to timely free-throw shooting and strong defense.
The Crimson outrebounded the Bears, 45-23, while Metoyer lead all scorers with 23.
“Defensively it was just trying not [to have] little breakdowns or mental breakdowns,” Tummala said. “For the first time I thought we really put that together at the end of the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to climb in the ECAC standings, the Harvard women’s hockey team kicked off a four-game roadtrip in the state of New York, taking on conference foes Rensselaer and Union.
The Crimson (15-9-3, 11-6-3 ECAC) came out of the weekend undefeated, settling for a tie against RPI (10-14-8, 8-8-4) before claiming a 3-0 victory over the Dutchwomen (0-26-6, 0-17-6)
“Obviously you want to walk away with two wins but we walked away with…three out of four points so overall we did pretty good” freshman defenseman Kate Hallett said. “I think we put out a lot of energy this weekend.”
HARVARD 3, UNION 0
In the second game of the weekend, the Harvard first line picked up all seven points of the game as the Crimson continued its dominance over Union with a 3-0 win. It was Harvard’s 26th consecutive victory over the Dutchwomen, a team that has never defeated the Crimson in program history.
Co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer picked up her fifth shutout of the season in front of the net, tallying 23 saves.
Harvard got off to a quick start thanks to junior Sydney Daniels. Less than three minutes into the game, senior Miye D’Oench fired a rocket towards goal that Daniels redirected past Union netminder Melissa Black. It was the 19th assist and 32nd point of the season for D’Oench, who is ranked fourth in points in the ECAC.
“Scoring a goal like that in the first five minutes is always good to get some momentum going forward in the game, which I’m happy we were able to hold onto,” Daniels said.
Following two penalty calls against Union, one for slashing and another for holding, the Crimson capitalized on the two-man advantage as co-captain Michelle Picard found the back of the net.
Junior blueliner Brianna Mastel fired a shot from the point which rebounded off of Black to Daniels. After Daniels and sophomore Karly Heffernan took a few shots from the side of the goal, Picard poked it in from just outside the crease to double the Harvard lead. Daniels and Heffernan were credited with the assists.
On the other end of the powerplay, Harvard maintained discipline, giving up only two penalties while scoring its first shorthanded goal since Halloween.
After sophomore forward Lexie Laing was sent to the box for tripping late in the second frame, sloppy play between two Union players, who failed to control possession, along the boards allowed a floating Daniels to pick up the puck in the neutral zone and rush down the left flanks unmarked.
The Southwick, Mass. native fired a slapshot from outside the left faceoff circle into the bottom right corner for her 15th goal of the season and third point of the game, tied for her single-game career high.
“Tying RPI wasn’t the outcome we wanted but I think turning around and really getting ready for Saturday’s win and getting the win really was good for us,” Daniels said. “It gave us a lot of momentum to catapult ahead for next weekend.”
HARVARD 1, RENSSELAER 1
The Crimson kicked off its road trip with a 1-1 tie against RPI, as rookie forward Grace Zarzecki’s eighth goal of the season tied the game for Harvard.
10 minutes after going down, sloppy passing between the RPI defenders bumped the puck into the slot and the path of Zarzecki, whose first time effort rocketed past goalie Lovisa Selander.
Despite outshooting the Engineers 43-26, including a 10-4 advantage in the first frame, it was RPI who opened the scoring. Following a scrum in front of Maschmeyer’s net, RPI sophomore Shayna Tomlinson poked the puck in on the left side to give her team the lead. Maschmeyer tallied 25 saves on the day.
The Crimson had key opportunities to take the lead in the third frame following two RPI penalties but failed to take advantage of either, letting the game escape into overtime. While Harvard dominated the extra frame, claiming a 4-1 shot advantage, RPI held the Crimson scoreless to escape with the tie.
“You have to give credit to RPI’s goalie [Selander],” Hallett said. “She played very well…. That said, there were 43 shots but shots are different than scoring opportunities. What was different this weekend was that we did have a lot more scoring opportunities than we’ve have lately, which is good…. If we keep pounding at it, we’ll get there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after falling to Springfield in a tortuous tiebreaker, the Harvard men’s volleyball team returned to campus for the start of EIVA conference play.
There was not much comfort in this homecoming: On Friday night, the Crimson hosted No. 7 Penn State, winner of 17 straight league titles, and on Saturday night, it hosted No. 15 St. Francis.
Exactly half of this competition went according to plan. In a sweep loss to the Nittany Lions (7-2, 2-0 EIVA), Harvard played perhaps its worst volleyball of the season, while in a sweep win over the Red Flash (5-6, 0-3), the team played perhaps its best.
HARVARD 3, NO. 15 ST. FRANCIS 0
“Branden [Clemens] was virtually unstoppable tonight,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “He’s been that way all season.”
Indeed, facing an 0-2 start to conference play, captain and outside hitter Clemens put on a remarkable performance, leading all players with 19 kills and a .708 blocking percentage.
He received help from several teammates, especially sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch (13 finishes), and Harvard (4-5, 1-1 EIVA)cruised to a 3-0 triumph while hitting .494.
In the second set, however,that result threatened to unravel.
The Crimson clung to a 22-21 lead when junior outside hitter Casey White smashed a serve into the net and yelled out a curse. Two points later, freshman middle blocker Trevor Dow repeated the mistake—albeit more quietly—to knot the match at 23-23.
Clemens and sophomore setter Marko Kostich averted the disaster with back-to-back kills, claiming the set and the momentum.
The same duo was hard at work in the third game, as Clemens put up seven finishes and Kostich recorded 18 assists. A mid-frame 5-1 run gave the hosts breathing room, and Harvard hung on for a 25-20 victory.
Sophomore outside hitter Brandon Buck led St. Francis with 13 finishes, but he could not prevent the Red Flash from dropping to the league cellar after its third EIVA loss.
The Crimson’s domination began early in the night, as the hosts raced to an 11-5 lead. That quick start culminated in a 25-19 game win.
“We came out wanting to fight,” Clemens said. “Getting swept by Penn State will definitely get some fire in your belly.”
HARVARD 0, NO. 7 PENN STATE
The set score might say differently, but on Friday night, only a few points separated Harvard from a sloppy upset over the Nittany Lions.
Consider the second set: Down 17-13, the Crimson had clawed back to take a 21-20 lead. Over 400 people had made it to the home opener, and that crowd buzzed with new expectation of a grind-and-grit finale.
Instead, Penn State took the next five points to claim the frame. The crowd settled into silence.
A frame later, the hosts boasted a 19-18 lead after powering ahead on an early 6-0 run.
But the Nittany Lions responded in formulaic fashion, using a five-point streak to take control. Although Harvard fought back with a pair of points, the night ended on a kill by sophomore outside hitter Chris Nugent. Game score: 25-21.
In contrast to the efficient offense against St. Francis, the Crimson put up a .179 hitting percentage. Clemens, who had racked up double-digit kill totals in his last 17 matches, accumulated one finish and three errors.
“Penn State, they have a great coach, and they’re really smart,” Clemens said. “They scouted well…. I really couldn’t get in a rhythm.”
Despite that difficulty, Harvard opened play by building a 12-6 first-set advantage. The Nittany Lions scratched back to tie the score at 23-23, and then a pair of errors—one by White and one by Clemens—handed Penn State the set.
Nugent, the Nittany Lions’ leader in kills, topped all players with 19. Gretsch led the Crimson with nine.
“Penn State is a really good team, but I felt like we made them look better,” Baise said. “Our side of the net was not the team we usually are.”
