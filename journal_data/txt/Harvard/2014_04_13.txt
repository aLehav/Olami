After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a game with big Ivy League implications, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team suffered a sound defeat against conference rival Princeton, 15-6, on Saturday at Harvard Stadium. Coming into the contest, both the Crimson (7-5, 3-2 Ivy) and the Tigers (8-4, 4-1) had identical overall and league marks, and the two squads were tied for second in the conference.
In the opening minutes of play, the game looked as if it would be an even matchup. An early Princeton goal was quickly answered by Harvard freshman attacker Marisa Romeo, who took advantage of one-on-one defense to score her league-leading 38th goal of the year with 22:58 left in the first half.
“We were really just trying to control and maintain possession for longer than they could,” Romeo said. “That was basically the game plan coming in.”
But the situation quickly got worse for the Crimson, as the Tigers utilized a very efficient offensive attack to wear down the Harvard defense and create scoring opportunities for themselves.
In one of its first possessions of the game, Princeton set the tone by running down nearly five minutes of clock and finishing with a goal by junior midfielder Erin Slifer.
Slifer would prove to be a thorn in the Crimson’s side throughout the contest, as she racked up a career-high seven points on four goals and three assists.
“Slifer is one of our players who's getting better and better,” Tigers’ coach Chris Sailer said. “She's strong and powerful, and she's learned to switch up her shots more to keep the goalies guessing.  She also sees the field really well, and has a lot of success finding open teammates.”
Princeton moved the ball quickly from player to player, looking for openings in the Harvard defense and taking advantage of free positions given away by penalties called against the Crimson. The Tigers would go an impressive six-for-six on free position shots throughout the day.
“That ended up having a big impact on the game,” Romeo said. “We got kind of unlucky on a lot of calls throughout the game, [but] we just kind of have to expect that not every call is going to be in favor of us.”
It quickly became clear that if the Harvard team was to be competitive, it would have to take advantage of every offensive opportunity that came to it. However, this proved to be a struggle as the Crimson was plagued by turnovers, giving up the ball 14 times.
“They really threw us off guard by sporadically changing their matchup plan with different people and different numbers of people on us," Romeo said. "But we’ll know how to handle it next time.”
The game’s most crucial stretch came with about two minutes remaining in the first half. Harvard had just shrunk the Princeton lead to 6-3 off of an unassisted goal by sophomore midfielder Audrey Todd, and the Crimson immediately won back possession. It seemed as though it would have a chance to get its offense in position, let the clock wind down, and hopefully score a goal to go into the second half with a manageable two-point deficit.
“We were just trying to chip away and get closer and closer,” Romeo said. “They were starting to pull away. We were just trying to work for a good possession but not force the shot.”
Instead, a yellow card issued against Harvard allowed the Tigers to take the ball back with 1:55 left in the half. Princeton would take advantage of the turnover, quickly putting two points on its side of the board on back-to-back goals by midfielder Anya Gersoff. What could have been a 6-4 contest instead became an 8-3 spread.
Things went from bad to worse, as the Tigers piled on three more unanswered goals to put the game at a daunting 11-3 mark four minutes into the second half.
“That momentum was huge for us at the end of the first half,” Sailer said. “Then to be able to come out and score the first three second half goals and expand the lead definitely was the turning point.”
But the Crimson continued to fight back. When it did get its offense in position, it showed flashes of the brilliance that has made the Harvard attack one of the most potent in the Ivy League this year. Todd and Romeo both took advantage of defensive mismatches, striking for two unassisted goals each. In addition, Alexis Nicolia and Sophia Capone both capitalized on free position shots and put in one goal each.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the momentum Princeton had already gained would prove to be too much to overcome, as the Tigers held on the rest of the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A two-goal lead never seemed so small, as the No. 17 Harvard men’s lacrosse team watched its advantage slip away to No. 11 Penn (6-3, 3-2 Ivy) on Saturday afternoon. The 8-7 overtime loss at Franklin Field marked the Crimson’s first dropped Ivy League contest of the season, ending Harvard’s longest conference winning streak since 1998.
“We played a great game overall, but we just couldn’t execute at the end,” Harvard coach Chris Wocjik ’96 said.
Up 7-5 midway through the fourth quarter, Harvard (7-5, 3-1) looked as if it would remain undefeated in league play. But Penn wasn’t done yet. After an unassisted goal from the Quakers’ Zack Losco and an untimely Crimson offsides call, Penn found the back of the net with just 13 seconds remaining in regulation.
“We are really upset about the outcome, obviously,” co-captain Joe Petrucci said. “We outplayed them for the majority of the game, but they made a couple of key stops and some key plays that eventually lost us the game.”
The Harvard attacking unit outshot the home team, 36-27, led by two goals and an assist from co-captain Peter Schwartz. Sophomore Devin Dwyer also contributed three assists, bringing him to 38 on the season. Against the Quakers, Harvard saw an end to its eight game streak of scoring at least 10 goals.
“[Junior goaltender] Jake Gambitsky played an outstanding game,” Petrucci said. “As always he was really reliable, he made some excellent saves, and he was really the reason that our defense held them to a low number. He’s been a big part of our defense all year and he played a great game today.”
The stopper came up with 10 saves on the day, keeping the Crimson in the match until the final moments. But Quaker goalie Brian Feeney had a standout game between the posts, tallying 13 saves.
“It was a hard fought game overall,” Wocjik said. “We had great effort. We won the majority of the faceoffs, the effort was great on groundballs…. [Penn] just didn’t fall for it.”
Senior Gabriel Mendola set the pace for the Crimson for the second straight Ancient Eight matchup. Mendola won 13 of the 18 faceoffs at the midline.
“Gabe did a great job again,” said Wocjik. “He has been critical this season. He came into this game like he comes into them all. He was confident and did a really good job fighting to the ball and helping us come up with the possession.”
With his confidence and drive, Mendola tied his career high of 10 ground ball pickups. In the last three games, Mendola has won 37 of his 55 faceoffs and collected 22 ground balls.
“It was a solid effort on both ends of the field,” Wocjik said. “The defense kept it a relatively low-scoring game.”
Junior long stick midfielder Brian Fischer set a career high three caused turnovers and scooped up five loose balls, while sophomore defender Stephen Jahelka tallied a season high six ground balls.
The teams’ reunion was nearly identical to last year’s meeting, when the Crimson topped the Quakers, 8-7, on an extra time bullet from the stick of then-sophomore midfielder Murphy Vandervelde 1:18 into overtime.
“Penn is a very good team,” Wocjik said. “We’ve played some very close games with Penn, with a number of overtime games in the last four years. They’re a very strong team, and they have always been very good defensively. I thought today was the same thing. It was just a great, hard fought battle. I give them credit. They were in it to win it.”
The two teams have played beyond the final buzzer in three of the past four regular season contests, while Penn holds a 2-1 advantage in these overtime matchups. Saturday’s loss maintains Harvard’s position atop the Ivy League, though the Crimson now shares first with Cornell.
“We have to put this one behind us,” Petrucci said. “I think it’s really important that we stay positive and keep our confidence. Our goals that we put out for ourselves at the beginning of the season are still out there for us. We can still achieve all of them, but we have to be our best for these last couple of games and into the postseason.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the only outdoor home meet of the season for both teams, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field programs gave Crimson fans plenty to cheer about.
Hosting rival Yale on Saturday at McCurdy Outdoor Track, Harvard recorded two dominant victories. The women notched an 87-54 win, while the men handed the Bulldogs a humbling 104-34 defeat.
The Crimson won 24 of the 33 events contested in the rare dual meet. While both programs often split up their rosters and send competitors to disparate meets in a single weekend, all of the athletes on both teams participated against Yale.
Having full rosters proved vital for Harvard, as the Crimson’s superior depth allowed it to dominate the podium in multiple events.
“It’s really just nice to participate in the tradition, everybody had good energy and we had good weather,” sophomore Autumne Franklin said. “It was a good event overall.”
Franklin led the Harvard women with two victories, one in the 100-meter hurdles with a time of 13.72 seconds and the other in the 200-meter, which she finished in 24.41.
Despite the disparity in score throughout the meet, the athletes tried to maintain their intensity and not let their concentration wane.
“Trying to run your own race was probably the biggest thing that our group was focusing on, I know our whole team was focusing on,” Franklin said. “[We tried] to perform well even though we didn’t have extremely high competition.”
Also notching two victories for the Crimson was junior Jarvis Harris, who won the 110 hurdles by over a second with a time of 14.11. He also won a closer race in the 400 hurdles, crossing the line in 52.78.
The throwing athletes had strong performances on both the men’s and women’s sides, winning every event and sweeping two of them. Junior Ben Glauser won the men’s hammer throw by more than five meters, besting teammate and freshman Josh Whitener. Senior Dustin Brode took third for the Crimson to complete the 1-2-3 sweep.
Harvard recorded another sweep in the men’s shot put, which Glauser also won with a throw of 17.71m. He was followed by Brode and fellow junior Igor Liokumovich, who took second and third, respectively.
Junior Dean Sullivan dominated in the men’s javelin, besting second-place Whitener by almost 20m with a toss of 62.0m.
In the women’s throwing events, freshman Nikki Okwelogu led the way, winning both the discus and the shot put. She threw the discus 43.87m and heaved the shot 14.34m.
Senior Hannah Mayer added a win in the women’s javelin, while senior Adabelle Ekechukwu won the women’s hammer throw, completing a sweep for the Crimson in the throwing events.
“The field events have been a real bedrock for us,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was great to see Nikki come away with the two wins…and Ben Glauser with the two wins.”
In a day of stellar performances for many Harvard athletes, a few of them moved into the record books on Saturday. Glauser and Okwelogu moved into fourth all-time at Harvard in the hammer throw and the shot put, respectively, while Harris’s time in the 400 hurdles put him at seventh all-time.
Harris’s effort in the 400 hurdles was remarkable considering it was his first time running the event. His performance in the event marks a continuation of his strong performances in hurdle events, as he broke Harvard records in the 60 and 110 hurdles last year.
The results for both the men’s and women’s squads extended a stretch of overall dominance against the Bulldogs; the men picked up their fourth straight win against Yale, while the women beat their rivals for the seventh consecutive year.
The teams and the fans could not have asked for a better day, as the warm weather and the cloudless sky made for perfect conditions in which to compete. Fans turned out in droves to support the squads, and the Crimson did not disappoint.
As it has throughout the season, Harvard will separate into groups and attend multiple meets next week, with four different events on the schedule.
“I was really pleased with the way both the men and women competed,” Saretsky said. “A lot of things went our way, we had a great day and great fan support, and I was very pleased to come away with the two wins.”

The westward wind of Stanford apparently blows. Lately, Stanford’s admissions rate has been dropping like a stone—down to 5.07%, half of what it was for the class of 2007. But Harvard students, alumni and donors, do not hold to your hats for too long: What do Kim and Kanye’s Vogue Magazine issue and Stanford have in common? They are here today, gone tomorrow. (We wish!)
 
Is Stanford just another Californian fad? Let's take a look at the qualities that led to the university's meteoric rise.
 1. It has a posh real name. At its founding some 250 years after Harvard’s, Stanford University was named “Leland Stanford Junior University” which remains its official name.
 
2. Make-out parties. Stanford has earned an enviable reputation amongst frustrated high schoolers for its “Full Moon on the Quad” parties. Think Incestfest on the Quad Lawn.
 
3. Bikes are in. If I thought the walk from Hurlbut to Annenburg was bad, try Stanford’s monumental campus. And while bikes may be prohibited on the Harvard Yard, they are quite hip out in Palo Alto.
 
4. Jorts are also in. The perfect combination of prep and cotton, jorts are a very good look. Yet jorts are woefully uncomfortable for the Cambridge winter, a prolonged season that also includes its autumn and spring. Assured 70 degrees weather in the spring semester? Jorts, jorts, jorts.
 
5. Become an astronaut. The dream of every young kid can become a reality at Stanford. Whereas Harvard lacks a consistent supply of alumni going into astronautics—instead favoring consulting and hedge funds—Stanford counts 17 current astronauts among its graduates.
 
6. Become a reality TV star. Whilst Harvard may boast Tyra Banks and the team behind The Simpsons, Stanford provides the unique opportunity to be famous for being famous. Such is the case of Alex Michel, the eponymous “bachelor” in "The Bachelor’s" very first season. The FIRST season; such is Stanford’s innovative reputation.
Will Stanford’s reputation ever be cut down to size, dare we say, like a tree? Not as long as Leland Stanford Junior University continues in its Cardinal values of global name recognition, prurient student life, and alumni impacting the world in new ways.

The annual Advising Fortnight, designed to give freshmen a look at Harvard’s 49 different concentrations (rumor has it that “Bragging About How Stressed You Are” was just approved by the College), just came to a close. By now freshmen have had a chance to weigh their options and judge what path might be best for them. Now it’s Flyby’s turn to do what we do best: judge people based on cursory information.
 
Any kind of Biology - Let us guess, pre-med track? Let us guess again: You’re interested in human development and regenerative biology? How original. You’re smart, but you’re about as typical a Harvard student as we’re going to find. Side note: At least be hilarious and concentrate in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
 
Physics - You own at least two graphic tees—one with a periodic table and another with Einstein’s head and some caption that you think is witty but most (normal) people don’t understand. You were also wishing to get placed into Leverett on Housing Day (sorry if that didn’t work out).
 
Mechanical Engineering - You have bags under your eyes, and you’ve been stress-eating recently. It’s OK; you get used to the p-sets eventually (I think—I’m an English concentrator).
 
Mathematics - We could say anything right now; reading a commoner’s publication like Flyby won’t help you theorize about Fermat’s Last Theorem (yes, we had to Wikipedia that).
Applied Mathematics - Your first memory is of completing a Sudoku puzzle.
 
Economics - You’ve posted at least one status while taking Ec10, in which you’ve recklessly complained about how you disagree with N. Gregory Mankiw even though he’s your professor. You’ve also never taken a midterm without claiming that “totally failed it” so that you don’t get your hopes up.
 
English - You have an affinity for tweed jackets and leather chairs. You also probably talk with your hands and chuckle inwardly when you mention a little-known book (“Burning Bright” by John Steinbeck, anyone?) to your engineering roommate and he/she hasn’t read it.
 
Literature - See above, but you also lament how “totally mainstream” the English concentration is.
 
Folklore and Mythology - Wait, we think we’re psychic now—you won’t find a job in your field. Better make the most of your electives and secondary. Also, you’ve probably listened to an angry Classics concentrator talk about how your department makes theirs look less serious.
Government - Athletes?
 
Earth and Planetary Sciences - For at least one summer, you tried going shoeless because shoes are a human construct that limits our connection with the Earth and makes us callous towards things like pollution and global warming.
Long story short, you can make fun of every concentration at Harvard (especially the ones with funny names). Don’t let the potential insults stop you from picking whatever concentration suits your fancy, and never forget that there’s always a concentration worse than yours (it’s called being a Yale graduate).
