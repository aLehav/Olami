After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After last year’s wildly successful “Bohemian Rhapsody,” summer hit “Rocketman,” and recent releases such as “Yesterday” and “Blinded by the Light,” it seems Hollywood has found great success and box office potential in the music biopic. Drawing critical acclaim for their actors’ detailed embodiments of famous icons or, at the bare minimum, pleasing fans with optimistic tributes to their favorite artists, these films are saturating the movie industry. Director Rupert Goold’s “Judy” about the Wizard of Oz darling’s tragic final year seems, in theory, to fit this hackneyed format.
Set in 1969 just months before Judy Garland’s death from a barbiturate overdose at age 47, the film provides a dark, vulnerable window into the ex-starlet’s life at a decisive low point. She fights to stay financially afloat, suffers from a pervasive addiction to pills, enters a battle for custody over her own children, and must leave them behind as she travels to London for a tour that might hopefully reignite her dying career. Renée Zellweger takes up the challenge of portraying the increasingly anxious and self-destructive Garland with absolute dedication and compassion that help her live up to the bar set by other acclaimed biopic actors like Rami Malek and Taron Egerton, while adding her own spin to Garland’s character. While Malek won an Oscar for his shockingly precise embodiment of Freddie Mercury, nailing Mercury’s every movement and gesture from the iconic Live Aid Concert, Zellweger shines due to her ability to tug on the audience's heartstrings, not necessarily because of her uncanny ability to mimic the singer. Goold does not shy away from exploring Garland’s inner demons as she speeds towards her untimely death yet avoids a completely tragic, defeatist tone that would make the movie ultimately too painful to watch. Striking a balance that any film based on real-life events must grapple with, “Judy” manages to sprinkle in sudden moments of elation and awe while ultimately leaving the audience with a more profound, empathetic sense of grief.
Based on Peter Quilter’s Broadway play “End of the Rainbow,” “Judy” centers around Garland’s final tour as she fights against increasingly hostile media coverage, recklessly marries a young entrepreneur, and frantically attempts to repair the damaged relationship she has with her children, but Goold also makes the decision to include flashbacks to Garland’s abusive childhood at MGM Studios. Bookending Garland’s tale with the tear-jerking final chapter and the brutal first pages that laid the foundations for trauma that she futilely tries to escape, the filmmaker managed to both avoid a cliché depiction of a star fallen from grace and enhance the story’s overall emotional impact. Young Judy’s (Darci Shaw) interactions with a slimy MGM executive make one’s skin crawl, highlighting the problematic power dynamics that are especially relevant in a post-Weinstein America. Overall, Zellweger’s depiction of the unstable Garland falling apart from drug addiction and insomnia is all the more gut-wrenching, once the audience also bears witness to her childhood memories of movie executives refusing to give her food and instead forcing her to take diet pills to keep off weight and “pep pills” to help her stave off exhaustion and hunger.
Despite exploring dark topics like drug and child abuse, the film also celebrates the singer’s untamable artistic passion and has moments of joy that shine in contrast to the general gloomy tone. Zellweger’s performances of nostalgic, powerful numbers like “By Myself” and “The Trolley Song” are, without a doubt, highlights of the film, and when she’s not playing a Judy who is strung out on drugs or extremely drunk on stage, her infectious energy and all-encompassing exertion are virtuosic — not to mention, she actually sings all the songs in the movie herself. While her deft physicality and intensity make her performance Oscar-worthy, Zellweger even manages to convey musical passion and love of the spotlight just through the wide-eyed, awe-filled look that made Judy Garland so famous.
The song “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” is an American classic cherished for its resonant message of hope in the face of adversity, but never has it been as heart-breaking and fragile as Zellweger’s version is in the final moments of the film. The audience chiming in once Judy’s damaged, weathered voice struggles to hit the notes might typically seem cheesy, but the buildup of all Garland’s trials and tribulations, mixed with her genuine happiness in this moment, make it an absolute tear-jerking finale to a bittersweet story.

“Friends” is around, yes, but not necessarily relevant — though this hasn’t stopped teenagers from hosting themed parties about the TV show. Having debuted 25 years ago and ended 15 years ago, it would be an understatement to say that the show is dated. That, of course, has not stopped people from binge-watching it, especially since Netflix announced the show would be leaving the site at the end of 2019. People are now uncertain about how to view it: Is it a tropey, white-washed, unrealistic portrayal of New York life that is also at times racist, sexist, and homophobic? Yes. Is it also clever, well-paced, debate-provoking, and full of excellent costuming decisions? Also yes.
The fact that one can answer yes to both these questions is precisely why we’re still arguing about its existence all these years later, and why many a thought piece has been written. (Including this one, of course.)
I’ll add to the noise and say that Joey and Phoebe’s relationship was the most touching one on the show, one built on respect and communication. Chandler and Monica ended up together in the way that many people today want to meet their significant others: They were friends first, and then it clicked. Rachel was Rachel and Ross got too many free passes for his irritating and controlling behavior, but he was still lovable when talking about dino bones (even if the rest of the group found his job annoying).
The demographic that watched “Friends” at the time it aired liked basking in the idea of the ideal American: young, white, chummy, making money without seeming to put effort in the workplace, owning spacious apartments that in real life would have no shortage of mice. It’s idyllic. Half the charm is in the fantasy of wishing we could be them.
The caveat to all this is that while television networks should have been more true to life back in the ‘90s, the brutal truth is that they weren’t, and that the only solution is to address certain topics with sensitivity and better represent their viewers. It would have made for better watching if Ross weren’t a clingy jerk in season two, when he harassed Rachel about her perfectly collegial relationship with her co-worker Mark, and it absolutely would have been better if the group hadn’t immediately questioned Joey’s sexuality when he bought a purse. There are indeed many head-scratching moments that can’t necessarily be excused, and shouldn’t be.
Hype is generally suspicious and demands verification. This is largely because people become exponentially more stupid in large groups, and because if they somehow manage to be correct, it’s important to be able to discuss the latest thing with some level of expertise. The hype around “Friends” has been rekindled because of the 25 year anniversary, but in a way, it never really died down. But why? Why is this show so gripping? The mundanity, the aspiration? Maybe it’s the idealization of a world to which some people now aspire, given the shattering of our political system?
Ultimately, though, it would be better if “Friends” disappeared from social media feeds and endless online newspaper coverage and became a preserved relic of the past. Just like we put distance between us and Picasso, Elizabeth Taylor, and other questionable late figures — despite appreciating the place of their art in their historical periods — it may be time to do the same with “Friends.” Even the discussion is tired. With the exception of the current ‘90s fashion revival, it’s best to keep some cultural relics in their own era.
And, finally: whether or not they were on a break, whatever the terms of that may be, Ross treated Rachel badly for much of their relationship (I repeat: controlling behavior). Honestly, that’s worse.

News of school shootings pierce in a uniquely nauseating way. Parents send their children, teens, and young adults off to school so that they can grow and learn for their bright futures — flawlessly innocent, perfectly defenseless. The act of robbing children of those futures, destroying that innocence, and taking advantage of such defenselessness is too evil and sickening to convey with words.
Also sickening are those who make any attempt to profit off of or sensationalize such a tragedy.
On September 15, a clothing brand named Bstroy released Instagram posts from a fashion show in New York launching some of their new items. Among the newly debuted items are four sweatshirts: one green with “Sandy Hook” written across the front, one light blue with the words “Stoneman Douglas,” one faded red with “Virginia Tech,” and one gray with “Columbine” in light blue letters.
All four sweatshirts are riddled with bullet holes.
I cannot fathom why the designers of those sweatshirts and the owners of the company, Dieter Grams and Brick Owens, thought that this stunt would be anything other than insensitive and disgusting.
Survivors and victims’ families were justifiably outraged by the sweatshirts. I cannot even imagine how appalling it must be for those affected by the tragedies to see their pain being marketed as a fashion statement. Beloved daughters, sons, siblings, and friends lost their lives to real-life bullet holes through their real-life clothing. For entire communities, these shootings were not a movie scene or a distant news peg; they are a reality that people must continue to grapple with today. To even create, much less market, these sweatshirts is disrespectful to the victims and to all who loved them. Even if Bstroy did not intend to sell the sweatshirts as they so claim, attempting to gain publicity or notoriety at the expense of others’ loss is despicable nonetheless.
I want to see the images taken off of Bstroy’s and Brick Owens’ Instagrams and I never want so much as a thread of one of those sweatshirts to be produced again. I want consumers to boycott Bstroy so they can never sell another article of clothing. In my rage and in my anger, I want the producers of these sweatshirts to know even just one ounce of the pain that those affected by the tragedies have to carry with them every day of their lives.
But then I take a step back and I remember the lessons I learned growing up in the town neighboring Sandy Hook. Their message is this: “We are Sandy Hook, We Choose Love.”
For Sandy Hook, the emphasis has never been on vengefulness, hatred, or bitterness. The community has preached, and continues to preach, kindness and empathy above all. Kindness and empathy, even in the face of evil and hatred.
For the one green sweatshirt on Bstroy’s Instagram, there are hundreds and hundreds of “Be Kind” necklaces worn around the country as a reminder to treat others with kindness. While Bstroy might be seeking to make a profit, there are charities and funds such as the Vicki Soto Memorial Fund, the CMAK Foundation, the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Foundation, and dozens of others dedicated to spreading kindness and combating violence in memory of the Sandy Hook angels. Sandy Hook is not alone in their resilience, as the communities surrounding Columbine, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, and Virginia Tech also preach messages of kindness and love despite the suffering that they too have experienced.
I urge you, the reader, to honor the victims of these tragedies by doing as their families ask: spread kindness. Spread kindness here at Harvard, spread it in your hometowns. Wear it on your sleeve, and take it with you everywhere you go. Use instances like Bstroy’s insensitivity to remind you of the work that needs to be done and how little acts of kindness by you and I can help move us in that direction.
Of course I still want the images of the sweatshirts to be taken down. But more than that, I want the voices preaching kindness and empathy to be heard far louder than the voices preaching disrespect and insensitivity.
Choose love.

College has done an alarmingly good job of making me feel like crap. Not all the time, but a substantial enough amount that it seems worth discussing.
Harvard is an elite kind of place, stating it as such almost seems redundant at this point. Perhaps we can’t fault the institution for its nature, not when its inception was based on curating the best and brightest (and by no coincidence, the most socio-economically well off). So instead, we like to celebrate how far Harvard has come since the days its student body had largely been comprised of white men.
My theory of the modern Harvard student, however, is that we’ve held onto our continuing legacy of wanting to be different and distinct, “superior” from the rest. Smarts, spirit, and a decision behind the closed doors of the admissions office have gotten us all to this same school. But how do you distinguish yourself from people who are just as smart and spirited, if not better?
The solution comes in the form of comp processes to get into clubs that pride themselves on the numerous hoops they can make applicants jump through in the hopes of securing a spot of acceptance. It’s possible that there is substance to “merit-based” organizations like the Harvard Lampoon, which has a comp, or the Signet Society, which has an application — surely they’re justified in wanting to select who they deem as having the talent to be involved in their respective circles.
But I’ve always found something more insidious about some social clubs on campus. For those not familiar, single-gender final clubs are select organizations that would have been easy to ignore if not for their blatantly present properties on campus, and the complicated histories tied to them. You can’t quite get to the Staples on campus without passing by at least one of these mansions, identified by some tacky flag hung from their doorstep. Every fall, these organizations on campus invite students to join them in a semester long “punch process” — a time-consuming cat and mouse game where the priority for serious punch-hopefuls is to demonstrate their commitment to the social club by attending every punch event, no matter how ridiculous the timing or place.
Objectively, it might not seem like a bad thing to commit to: A private party place on campus, notorious prestige, and an impressively strong alumni network. My first experience even interacting with this more obscure realm of campus life was on a phone call to solicit donations on behalf of Harvard, where a very loyal alumni of an unrecognized student organization ranted for several minutes about his refusal to donate anything until the College’s sanctions are removed.
At the time, and even now, I can’t help but wonder what the purpose of a “social club” is — what are their missions and values, do they even exist? What do they contribute to the student body beyond a gated social scene? And a darker question — what does it mean to be rejected from such an organization? It isn’t exactly the equivalent of a failed comp process or a botched performance. Rather, the reason why one does not make the cut, is often based on that person’s social capital on campus.
Of course members of these organizations would argue that there are cuts based on commitment to the punch process, but what’s the excuse then for people who go to every event and meeting, only to still fail at achieving membership? There isn’t much insight into the metrics for deciding if a person is fit to join a social club, but the rejection is a clear statement in and of itself — you’re not good enough. For us.
It is very easy to take these superfluous decisions to a personal level — to be socially rejected is an intimately hurtful thing. But it is just as important to remember that these “elite” organizations are only as special as we let them be. My own elite circle is made up of the best kinds of people: Art history nerds and computer science whizzes, friends who always save me a seat at lecture, and blockmates who never fail to make me laugh after a tiring day. My network is made up of teaching fellows who offer to stay past office hours and House tutors who love to geek out over comics. I’ve been awed to know people who unfalteringly share their truths, and been humbled to be with those who are brave enough to be vulnerable. Beyond campus, I am honored to know uncles who freely volunteer at masjids, organizers who rally to normalize mental health in their communities, and advocates who exercise utmost patience and compassion in supporting their siblings with special needs.
The people I’ve surrounded myself with are people who inspire me to strive to be my best self. They may not have accolades and titles, and they might not even want that sort of recognition. I certainly did not have to complete any punch process to earn their companionship. Truly great people, you see, freely and gladly share the warmth, intellect, and joy of their greatness.
And these are the kinds of circles I want to keep forever.

Amid a national debate about the utility of a liberal-arts education, wherein some universities have considered replacing some humanities departments with more career-oriented pathways, Harvard’s History department has decided to offer a set of new foundational courses and a “career course cluster” track in a bid to attract more students.
We view this “crisis in the humanities,” and the History department’s response to it, as a phenomenon best understood only by considering the ways in which our economy, Harvard, and higher education in general have changed in recent years. As the number of concentrators in the humanities and some social sciences has dwindled here at Harvard, we believe the shift away from these subjects can be explained by a tragic feedback loop between the University’s changing relationship with the economy at large, and students’ increasing academic orientation towards career-related fields, partly fueled by misconceptions about the utility of the humanities.
This phenomenon may appear appropriate and inevitable, if one believes students go to college purely to learn things that will help them find a job. This is a natural outcome of economic demand and incentives, especially as the most recent financial crisis and concerns about college affordability loom large in the minds of our generation.
This functional attitude towards higher education is only reinforced at Harvard. Through a well-oiled recruiting mechanism, our peers — 48 percent of surveyed recent grads — are funneled into fields like consulting, technology, and financial services. The significant presence of these industries has reified a culture where students may feel as if working in these fields, and studying specific concentrations to prepare for them, are their only option. We find this trend particularly troubling for industries we believe have done relatively little to further the social good.
However, it does not necessarily follow that the humanities and social sciences fail to equip students for future careers. Rather, we believe this misconception — the failure to recognize the important communicative and qualitative analysis skills that these fields foster for their students — partly explains the crisis facing the humanities and social sciences.
But at issue here is not only the utility value of the humanities and social sciences. Instead, this functional attitude towards higher education at large seems to us at bottom a rejection of the liberal arts education. As a Board, we believe in preserving the educational philosophy of the liberal arts — studying history and the humanities has deep, enduring cultural value that goes beyond immediate functional value. These fields prompt us with questions about meaning, contextualise our studies of the natural world, enable reflections about long-standing but biased assumptions, and define what it means to live within the dictates of empirical and mathematical rules. In a world of numbers, the social sciences and humanities help us understand the space between them.
Though practically difficult to achieve, a major reworking of the relationship between higher education and leading roles in the economy seems necessary if we hope, as a society, to bestow greater value on the modes of thinking taught in a liberal arts curriculum. Otherwise, there may not be much humanities departments can do, especially if students continue to opt for other fields of study. Therefore, we encourage affected departments and faculties to begin discussing this issue more widely, if they have not already done so — to show the great value that the traditional liberal arts curriculum can provide to all students, regardless of their career or life trajectory.

The Undergraduate Council is currently working to bring to campus small robots powered by artificial intelligence that can deliver food to students, according to Dunster House Representative Noah Harris ’22.
Starship Technologies, the company that manufactures the robots, aims to “make local delivery faster, smarter and more cost-efficient.” Weighing in at under 100 pounds, the robots operate autonomously on streets and sidewalks. Ordered food stays locked inside the machine until the buyer unlocks it with a smartphone app.
According to Harris, Starship’s robots already operate on the campuses of George Mason University, Northern Arizona University, Purdue University, and the University of Pittsburgh. Turbotax’s employees on their corporate campus also use these robots.
Harris said he got the idea to bring the robots to campus after seeing a story on the news about Starship robots delivering food on other college campuses. He then contacted Starship Technologies to plan to bring the robots to Harvard.
“I was just like, this would be a really cool thing to implement at Harvard,” Harris said. “Harvard's like a really open kind of campus and large sidewalks and a lot of space.”
Sean Eckard, senior manager of business development at Starship Technologies, said the project is awaiting approval from the Cambridge City Council. Eckard said he believes student support will help the approval process.
“We engaged with the city of Cambridge, and the idea is, I think it would be good if there’s a request from the student body to the city, that we would like to have these robots here,” Eckard said.
According to Eckard, when the company and the UC proposed the project to Harvard University Dining Services, HUDS declined to participate because it wanted to focus on community dining experiences inside of student dining halls.
“[The University has] been supportive, of course,” Eckard said. “In this instance, we’re going to need to sign on neighboring restaurants, so private restaurants. This requires us to drive on the City of Cambridge’s sidewalks.”
Harris said he hopes the UC will be able to hire student workers to operate the robots, as the robots require personnel to place the food inside them.
“They’re going to the various restaurants to get the food to put in the robot or going to HUDS and working with their staff because someone has to put the food in the robots,” Harris said of the student workers.
The University does not oppose this new project and is waiting on approval from the city, according to an email from University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
“If and when private vendors obtain all required approvals to operate on City sidewalks, we don’t anticipate any material obstacles to allowing them to operate on the sidewalks within campus as well,” O’Rourke said in an email.

Cambridge residents and city officials have started to question the state of pedestrian safety after 67-year-old librarian Sharon Hamer was struck and killed last week crossing the street in Harvard Square outside of the crosswalk.
Several days later, during Monday’s City Council meeting, Vice Mayor Jan Devereux introduced a policy order calling on her colleagues to commit to studying how pedestrian safety can be improved during the upcoming redesign of the Harvard Square Kiosk.
As Out of Town News, the kiosk’s longtime occupant, prepares to leave its space ahead of major renovations, Devereux said in an interview that there is a clear opportunity and obligation to evaluate how the Square can become more pedestrian-friendly.
"I really want to ask our staff to just take a second, third, fourth, look at the design, and how it's going to improve the conditions because we have so many people crossing the plaza now,” she said. “I just think we're obligated to really scrutinize it very carefully.”
“I think this crash is really a wake up call that we can't simply ignore,” she added.
Wendy Landman, executive director of WalkBoston — a pedestrian safety group that is working across the state to make cities safer and more convenient for walking — said her organization is focused on improving “everyday walking” such as travel to schools and transit hubs. In terms of safety, she said she is most concerned with distracted driving.
“When you walk down the street, whether you're in Cambridge, or Boston, or rural towns in the Berkshires, it feels like half the drivers are looking at their phones,” she said. “The number of fatalities has been growing across the country, and there are a lot of people trying to figure out what all was going on.”
While crashes involving motor vehicles in Cambridge have dropped since 2000, the number of crashes involving pedestrians has stayed “generally consistent,” according to a 2017 Cambridge Police Department report. The report attributes this fact to the city’s rising population and associated rising number of pedestrians on Cambridge’s streets. Crashes involving either pedestrians or cyclists make up an average 17 percent of total crashes annually.
Patrick C. Braga, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, said the Square has several “shortcomings” with regard to ensuring the pedestrian and cyclist safety. Among the most significant are narrow sidewalks and a street design that gives priority to cars, he said.
“I'm almost punished through the streetscape design of having to constantly have to reassert just my human presence to others and hope that I can get empathy from the people who are driving to not endanger me and not see me as an obstacle in their way, but just somebody trying to get somewhere,” he said.
“Distracted walking should not be punishable by death in a highly walked dense area like Harvard Square,” he added.
Devereux said that there is no “magic bullet” to solve the problem, but that the city is taking steps to improve safety. She cited decreased speed limits and improved street design as part of an ongoing effort to address deadly crashes.
“Street design is key — looking for ways to continue to make the street infrastructure reflect that pedestrians and cyclists have equal, if not greater, right, to be using the street and need to be protected and separated and very visible,” she said.
Landman said that Cambridge’s city government has been a strong partner with her organization in improving pedestrian safety. She added that “concerted efforts” by the city have helped to improve overall safety, though it still has its issues.
“A great many Cantabrigians walk to transit, walk to their cars, walk in general,” she said. “[City officials] have been hard on it, but it has obviously not been fully successful.”
Braga said he proposed a design overhaul for the Square that would include a roundabout with smaller lanes and “prioritize safety.” He added that additional measures like changing the number of car lanes in certain areas and relying less on traffic lights could alleviate some of the dangers throughout Cambridge.
“It shouldn’t be that kind of rigid, over-engineered control,” he said.
Braga also said the possibility of eliminating car traffic entirely from the Square posed an “extraordinarily promising” solution so long as it were to be sufficiently studied. Both Devereux and Landman agreed.
Cambridge resident Heather M. Hoffman said that while she believes many approaches must be considered when addressing pedestrian safety, she believes walkers must be more “assertive” in order to help prevent crashes.
“I understand that my job [as a walker] is to make sure that [drivers] know what I want to do, so that they can stop and let me do it,” she said. “And I get so annoyed with the pedestrians who hang out on the curb, waiting for someone to read their mind and let them cross. The law says ‘stop for a pedestrian in a crosswalk,’ not a pedestrian texting and thinking about a crosswalk.”

Harvard’s graduate student union announced two new members of its bargaining committee on Thursday, adding new faces to the body responsible for contract negotiations with the University.
Statistics Ph.D. candidate Cory W. McCartan and Biostatistics Ph.D. candidate Lee Kennedy-Shaffer were announced as the two new members of Harvard Graduate Students Union – United Automobile Workers’ bargaining committee, according to an email sent to union members by the union’s elections committee. There are now 10 members on the bargaining committee.
McCartan and Kennedy-Shaffer were the only two students to run for five open positions. No vote was held and they won the election by acclamation, according to returning bargaining committee member Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15. As a result, three committee seats remain unfilled.
McCartan wrote in an email that before coming to Harvard, he organized Grinnell College’s Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers and negotiated three contracts while he was an undergraduate there.
“Now, at Harvard, I hope to use my bargaining experience to help negotiate a strong and fair first contract,” McCartan wrote.
Kennedy-Shaffer said the 2016 strike by the Harvard University Dining Services workers inspired him to run for the bargaining committee.
“I’ve been very impressed with everyone on the bargaining committee and the work that they’ve put in so far,” Kennedy-Shaffer said.
The election came after five members left HGSU’s bargaining committee last spring following graduation or moving away from Cambridge. Of the three vacant seats, one is the spot reserved for a representative from Harvard College. Evan C. MacKay ’19, the former College representative, graduated last spring.
Sandalow-Ash wrote in an emailed statement that even though no undergraduates ran for a bargaining committee position, College students are “heavily involved” in union organizing.
“Our bargaining committee works closely with undergrad student workers, and we are committed to winning a contract that meets the needs of undergrad and grad workers alike,” Sandalow-Ash wrote.
Sandalow-Ash added that returning members are looking forward to welcoming McCartan and Kennedy-Shaffer and will work to bring them “up to speed” on the negotiations.
“We are excited to see the new perspectives that our new bargaining committee members will bring,” she wrote.
Since HGSU and Harvard began negotiations in October 2018, they have come to tentative agreements on a number of proposals including travel reimbursements, health, and safety equipment. They remain deadlocked over central contract issues such as grievance procedures, compensation, and healthcare benefits.

Harvard Earth and Planetary Sciences professor Jerry X. Mitrovica was one of 26 individuals awarded the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship Wednesday.
The MacArthur fellowship is a $625,000 “no-strings-attached” award, granted to “extraordinarily talented and creative individuals as an investment in their potential,” according to the MacArthur Foundation’s site.
Foundation president John G. Palfrey ’94 wrote on the site that this year’s cohort of fellows “give us reason for hope.”
“From addressing the consequences of climate change to furthering our understanding of human behavior this year’s 26 extraordinary MacArthur Fellows demonstrate the power of individual creativity to reframe old problems, spur reflection, create new knowledge, and better the world for everyone,” he wrote.
Mitrovica runs a lab group that studies sea level changes on time scales ranging from seconds to millions of years.
He said his group is most often associated with glacial “fingerprints” — the idea that melting ice sheets do not raise sea levels uniformly, like in a bathtub, but rather create specific spatial patterns.
“We come up with models for how the sea level should vary from place to place,” Mitrovica said. “And that pattern looks nothing like the bathtub. It changes from place to place dramatically. And we provide the community with those patterns.”
Mitrovica said that these patterns can be counterintuitive.
“Some scientists still scratch their heads about it, but where an ice sheet melts, sea levels will actually fall,” he said. “But you're gonna pay the price somewhere, right? The further you get away from the ice sheet, the more of a sea level rise.”
He added that the “locations with the highest sea level rise” will include the east and west coasts of the United States.
Mitrovica said his group personalizes patterns of climate change for communities.
“For many years in sea level research, all people ever did was quote the average,” Mitrovica said. “If you do what you do in the Boston area, you don't really care what the average is. You want to know what what it’s doing in the Boston Harbor.”
Mitrovica said he was “shocked” to receive the award, and looks forward to harnessing it in order to promote equity and inclusion in the sciences.
“I have a great group of graduate students. They’re activists in every way,” he said. “And I think I was going to talk a lot in the next few weeks about what is a way at least to use part of this funding to address equity and diversity issues.”
Sophie L. Coulson, a graduate student working in Mitrovica’s research group, said that the professor has already sought guidance from his mentees on how he can best use the award to improve diversity within the science community.
“We've talked about having high school students work with us in the lab during the summer,” Coulson said. “That's definitely something that we're excited to participate in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ad Hoc Committee for Harvard Divest — a group of Harvard alumni advocating for the University to divest its endowment from fossil fuels— raised $60,000 to hire two coordinators for alumni activities through the Cambridge climate group Better Future Project.
The committee raised money for Better Future Project to hire former College students and divestment organizers Canyon S. Woodward ’15 and Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, who is also a Maine State Representative, according to former United States Senator and Ad Hoc Committee member Timothy E. Wirth ’61.
Wirth said the group is continuing to push the University to divest from fossil fuels through the creation of these new positions.
“Now's a critical time, you know why, there is nothing to wait for,” Wirth said. “We ought to get going and do everything we possibly can to get Harvard to grow up.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s previous statements about divestment. Bacow has said that while he agrees with concerns about climate change, he disagrees with divestment as the best mechanism. Bacow has argued that the University should use its scholarship and engage with fossil fuel companies to address the issue.
Both Woodward and Maxmin officially work for the Better Future Project — headed by Executive Director Craig S. Altemose — but focus their efforts specifically on Harvard. The pair is involved with the group’s Divest Ed project, which works to expand the fossil fuel divestment campaign on college campuses.
Altemose said Wirth had the idea for Better Future Project to hire Woodward to work exclusively on divestment at Harvard.
“So he works for Better Future Projects, not explicitly for the Ad Hoc Committee, though certainly works very closely with them,” Altemose said. “But I think ultimately, we really see the students as his supervisor, in the grandest sense that we want to make sure the work that he is doing is very much in line with what the students believe is strategic for the campaign.”
As undergraduates, Woodward and Maxim were both co-directors of Divest Harvard — a student-led group that organizes for fossil fuel divestment. During their time at the College, the group organized a week-long blockade of Massachusetts Hall, which houses the offices of the University President.
Current Divest Harvard members hosted “Heat Week” last April, a modified version of the original protest featuring rallies and panels about divestment, but no blockade.
Woodward — who started in August — said he has been mainly focusing on engaging alumni on the issue of divestment. Woodward is currently planning a retreat for alumni who were involved in fossil fuel divestment activism.
“I'm still in really good communication with tons of folks from my years at Harvard, who were involved with this campaign on campus,” Woodward said. “I think it was one of the most meaningful, impactful experiences that a lot of us had at Harvard.”
Working part-time for the Divest Ed project, Maxmin spends most of her time serving in the Maine House of Representatives. She did not respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.
Woodward said this is a critical time to get involved with divestment. Last week, members of the group rallied in the Science Center Plaza and at Boston City Hall Plaza as part of a worldwide climate strike.
“We’re in this total crisis moment with climate change, and we have to get meaningful action now,” Woodward said. “And so, that's why I'm back. I think this is a really important moment for institutions like Harvard to step up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Office of Career Services launched a new online platform that helps international students find jobs in the United States and aids American students in locating jobs abroad earlier this month.
The platform, Interstride, allows students to look up individual companies and see how many visas they have sponsored. Interstride also provides information on visa application processes in different countries, practical advice for living abroad, and organizational tools to help structure the job search.
OCS decided to subscribe to Interstride because international students — both in the College and in the graduate schools — have increasingly faced challenges in securing jobs in the U.S.
“Last year, it was particularly difficult for our international students, particularly our College students, to land jobs in the United States if they wanted them because our government has been making the visa process even a little more challenging,” OCS Director Robin Mount said.
International students wanting to work in the U.S. must be in accordance with F-1 student visa regulations. To work in the U.S., F-1 visa holders can apply for one of two programs: Curricular Practical Training or Optional Practical Training.
CPT must be completed before graduation and is incorporated into a student’s plan of study. OPT can be granted initially for up to twelve months and can be used either while a student is in college or post-graduation. Most international students searching for summer internships apply for CPT, because the timeframe for obtaining OPT tends to be lengthy.
“I have international friends who applied for OPT but didn’t get an answer on time, so they had to cancel their summer plans in the U.S. and find something else to do,” Tunisia-native Wassim Marrakchi ’21 said.
Some international students have also reported longer processing times for OPT applications in recent years.
Students with E.U. passports have also faced new challenges in their job searches due to Brexit, according to Mount. In the past, some E.U. citizens chose to work at multinational corporations with branches in the U.K., but those opportunities are now limited given that many companies are eliminating their British branches.
With these recent difficulties in mind, OCS chose to bring Interstride to campus and will terminate their subscription to GoinGlobal — the office’s current platform for international job searches — on Monday.
“I think GoinGlobal had been designed thinking about students who wanted to go abroad and then also happened to help students who were international students,” said OCS Associate Director of Employer Relations and Operations. “I think Interstride was instead designed by people who had been international students themselves, so it was designed with the international student in mind but also helps students who want to go abroad and has lots of country guides and things like that.”
Dimitar Karev ’21, who is from Bulgaria, said that though he believes Interstride will be helpful, there is a limit to how much the platform can be of assistance.
“Almost all the jobs that I applied to had the question, ‘Are you eligible to work in the U.S.?’ or a question like ‘Would you ever want us to sponsor you in the U.S.?’” he said. “If I ever wanted to continue full-time, I’d need to be sponsored, and a lot of companies don’t sponsor and don’t accept international students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dipping their toes into the national political scene for an evening, six representatives of Harvard groups supporting Democratic candidates for president sparred over policy ideas and platforms at a debate held in Harvard Yard Thursday evening.
Roughly 200 undergraduates packed into a Sever Hall classroom for the event, hosted by the Harvard Political Union. Despite the debate’s intent to persuade, some attendees appeared to have made up their minds before coming, donning campaign gear for the candidates represented on stage.
HPU President Matthew S. Miller ’21, Institute of Politics Director of Diversity and Outreach Jasmine N. Hyppolite ’21, and Institute of Politics Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 introduced the debaters and laid out the event’s format.
Each debater had the opportunity to give an opening and closing statement; answer an audience question; respond to common campaign criticisms; and articulate their candidates’ position on climate change, health care, foreign policy, and education. If a candidate went over the allotted time, Miller interrupted them with loud bangs of his gavel.
Groups of Harvard College Democrats favoring Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.), South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg ’04, Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang were present at the debate. One student from each group participated in the debate as other members of each group cheered from the audience.
Each debater delivered an opening statement, giving a brief pitch for their respective candidates. M. Kate H. Travis ’22, representing Harvard for Warren, recalled hearing about Warren’s remarks in support of Planned Parenthood in 2015.
“I'm worried about one day that I or one of my friends might need a cancer screening, or an IUD, or maybe even an abortion and not be able to get it because our government decided that that was not the kind of healthcare that we wanted to provide, and who should I see on my Facebook feed but Elizabeth Warren talking about this issue,” she said.
Damian L. Richardson ’20, a member of Harvard for Kamala, focused his remarks on Harris’s record as a prosecutor.
“The criminal justice system is a more just place because Kamala entered into a system she knew was steeped in oppression and reformed it from the inside out,” Richardson said. “Let me tell you, she's ready to prosecute the case against the predator in the White House.”
During one part of the debate, the moderators asked each representative about a criticism commonly leveled at their respective candidate’s campaign. Miller asked Diego A. Garcia ’20, a member of Harvard for Biden, about Biden’s decision to support the Anti-Drug Abuse Act 0f 1986 when he was a U.S. senator representing Delaware.
“If crime were to rise under Vice President Biden's potential presidential administration, how would he craft a criminal justice policy that does not fuel racial inequality?” Miller asked.
Garcia responded, calling for the end of private prisons.
“Furthermore, we need to decriminalize marijuana,” Garcia responded. “Finally, we need to invest in preventive services — things like addiction therapy, mental health services, education.”
Midway through the event, Miller and Hyppolite ceded the floor to audience members. Faced with an audience question about Booker’s record on education while serving as mayor of Newark, N.J., Harvard Law School student and Harvard for Cory representative Andrew J. Freire defended the candidate’s decision to support charter schools in the city.
Many of the debaters used part of their closing statements to invite audience members to their groups’ regular meetings. The HPU also invited attendees to sign up for “Harvard For” email lists.
Other debaters included Piper W. Winkler ’21 from Harvard for Bernie, Michael B. Baick ’22 from Harvard for Pete, and Michael Zhu ’22 from Harvard for Yang.
Debate-watcher Lena Lofgren ’23 said she has a “strong leaning” toward voting for Warren or Sanders in the Pennsylvania primary, but that she attended the debate to hear other undergraduates’ rationales.
“In the democratic field can be hard to distinguish between different candidates, especially in such a competitive primary,” Lofgren said. “So I think it was important to me to hear the perspectives of the different candidates in this debate setting but also in particular hear why other students are attracted to them.”

Sai Shanthanand S. Rajagopal ’20 was doing research in Chennai, India in June when the city reached “Day Zero” — the day that all four reservoirs ran dry and left almost no water.
“You would see women, especially, lined up on the streets, and they'd be arguing and fighting because water tankers had to be bused in to bring in water,” Rajagopal said. “And I realized that the climate change issue isn't an ‘in the future’ thing. We have to hit these targets now.”
Witnessing first-hand the drought’s effects on the local population prompted Rajagopal — a second-generation Canadian from Winnipeg, Manitoba — to run for office. He is the Green Party candidate for the parliament race of his riding — the Canadian term for district — Winnipeg North.
Rajagopal is currently running against five other candidates, including the incumbent from the Liberal Party, Kyle Lamoureux. The Conservative Party candidate, Cameron Ogilvie, left the race after making racist remarks and has yet to be replaced.
The election is scheduled for Oct. 21, just five and a half weeks after the campaign period kicked off on Sept. 11.
Rajagopal said he turned to the Green Party because he believes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s liberal government has failed to take meaningful steps toward meeting its climate change targets including reducing emissions 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.
“I started volunteering with the Green Party of Manitoba, because they were the only party that had very actionable policy changes that would lead to the drastic reduction in carbon emissions that we need,” he said.
Rajagopal put himself into consideration as the Green Party candidate over the summer and found out he was selected in mid-August.
Apart from environmental policy, Rajagopal’s platform focuses on working with First Nations people to rework the Indian Act and combatting his riding’s growing substance abuse and opioid epidemic.
Despite remaining enrolled at the College, Rajagopal has spent the whole semester in Winnipeg up until this week, when he traveled back to campus for a midterm.
“My professors have been so understanding. They've been able to move deadlines for me, just exempt me from a lot of attendance things, and that's been very helpful,” Rajagopal said. “I likely would have done it anyway, and just taken the penalty, but it's nice to have a little bit of leeway.”
While in Winnipeg, Rajagopal has been running his campaign out of his bedroom — where he has taped maps of the riding all across his walls — with the help of four volunteers.
“I would say the most engaging moments I've had are actually just the door-to-door canvassing I do,” he said. “When I do that, I'm able to talk face to face with voters.”
Paul E. Adams, a veteran political reporter and current professor of journalism at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, said he believes it is unlikely that Rajagopal will win the seat. Though Adams has not been following Winnipeg North closely in this election, he said he knows its history well.
“I would be very, very surprised to hear that the Greens were to win that seat,” he said. “It’s not one that’s often in the discussion as a target riding for the Greens.”
Still, Adams said things can change rapidly in parliamentary systems.
“The parties like to say ‘we have a candidate running in all 338 seats,’ and sometimes what happens is that there’s a wave towards one party,” Adams said. “A high tide lifts all ships and you get people getting elected who you wouldn’t have expected to.”
Rajagopal said if he wins, he will drop out of his master’s program and leave at the end of the term. He is an Advanced Standing student and has already completed his undergraduate degrees. If not, he plans to work in the non-profit or service sector and is “more than willing” to run again.
“For the Green Party, they're looking for some continuity of candidates who keep running, so that way people can get more recognition for the Green Party, as well as the individual candidate in the riding,” he said. “I would probably try to run again in four years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Sept. 27, 2019, at 10:27 a.m.
Harvard Management Company returned 6.5 percent on its investments for fiscal year 2019, bringing the value of the University’s endowment to $40.9 billion.
The returns were announced in a note from HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar to University affiliates Friday morning, and represent the lowest return rate in two years — 2018 saw a 10.1 percent return, while 2017 yielded 8.1 percent. Despite the low rate, the endowment exceeded $40 billion for the first time in its history.
Harvard has lagged behind its Ivy League peers in recent years and fell short of Dartmouth’s 7.5 percent return this year. Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania are the only Ivy League institutions that have reported their fiscal year 2019 returns so far. All three endowments trail the S&P 500’s return of 8.22 percent for the period matching Harvard’s fiscal year, ending June 30, 2019.
Narvekar, who came to Harvard from Columbia University in December 2016, wrote in his message Friday that he is “encouraged” by the progress HMC has made, but that much work remains.
“We are mindful that there is much left to accomplish in the years ahead to resolve legacy issues and position the endowment for long-term success,” he wrote.
Narvekar also noted that this year marks the half-way point in the University’s five-year plan to restructure its endowment management and shift its portfolio.
This is also the first year that the endowment will see a tax on its yields, the result of a Republican-led tax overhaul passed in late 2017. Harvard has lobbied extensively against the tax over the past several years, thus far to no avail. Still, experts say the tax rate — 1.4 percent — is low enough that most people probably wouldn’t notice any difference.
“It’s just that small tax and it’s not on all assets. It’s on certain parts of the income. I don’t think most people would notice the small difference,” said Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at Seton Hall University.
Kelchen said that various exemptions, including exemptions for assets not directly used to carry out an institution’s tax-exempt purpose, will likely make the effective tax lower than the official rate.
“The largest drop would be 1.4 percent lower returns, but because of all these exemptions, it might knock off a couple hundredths of a percentage point off the endowment returns,” Kelchen said.
Narvekar did not address the effects of the endowment tax but wrote in his note that further details about the returns and HMC’s progress would be released in the University’s annual financial report next month.
Harvard’s endowment — the largest of its kind in the world — funds many of the school’s operating costs. Roughly one-third of the University’s operating budget is drawn from the endowment each year, though its schools depend on the investment fund to varying degrees.
The University’s endowment has come under increased scrutiny in recent years as student activists target various investments including those tied to the fossil fuel industry, private prison companies, and Puerto Rican debt. Fossil fuel divestment activists have been particularly fervent in their calls for Harvard to withdraw its endowment from a stake in that industry.
