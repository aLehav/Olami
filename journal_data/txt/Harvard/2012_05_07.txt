After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There once was a time when an editor, an institution, and a financial incentive stood between any would-be pundit and publication. Then came the internet which, for better or for worse, removed each of those barriers, allowing for the rise of the blogosphere as a powerful engine of opinion and news analysis. One consequence of this shift has been the democratization of the press: Where there used to be few voices, now there are many. Another effect, however, has been the proliferation of a whole lot of extremist, hateful, and just plain bad writing. Indeed, the internet has provided a forum to more than a few degenerates with journalistic aspirations.
The latest chapter in the saga of media democratization is Twitter’s rise as one of the world’s most prolific source of ostensibly “published” content. Twitter is unique in that it “publishes” even those individuals who had no particular intention, desire or reason to have their writing viewed by anybody but their friends. Yet new internet news sites like Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post—which scour Twitter for the latest eye-popping trends—have elevated the tweets of no-name wackos to the status of news. The result of this new genre of Twitter-based reporting is that every few weeks we are inundated with stories about the depravity of society, as exposed by a few dozen reprehensible tweets.
Recently, two Twitter incidents have made headlines. First, a dozen or so disgustingly racist tweets about “The Hunger Games” caught the attention of Jezebel, the Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, and even The Week. Then, just a few weeks later, several dozen repulsive, hateful, and equally racist tweets about a Boston Bruins hockey game were reported on by the Huffington Post, Sports Illustrated, and even the Washington Post. This has had the simultaneous effect of, on the one hand, sensibly reminding us of what lingering racism still lurks on the fringes of society, and, on the other, making those fringes appear much larger than they really are.
When people see such tweets reposted on news sites, they are, appropriately, shocked and appalled at the unbridled racism that still exists in our society. It is absolutely true that we too frequently forget about the hateful element that lives among us. And while the internet has long been home to such vitriol, it is usually delivered under the cloak of anonymity. There is, no doubt, something particularly shocking about reading a racist tweet posted under someone’s real name on Twitter. However, when Buzzfeed publishes a story about “10 Incredibly Racist Hunger Games Fans,” it gives readers an outsize picture of the amount of racist garbage on the internet. Surely, each of those tweets is repugnant, and we should be constantly working to eliminate such sentiments from our community—but 10 people does not a degenerate society make. The heavy reporting of such tweets gives people the false perception that racism in America is actually getting worse, when in actuality it is just being uncloaked.
The other recent incident in which two dozen Boston sports fans unleashed a barrage of racist tweets directed at the Washington Capitols’ Joel L. Ward following his winning goal against the Boston Bruins is a bit more concerning. The website Blacksportsonline.com found 18 repulsive tweets containing the n-word. The number of Boston sports fans, while big, is considerably smaller than the pool of people who saw the Hunger Games, which suggests that this incident calls to light a deeper phenomenon. Indeed, this should be taken as a serious reminder that Boston and Boston sports culture have a dangerous history of racism which occasionally still rears its head. That said, as someone who’s spent his whole life in and around Boston, I didn’t need the Washington Post to remind me that there are at least a few dozen racists who still watch the B’s.
There are certainly some upsides to this over-reporting of tweets. For one, it forced the Bruins to issue a statement condemning racism among their fans—a step which was long overdue. Second, it is valuable to be ever-vigilant against the racist and hateful streak in our society, no matter small it may be. However, we must be careful not to interpret this new insight into the musings of racists as a sign that racism is increasing in America, or that the progress of the last fifty years has been for naught.  Our society is not, nor should it ever be, defined by a few dozen tweets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Arizona, already known for its deeply anti-Hispanic political environment, continues to make progress in its effort to make the state even more inhospitable for Mexican-Americans. After shutting down the Mexican-American studies program at the Tucson School District, the state Superintendent of Schools John Huppenthal said last month that he is considering doing the same with the Mexican-American Studies program at Arizona’s public universities.
It was Huppenthal himself who passed the law that made this attack on ethnic studies possible. In 2010, Huppenthal, then a state senator, helped write a bill banning public school courses that advocate the overthrow of the United States government, promote racial resentment, and treat students as members of an ethnic group rather than individuals. The language of the bill was race-neutral, but in a state where a third of the population is Hispanic, the target of the bill was clear.
By going after university curricula, Huppenthal is again treading dangerous waters. As a matter of general principle, what is taught in university halls is a matter that should be decided by academics, not politicians. When politicians, not Ph.D.s, decide on a school’s curriculum, we end up with a situations like the one in Texas two years ago, in which political conservatives on the school board voted put less of an emphasis on the study of Thomas Jefferson as a founding father because they disagreed with his view that there should be a wall of separation between church and state.
Huppenthal claims the Mexican-American studies program produces radicals indoctrinated to resent Anglos. If this is true, the rest of America should be watchful of the Anglo-hating radicals coming out of Stanford and over twenty other universities and colleges that offer a Chicano studies program. If Huppenthal’s goal is to reduce resentment toward Anglos, then he is shooting himself in the foot through his actions. I see no better way of increasing resentment toward Anglos than having an Anglo politician shut down a Mexican-American studies program amid massive protest from largely Mexican-American students like he did in Tucson.
The establishment of Chicano Studies programs in universities across the country was a decades-long struggle led by Mexican-American faculty and students, and it would be a shame if it were all laid to waste in Arizona by a politician with irrational fears of a Reconquista, a supposed plan by Mexico to re-conquer the lands it lost in the Mexican-American War.
It is interesting that Huppenthal did not single out the University of Arizona’s African-American Studies program. The people of Arizona should pray that the superintendent does not come to the conclusion that learning about slavery and Jim Crow causes resentment toward Anglos, lest the students of Arizona are deprived of two centuries of American history.
The victims in all this are the students in Arizona’s public universities who will be put at a disadvantage against students at other schools. If Huppenthal succeeds, they will no longer be able to learn about Westminster v Mendez, the Southwestern version of Brown v Board of Education that ended the segregation of Mexican-Americans in public schools ten years before Brown, or about César E. Chávez and his struggle for fair wages for farm workers. These are both essentially important parts of American and Chicano history. Mexican-American Studies, like other ethnic studies programs, allow students to learn more about events in history that are too often overlooked in general history courses.
Perhaps if Superintendent Huppenthal took one of these courses and learned of the struggles of Mexican-Americans in the U.S., he would be less enthusiastic about bringing about their demise. Either way, Huppenthal would do well to end his crusade against Mexican-American Studies in Arizona’s public universities and revise his decision to defund the program in Tucson’s high schools.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three panic attacks in a few days during freshman year, I called the University Health Services mental health line. The first question they asked me after my name was “are you suicidal?” I wasn’t, so I received an appointment for the next week. My therapist was caring and helpful, but the sessions quickly became limited to thirty minutes every other week. The doctor apologized that he couldn’t do better—there were simply too many patients. “There are lots of people with much worse problems than you,” he told me sternly. I couldn’t argue with this, but the panic attacks recurred. Eventually I gave up on University Mental Health Services, found a private provider, and recovered. In this last part I was lucky—my family has the resources to pay for a private provider, and my symptoms were minor compared to those of many others.
In contrast to the treatment that I received at UMHS, the recommended dose for those who are diagnosed with depression or anxiety and recommended for cognitive-behavioral therapy (one of the most common types of therapy) is one to two hours of contact with their therapist a week—four to eight times more than what UMHS offered. Of course, nearly every student can repeat some story of a bungled treatment at UHS—most especially of waiting. But what is remarkable about mental health services in particular is that rationing such services means not that students have to wait for the proper treatment, but that they aren’t ever getting the right dose. Mental heath therapy works like chemotherapy treatments—getting the full amount over the right period of time is key. My case is far from unique and one of the least serious I’ve heard of. Other friends have been pressured to leave the system after a certain amount of time, or substitute student-run counseling services, or take medication instead.
This isn’t responsible care, although I believe that most of the doctors are doing the best they can with limited resources. The “are you suicidal?” question is asked first because it is an “urgent care” line, and suicidal patients must be addressed with particular care, but as well because suicidal patients must be prioritized, leaving less serious cases by the wayside. But this kind of response to the shortage of slots creates a number of problems. First, “are you suicidal?” is not the same kind of question as “are you bleeding?”; people are not qualified to recognize the severity of their problems, especially during a crisis. Sometimes patients are worse off than they know—many instances of self-harm and suicide are impulsive. Further, even those who are not suicidal know that if they present themselves as too troubled, they may be given more serious treatment than they want (anyone care to go to the hospital?) and thus downplay their symptoms. Self-reporting, especially over the phone, is a dangerously unpredictable method of diagnosing and assigning priority to patients.
Part of the underlying problem with the availability of UMHS services is that mental healthcare is often dismissed as not as important as other kinds of healthcare, just as mental illness is stigmatized and dismissed. But mental health is crucial to students’ happiness, ability to succeed academically, and—occasionally and most unfortunately— to their lifespan. In the past, the Crimson has not always published the cause of death of Harvard students who commit suicide, but the silence in these articles often indicates that this was the case.
Though suicide presents by far the most serious sign of mental health problems, the real issue is that all mental health cases ought to be taken seriously and addressed with the best quality medical care. Naturally, a system that gives everyone enough care sometimes means that people will be over-treated, just as they are for any other kind of illness; doctors will see patients who need less care than they think they need. But on the whole, the well-being and academic success of students would be best safeguarded by an improved number of mental health clinicians. There are certainly other reasons mental health is a problem at Harvard. Many have commented on the culture of always appearing “fine” rather than admitting weakness, and the level of academic pressure can’t help. These things are important and should be addressed, as well. But given that mental illness is, in fact, an illness, having enough doctors and treatment is the simplest and most obvious necessity. It’s a basic health and safety issue and is also of critical importance to the happiness and success of members of the Harvard community. We have far too many patients; we need more doctors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has come far from its first days as a college intended for the privileged sons of New England’s wealthiest residents. At the same time, Harvard’s administration (like that of other universities in America) has expanded in scope far beyond its original purview. These changes, while not necessarily bad, have largely escaped the conscious notice of many students, and certainly deserve attention in this newspaper.
The Charter that incorporated Harvard College in 1650 was granted to an institution dedicated to “the advancement of all good literature, arts, and sciences; the advancement and education of youth in all manner of good literature, arts, and sciences; and all other necessary provisions that may conduce to the education of the…youth of this country….” Originally run by a President, five Fellows, and a Treasurer, Harvard’s administration has grown substantially since its first days. Along with thirteen deans of different graduate schools and the deans of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the College, Harvard’s website also lists 13 vice-president level executives, with responsibilities ranging from “Vice President for Planning and Project Management to “Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications” to “Vice President for Campus Services.” Beyond that, Harvard’s Administrative Directory lists well over one hundred deans, assistant deans, directors, and coordinators.
Many of the tasks completed by these many administrators are vitally important.  Harvard now provides many services and resources for students that it did not previously. For example, the new Office of BGLTQ Student Life was a necessary and important addition to Harvard College, and we look forward to seeing it develop to become more of a presence on campus in the coming years when it has a full-time director instead of simply an interim coordinator. The Office of Student Life, though still learning how to best serve undergraduate students, also fills an important and needed role in Harvard life. However, the Harvard administration has also expanded to take on new roles not directly connected to student life or academic experiences. For example, most students probably could not explicate a time in which their Harvard College experience was directly enriched by the “Director of Special Projects” at the Office for Faculty Development.
In fact, it is a common refrain heard on campus that the accompanying proliferation of administrators has been a waste of money, and that Harvard will be unable to stop already exorbitant tuition costs from rising much further without cutting some administrative expenses. Indeed, if the University continues to follow the trend of growing its bureaucracy, it will run the risk of overextending itself and in doing so lose accountability or transparency. Even now, it is often confusing for students to approach the administration if they wish to seek changes in Harvard’s policies or actions. We are surprised that, with a directory of deans and administrators whose length rivals that of the bibliography of a short book, most undergraduate students do not interact with many administrators on a regular basis. Even when deans themselves are friendly and accessible, the multifarious positions and titles may intimidate students who (like us) are not quite sure of the distinction between a “Dean of Science,” “Administrative Dean of Science,” and “Assistant Dean for Science”—and whether any of these administrators have any interest in talking to undergraduates.
That being said, extending the role of the Harvard administration is not necessarily a bad thing. The expansion of Harvard College into a university with multiple graduate schools and world-changing laboratories has created an institution that is world-renowned for repeatedly producing important research findings and educating leaders in fields as diverse as politics, law, medicine, education, and academia. The over 200 employees of the Harvard Management Company help invest Harvard’s impressive endowment in order to generate returns that help pay for our college experience and financial aid. The work of administrators in FAS and other schools undoubtedly helps facilitate the maintenance of Harvard as one of the top universities in the country.
Harvard has certainly come a long—and fruitful—way since its founding in 1636. 375 years later, we are proud to belong to an institution with a remarkable history and even more remarkable present. Just as the first President and Fellows of Harvard College would probably never have recognized the huge majority of job titles of Harvard’s administrators today, in all likelihood this University will look very different when we come back for our tenth, thirtieth, or fiftieth reunions. We hope that as in the past, the Harvard administration’s future growth—albeit ungainly, full of kinks, and inefficient—will only serve to enhance our university’s ability to serve its students, faculty, and the global academic community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what is nearly a biannual rite of passage, Harvard undergraduates­—nearly one thousand of them—flock to Sanders Theatre to attend “Justice,” a course taught by government professor Michael J. Sandel every other year that challenges students to consider difficult moral dilemmas.
But even with the lofty enrollment figures, Harvard students make up only a small portion of people engaged in the course. In the five years since the course became publicly available online, millions of viewers from around the world have “taken” Sandel’s course, according to the course’s website. Virtual students have the opportunity to watch all of Sandel’s lectures and post their thoughts on discussion forums.
Now, as a result of the Harvard-MIT partnership announced last Wednesday, ”Justice” will be just one of many Harvard courses open to the general public online.
Harvard and MIT have each pledged to spend $30 million to establish a joint online platform called edX, which will offer lecture videos, class exercises, and quizzes. Building off of MIT’s open courseware platform MITx, the jointly run online education network will eventually incorporate instructional offerings from many universities, administrators hope.
Soon, undergraduates at both colleges will not be the only ones listening to lectures and chugging through problem sets.
Faculty response to the announcement has been largely positive, with professors across a wide range of disciplines citing not only increased public access but also on-campus advantages and applications of edX.
“By opening access to the Harvard classroom, we not only share our resources with others, we also enrich the learning that takes place here at Harvard,” Sandel wrote in an e-mail.
“Being very inclusive of the rest of the people in the world who want to learn, I think, is a very admirable and very good thing to do,” said Ali Khademhosseini, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and affiliate of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology.
Professors also agreed that in addition to opening up Harvard and MIT’s resources, data collected from edX has the potential to significantly improve the classroom experience of students on campus.
“The problem with online education as a whole is that it hasn’t been interactive, just a source of information,” Khademhosseini said. But edX could change that, he continued.
David J. Malan ’99, who teaches the popular introductory computer science course CS50, added that while Harvard has yet to decide which courses to offer through edX, he would be very open to including CS50 on the class list.
CS50 has posted lectures online for five years now, but Malan acknowledged that a platform like edX—with its research potential and broad reach—would significantly expand his course’s potential to “leverage the internet and web-based tools.”
Data from edX could tell professors which lecture formats and exercises are most effectively communicated online, allowing faculty to cover basic material more efficiently and reserve classroom time for question and answer sessions or interactive activities.
“Merely listening to someone like me lecture for 60 to 90 minutes cannot possibly be the most effective way to learn and absorb complex material,” Malan said. “We would love to be part of something like this.”
Professors agreed that re-thinking the format in which learning takes place—in all disciplines—must be a key part of the new initiative.
“The humanities in general have been taught in a relatively traditional format—the lecture hall, or the seminar room,” said Martin Puchner, professor of drama and English and comparative literature. “It’s gotten good at it, but there are new opportunities provided by different types of technologies.”
EdX is an evolving platform, and students may have a chance to contribute feedback and classroom modules as early as the fall, according to Malan.
Although many people view Harvard’s exclusivity as one of its defining features, professors say that increased accessibility of Harvard’s educational offerings to the broader community will not diminish the University’s prestige.
Puchner said that much of the “residential, liberal arts college” experience cannot be duplicated simply by putting classes online. Daily interactions among students and between students and their instructors, he said, are incredibly important as well.
“I don’t think the online courses will dilute the brand,” Puchner said. “I think it will make Harvard College even more desirable than it already is.”
While some professors feel strongly that edX will supplement, rather than displace, tradition learning models, Khademhosseini said that he can imagine a future in which online portals provide an education that is on par in terms of quality with in-person classes at universities.
“I think it’s not impossible,” he said. “I think the trend is going that way.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 8
An earlier version of this article stated that more than 15,000 students around the world have taken Michael Sandel’s course “Justice” online. In fact, more than 15,000 students have taken the class at Harvard, while millions around the world have watched the course lectures online.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part II and Part III of this story appeared on May 9 and May 11, 2012.)
Two Harvard alumni guide seventh grade students in Classroom 205, home to humanities and Spanish, at the Community Charter School of Cambridge.
A picture of Jeremy Lin ’10, the Harvard athlete turned professional basketball star who rocketed to international fame this spring, hangs on the back wall of the room.
In the front of room, Henry J. Seton ’06 leads students through a lesson on “The Odyssey,” reading from a graphic novel adaptation of Homer’s classic.
“So what is his tragic flaw?” Seton asks with dramatic flair. Many of his seventh graders raise their hands eagerly, hoping that their answers will earn a congratulatory ringing of his small bell.
Seton, who concentrated in Social Studies with a focus on education, is one of the many Harvard graduates—24 of them, according to statistics collected by the city’s three charter schools—who are at the vanguard of the charter school movement in Cambridge.
His students are among the lucky 1,822 who have won lotteried seats at Cambridge’s three charter schools—independent schools that are funded by public money but not bound by many of the state codes that regulate traditional public schools. Driven by a mission of educational excellence, these schools see more students apply each year than they can take in their classrooms.
In their efforts to offer top-knotch public education in Cambridge, these schools—CCSC, Prospect Hill Academy, and Benjamin Banneker Charter Public School—have tapped into Harvard’s resources during their fledgling years. These schools have taken advantage of the University’s academic rigor, student population, and innovative faculty, a relationship that has benefited both the charter schools and members of the Harvard community.
“A PIPELINE”
The Harvard Graduate School of Education, ranked the second-best graduate school of education in the country by U.S. News & World Report, has served local teachers as a convenient way to further their education and better serve their schools.
Caleb Hurst-Hiller, who was appointed CCSC’s head of school in March, is one of the many Harvard affiliates working on the front lines of the Cambridge charter school movement.
After graduating from Brown, Hurst-Hiller wanted to immediately explore teaching instead of enrolling in a masters program, he says. He joined the CCSC faculty in 2005 as a founding member. After two years, he decided to pursue a one-year specialized master’s degree at the Ed School. While continuing to serve as a teacher, mentor, and basketball coach at CCSC, Hurst-Hiller studied instructional improvement, education policy, and small schools. After completing his studies at the Ed School, Hurst-Hiller worked as a humanities teacher and was then promoted to principal of CCSC’s upper school in 2009.
Hurst-Hiller says the training he received at the Ed School has benefited CCSC in two ways. First, his academic experience there enabled him to bring new insight to curriculum planning and reform—crucial aspects of the charter school’s mission.
Hurst-Hiller’s time at the Ed School has also allowed him to bring personal connections to CCSC. “I did a master’s program at the Ed School to help network...and I still stay connected,” Hurst-Hiller says. He has helped secure CCSC’s relationship with Harvard—what many Cambridge educators call a “pipeline” between the charter schools and Harvard.
From their inception, Cambridge-based charter schools have been shaped by Harvard alumni. When Prospect Hill opened in Cambridge in 2002, the school had three teachers who had earned master’s degrees from the Ed School, according to Michele M. Meagher, human resources manager at Prospect Hill. These three now comprise the core of the school’s administration, Meagher says.
Jed F. Lippard, now head of school at Prospect Hill, was among those three. “There are a lot of personal relationships that people [at Prospect Hill] have developed with HGSE. Many of us are on the Ed School listserv and attend the Askwith Forums,” Lippard says.
Cambridge Public School Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young, who received a doctoral degree in administration, planning, and social policy from the Ed School in 1988, praises the presence of Harvard alumni teaching in the district.
“We always feel that Harvard graduates who come to work here bring to us a good mix of the two core values: academic excellence and social justice,” Young says.
While currently no faculty members at Benjamin Banneker hold Harvard degrees, Deputy Director Sherley Bretous-Carre says that the school takes advantage of Harvard by drawing upon faculty research and knowledge.
Benjamin Banneker, a kindergarten through sixth grade charter school focused on science and technology, has looked to Harvard to help improve its curriculum and teaching methods.
“We continue to be ahead of the curve. We’re always looking to studies and programs that we can participate in. We love to do longitudinal studies on where students have gone, what path they’ve taken,” Bretous-Carre says, adding that Banneker hopes to use Harvard resources for development and marketing as the school looks at updating its technology labs.
LEARNING TO TEACH
Every weekday last semester, Seth A. Pearce ’12 woke up at 6:40 a.m. and took the 7 a.m. shuttle into Kendall Square to student teach in the classroom of William D. Connell, an Ed School graduate who now teaches humanities at CCSC.
When not writing his thesis on liberal political philosophy and education, Pearce worked as a full-time student teacher. Now, in his final semester at Harvard, Pearce has continued to work for CCSC as a substitute teacher and will join the CCSC staff full-time after graduation to teach eighth grade humanities.
“My impression was that it is a really effective school. I’ve been in a lot of different educational environments, and I wanted to be in a place like [CCSC],” Pearce says.
Pearce is enrolled in the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program at Harvard, through which he has studied at the Ed School and assisted teachers at Quincy Upper School in Boston and CCSC. Participants in the program take the Massachusetts Test for Educator Licensure so that they graduate as certified public school teachers.
Orin Gutlerner—the former director of UTEP who left Harvard in 2008 to help found Match Teacher Residency, a program that trains teachers and places many of them in charter schools—said that Harvard’s student teachers have increasingly been placed at Cambridge-based charter schools rather than traditional public schools run by the city since he took over the program in 2003.
This year, Pearce and one other UTEP student have taught at Cambridge charter schools, and one UTEP student taught at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, the city’s flagship public high school.
Gutlerner found charter schools to be beneficial for student teachers. “CCSC believed in [a college preparatory education] for low-income students, and that’s why Harvard students have gotten into teaching in the first place. They want students to see the kind of opportunity that they have had,” he says.
When Seton arrived at Harvard, he was hesitant about charter schools. He completed his student teaching hours at public high schools in Boston and Quincy.
It was not until Gutlerner convinced Seton to visit CCSC when he was applying to teaching jobs that Seton began to open up to the idea of working at a charter school.
“[CCSC] is led by people who are committed to social justice,” Seton says. “All of those things like the dress code and detention and being all about professionalism and college prep discourage people, but I see that here we make sure we can run an effective and efficient classroom.”
Though CCSC and Banneker have enjoyed working closely with the University and its faculty and students, Prospect Hill has shied away from placing Harvard students as teacher’s assistants.
Lippard says that Prospect Hill used to have a stronger connection to UTEP and TEP, the parallel program at the Ed School, but the school has broken off that relationship for two reasons.
“[Student teachers] are not there for as long as we would want them,” Lippard says of the one-semester full-time teaching commitment that UTEP students make. Second, he says he believes that his teaching staff, comprised of many novices, does not have the requisite experience to be effective mentors to student teachers.
Though Prospect Hill has ended its placements from UTEP and TEP, it does employ 12 teachers and staff members who hold degrees from the Ed School or the College, according to Meagher.
Lippard says that there are many personal relationships between the school and the University, and he hopes to increasingly tap into other Harvard resources.
“We’ve not even begun to scratch the surface of the relationships,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has almost doubled in undergraduate enrollment since 2008, the rapidly growing school has nevertheless maintained a firm commitment to intimate, faculty-led advising.
The growth that has defined the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences since its creation in 2007 has inspired new concentrations, expanded infrastructure, and changed pedagogical styles. As the department has grown from 299 undergraduate concentrators in 2008 to 578 in 2012, the increased number of concentrators has posed concerns regarding the extent to which SEAS can maintain a sustainable advising framework. But SEAS remains boldly confident that it can handle its popularity.
“More concentrators are certainly welcome,” computer science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 says. “We’re going to work to maintain the strength of our advising.”
CATERING TO THE INDIVIDUAL
Over the years, engineering concentrators have stressed the value of personal advising experiences including one-on-one interactions with professors, tours of labs, and research opportunities. At SEAS, many of these perks have traditionally been facilitated by the smaller size of the school’s concentrations.
“The small size is a great advantage,” says biomedical engineering concentrator Jermaine B. Heath ’14. “The ability to engage with the faculty on a personal level...motivates students to think critically about concepts presented in class.”
Carolina I. Ragolta ’13 says she chose Harvard over other schools with bigger engineering programs specifically because of SEAS’ more intimate size.
“I immediately felt a sense of community that was not present at colleges with much larger engineering departments, or even in other larger concentrations here at Harvard,” she says.
Students say that this size, even as the school grows, helps them as they focus in very specialized areas within the broader framework of their concentrations. They still remark on the highly personalized guidance they receive in those areas.
Maura D. Church ’14, an applied mathematics concentrator focusing in music, says that sitting down with applied mathematics advisers who were familiar with course offerings at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was crucial in establishing her plan of study.
“Not only must advisers have a good sense of the applied mathematics discipline, but they must also be very familiar with offerings in other disciplines to help students figure out exactly what they want to do with their concentrations,” Church says.
Every undergraduate receives a faculty adviser. Moreover, because of the attention that a number of SEAS professors have focused on student design within their courses, the department has reinforced the advising structure within courses as well—a microcosm of the concentration guidance system. In classes such as Engineering Sciences 50: “Introduction to Electrical Engineering” and Engineering Sciences 227: “Medical Device Design,” for instance, students have looked to professors and outside specialists for help on their own research projects.
“They made sure that there were always experts there in whatever area you were interested in pursuing,” says Kayla M. Shelton ’13, who took ES50 this semester.  “You’re never all by yourself.”
ADAPTIVE FACULTY
Many concentrations have introduced social initiatives to strengthen the sense of community amongst students. Applied mathematics, for example, holds weekly thesis meeting sessions, presents weekly cake social hours, and is discussing the possibility of creating smaller community structures based on student application area.
“These are informal social events that brings together concentrators and advisers,” says Margo S. Levine, the assistant director of undergraduate studies in applied mathematics. “I often overhear advising conversations going on at these socials.”
SEAS’ expansion, however, has challenged the school to adapt its programs and advising structures to maintain its personal connection with students. The school hired two assistant directors of undergraduate studies in the last year and, according to SEAS Assistant Dean for Academic Programs Marie D. Dahleh, is prepared to hire additional faculty to allow students to “conduct undergraduate research, pursue design experiences, and ultimately to make the most of their opportunities.”
“As we get a lot more concentrators, it gets harder and harder for a single individual director of undergraduate studies to take on the role of advising concentrators to a close level,” Dahleh says, “That’s where the increased personnel comes in.”
The high number of requirements in some SEAS concentrations—the school offers an ABET-accredited bachelors of science degree which requires 20 half courses—has also highlighted the role of advising in making sure students can graduate on time with an idea of their post-college plans.
“Advising  plays an important role in all concentrations, but when you have a large number of courses to fulfill, it becomes all the more important to have a program that can advise students effectively,” Dahleh says.
“WE’RE NICE PEOPLE”
Assistant Director for Undergraduate Studies in Biomedical Engineering Sujata K. Bhatia says that, through her advising relationships, she has come to think of her students “like family.”
“It’s absolutely a goal that every student feels that they can get a personal tour of the teaching labs, knows that they are welcome to sit down and chat with faculty about whatever’s on their mind, and believes that their success is very important to us,” Bhatia says. “So it’s absolutely a goal to make sure that growth doesn’t stand in the way of good advising.”
Lewis mentions initiatives to welcome students to SEAS, such as phoning admitted freshman to introduce them to a faculty contact even before they arrive on campus.
“We develop a certain level of interest and respect for our students,” he says. “Everybody knows how interesting our undergrads are and how much work we can get out of them. God knows what’s going to happen to them after they get through sleeping in your course. They may wind up starting things like Microsoft and Facebook.”
“We’re nice people. Most of us like students. We remember when we were students and we liked it when people were nice to us.,” he adds.
Despite this outreach, however, students and faculty alike highlight the students’ role in shaping their own advising relationships.
“I’ve never needed any real advising before. I usually have my courses planned out long before I’d need to talk to an adviser,” computer science concentrator Dan B. Bradley ’14 writes in an email. “To have a good advising experience, you have to put in as much or more effort than your adviser to make it work,”
“Every person can make their advising experience as great or bad as they want it to be,” Amy Z. Chen ’14 adds. “It’s an interactive process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a report on advising, a faculty committee wrote, “One quarter of the student body commands a considerable amount of attention from individual members of the faculty; the remaining three quarters got relatively little attention.” The biggest problem, the committee found, rested in the largest departments at the College, like economics and government.
That assessment might sound familiar today. But the report was written in 1950.
Much has changed in the past six decades and even in the past handful of years. But students and faculty in the social sciences division—which houses the College’s two largest concentrations, economics and government—still point to a divide in the strength of the advising students receive that pivots on the size of their departments. While smaller concentrations offer more personalized guidance, larger departments still struggle to find the best advising program for hundreds of concentrators.
“When you have a small department, the type of system to advise them, by design, is very different from a large department with many students,” economics concentration adviser Kiran Gajwani says.
REFORMING THE BIG SYSTEMS
Economics and government, historically among the largest concentrations in the College, have each taken steps in recent years to reform their advising systems. Their approaches are nearly opposite, one moving advising away from the Houses and one moving it into them.
In the economics department, administrators have shifted focus from a House-based advising framework to a centralized program within the department’s headquarters. Gajwani, who joined the department in 2010, was the first hire as a Littauer-based concentration adviser. Unlike the other concentration advisors, who are graduate students, Gajwani is a lecturer-adviser who completed her Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2008.
According to Jeffrey A. Miron, director of undergraduate studies in economics, the department will phase out the current graduate student advisers and replace them with more lecturer-advisers like Gajwani.
“There’s a lot to be gained from somebody who already has their Ph.D.,” economics department chair John Y. Campbell says.
Miron says that the post-Ph.D. advisers will foster “more stability [and] more continuity” so that more students can remain with the same adviser throughout their time as economics concentrators.
“By necessity, we need to come up with tools to make advising work for large number of students,” Gajwani says. “We’ve made changes in the past few years.”
So has the government department, with a bevy of reforms in the past year including a new faculty mentorship program and the addition of sophomore tutorial teaching fellows as advisers to supplement the House-based system. These changes will go into effect beginning with government concentrators in the Class of 2015.
“The big change is to make sure that when students declare their concentration, they get the advice they need,” government Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch says.
This latest revision is perhaps the most comprehensive in an ongoing series of changes in the department geared toward making resources more accessible to students. In 2010, the department assigned advising responsibilities to House tutors and to upperclassmen concentrators to bring resources closer to student life. These changes to advising create distinct tiers of advisers and mentors, ranging from full professors to fellow students to satisfy different needs for government concentrators.
UNTAPPED RESOURCES
Despite these advising reforms, students in economics and government often underutilize the resources available to them.
“I’ve probably had the standard experience,” says Leah R. Kaplow ’12, an economics concentrator. “You’re not really forming a serious relationship [with faculty members] unless you really try to.”
Kaplow suggested that assigning specific advisers to students based on their fields of interest could improve the economics advising structure. Government concentrator Giacomo Bagarella ’13 agrees.
“A change I would recommend is someone setting students up with advisers,” Bagarella says. “I think there are a lot of helpful and intelligent grad students in the department...so regardless of how many undergraduate there are, each [student] can find a grad student to fit their interests.”
Students say that, with some effort, there is guidance to be found.
“I don’t think students are making full utilization of the system,” says Edith Y. Chan ’12, an economics concentrator and an inactive Crimson business editor. “I think it takes a lot more initiative.”
Chan says that she taps into the advising system “quite a bit” by taking advantage of economics advisers’ open-door policies when she needs help. And for government concentrators, some say that the residential program fits well into their routines.
Elihu A. Reynolds ’12, a government concentrator, says that he found great support from his House adviser.
“I’ve worked very closely with my adviser here in Adams House,” he says.
A COZIER FIT
In smaller concentrations, students say they find cozier environments that lend themselves to deeper advising relationships.
Advising resources for the history of art and architecture department are centrally located in the Sackler building, like the economics department in Littauer since the end of House advising. But the history of art and architecture department is much smaller, which students say lends the concentration a welcoming, personal feel.
“We have a really great non-residential system,” Jacob J. Cedarbaum ’12 says. “I don’t actively seek out a lot of advising.”
The anthropology department, which houses the social anthropology and archaeology concentrations, maintains a head tutor for each concentration.
“The advising system has done very well,” anthropology Director of Undergraduate Studies Steven C. Caton says.
Professor Richard H. Meadow ’68, the head tutor for archeology, advises all of its roughly 30 non-honors and honors concentrators on general topics such as course selection and grant applications.
In monthly group meetings with honors seniors, he says, he aims to “build a community among the students.”
As a smaller department, anthropology advisers can broaden their efforts beyond simply giving advice to its undergraduates. Many of the advising staff also work on increasing the department’s exposure around campus and attracting freshmen. In particular, Caton says the department tries to “put the name of anthropology out at main events,” citing Advising Fortnight and the Professors and Pasties discussion series as examples.
“This has helped to make undergraduates more aware of unconventional concentrations like anthropology,” Caton says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Men’s Basketball team is traveling to Italy in mid-August for some summer competition.  The Crimson will be playing in Rome, Pisa and Venice.  There is a fan package being offered that also includes opportunities to sightsee between games in Florence and Lake Como.
As the saying goes, “when in Rome, do as the Romans do.”  So, Harvard players and fans alike should come prepared to wholeheartedly embrace the Italian culture. The Crimson players should not have any trouble carbo-loading before game days. And, instead of filling the typical Gatorade sport bottles on the Harvard bench with water, why not drink Chianti, the traditional red wine of Tuscany?
While basketball sneakers are practical, they are not fashionable across the Atlantic.  Perhaps players and spectators should exchange them in their suitcases for Superga sneakers, the multi-colored Italian brand of shoes that is ubiquitous across Europe.
With a little bit of luck from a coin tossed into the Trevi Fountain, we should expect great success for Harvard this summer. And, hopefully, the team will return with ample photographs of various players “holding up” the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  That is the only reason people go there, right?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s finals week, and that means something different for everyone at Harvard.  For most, finals week leads to hours of time lost in Lamont Library Penitentiary.  If you’re reading this, chances are high that this is part of that study break that was supposed to be five minutes.  Don’t be ashamed, we’ve all been there.
But when you have something better to do than read a blog about Harvard sports, we strongly suggest taking a look at Twitter.  The frustration, stress, and joy of the end of the academic year have brought some of the finest Tweets of the year.
After sorting through a thousand “Can’t believe it’s my last (insert sentimental thing about Harvard)”-Tweets, we picked out some of our favorites from a couple of freshman athletes.
1) In spite of the hours of essays and tests that accompany the end of the year, Tommy O’Regan has made it a point to keep his followers updated. Yes, this includes when the forward on the men’s hockey team is doing work for Lady Samurai. On April 30, O’Regan’s followers received a flashback to the 90s:
"Boy Meets World has one hell of a theme song #2ndboymeetsworldtweetthismonth #moretocome"
Second tweet of the month?! It’s amazing how much the mind can wander in Lamont. But notice that the forward used “has” instead of “had,” which means that this tweet probably wasn’t prompted by a nostalgic YouTube clip…
2) According to Twitter, O’Regan is done with language classes:
"About to enter my last language class in my career as a human"
We’re hoping it’s a long career that culminates with a birth in the Human Hall of Fame.
3) Hours later, O’Regan found himself in a tricky situation.  The forward tweeted the following after an awkward encounter left him speechless:
"Whats the "Thank You" etiquette on someone holding 3 doors in a row open for you? Do you say it softly three times? Loud once at the end?"
That’s incredible. A New-Englander holding three doors in a row? That astonishing feat has got to be one of the highlights in O’Regan’s young career as a human.
4) According to Twitter, Jonah Travis has completed his freshman year.  The forward on the Harvard men’s basketball team finished his finals on May 5 and grabbed a plane back home.  Just before liftoff, Travis used Twitter to let off a little steam:
"WE HAVE THE ENTIRE FIRST CLASS TO OURSELVES WHY ARE YOU SITTING NEXT TO ME????!!!!!!"
Poor, poor Jonah. We remember the first time someone sat next to us on an airplane.  In fact, the memories are so clear that we don’t even remember the last time someone didn’t sit next to us. Correct us if we’re wrong, but couldn’t you have sat anywhere in first class if the entire section was empty?  We’re not exactly sure how first class works, though, seeing as how we plebeians aren’t used to the luxury of space.  Hope the luxurious flight with lots of legroom, complimentary food, and movies wasn’t too taxing.
Well those are the Tweets of the Week. It was the final week for the first years to prove themselves, and O’Regan rose to the challenge. On the other hand, it was the last week to make those freshmen mistakes. At least now Jonah knows that people are watching during finals week.

On the open road, all of us find different ways to kill time. Some of us sleep, others read, still others incessantly nag the driver with a regular chorus of “are we there yet?”
But Harvard baseball has taken road-trip entertainment to the next level.
Few things are as American as baseball and road trips. Throw Kevin Costner in there, and you’re basically two-thirds of the way to a blockbuster feature film.
Add “Call Me Maybe?” Not exactly what Steinbeck or a grizzled baseball veteran might have in mind for the great American highway.
Earlier today, a member of the team posted a video to YouTube of one of the vans offering its rendition of Harvard’s latest party-music obsession. You can check out the clip above, but for those of you who don’t have three minutes and 18 seconds to spare, here’s a rundown:
Lip-synced verse. More players emerge. Simple, synchronized dance move. Repeat.
All year, Crimson Sports follows Harvard’s 41 varsity teams, and we develop a pretty good sense of the on-field dynamic. But it isn’t often that we get a behind-the-scenes look like the baseball team has given us.
To that end, here’s some things The Back Page has learned about Harvard baseball:
1) There are at least nine players in the van (assuming the videographer is on the team). There are 33 players listed on the official roster. Evidently none of them has any past experience in choreography. As much as we like the right-arm-left-arm-cross-arm move you were doing, would it have killed you to mix it up every once in a while?
2) Their knowledge of the lyrics is damn impressive.
3) To Jack Colton: How do you sleep through that?
Baseball team, we hope you had a good time putting the video together, and thank you for the much-needed finals period entertainment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third consecutive year, the Harvard softball team stormed through Ivy League competition to earn a berth in the best-of-three Ivy League Championship Series, to be held at Soldiers Field starting May 11.
The 2009-10 Crimson posted a 17-3 record in conference play before falling to Cornell in the ILCS in three nail-biting games. Last season, Harvard sported an 18-2 Ivy record and again met the Big Red in the ILCS, this time submitting a dominating performance and winning the title in two games, by a combined score of 9-0.
This year’s Crimson squad could be the best of the bunch. Led by characteristically stellar pitching from co-captain Rachel Brown and a powerful offense keyed by senior Jane Alexander and sophomore Kasey Lange, the Crimson (31-13, 17-3 Ivy) again pummeled Ivy League competition in the regular season, including one stretch of 14 straight victories against conference foes.
But Harvard will confront a different
challenge in the upcoming championship series: Penn and star pitcher Alexis Borden. Borden led all Ancient Eight pitchers this season in wins (24), ERA (1.33), and innings pitched (183.2), and she’s peaking at the right time for the Quakers. In the one-game playoff to decide the winner of the South Division on Friday, Borden threw a perfect game against Cornell en route to a 4-0 victory and a berth in the ILCS.
“I had the game tracker up on my computer,” Brown said. “Obviously, she did what she had to do to get the win. It’s impressive for her to throw a no-hitter in such an important game.”
With the win, Penn earned a bid to the ILCS for the first time since 2007, in which it lost to the Crimson in two games. But this is arguably the strongest Quakers team in history, with a school-record 33 wins, including 15 against Ivy opponents.
“I definitely think [Penn is] a lot stronger than past years,” Brown said. “They’ve always had talent, but this year they were a good team. I know they have two strong lefty leadoffs, and then they have two power hitting righties after that, but I think their whole lineup is very strong, so pitching and defense are going to be crucial.
The Quakers’ victory also precluded the latest installment of one of Ivy League softball’s fiercest rivalries from happening; for the first time since the 2008-09 season, a battle between Harvard and Cornell will not decide the Ivy League champion.
“We as a team had focused on [that] it doesn’t really matter who we play because we’ve been playing well all season,” Brown said. “Clearly, we have an intense rivalry with Cornell, so playing them would have been more of a deep-rooted opponent, but we know Penn is a strong team.”
Borden, the source of much of that strength, will likely pitch Game 1 and, if necessary, Game 3 of the series. She made two appearances against the Crimson earlier this season, allowing five runs and 11 hits in 7.1 innings in a pair of Harvard victories.
“Last time she came here, we handled her very well,” said junior Stephanie Regan, who is third on the team with a .336 average. “I am a very ‘see ball, hit ball’ kind of hitter; if its in the zone I’m going to take it. She has a good changeup and a good rise ball she likes to mix in, [so] if she throws it in the strike zone, you have to swing.”
The one-game playoff between Penn and Cornell forced the date of Game 1 of the ILCS to be moved back from May 5, for which it was initially scheduled, to this coming Friday. The extra week off provided Harvard with some much-needed rest, mentally and physically.
“It’s allowed us to sharpen up and think about what Penn did to us last time and prepare for the game,” Regan said. “The rest will give us time to have everyone at 100 percent, and not having the series in the middle of exams will help our mental health.”
The Crimson will need that rest to prepare for Borden. And with Brown, second in the Ivy League in wins, ERA, and innings pitched and first in strikeouts, taking the circle for at least Game 1 for Harvard, runs will come at a premium.
“I think it’s going to be really key to score early and keep adding runs, so one run at any point is going to really give us a cushion,” Brown said. “These games are going to be really close, so every run will count.”

The Harvard’s women’s lacrosse team fell behind early and was never able to recover, losing, 9-5, to No. 16/9 Penn in the semifinal of the Ivy League Tournament on Friday in Philadelphia.
With the win, the first-seeded Quakers (9-6, 6-1 Ivy) advanced to Sunday’s championship matchup, where they fell to Dartmouth, 6-4.
Friday’s loss snapped a five-game winning streak for the Crimson (9-7, 5-2).
“We were in a good mental state heading into the game,” said co-captain Melanie Baskind, who led the Crimson with two goals and three ground balls. “We obviously knew that Penn is a very good team. At the same time, we had confidence in ourselves. Our last two games against them were very close. We felt good about our gameplan, and we were confident that if we played well we would have come out on top.”
Penn was led by sophomore Courtney Tomchik, who scored three goals in the contest—including the opening two tallies—and by junior Meredith Cain, who scored three consecutive goals to close out a dominant first half for the Quakers.
As has been a recurring problem for Harvard all season, the Crimson was plagued by another slow start. Depite holding the 10-7 shot advantage, Harvard went into halftime trailing, 6-1.
“I think its tough to say [why we had a slow start],” Baskind said. “Its easy to say a lack of focus, a lack of energy, but we prepare for games the same way. [Penn] just came out stronger and faster than we did.”
Harvard was continually thwarted by Penn goalie Emily Leitner, who stopped three of the four shots she faced in the first half. Leitner finished with 10 saves and allowed five goals in sixty minutes.
“Our coaches were very adamant on how the goalie was a lefty and that we needed to shoot to her right and not shoot at her feet which is something we were constantly doing,” said senior Jess Halpern, who finished with one goal on one shot. “I think we got a little flustered, and we weren’t sticking to what our coaches were telling us.”
Halpern was the only Crimson player to beat Leitner in the first half, scoring with 16:53 to play to halt a 3-0 Penn run.
“The problem was that we weren’t finishing our shots,” said Baskind, whose squad connected on just five of 27 shot attempts on the night. “Statistically we hung with them all over the field, but we just had a lot of trouble placing the ball around [Leitner], who played very well.”
Despite facing a five-goal halftime deficit, Harvard believed it had the ability to come back in the second frame.
“The focus at halftime was just making sure we were taking good shots,” Baskind said. “I felt like we were in the game for all sixty minutes.”
Coming out of the break, Quakers junior Maddie Poplawski finished a free-position opportunity to stetch Penn’s lead to six.
Baskind provided the Crimson with some hope, responding with back-to-back goals.
But Penn senior Erin Brennan pushed the Quakers’ lead back to five after finishing a pass from Poplawski with 12:22 to go.
Harvard sophomores Chelsey Newman and Kyleigh Keating closed the gap to 8-5 with a pair of scores in the final 10 minutes, but that was as close as the Crimson got.
“We had a couple of posts and some crucial turnovers in the midfield, but we didn’t give up until the end,” Baskind said. “I don’t think the score indicates how close it was.”
In addition to outshooting Penn 27-16, the Crimson had fewer turnovers and was perfect in clearing attempts (12-for-12).
The Crimson finishes the year at 9-7 overall, its seven losses coming to ranked opponents.
Despite starting conference play with a pair of losses, Harvard managed to end the regular season on a high note and to secure its second straight Ivy League Tournament berth.
But unlike last season—in which the Crimson fell in the championship game—Harvard returned to Cambridge after the opening round.
“I think our coach summed it pretty well,” Baskind said. “It’s a disappointing loss to a season we turned around. We were playing very strongly at the end. It was a good season, but it was a disappointing loss. We weren’t ready to stop playing.”

If you’ve ever missed the chance to see your favorite Harvard squad play because you missed out on those few reserved tickets or weren’t able travel to away games, you now have the opportunity to catch the action by tuning in to NBC Sports Network. Following a renewed national television contract, fans will now have more opportunities to cheer on the Crimson from afar.
NBC Sports Network, formerly known as Versus, and the Ivy League have reached a new two-year agreement regarding the network’s national television rights to Ancient Eight contests. The new agreement will begin with the 2012 football season and end with the 2014 lacrosse season, and for the first time NBC Sports Network will have the rights to men’s basketball and men’s lacrosse broadcasts.
The number of football games televised, as well as the addition of basketball and lacrosse, mark changes in the agreement between NBC Sports Network and the Ivy League. Between six and 10 football and men’s basketball games will be televised along with up to four additional men’s lacrosse games.
There was no specification on whether or not the televised contests will be limited to exclusively Ancient Eight opponents. But one of the agreement’s stipulations is the network’s rights to televise The Game in both 2012 and 2013, while coverage of other Ivy League rivalries has not been mentioned.
Though only three of Harvard’s 41 varsity sports will claim the additional national attention, the Crimson faithful will likely see the new agreement as a step in the right direction.

First drafts are no longer safe from the eyes of outsiders. Flyby raided the Lamont recycling bins to discover the deeply profound, uncover the roughest of the rough, and unearth a slew of amusing, verbose, and altogether fascinating papers.
Here are some lessons we learned that might benefit other paper-writers during the last stretch of finals:
Give your variables names that sound like dinosaurs.
"The data for both tenyryields and thirtyyr was obtained from Bloomberg." – Economics paper
Human rights violations are not-right violations of humans.
"It challenges the human rights philosophy by questioning how can a Serbian be persuaded to protect the human rights of those that that the Serbian do not recognize their humanity...First, it persuades observers of human rights violations to prevent further violations by motivates onlookers of human rights violations to do something about those violations by reminding them that those who suffer are, like them, human." - Human rights paper
Apparently we're doing a lot of swallowing.
"Swallowing is synonymous with 'destroying' and 'devouring,' the act of finishing something off." - Literature paper
"Her answer instead is to pinpoint her feelings of loss onto tiny, anecdotal aspects of the dead that are easier to chew and swallow." - Literature paper (a different one)
The ultimate bodily experiment was not, in fact, the Chickwich Challenge.
"Ecce Homo answers the ultimate question, of which Zarathustra is the ultimate experiment so far, in every literal, bodily, and corporal sense: Truth is only incorportation." - German paper
Convince the reader to support your thesis.
 "Best Points: Many points in the essay were very scientifically based and specific points were made to convince the reader into supporting my thesis. It was hard at the beginning in terms of concise and straightforward thesis." - Expos 20 cover letter
That's deep.
"Every perception is part of a cosmic story in which the external actuality is knowable to the personal consciousness and at times representative of eternal truths." – English paper

The Harvard-Radcliffe Rugby Football Club bypassed traditional forms of fundraising by creating a method of raising money unique to their athleticism: moving. Calling themselves "Radcliffe Movers," members of the Women's Rugby team will work in groups of two and three people to assist students as they move boxes and furniture out of their dorms and into house storage facilities. "We get off-season lifting workouts, you get your stuff moved," reads the tagline on the Radcliffe Movers sign-up form.
This is the first time that the Women's Rugby Team has offered their help in moving students out of their dorms, and 32 undergraduates have already purchased moving assistance by signing up on the Radcliffe Movers google form that circulated over House and organization email lists this weekend.
The Radcliffe Movers will begin their work on Monday, May 7, and continue moving items through Friday, May 10. They'll be charging $20 for the first hour and $10 for each additional hour of labor. About two-thirds of the rugby team's 35 members has volunteered time to help out with the moves.
