After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Magicians and audiences from Boston and around the world gathered together virtually for the Boston Magic Lab’s final show of 2020. With backdrops varying from simple bedrooms and offices to more elaborate studio setups, six performers presented the audience with impossible effects ranging from a perfect prediction of a spectator’s thoughts to a chosen playing card emerging from a jar of vegemite. In the show’s unique digital format, viewers spammed “1”s into the chat in lieu of applause, and volunteers were toggled from viewers to panelists when they interacted with the performers.
Now a year old, the Boston Magic Lab is one of the latest additions to the Boston arts scene. The group hosts a monthly open-mic for magicians to test out new material. The show is entirely free for audiences, who are instead encouraged to contribute to local charitable organizations. The magicians aren’t paid to perform — rather, they receive in-depth feedback for their routines.
The Boston Magic Lab was founded by Felice T. Ling, a social anthropologist and street magician who is a regular performer at Faneuil Hall. After having a chance to test some new cabaret material at the Toronto Magic Company, she was inspired. A few years later, Ling’s magician friends from Toronto visited Boston, and they sent out a call for local magicians to come hang out. It was then that Ling met many of the magicians who would join the Boston Magic Lab crew. “[I] realized that there’s a lot of little tribes of magicians in the area who were also craving the same thing that I was looking for,” Ling said, “which was community and a place to perform and try out new stuff.”
While open mics exist in stand-up comedy, the concept of a magic open mic is a relatively new idea. “I think part of the challenge of magic is a lot of people do it as a hobby, which is great, but then it’s always tough to find places to perform live, where you can test new material and you can be, quote unquote, you can be bad to get better,” said magician Adrian Saw, an Australian financial trader based in Singapore who has performed magic in comedy clubs throughout Asia. An open mic platform gives new magicians an opportunity to practice and seasoned professionals a chance to take risks.
One of Ling’s goals for the organization is to spotlight local magicians. In pre-pandemic times, the Boston Magic Lab was housed in the Rozzie Square Theater. “Feeling like Boston is very important to us,” said Ling. “The goal is still to try and keep three slots for Boston area or New England area magicians.” Another of Ling’s goals is to showcase marginalized peoples. “There are so few magicians who aren't white men, just to be blunt,” she said. “I think [representation]’s really important because for me, the first time I saw a magician on stage who looked kind of like me, that was huge.”
Like all the performing arts, magic has been struck a terrible blow by the pandemic and the subsequent closure of nearly all in-person venues. Magic carries a physicality that is distinctly lost in this virtual world. Viewing tricks through a screen is a significant change in the experience, not just for audiences, but for the magicians themselves.
“If I, for example, turned a coin into a solid steel ball, you just have to believe that what you're seeing is a solid steel ball, you can't actually feel it. You can't actually see that this is a solid steel ball, no longer a coin, and that's the most difficult part, because everything is visual, is no longer tangible,” said Jay S. Chun, an Edmonton based street performer known for her circus skills. “And as a street performer who works with a lot of, ‘Come close, feel my props, these are regular props, let's do magic with them,’ is entirely out the window.”
Similar to stand-up comedy, magic relies heavily on feeding off of an audience’s energy — interpreting reactions and altering one’s performance in real time to create a unique and engaging show. Performing for a screen is very different from performing on the street, in a club, or on a stage. “For me, what this is is just a great big game of pretend,” said Benjamin L. Barnes, the current Entertainment Director at the Chicago Magic Lounge. “I am imagining what [people in the audience] look like, I am imagining that they're having fun and so I'm having fun with them, never seeing them. It's all just make believe. And I imagine things are going great ... There was one point in the show where I said to everyone, ‘I can see some of you are clapping, thank you so much.’ I saw none of that, it's just in my imagination.”
A virtual format does come with some benefits. “It's been some of the most creative times of my life because I'm able to pursue stuff that I wouldn't normally do,” said Louie M. Foxx, a Seattle based magician and two-time Guinness World Record holder, who has been experimenting with creating short pieces of pre recorded content.
Saw agreed, referencing a trick he did with a coin during the recent Boston Magic Lab performance — something that would usually be considered close-up magic. “I couldn't really do that in a live environment, in a stand-up or comedy room because no one past the first row could see that coin, but in a Zoom environment where you've got the camera right there and the audience can see a tight frame, you can start using different things that you wouldn't otherwise use in a live show.”
For now, virtual shows are the only option for most magicians. All of the Boston Magic Lab performers emphasized the importance of pivoting and taking advantage of this new opportunity. “Every single platform: TV magic, close-up magic, parlor, stage, they each have their own beauty to it, and you just have to try to find that beauty in every single one,” said Linda Hung, a recent graduate of Pace University currently based in NYC. “And virtual shows [are] just a new platform that people need to find the beauty [in].”
Barnes said that, if anything, magicians will be better performers after working in the virtual realm. “I think this situation has forced us to learn to connect with people more because of the obstacles of not being there with them physically ... If you can connect with people through a camera, that's a great skill to have.”
For the Boston Magic Lab, moving beyond physical space means reaching a larger circle of magicians. “I think switching online has helped me find people in the New England area, actually, that I did not know of here,” said Ling.
The performing arts scene is bound to emerge from the pandemic as a changed industry. Much of in-person magic involves working with volunteers, passing around props, and choosing cards, but in a post-pandemic world concerned about hygiene, this is unlikely to come back any time soon. All of the performers agreed that the virtual magic show is here to stay, even after a return to in-person venues is possible. “It's inexpensive, you can connect people in different geographic locations, and it's a lot of fun, and I don't think it's going to go away just because we can be together in person again … honestly, I think it's good. It's another avenue through which magicians can make a living, which is fantastic,” Barnes said.
Audiences may be Zoom-fatigued, but there are still reasons to seek out virtual magic shows, even more so than other virtual entertainment. “[In] most of those other art forms it's a fixed performance and an audience member would see that same show if they watched that virtual performance five times,”Saw said. “But in a magic show, you're going to have audience members making different decisions ... I think people have been so isolated that just sitting, watching passively a Zoom show is not really what people want in this kind of environment — they want to be involved. They want to have their camera on. They want to talk, they want to make decisions, and I would say magic is probably one of the only art forms in a virtual medium where people can do that.”
As for the Boston Magic Lab, they intend to resume performances in January 2021 after a two-month hiatus, during which they plan to rework and improve their show and continue to build an unpretentious and inclusive community.
We're not a nonprofit, we're not an official organization,” said Ling. “We're just a group of friends who want to put together a good show.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid the never-ending chaos of 2020, both music and film are playing a part in helping everyone stay sane and grounded. This playlist is dedicated to the powerful intersection between the two art forms. Here are just some of the iconic needle drops of the past few decades that have made movies more memorable.
“The Power of Love” by Huey Lewis and the News — “Back to the Future” (1985) 
The lighthearted, adventurous whimsy of “Back to the Future” is perfectly encapsulated by the “The Power of Love'' by Huey Lewis and the News. The song plays during the opening credits sequence, as everyman protagonist Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) rides his skateboard to school with gritty rock guitar and classic ‘80s synths backing him up. The pure optimism of the song is undeniably infectious — you can’t help but smile while watching this scene.
“Modern Love” by David Bowie — “Frances Ha” (2013)
In the black and white indie gem “Frances Ha,” there’s a nod to the French film “Mauvais Sang,” in which Greta Gerwig’s character runs and dances spiritedly down several New York City blocks to the effervescent “Modern Love.” With abundant charm, this scene captures the dream of the city that the titular Frances is trying to cling to. (For another movie featuring a woman dancing without a care to “Modern Love,” watch the 2015 rom-com “Sleeping With Other People.”)
“Visions of Gideon” by Sufjan Stevens — “Call Me By Your Name” (2017)
Timothée Chalamet simultaneously captures and breaks viewers' hearts as he silently cries in front of a crackling fireplace at the end of “Call Me By Your Name.” While Chalamet’s acting is incredibly emotive, Sufjan Stevens’ “Visions of Gideon'' elevates the scene to a new level. Stevens’ ethereal voice reflects Elio’s heartbreak with devastating beauty.
“Fight the Power” by Public Enemy — “Do the Right Thing” (1989)
In Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing,” the quintessential protest song “Fight the Power” by Public Enemy is featured multiple times, playing during the opening credits and proudly blasting from Radio Raheem’s (Bill Nunn) boombox. The defiant beat and lyrics — “We got to fight the powers that be” — set the tone for the film and its exploration of tense race relations in Brooklyn.
“In Your Eyes” by Peter Gabriel — “Say Anything...” (1989)
When Lloyd Dobbler (John Cusack) holds up a boombox playing Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes” outside of his ex-girlfriend Diane Court’s (Ione Skye) window, is it stalkerish and creepy? Is it the epitome of grand gesture, swoon-worthy romance? Interpretations may vary, but the iconic image of Lloyd — one of the most likable coming-of-age protagonists to date — holding up that boombox is permanently seared into our collective memory.
“Sunflower” by Post Malone and Swae Lee — “Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse” (2018)
At the beginning of the animated film “Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse,” Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) listens to the feel-good hit “Sunflower” in his headphones, absent-mindedly singing along as his parents call for him to get ready for school. The scene is short but truly endearing as it helps us get to know Miles as a character. Try to keep yourself from singing along with him — it’s impossible.
Finally, a few honorable mentions:
“Redbone” by Childish Gambino — ”Get Out”(2017)
“Tiny Dancer” by Elton John — ”Almost Famous” (2000)
“Changes” by Butterfly Boucher ft. David Bowie — ”Shrek 2” (2004)
“Falling Slowly” by Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová — ”Once” (2007)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During her time at Harvard College, Katie E. Low ’12 was premed. Now, she works as an animator at Walt Disney Animation Studios and runs a podcast called Animation Happy Hour, where she informs and inspires young animation students hoping to break into the industry. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Low about entering the animation industry, her work at Disney, and her thoughts on representation in the animation industry.
The Harvard Crimson: You came into Harvard as a premed, but instead of going to medical school post-grad, you decided to pursue animation at the Savannah College of Art and Design. What drew you towards pursuing animation after you graduated? When did you first get interested in it?
Katie E. Low: At the very beginning, I remember flipping through the course catalog as a freshman, and I saw that they had animation courses. Right then, I knew; I had like a heart flutter [and] was really excited — but it conflicted with my choir rehearsals. So, I kind of quieted that interest right away freshman year.
I remember the exact moment where I decided to switch gears. It was when I failed an organic chemistry midterm, and I got a horrible grade, I think it was just embarrassingly low, like in the 30s, or 40s. It was horrible. And I went from a panic attack to total peace when I realized, okay, maybe this isn't for me, and I should pursue what I'm actually interested in. And I went through that roller coaster of emotion, I think, honestly, within two hours.
And so I took my first animation course junior year; I dropped choir. Even though my first animation was terrible, I did all these drawings in my dorm room, and then I took them into Sever hall to scan them, and used the software to actually have them animate. And seeing that come to life for the first time — I think I was hooked right then and there.
THC: What's your favorite part about being an animator? And what are you proudest of in your work? What makes the medium of animation special to you?
KEL: I think that animation provides the necessary distance to discuss very difficult subjects — whether it's something like stereotyping or bias in “Zootopia” or female empowerment and believing in yourself in a movie like “Frozen.” So that's one very big picture reason I love animation: I think live action can be more on the nose with a subject, and you can't as metaphorically approach a difficult subject like race.
But then, the second reason really is just a love for the craft. I love that so much thought goes into every single frame of animation — whether it's deciding how long to hold a blink, whether you do a double blink, or something like that. And that contains the intent of the acting entirely. Or sculpting a facial expression in a specific way for a specific character or studying reindeer locomotion if you have to animate a reindeer. Actually, that's what keeps animation fresh for me, as every assignment I have is different. I keep having to study and reference real things in real life to inform my work. It really never gets old, and it's always a new challenge.
THC: What have been your favorite projects that you worked on, at Disney or before? And kind of what were the highlights and challenges of these? And what made them special to you?
KEL: So my first movie was “Ralph Breaks the Internet,” and I was a production assistant on that film. The department that I assisted the most was story, which was just so much fun to be a part of because I was in all of the story meetings and pitches and brainstorms with the directors, the story team, and the producer. I can't imagine a better place to be a fly on the wall; you're really seeing the movie come to life... I actually, as PA, even pitched a couple ideas, which is really exciting for me. That was, I guess, kind of the first project where I felt like I actually really contributed to a film.
“Frozen 2” obviously, that was the first film where I actually animated, and it's so hard to express what it means to see your work on the screen, because it's something that was so close to you, and like started in your head, which then, you know, you can go see with your family. And for me, I think the most rewarding moment I've had so far was [when] I animated Elsa singing in "Some Things Never Change," and then I saw my three year old niece later on, and she actually was singing along to the lyrics I animated. And for me, that makes it all worth it — just knowing that these movies actually mean something to so many children and so many families. And it really has a life of its own outside of your stressful work life. It makes it all worth it — any late hours you pull or anything like that.
THC: What inspired you to start “Animation Happy Hour”? What is it like entering a whole new type of creative space? And how has the podcast grown since it started? What's been your favorite part of working on it?
KEL: I started the podcast because I found that I was getting lots of emails from students who are trying to break into the industry. They were all kind of asking the same questions. And it definitely reached a point where the volume of inquiries exceeded my ability to respond, and I just wanted a more efficient way to get that information out there. I wanted to kind of democratize that information as well because I felt like, personally, I've had a lot of advantages, as I've broken in, so any way that I can help level the playing field, I wanted to take part in.
And this gets a little personal, but it's no secret that there are less female creatives in animation. I think it's a complex issue. And there are multiple reasons for that. But one cause I definitely think is confidence. I think a lot of women, maybe like me, reach a point where they don't feel like their skill set is strong enough, so then they pivot into something else where they feel more comfortable — and they don't kind of work through that discomfort. And I want this podcast to help, especially other women or minorities that are underrepresented, work through those tough times and those tough periods of insecurity to hopefully get better representation in our industry.
THC: Could you speak a little bit more about the issues of representation that you've mentioned about the animation industry? What changes need to be made to kind of create more representation? Or is it just kind of an issue of just, you know, inspiring people to go for it?
KEL: Any discipline in animation, I think, takes five to 10 years of very focused study and training to reach a professional level — especially at any of the top studios where everyone needs to be hyper specialized and basically masters of their craft. And what I think it boils down to is definitely money and accessibility, which is going to favor white men, when you kind of break it all down. I think that's probably the number one issue to address at the heart of it. And I think it can kind of parallel discussions of affirmative action for college admissions, where maybe recruiters don't prioritize the absolute best, most polished, most professional portfolio they see, maybe they do start taking into account factors like race and gender and the schools that people are applying from, and just the access that a prospective candidate might have had.
But on top of that, I do think it is multifaceted. I think we'll start to see a shift because places like Disney do have women in prominent leadership roles. Like we have Jennifer Lee, who is our chief creative officer and has directed “Frozen”/”Frozen 2” and she's more visible in a way that women hadn't been before. And we recently had a documentary series about the making of “Frozen 2” where we featured a lot of our prominent female artists. I do hope that that exposure will inspire the next generation of minority and female artists to break in.

Tom Rogers ’84 came into his senior year of high school thinking he wanted to be a physicist. Now, after a nine-year stint as a staff writer for Disney animated television, he has a Daytime Emmy to his name for “Elena of Avalor,” a book titled “Eleven,” and a whole host of awards for his various movies. Rogers is the writer behind such childhood classics as “Kronk’s New Groove,” “Cinderella II: Dreams Come True,” and “The Lion King 1½,” as well as his new show, “The Chicken Squad,” which is coming to Disney Junior in the fall of 2021. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Rogers to talk about his circuitous path to writerdom and Disney’s move away from “white princess culture.”
The Harvard Crimson: Disney magic has made up a great deal of our collective childhoods. What inspired you to start working with Disney?
Tom Rogers: I came to it in a very roundabout way. My Harvard experience was all about discovering, trying to figure out what interested me, what direction to go — and Harvard can be kind of an intimidating place, especially when you’re surrounded by people who are very sure of who they are and what they want to be.
[After college] I got what amounts to a sort of menial entry-level job, as a script reader. I did that for a long time and kind of had a revelation, which is: None of these people needed permission or credentials to become a writer — they just needed to get busy writing. And so I did.
An executive who knew some of my work had worked for Disney, and asked if I wanted to come write a “Cinderella” short about Cinderella’s life in the palace after “Happily Ever After.” I loved it. I loved the imagination that went into it; I was writing this little story that involved Cinderella and her little mouse friends, Jaq-Jaq and Gus-Gus, and I bought little plush toys of each of them and I would put them up on top of the computer monitor so I could talk to them, have conversations with them. My wife thought I was losing my mind because she could hear me doing their voices, you know, [imitating] ‘Oh, hey, Jaq-Jaq!’ You do it to try to get into the character and write in the rhythms that they speak in. And I guess I did a pretty decent job of it, because that team hired me on to do some additional work, and that led to another show, and another show, and I became a staff writer in that division for about nine years, which was just a great training ground.
THC: If you had to pick a lesson from something you’ve made which you would really like to espouse, which would that be?
TR: I wrote a book a couple of years ago for middle school kids called “Eleven.” It’s about a boy turning eleven on 9/11. In part, I wrote it as a didactic tool, as a way to teach, but I also wanted it to be an engaging story. And a consistent theme I find in all the things I write is what it means to be a hero, what it means to have courage. When I was a little kid and I used to dream about being a hero, my daydreams were kid fantasies about running into a burning building and saving everyone, and all the pretty girls wanted to be my girlfriend, because I was the hero of the day. And then, growing up, understanding courage is sometimes being strong in the face of your fear, standing up quietly for what’s right, being responsible for someone else when you could turn your back and walk away. Those things are also heroic. And I was able to put that into this book. It becomes a discovery of what it means to be a hero when you’re put into a situation that challenges you beyond your emotional capabilities. That’s a story I’m really proud of.
THC: How has writing for Disney changed over the years you’ve been working there?
TR: I think the emphasis on moving away from a kind of monolithic white princess culture to recognizing the world that we’re in, and representing that world both on screen and behind the camera. My show –– of our four main characters, two are African-American, because we want to have those voices represented. Of our top 30 cast members, probably just under half are non-white. It’s just better storytelling to not have everybody sound the same and look the same and think the same. The same is true on our writing staff and our artist staff. [There are] way more than 50% women on our crew, which is really good, and certainly wasn’t always the case. Traditional animation was very much a boys’ club. I mean, look, I’m a middle-aged white male, I can’t myself diversify things, but I can use my position to create opportunities to make that happen. I don’t want to do any back-patting, but I’ve been proud of all my shows really pushing to make those opportunities happen. We are aligned, both Disney and I, and everyone else I know that’s making shows now, that this is the way it should be and needs to be. So that’s probably the biggest change.
THC: Tell me a little bit about your new show!
TR: It’s called “The Chicken Squad”! We will come to air in –– the plan right now is — spring of 2021, on Disney Junior, eventually to be released on Disney Plus. It’s based on a series of kids’ books by Doreen Cronin, and it’s about this team of siblings: three little chickens, Coop, Sweetie, and Little Boo, who are a team of scouts. They go around solving little mysteries and helping out their neighbours. Then they have this mentor named Captain Tully, a search-and-rescue dog who’s supposed to be sort of a watchdog over this suburban backyard chicken coop, but she becomes their teacher. We’re having a ball, it’s great, and we’re trying to lean in on positive storytelling and the social and emotional learning messages for kids.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week’s iteration of “The Undoing” feels far too similar to the previous two episodes — with the exception of a twist in its final five minutes. With a feel more like a soap opera episode or a TV sitcom, “Do No Harm” doesn’t seem to do a whole lot of anything. The audience gets to meet a few new characters and see a couple new places, but by and large, it’s nothing special.
One of the most unfortunate letdowns of the episode is its introduction. After a killer cliffhanger in the final moments of episode two, episode three wastes that exciting climax in a redo of previous scenes. Letting down its audience’s anticipation, the show relies on previously-shot material scattered with repetitive dialogue between Grace (Nicole Kidman) and Detective Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez) and leaves its audience wanting more.
While the episode lacks particular innovation, its visual and sonic effects still manage to creatively portray the show’s building tension. We see New York through a tilt-shift lens as Grace grapples with the very real possibility her husband, Jonathan (Hugh Grant) is a gruesome murderer and her father has been lying to her. The quietly hopeful tune as Grace goes to see Jonathan for the first time in jail sets the mood without being too blunt. The silent tension in the car when Grace commutes to and from jail establishes the terror she is feeling, finally confronting her husband for the first time while the mystery swirling around the whole ordeal only grows.
In the final five minutes, that building tension finally pays off. The show serves up an ultimate reveal — Grace Fraser may in fact be Elena Alves’ (Matilda De Angelis) murderer. In this moment, the entire perspective of the show shifts. It is no longer clear if the protagonist that has been the center of attention for the first three episodes has in some ways deceived the audience and herself by killing Elena Alves.
With that one fell swoop performed with perfect frustration and anger from Detective Mendoza, the curious interactions from the previous episodes between Grace and the police seem to make far more sense. These men weren’t needlessly harassing a one-percenter, they were going after a legitimate lead and got stonewalled. In this one interaction, the writing (David E. Kelley) and directing (Susanne Bier) prowess of the show became abundantly clear. Such an understandable but also completely unexpected twist takes the episode and show from enjoyable and exciting to truly breathtaking.
In one particular moment, even before the climactic interaction between Mendoza and Grace, Donald Sutherland shines as Grace’s father Franklin Reinhart and livens up the screen. Drawing from his decades of experience, we see him practically spit at the feet of Detective Mendoza without even raising his voice. The disdain for this man tearing apart his daughter’s family was palpable. In what was a phenomenal display of his power in the show, Franklin demanded the audience’s attention and added life to a slow portion of the episode.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an easily digestible 116 pages, Don DeLillo eloquently demonstrates the fragility of our pre-pandemic way of life. Every moment of our days were fraught with experiences taken for granted. “The Silence,” through a carefully constructed criticism of everyday squander, shows the value of being present in every moment. With only five main characters, this novel whisks readers through carefully crafted streams of consciousness — all demonstrating how, at any moment, life can irrevocably change.
Part one begins with a couple flying back to the United States from a short getaway across southern Europe. Together, Jim Kripps and Tessa Berens follow their usual routine for flying home from vacation, mindlessly talking about nothing in particular on the flight and staring out the window. By clearly and concisely describing the boredom and mindlessness people around the world must tolerate in order to be able to travel and commute, DeLillo lays out the error in our ways. People vegetate on planes all hours of the day, waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel — completely letting the present slip away as they watch the newest blockbuster movie or drink complimentary champagne until they pass out, only to wake up at their destination.
The story continues with Max Sterner and Diane Lucas waiting for their friends' arrival to enjoy the Super Bowl. Diane asks a previous student she was close with, Martin Dekker, to visit as well. Throughout the entirety of the book’s introduction to Max and Diane, Max is wholly absorbed in the game, awaiting and betting on each play. Diane and Martin talk for pages about the irrelevancies of what Martin studies. DeLillo captures the awkward moments of everyday life through impressionist representations of normalcy. The slight exaggeration of Max’s dedication to the game and Diane’s apathy towards her husband highlight the lackluster attitude of common people today, rolling through the day, letting time pass them by.
The central intrigue of “The Silence” is revealed at the end of the first and second chapters of the book. Following the introduction of the two sets of characters, Jim and Tessa’s flight loses power, and so does Max and Diane’s apartment building; the Super Bowl screen goes black. Thanks to this one event, the entire story shifts and develops into a scathing critique of modern dependence on technology.
After their plane crashes in Newark, Jim and Tessa mindlessly fumble along with other passengers to a clinic to be assessed and then discharged. Without the aid and distraction of cell phones and television, the clinic waiting room transforms into a startling display of people’s inability to communicate and wait. the loss of the immediate gratification machines pushes everyone into a somber lull. Eventually, Jim and Tessa succumb to their desires and slip into the single clinic restroom to make love to each other without a single thought to the impact it may have on others around them. The main characters of our story — neither protagonists nor antagonists — become lost in a new, dark world.
Bumbling back and forth, mumbling about many nothings, it quickly becomes apparent that the characters have almost lost their humanity: Ripping technology away stripped the characters of what they knew to be real in an ever-changing world. Tessa and Jim fumble around the clinic, trying to make their way to the Super Bowl watch party. Max and Diane struggle with the loss of their pivotal event. Max nurses a bottle of whiskey, waiting for the game to return. Diane and Martin trade smalltalk about the wonders of science.
Removing the structure of chapters and clear delineation of a set story in part two, the novel transforms into an almost diary-like flow of different thoughts from varying perspectives. We see Max wander silently out of the apartment to the cacophony on the streets below, counting the stairs and listening to the noises of a growing chaos. Jim and Tessa slip away to try and sleep away the problems. Diane and Martin, almost fall into an elopement, grabbing each other tight and waiting for change.
In a unique approach to critique the fragility of our technology-ruled lives, “The Silence” beautifully grabs the attention of readers with a unique perspective on modern issues. Living in the real twenty-first century, people know firsthand the fragility of modern-day life. The pandemic has ripped away any semblance of normalcy for billions all over the world. In DeLillo’s story, there is but a single moment of realism slipping through the cracks of catastrophe. While our main characters fumble for purpose in a dark world, a lone woman still goes out for her run.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rebecca Roanhorse’s latest release, an adult fantasy inspired by civilizations of the Pre-Columbian Americas, delivers an epic adventure filled with magic and intrigue. The book follows Nara, a priest who is trying her best but has the odds stacked against her; Xiala, a pirate captain with mystical powers and a distrustful crew; Okoa, a son of a mysteriously murdered clan matron, and Serapio, a young man prophesied to be a lost god reborn. Their lives converge in the days leading up to a rare occurrence: the solstice lining up with a full eclipse, where the sun is at its weakest and those who follow the cult of the lost Crow God are planning on staging a coup. “Black Sun” is a powerful novel that brings something truly new to the adult fantasy genre.
This book has one of the most outstanding first chapters of recent fantasy releases. The first 10 pages set an exhilarating pace, drawing the reader in with exciting questions and very few answers. Unfortunately, after this, the pace is slightly hindered by necessary worldbuilding, and remains clipped until halfway through the novel. But the speed is a reasonable trade-off, considering just how expansive and fascinating the novel’s world is.
Roanhorse expertly crafts an innovative fantasy world in a very short amount of time. Complete with complex political systems, matriarchal clans, and even a seedy underbelly, the primary city of Tova is so vividly described it feels real. The societies Roanhorse crafts here are also excitingly non-heteronormative. The book explores gender dynamics in a compelling manner, and thus is a breath of fresh air in a fantasy literature landscape that’s filled with 1,001 magical reimaginings of Western Europe.
Part of the reason why the world feels so expansive is because it is explored through a rich ensemble cast — each individual possesses a unique role within the story. Seen through a rotating point-of-view, the primary four characters have depth and roundness, and the secondary characters are also well-developed.
One of the most gripping elements of this book comes from the fact that this shifting point-of-view breaks the characters from the traditional protagonist and antagonist structure. For example, Serapio as a protagonist would necessitate Nara’s portrayal as an antagonist, but since the reader is given both points of view, they are encouraged to root for both, despite knowing that the goals of each character are in direct opposition and a happy ending for all is impossible.Through this narrative style, each character is highly emotionally developed and sympathetic, even when they toe the line between hero and villain.
While the characters themselves are incredible, some of the primary four’s arcs feel weaker than others. Xiala’s personal character arc slows down when a romantic interest is introduced, which was especially disappointing given her compelling independence. However, since this is the first book of a new series, one can only assume that her character will get the exploration she deserves in future installments.
While this book is not for the faint of heart — given the violence, vengeance, and betrayal — it is an enjoyable emotional rollercoaster. Though the book has many things going for it, “Black Sun” is most memorable for its high stakes. Roanhorse deftly cements the importance of the events of this novel. Each chapter, regardless of which character it follows or whether it is in the present or a flashback, feels integral to the plot. Each chapter also covers many modes of expansion, adding something new to both the personal and political spheres of the novel — which is not an easy task when a book follows so many different lines of plot and character.
Overall, this new release is a stunning addition to Roanhorse’s prior work. “Black Sun” is an electrifying read for fantasy fans to sink their teeth into, and the wait is already unbearable for the next installment of the series.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to a recent investigation by the Chronicle of Higher Education, national political polarization has permeated the governance structure of American public colleges and universities, resulting in a lack of trust in university governing boards. Many public flagship university board members undergo a political-appointment process, whether it be through direct appointment by governors or with the approval of lawmakers. The Chronicle found that the appointment process for governing boards is oftentimes controlled by one political party, who are most often Republicans despite the liberal-leaning nature of most college campuses. Board members across the nation’s public flagship campuses or state systems have also poured at least $19.7 million into political campaigns and partisan causes within their institution’s states.
So what are the effects of this political polarization and the disconnect between the political leanings of the governing boards and the campus community? One example in which this divide is evident is the COVID-19 pandemic. Members of university communities whose governing boards decided to require them to return to campus this fall — often with limited infection control measures cricitized by experts — were critical of their own governing boards’ handling of the decision. In these instances, the political and financial motivations of those that set policy for the universities are quite literally at odds with the health and safety of those they are meant to serve.
This phenomenon is deeply alarming. The fabric of our lives as students should not be determined by the whims of people whose loyalties lie elsewhere. And it is not just isolated to the politics of public colleges and universities — in fact, Harvard’s own governance structure finds itself in a unique political position.
We believe that Harvard must engage politically on the national stage. In the past, in fact, we’ve been skeptical about our own University’s claims that its leadership is and should remain apolitical, in the context of prison and fossil fuel divestment. We’ve lauded Harvard when it has taken political stances and criticized it for failing to take others. Often what appears as a political statement is actually a moral one, especially during the Trump administration, when civil rights have been under constant attack.
But Harvard must also reflect on the morality behind its own internal decisions, whether seemingly political or not. When does Harvard choose to take a stand against sexual assault and when does it not? When does Harvard turn a blind eye to issues in its own police department? When does it benefit from tax breaks on property that take money away from city budgets?
Harvard should be political. But its political nature must extend to a reflection on internal policies as well as national ones, for these two approaches cannot be separated. Our own leaders and governing boards must be held to the same level of scrutiny that we expect Harvard to hold our national government to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nov. 1, the restrictive early action deadline, marked the beginning of the Harvard College Admissions’s annual five-month sprint to assemble an incoming class that reflects the widest possible spectrum of race, gender, geographic origin, socioeconomic status, and academic and co-curricular interests.
Harvard’s admissions practices are designed to help the selection committee build a diverse College class. But before the admissions committee gets lost in this year’s search, they should take some time to think about how their work can be transformed into a powerful tool to create diverse high school classes, too.
High schools in affluent areas are acutely aware of the way they are viewed by selective colleges. When my San Francisco high school abolished Advanced Placement testing in a laudable effort to increase academic exploration and empower the faculty to focus on their specific strengths, it only did so after many assurances from college admissions departments that students wouldn’t be penalized. As at many schools that made similar decisions, parents were scared that their kids wouldn’t gain admission to selective universities. So we know that, at least in well-off communities, colleges hold a lot of potential sway in the way secondary education is structured. It’s time for Harvard to claim this power.
Although there’s some debate about which metric is best for measuring school segregation, it’s clear that the American school system is more segregated than it has been in decades. What if Harvard stated a preference for students from racially diverse high schools — would that compel affluent school systems to beef up their diversity initiatives and broadly encourage the reintegration of American K-12 education? It’s a powerful idea, and one worth exploring.
No, this wouldn’t be a silver bullet to fix high school stratification. It might work best in urban school systems like San Francisco’s, where racial segregation exists in a dense enough geographical area that remedies are possible. This was my experience — my high school seemed to use geography as a proxy for race, admitting students from scores of middle schools across San Francisco, a city whose racial diversity is organized by neighborhood.
But other barriers remain: Most schools won’t have the financial resources to expand access to other students, and plenty of selective schools simply won’t care. However, at least in some school systems, Harvard might have the power to declare its values and use its college admissions policy to make a difference.
Why stop at race? Harvard should declare a preference for students from socioeconomically diverse high schools as well. We live in an era of great socioeconomic stratification, and it should be news to nobody that this affects schools and educational outcomes deeply. If the admissions office announced that, starting in about five years, they were going to give an active boost to applicants with the worldview and interpersonal experience garnered by learning in a diverse environment, I predict that private, parochial, and insular public schools across the country would scramble to open themselves up to poorer students who are currently denied access to such educational spaces.
Like all other factors in Harvard’s admission process, the diversity of applicants’ high school environments should be considered in a holistic manner that takes access into account. It would be unfair to penalize students from under-resourced schools for failing to come from a diverse student body, and it would be similarly difficult to justify penalizing a student from Sausalito, Calif. (93 percent white, just across the Golden Gate Bridge) for not coming from a school as racially diverse as a student from San Francisco (47 percent white). Instead of putting the burden on applicants directly, I imagine this policy playing out more indirectly in the form of competition between rival school administrators to ensure that their school is on par with the region’s diversity leaders. Concerned parents and students, with the privilege to do so, would vote with their feet to choose more diverse academic settings.
To be sure, this approach could become a slippery slope. Harvard could theoretically use its admissions leverage in support of any number of issues: After race and income, why not select for schools with rich opportunities for public service, or schools that offer programming in sexual harassment prevention? Heck — what if Harvard stated a preference for schools that required students to read the newspaper?
Maybe The Crimson’s readers would support the last, somewhat frivolous, suggestion, but we need to set a limit somewhere. Should Harvard put its gravitas on the line in order to take a (likely ineffectual) stand on more controversial issues like endorsing secular education or supporting a progressive dress code? Probably not. Luckily, emphasizing racial and economic diversity is more than an arbitrary stand — Harvard can make the clear case that students from desegregated schools will more comfortably contribute to the diverse college class.
Harvard already has a lot of tools at its disposal for influencing the way secondary education is carried out, from training teachers to developing curricula. As this year’s admissions process kicks off, it’s time for Harvard to recognize that it has one more tool at its disposal.

Tom Lehrer is no longer a household name, but he was one of the most important political satirists of the 20th century. A musical comedian, his lyrics are edgy, irreverent and heroically creative. Working from the 1950s through the 1960s, he mocked the Church, the Army, the space program — no cow remained sacred. His crudity kept him off the radio and away from full mainstream success, but he still sold millions of records and, maybe more importantly, influenced the comedians of today. Weird Al Yankovich, Randy Newman, and Lizz Winstead, the creator of The Daily Show, all cite him directly. Bo Burnham is a clear spiritual descendant. As political satire has blitzkrieged mainstream American culture, it’s worth looking at its greatest practitioner in the 20th century and seeing what we can learn.
The most obvious element of Lehrer’s biography is his titanic intellect. In 1946, at the age of 18, he started his Ph.D. in math at Harvard (a place he memorably termed a “hotbed of celibacy”). In a group of friends that included a future Nobel laureate, he was considered “the intellectual leader.” Equally impressive as a musician, he once entertained friends at a Harvard party by playing Rachmaninoff in two keys at once, one for each hand.
In college, he wrote musical comedy simply to entertain at parties. But especially as Lehrer’s career took off, much of his work turned more political. On the nuclear arms race: “‘The Lord’s our shepherd’ / says the psalm / but just in case / we better get a bomb.” On nominal liberals: “It’s fun to eulogize the/ people you despise as / long as you don’t let them in your schools.”
This makes his opinion on political satire all the more striking: that it doesn’t work. Lehrer points out that satire is by definition the drawing of exaggerated comparisons, so an “opponent then can easily say 'well yeah, but that's exaggeration, that's not how it is'. Which is true.” His song, “I Wanna Go Back To Dixie,” attacking the racial undertones of Southern nostalgia, probably didn’t convince anyone to rethink their behavior. Overt racists would probably agree that they “ain’t seen one good lynching in years;” others would respond that it’s reductive and simplistic to say that you can’t separate racial and nonracial Southern nostalgia.
I think Lehrer was broadly right, but not quite generous enough to himself. Consider “It Makes a Fellow Proud to be a Soldier,” Lehrer’s send-up of the U.S. Army. If someone were to criticize the Army’s competence in 1959, reverence for the institution might well lead a listener to dismiss their arguments out of hand. Humor may not win debates, but it allows us to have debates we otherwise wouldn’t.
When Lehrer’s satire had real political utility, then, it was in helping shift the window of what could be permissibly challenged. Satire cannot slay the sacred cow, but it can remove its protected status.
If that’s all political satire can do, it’s worth asking what it still has to offer. Lehrer bravely attacked the Church, the Presidency, the Boy Scouts; it doesn’t take much bravery for a comedian to take on those institutions anymore. As the left has gained cultural power, many of America’s sacred cows now belong to the left. So what’s a liberal satirist to do?
The satire that now dominates mainstream American culture — the Daily Show, the late-night shows, Saturday Night Live more than ever before — have largely chosen to produce comfortable white noise for like-minded viewers. Fine. Much of Lehrer’s work preached to the converted. The difference is that Lehrer found comedy in poking bears, while these shows simply laugh at carcasses.
Bo Burnham is a clearer heir to Tom Lehrer. He is a musical, irreverent, peerlessly witty comedian, by turns darkly nonsensical and socially observant. He has one foot outside the mainstream. Like Lehrer, his satire is very strongly liberal, but he continues Lehrer’s tradition of irreverence; very few ideologues of any persuasion could sit through his show totally unperturbed. “Kill Yourself” is an excellent example.
Of course, satirists probably shouldn’t upend every taboo just for the hell of it; they should have higher goals than that. But so far in its history, satire has done little else successfully. So SNL and the Daily Show and all the rest have a decision to make: are there any sacred cows left worth targeting? If not, then satire must reinvent itself. I don’t know how, and from the looks of it, neither does anyone else.

Amid a skyrocketing nationwide coronavirus case count, University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced in an email last week that the majority of faculty, staff, and academic personnel will continue working remotely through June 30, 2021.
In her Nov. 12 missive to faculty, staff, and academic personnel, Lapp cited “real financial challenges and uncertainty” stemming from the pandemic that necessitate University-wide operational changes.
“We expect continued financial pressure as students defer admission, on-campus programming is canceled, financial aid needs increase, and new costs for campus testing, tracing, and safety must be absorbed,” she wrote. “This combination of factors is expected to result in a larger deficit from operations for the current year, thus placing constraints on the University’s finances.”
Lapp wrote that this expectation justifies a modified emergency excused absence policy, which has sustained regular salaries and benefits for all directly employed staff and some contract workers since the pandemic halted their work in March.
“As most parts of the campus remain closed, and the financial impacts to the University continue, there are limits to our ability to do so indefinitely,” she wrote.
Effective Jan. 15, 2021, directly employed staff will only receive up to 70 percent of their normal pay under the policy, and the majority of contract workers will be ineligible for this emergency benefit.
The University is also extending its new dependent well care benefit, which Lapp wrote will provide eligible staff up to 10 days of paid time off between Jan. 1 and June 30 to care for dependents who are well but whose care arrangements have been disrupted by COVID-19.
“This benefit is intended to reduce the stress that families are facing due to the competing demands of work, caring for dependents, and remote schooling during the pandemic,” she wrote.
Lapp also announced that changes to policies on the use of sick time — including flexible use for illness, isolation, and quarantine for workers and their dependents — will also remain in effect through June 30, 2021.
Harvard will extend winter recess in recognition of employees’ “remarkable creativity, grit, and determination,” according to Lapp. It will now start on Monday, Dec. 21, rather than at noon on Thursday, Dec. 24, as previously scheduled, she wrote.

Domestic assault prevention activists and Cambridge officials proposed ways law enforcement and other service providers can support vulnerable people who experience domestic violence in a webinar hosted by the City of Cambridge Monday.
The keynote speaker, Wanda Swan, presented a lecture on the history of white supremacy and policing in America to contextualize the conversation, which included remarks from Cambridge Police Department Superintendent Christine A. Elow and domestic violence prevention activists Jenn Ho and Shameka Gregory.
Swan, who runs a nonprofit focused on supporting Black individuals who experience trauma, said she does not believe piecemeal reforms can eradicate racism in systems founded on the oppression of Black Americans. She described whiteness as a social construct and a “conscious strategy” that emerged in colonial America to “maintain order.”
“Establishing a racial caste system that also created a Black race allowed for higher value benefits and benefits given to those who were labeled white,” she said. “But these benefits came at the cost of maintaining a system of graven inequity.”
Swan also said the original impetus for law enforcement in the United States was to strengthen racist systems and policies. She referenced slave patrols that formed in South Carolina at the start of the 18th century, which she said enforced runaway slave laws, terrorized slaves to deter revolts, and punished slaves for any perceived transgressions.
“There is a documented history in this country of a relationship with law enforcement that from its origin is harmful to Black liberation,” Swan said.
Elow, who is second in command at CPD and the highest ranking female in the department’s history, said she is aware of the police's role in enforcing racism. She said that history further exacerbates interactions between police and Black people who experience trauma.
“One of the things that I think about in my position as a police officer, that the police are the most visible, right, and oppressive harm in this system that we have in the United States today,” she said. “When I think about domestic violence situations by themselves, they are some of the most tense and unpredictable situations that police officers respond to.”
“But let’s add historical injustice and trauma on top of that, and it really does make for a perfect storm and intensifies all those emotions,” Elow added.
At CPD, Elow has helped set in motion an “interdisciplinary collaborative response” that partners police officers with groups dedicated to supporting domestic violence survivors.
“We do not want to criminalize poverty, we do not want to criminalize adolescence or addiction, or homelessness,” she said of CPD. “What we need to do is be working is working with our partners to make sure that we have systems in place that can help people and not rely on what I believe is an unjust criminal justice system.”
Gregor — one of the panelists who works at The Transition House, a Cambridge-based domestic violence intervention group — said she supports police reforms and training that seek to improve law enforcement’s response to domestic violence.
“As a society, we’re far from perfect. But while we’re working to build the one that we want, let’s work with — let’s work to improve what we have,” Gregor said. “The reality of it is there aren’t a ton of options right now. And Cambridge police is an option. And so if you’re working to do the work better, I want to see that happen.”
“At the same time, we need to be doing a better job of creating other options,” she said.
In an interview following the event, Elow said she understands calls to defund police departments given the role law enforcement has historically played in perpetuating racism. Nevertheless, Elow said CPD just wants “to be at the table.”
“This isn’t about the Cambridge police,” she said. “This is about helping people in our community that are in need. So whatever entity is there we just want to be at the table. We’ll take a step back wherever we need to take a step back.”
Correction: November 19, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Cambridge Police Department Superintendent Christine A. Elow said "historical injustice in trauma." In fact, she said "historical injustice and trauma."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to student advocacy, the College will exempt students who report sexual misconduct and harassment from consequences related to violating residential COVID-19 rules.
The new guidelines mean the College will not penalize students who come forward with allegations of sexual assault involving breaches of campus health rules. Prior to arriving on campus this fall, undergraduates living in Harvard’s dorms signed a “residential community compact,” agreeing to follow social distancing rules and other safety guidelines.
To enforce the compact and review alleged violations, the College formed a Community Council — composed of an equal number of student volunteers, faculty, and staff members — earlier this semester.
Students found in violation of the compact are subject to non-disciplinary consequences, including a warning, “community responses” such as education, and dismissal from campus housing.
Friday’s update appended new language to the compact, establishing protections from non-disciplinary actions for on-campus students.
“In order to encourage information sharing and seeking support, the College will ordinarily not hold students accountable for violations of the Residential Community Compact if those violations also include allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment,” the compact now reads.
“Nor will information disclosed by a student to a Title IX office or the Office of Dispute Resolution be considered by the Community Council,” according to the compact.
The addition states “it is not the practice” of the Title IX Coordinators to disclose information on student handbook violations to the Administrative Board or Honor Council. The coordinators also “will not provide reports about potential violations of the Compact to the Community Council,” according to the document.
Last week, the anti-sexual assault group Our Harvard Can Do Better penned an email to University officials demanding they enact what it termed an amnesty policy for students who report sexual violence.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Our Harvard Can Do Better’s advocacy prompted the addition of new text to the Community Compact.
“The College has been in communication with OHCDB about adding additional language to the community compact to encourage students to seek help under COVID rules, and the new language reflects that,” Dane wrote.
Our Harvard Can Do Better member Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 said while the revision marks “a win for student organizing,” the group still has “concerns with the language.”
“They’re allowing leeway to decide when are the exceptions to the ‘ordinarily,’ when are the exceptions to ‘the practice’ of the Title IX Coordinators,” she said. “That concerns us because we don’t want any exceptions to those.”
Still, Mahajan said the amendment to the compact is a “shift in the right direction.”
“Our advocacy, and from my perspective personally as well, is always going to be a balance between pushing for institutional change within Harvard and also tapping into the communities and students that we already have,” she said.

Harvard Business School will transition to remote instruction and restrict on-campus activities in response to increasing COVID-19 positivity rates among its affiliates.
Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi and outgoing Business School Dean Nitin Nohria announced the change in a message to Business School affiliates Saturday. The Business School is the only one of the University’s 12 degree-granting schools that offered in-person instruction this semester.
Crispi and Nohria wrote they based the decision to go remote on a number of indicators. Last Monday, five Business School affiliates had tested positive; by Saturday, 24 had. During the same five-day span, the number of Business School affiliates in quarantine rose from 14 to 114.
Crispi and Nohria also wrote that individuals in quarantine had begun to test positive for the coronavirus, which “simply wasn’t happening” at the beginning of the semester. MBA students represent approximately 70 percent of the total Business School-linked cases, per the email.
“We realize the transition represents a perhaps counterintuitive move, because we have stressed from the beginning — and continue to feel confident — that our classrooms, dining halls, and other on-campus spaces are not the locus of infection in our community,” Crispi and Nohria wrote. “Indeed, as of today, we have no evidence of infection occurring as a result of contact or interaction in these locations."
Crispi and Nohria also cited rising virus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations in Massachusetts more broadly.
The two deans urged students to form self-contained social pods for the remainder of the semester, encouraging them to find ways to engage with students outside of their pods online. The deans also wrote they would encourage all MBA students to get tested for the virus three times next week.
“We know this makes isolation and quarantine seem especially difficult: you feel fine. But these steps remain vital to limiting the spread of COVID on our campus. You can be fully asymptomatic and have a high viral load, meaning you are infectious to others,” they wrote.
“The majority” of students have complied with social distancing practices throughout the pandemic, per the email.
“We have discovered, though, that even small numbers of people disregarding safety measures can have a disproportionate effect on transmission rates. We now need to see what we can do to remedy this reality,” Crispi and Nohria wrote.
The Business School currently intends to operate in person at the start of the Spring semester, conditions-permitting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a resolution in its meeting Monday supporting Harvard janitors and custodians currently seeking a contract extension.
Through the policy order, the City urged the University to extend contracts for all 700 janitors to ensure they have secure employment throughout the duration of the spring semester. The policy also proposes that Harvard provide “economic improvement” for those workers during 2021 as recognition for their services as “essential workers” during the global pandemic.
The policy order comes in light of two rallies organized by 32BJ — a branch of the Service Employees International Union, which represents hundreds of campus custodians — that took place last Thursday and Friday, just days before the union’s contract was set to expire.
Members of the union picketed in Harvard Yard to demand the University guarantee their employment for the spring semester. On Thursday, Harvard announced a new emergency excused absence policy, through which workers directly employed by the University can receive 70 percent of their regular pay if the University does not require their labor.
As a result, the roughly 300 custodians on campus who contract with Harvard but are employed by different agencies will not be able to reap the benefits of the policy.
The union has also expressed concerns with the University for not providing sufficient PPE and for its sparse communication with workers regarding how to deal with cases of COVID-19.
At Monday’s City Council meeting, Angelica Silva, a University library custodian of 12 years, voiced her discontent with the University’s recently announced paid leave policy during the public comment portion of the meeting.
“As essential workers, throughout the pandemic we have helped Harvard stop the spread of COVID on campus,” she said. “I, myself, have done many things to help [keep] Harvard safe, often going above and beyond my job description.”
Silva said she believes custodians like herself provide essential services to the University, and that their role has been especially important over the past eight months as COVID-19 shut down much of Harvard’s operations. Silva said she stopped a fire from spreading in a University library in September.
“In addition to keeping the library clean and sanitary, this September, I noticed a fire starting in the library, and I contained it,” she said. “When the firemen came, they couldn’t believe that I had managed to stop it from spreading. The librarians were very thankful.”
“Now, Harvard is leaving us behind, when we need this job most,” she said. “We and our families depend on our salaries and our health care, especially during a global pandemic and economic crisis.”
City Councilor Marc C. McGovern contextualized the latest point of tension between 32BJ and the University with past conflicts between Harvard and its unions, including those that serve dining hall workers and graduate students.
“These groups are not asking for the world. They’re asking for some basic rights and living wages and basic protections, and yet I feel like they get nickeled and dimed all the time,” McGovern said. “I really hope Harvard hears this. I hope we don’t have to be back in this situation again over what is really a pretty straightforward and reasonable request, as they typically are.”
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui also criticized the University for its treatment of staff.
“This is just disgraceful to keep seeing this happen, and I hope Harvard moves to change this,” she said.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement the University empathizes with workers’ situations and that it hopes to soon reach an agreement with the Service Employees International Union.
“We recognize the unfortunate impact of the pandemic and that many workers have been unable to work through no fault of their own,” Newton wrote. “Since March of this year, the University has taken the extraordinary step of extending full pay and benefits to both its own as well as contract workers who had no work to perform due to the pandemic and the remote work and learning status of much of the University. This benefit was recently extended until January 15 of next year.”
During Monday’s meeting, the City Council also discussed funding a survey for Cambridge residents to report their experiences with affordable housing, the renaming of the Agassiz neighborhood, and measures implemented around the City to address climate change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 50 freshmen gathered on the Widener steps Saturday to call on the University to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry.
The rally was organized by freshmen members of the student group Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard to re-emphasize the group’s commitment to the movement, even during the pandemic.
Across the steps, socially-distanced students held banners and signs with individual messages in support of divestment. After reading a statement to be delivered to administrators, organizers asked the protestors to write down their own personal reasons for supporting divestment on the back of paper signs, which are now hung up around campus.
Kari A. Traylor ’24, a member of Divest Harvard who helped organize the rally, said she hopes the rally showed the administration her class cares about divestment, even amid a pandemic.
“The role of the rally was just to say… that even if the first-years haven’t been involved in FFDH past semesters and even though we just are getting started, our class will be holding them accountable,” Traylor said. “And in the midst of this pandemic, divesting is still one of the top priorities for our class.”
Two students also delivered speeches about the climate change crisis and the need to divest.
“In times of crisis, we cannot be neutral,” Jett H. Zhang ’24 said. “Divesting from fossil fuels isn’t just about stopping funding, it’s about sending a message. A message that Harvard cares. A message that Harvard wants to be on the right side of history.”
In her speech, Klara A. Kuemmerle ’24 emphasized that students cannot become complacent about Harvard’s actions.
“It's just like this gut-wrenching feeling that the University is investing against my future, when they invest in so much for my future — like all of my classes are incredible and I feel so fulfilled,” Kuemmerle said in an interview after the event. “It’s this paradox of this University is giving me so much to live for, but at the same time, using the fossil fuel industry to kind of like bet against my future.”
“That is not something that I want to look up to when I think of my University,” she added.
During the rally, students sat in silence for seven minutes to represent the seven years until our current rate of emissions will inevitably result in global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to New York City’s newly activated Climate Clock and calculations made by the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin.
“The clock counting down represents our shrinking time interval to avert the worst effects of the climate emergency,” Traylor said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton referenced past comments from administrators opposing divestment and emphasized Harvard’s climate change initiatives.
“While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it,” Newton wrote in an emailed statement. “Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions.”
In addition to showcasing Divest Harvard’s commitment to their cause, Kuemmerle said she felt that another goal of the rally was to highlight the group to freshmen on campus during an online semester.
“Because of the hindrances of Zoom, it's been really hard to kind of show who we are to the freshmen and just get awareness about our organization in the first place,” Kuemmerle said. “I know so many people who walked past the rally were like, ‘Oh I didn't even know that you guys existed,’ and so to be something that people can remember and actually visualize as an organization I think is really important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 praised the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for its recent decision to reduce or pause graduate student admissions in an interview with The Crimson on Monday.
Though GSAS will have fewer new students, the School will be “supporting a larger number of continuing students than it would have otherwise,” Garber said.
The change is “not just so that they can complete their dissertations,” he said. The shift takes into account the fact that current students will be faced with “a very tough academic job market” after they graduate.
“We are trying to position our existing students as well as possible for the next stage in their career,” Garber said. “Of necessity, that means that there is less funding available for new students.”
Garber also noted it is not a “complete freeze,” and there will still be some new admits — though he cautioned they “may not be evenly distributed” across departments or divisions.
“From my perspective, this is a very sensible way to ensure that our existing students have the best possible experience that they can and that they will be positioned well for success, while allowing for some new admissions in a very trying time, with the expectation that we will have additional changes in admissions in the future,” he said.
In the letter announcing the change late last month, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, GSAS Dean Emma Dench, and other administrators argued that admitting fewer new students will allow GSAS to “reset” its approach towards admissions and rework admissions targets to account for diversity, advising strength, and student career outcomes.
Garber echoed their point Monday, noting that temporarily reducing admissions offers GSAS the ability to address “more general issues about graduate admissions.”
“From the point of view of the University, we see Ph.D. students as producing the University Professors of the future, so of course we have a great interest in this, and we think that the leadership of GSAS and FAS has been highly thoughtful and very strategic in thinking about these issues,” he said.
In the interview, Garber also discussed the University’s implementation of their first contract with the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers.
Though labor relations are not under the purview of the provost, Garber has a leading role in the University’s relationship with HGSU-UAW due to its overlap with academic life at Harvard.
The contract — which it ratified on July 1 — will be in effect for just a year. But rather than speculating about future contracts, Garber said the University is “completely focused on implementing the existing contract.”
“I have to say that it's complicated to implement the contracts,” he said. “I think that everybody is acting in good faith but this is something that's completely new, that actually in many instances requires us to collect new kinds of data and implement new payroll processes.”
He said one such logistical issue is simply identifying which students are members of HGSU-UAW.
“I don't think these are showstopper kinds of problems,” Garber said. “It just takes time to work through them.”
HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla and Vice President Marisa J. Borreggine said in a written statement they have “provided ample support and information to the administration to make for a smooth contract implementation.”
“We know firsthand that the implementation and enforcement of a new contract is complicated, but we expect the university to do a better job holding up their side of our agreement,” they wrote.
Specifically, Mancilla and Borreggine alleged the University has “not always respected deadlines to ensure proper implementation of key provisions in the contract,” such as dues deduction, and said they are headed toward arbitration on two separate issues.
“Harvard has experience implementing collective bargaining agreements with other campus unions,” they added. “They should not be working differently with us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students living on campus prepare to disperse for the remainder of the fall semester, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Friday interview that Harvard is diligently preparing for the spring.
As undergraduates anticipate the College’s decision on which — if any — students it will invite to return to campus, Harvard began to provide initial details on the uncertain spring semester with its release of the academic calendar last month.
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced in October that it would not hold spring break in 2021. Instead, it will reallocate the five days of break as “wellness days” throughout the spring semester. On these days, scheduled approximately every other week, FAS courses will not meet.
Khurana said this plan yields two benefits: minimizing travel for students — which would reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission — and providing regular downtime.
When asked how Harvard will ensure that faculty honor the intent of wellness days by refraining from assigning class work, Khurana said he is confident that faculty will prioritize “students’ academic, social, and personal well-being.”
“We are going to be working with our community, our faculty, and others to think about how we can really ensure that those wellness days really provide a respite for our community,” he said.
He referred further questions about how the administration will help faculty work around wellness days to the Office of Undergraduate Education.
In an October interview, Khurana said Harvard would prioritize inviting the senior class to live in residence.
Khurana said the FAS Pandemic Planning and Response Group is considering different spring scenarios based on public health conditions and soliciting feedback about fall academic and residential experiences.
“My understanding is that the decisions around the spring with respect to who we can potentially bring back will be made in early December,” he said.
As administrators plan for the upcoming semester, students currently living on campus are preparing to move out before Thanksgiving break and complete their last full week of courses, in addition to final exams, at home.
Khurana said those on campus who have “no easy place to go” during winter break were able to petition to remain in Harvard housing. He noted the application and coordination process resembled that of previous years.
Last year, some of the 150 College students who spent winter break on campus said they were frustrated over limited dining and health services. Others said their winter in Harvard dorms was lonely, isolating, and “miserable” — an experience that social distancing and public health restrictions may even exacerbate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As an unprecedented and contentious election season draws to a close, Harvard faculty, staff, and students overwhelmingly contributed to Democratic candidates — including President-elect Joseph R. Biden, Jr. — over their Republican counterparts this election cycle, a Crimson analysis found.
Using publicly available Federal Election Commission filings, The Crimson analyzed 139,885 records of federal political contributions from Harvard affiliates between January 2017 and October 2020. In this nearly four-year span, Harvard staff and students contributed $6,729,018 to political candidates, committees, and parties — largely Democratic.
The current FEC data continues to reinforce the popular belief that Harvard’s staff and student base is mostly liberal. A 2015 Crimson analysis found Harvard faculty contributed overwhelmingly to federal Democratic campaigns and political organizations.
For this story, The Crimson analyzed the federal political spending of 8,134 contributors who reported “Harvard University” as their employer. Of these affiliates, 741 were faculty listed on University directories and websites as professors, preceptors, lecturers, and other instructors. Another 1,194 were students, while 5,999 were self-reported staff in non-teaching roles.
In the presidential election, the vast majority of Harvard donors chose to contribute to Biden over his Republican counterpart, President Donald J. Trump.
Among teaching staff, 270 faculty members contributed a total of $317,835 to Biden, while just five faculty members contributed a total of $3,030 to Trump.
A 2018 Crimson survey found 88 percent of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences believed Trump’s job performance was “very poor.” Similarly, the survey revealed that only 2 percent of FAS faculty members reported voting for Trump in the 2016 election.
Likewise, students’ contributions strongly favored Biden in the general election. Harvard students contributed $24,136 to Biden, while Trump garnered only $246 from them. Just four students, across all the University’s schools, contributed to the incumbent president.
The political contributions reflect a student body that largely leans left of the national electorate. The Crimson’s September survey of the Class of 2024 revealed that 90.1 percent of surveyed first-year students planned to vote for Biden in the presidential election.
Non-teaching staff had the greatest proportion of contributions to Trump, earmarking just over 3 percent of $410,361 in presidential contributions for the incumbent president.
While some surveyed faculty and students alike have indicated support for third-party candidates Jo Jorgensen and Howie G. Hawkins, the Libertarian and Green Party nominees for president did not receive any contributions from Harvard affiliates. In The Crimson’s freshman survey, just 2.3 and 0.5 percent of first-years indicated support for Jorgensen and Hawkins, respectively.
Harvard donors also contribute far higher dollar amounts to Democratic candidates and committees over their Republican counterparts.
Out of the $6,729,018 reported contributions from Harvard affiliates this election cycle, $5,330,055 in contributions went to partisan candidates and organizations.
Faculty members had the highest average contribution to Democrats: On average, Democratic-supporting faculty contributed $4,112 to Democrats, spending a total of $2,157,753 to support that party.
Faculty also were more likely to contribute to other Republican candidates than to Trump specifically. While only 0.95 percent of faculty presidential contributions went to Trump, 4.17 percent of all faculty partisan contributions went to Republican candidates, a rate similar to the one reported in The Crimson’s 2015 survey.
Independent and third-party candidates — including those from the Democratic-Farmer-Labor and Libertarian parties — received $35,997 from Harvard faculty.
Students, meanwhile, contributed the largest percentage of their total political spending to Democrats. Out of $170,819 in campaign contributions, 97.6 percent — or $166,772 — ended up in the hands of Democratic candidates and committees. Notably, Republican candidates only received $1,080 from Harvard students, while independent candidates received $2,966.
According to the Crimson’s Class of 2024 profile, while 57 percent of Harvard’s freshmen class identified as Democrats, only 5 percent identify as Republicans. A further 13 percent of the first-year student body identified as independent.
While Harvard faculty, students, and staff all preferred contributing to Democrats, each of the groups differed in their preferences in the Democratic primary. Contribution data from before April 8, 2020 — the date that Biden became the presumptive nominee — reveals that while Harvard affiliates as a whole preferred Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth A. Warren, faculty uniquely preferred Biden over progressive challengers.
Within the faculty, Warren led the pack in fundraising during the Democratic primary, garnering $102,137 in faculty contributions to Biden’s $46,651 and Sanders’ $18,404. But Biden was an unpopular choice among students and staff by contrast: Only 10.9 percent and 2.56 percent of staff and student contributions, respectively, went to Biden during the primary.
Among student contributors, Sanders and Warren were the clearly preferred candidates. Sanders was the most popular candidate, receiving $38,936 and accounting for 59 percent of all student contributions. Fellow progressive Warren was the second most popular, raking in $22,507 — and 34 percent — of student contributions. And Andrew M. Yang — who drew large crowds at a rally last year in Cambridge — narrowly beat out Biden in student funds, receiving $1,866 to the former vice president’s $1,677.
Similarly, staff contributions revealed a preference for Warren and Sanders over Biden. While Warren and Sanders drew $199,661 and $169,430, respectively, staff opted to contribute just $51,477 to Biden.
Despite these differences in primary preferences, Harvard affiliates quickly unified behind Biden after the Democratic primary, contributing $48,039 in the month of April alone.
Of the $6.7 million Harvard affiliates contributed in this election cycle, nearly 88 percent was spent on non-presidential races. In total, Harvard affiliates contributed to 676 candidates and committees; aggregate donations ranged from $672,039 to Biden for President to $4 total to Hoyos For Congress.
Many of the top recipients other than presidential candidates included Democratic and Republican party organizations. Harvard affiliates contributed $127,466 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, $124,868 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and $145,642 to the Democratic National Committee. They sent $43,957 to the Republican National Committee.
Individual candidates who garnered significant funds from Harvard affiliates include North Carolina congressional candidate Daniel “Dan” K. McReady, who received $57,334; Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who received $52,784; Democratic Massachusetts Congressional Candidate Dan A. Koh ’07, who received $44,450; and Democratic Kansas State Representative Susan Ruiz, who received $40,000.
Harvard affiliates contributed to races spanning 47 states and the District of Columbia. From incumbent Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) in Alaska to Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) in Illinois, and Timothy “Tim” W. Bjorkman in South Dakota to Sara I. Gideon in Maine, Harvard affiliates contributed to races in states large and small. The Crimson aggregated the sum of contributions to committees based in each state to obtain state contribution totals, excluding intermediary committees like ActBlue and WinRed which process contributions.
The District of Columbia received the most contributions from faculty and staff. But Vermont — where Bernie Sanders’s campaign headquarters was located — topped the list of regional contributions by students, taking in $17,512.
After D.C. and Massachusetts — which saw $1,152,916 and $809,494 in contributions, respectively — Harvard affiliates contributed the most to Pennsylvania, sending $712,238 to the Keystone State. Pennsylvania ultimately played a crucial role in this year’s presidential election, delivering 20 electoral votes to drive Biden to victory.
Following Pennsylvania were states with smaller sums: California, with $217,088, Colorado, with $151,940, and New York, with $141,501.
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, its flagship faculty, manages instruction at the College and in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. FAS contributed the second most of all University faculties, at $934,608.
Much like in the 2015 Crimson study, the faculty of FAS skewed far leftward in their donations: Of all partisan FAS contributions, $744,143, or 98.82 percent, went to Democrats. The 324 FAS faculty and instructors included in the dataset contributed $3,010 to Republican campaigns and candidates, less than the $5,600 FAS faculty contributed to independent candidates.
Within FAS, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences — aggregated separate from FAS at large in The Crimson’s study — beat out its liberal arts counterpart. SEAS faculty made mean contributions of $1,885, compared to just $950 from non-SEAS FAS faculty. Notably, all $183,399 in partisan contributions from 42 SEAS faculty went to Democratic candidates.
Though the Kennedy School had fewer contributors, they were more generous on average than their FAS colleagues. The 57 contributors listed as HKS faculty gave $329,109 to political committees, representing 9 percent of the University total and making the Kennedy School the fourth largest contributor. The average of HKS contributions — of which all partisan contributions went to Democrats — was $2,512.29.
The Business School faculty contributed both the most per faculty member as well as in total, with mean contributions of $3,666, and a total of $990,668 in contributions.
The Business School also boasted the largest share of contributions to Republicans. While faculty contributed $571,870 to Democrats, they also contributed $55,500, or 8.85 percent, to the GOP. This marks a sharp decrease, however, from the Crimson’s 2015 study, which reported that roughly 37 percent of contributions from Business School faculty went to Republicans.
The Business School was an outlier among its professional school peers. The Law School contributed the second-most per faculty member, with a mean contribution of $3,538 for a total of $436,196. Nearly all partisan contributions — 99.46 percent — went to Democrats, with only $2,000 contributed to Republicans.
Of all Harvard schools, contributing the least per instructor was the Graduate School of Design, whose faculty contributed just $56 on average.
The Crimson compiled the data for this analysis from publicly available Federal Election Commission records of contribution to federal election candidates and political action committees. Federal law requires the disclosure of political contributions exceeding $200 to a single candidate in an election cycle. The data does not include contributions made to independent expenditure campaigns, super PACs, or nonprofit groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code which engage in electioneering communications.
All contributions were collected from contributors who listed Harvard as an employer from the first quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2020. Federal election laws require donors to truthfully disclose their occupation and employer.
The Crimson then refined the dataset to separate Harvard affiliates into three segments: faculty, staff, and students. Specifically, faculty members were confirmed on a list of active professors, lecturers, preceptors, and other teaching staff drawn from University directories and websites. The contributions of faculty who teach at multiple Harvard schools were counted towards each school they taught at; sums and means per school thus account for both of their positions.
Students include all donors who listed their occupation as any variant of “student.” Staff include all affiliates who do not match the list of active faculty members, do not have “student” as their listed occupation, and do not have any variation of “professor” as their stated occupation. As such, contributions from retired, emeriti, or deceased professors are notably not included in either the faculty or staff groups, but do appear in the Harvard affiliate total.
ActBlue and WinRed are respectively Democratic and Republican fundraising sites. They rarely disburse contributions themselves, but rather act as a platform to process contributions for candidates. For Presidential candidates, all ActBlue and WinRed contributions earmarked for a specific candidate were included in contribution totals. Although ActBlue and WinRed are not registered as partisan committees with the Federal Election Commission, contributions to them were included in our party totals due to the partisan nature of these sites. Finally, ActBlue and WinRed were not included in the geographic distribution of committees due to their intermediary nature.

Why in the world does Harvard have seven concentrations related to biology? Does anyone outside of Harvard care if you studied Chemical and Physical Biology or Molecular and Cellular Biology? What does Integrative Biology even mean? Did you randomly take LS1A your freshman year and now you have no clue what to study? With the concentration declaration deadline upon us, we’ve created a procrastinator's guide to understanding obscure biology concentration abbreviations before November 19.
MCB: Molecular and Cellular Biology
What it’s about: We start with the smallest units of life: cells. If you really enjoy classes full of premeds, you’re bound to love this concentration. Most sophomore concentrators take MCB 60 to get a taste of the MCB concentrator’s life.
Who do I talk to?: Fill out the CPB-MCB plan of study and talk with Dominic Mao, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies for CPB/MCB.
Fun Fact: Other abbreviations that would work well for MCB include: My Cell Bae, Mitochondria is a Cool Box, and Many Cool Biologists.
CPB: Chemical and Physical Biology
What it’s about: This is great if you care about more than molecules, but not a whole lot more. Also, you have to be hardcore to want to study chemistry, physics, and biology all at once. Everything you do is eerily similar to MCB, and you have some of the coolest open houses and study breaks with every imaginable food under the sun.
Who do I talk to?: Same as MCB! Complete CPB-MCB plan of study and meet with Dominic.
Fun Fact: They have a ~biochemically-inspired~ right-handed helical staircase at their offices in Sherman-Fairchild.
Neuroscience
What it’s about: This one’s for the nerds who like the body’s most complex organ: the brain. You have to have a big brain to think about thousands of neurons that make up big brains. Plus, it’s one of two concentrations that doesn’t mandate independent research, if you don’t want to be stuck in a lab through college.
Who do I talk to?: Ryan Draft, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies for Neuroscience
Fun Fact: Lots of bonus points in the Flyby book because this is the only concentration without an obscure abbreviation.
HDRB: Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology 
What it’s about: If you actually like fully developed people and not just cells and brains, this might be the concentration for you. This is a great choice if you’re committed to doing some form of research in an up-and-coming area and like lots of photoshopped pubs.
Who do I talk to?: Have a four-year plan of study and meet with Amie Holmes, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies for HDRB.
Fun Fact: Some of the coolest upper-level courses you can take include “The Scientific Search for the Fountain of Youth” and “Glucose: From Molecule to Society.”
HEB: Human Evolutionary Biology
What it’s about: You like humans, but you also like how they’ve changed over hundreds of years and how they form little groups and give themselves creative names like Flyby, Editorial, and News. If you’re interested in arguing with anti-evolutionists, this might also be the move.
Who do I talk to?: Carole Hooven or Neil Roach, Co-Directors of Undergraduate Studies
Fun Fact: You’ll be surrounded by some of the wackiest people on campus — Professor Joe Henrich from the department even wrote a book called “The WEIRDest People in the World”!
IB: Integrative Biology (formerly OEB)
What it’s about: Does everything above sound like one amazing puzzle you want to fit together? Do you have trouble making decisions and tend to sample a bit of everything? IB will help you integrate your interest in cells, organs, people, animals, and evolution in the past and present.
Who do I talk to?: Andrew Berry, Undergraduate Advisor
Fun Fact: Party concentration? Through its connection with the Harvard Museum of Natural History, IB gets to throw the coolest parties — after hours, in the dinosaur hall.
BME: Biomedical Engineering
What it’s about: This one is for all the math people masquerading as biologists. If you enjoy creating, visualizing, and spatial thinking and want to take advantage of SEAS resources, this might be the best choice for you.
Who do I talk to?: You’ll need an eight-semester plan of study to meet with either Linsey Moyer, the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies or Professor Demba Ba, the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Fun Fact: You can take a HUGE variety of courses, ranging from tissue engineering to studying food fermentation.
I’m honestly not certain I’ve covered them all, but seven’s a lucky number at least? Perhaps your calling will be some of the other biology-adjacent concentrations, like Cognitive Neuroscience or Evolutionary Psychology or Chemistry. Still unsure? Considering the incredible degree of overlap across these concentrations, you can comfortably take some common requirements and postpone making a commitment, too! All in all, whether you’re an aspiring physician, researcher, or just someone who loves life, you’re bound to satisfy your cravings with Harvard’s buffet of life science concentrations.
