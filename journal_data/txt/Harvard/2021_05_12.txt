After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu ’07, a leading candidate in this fall’s Boston mayoral election, discussed her campaign platform and Harvard influences in a virtual press conference held Monday evening.
During the press conference — her third exclusive to Boston-area student journalists — Wu focused on how her time at Harvard impacted her candidacy, as well as the work of youth organizers in bolstering her campaign.
Wu described her education at Harvard Law School as “foundational” to her career in public service, specifically citing the influence of her first law professor, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
“I walked into my first day of law school at Harvard, meeting Elizabeth Warren as my contract law professor,” Wu said. “I worked on her campaign, her first campaign for the Senate, which took place during my three years of law school, and would not otherwise have gotten any exposure [to politics].”
Warren endorsed Wu on Jan. 15, saying in a statement to The Crimson at the time that she had seen Wu’s compassion and work ethic “first hand,” both in the classroom and on her Senate campaign. Warren added these qualities would allow Wu to “make a difference in people’s lives” as mayor through “bold, progressive leadership.”
“There’s no way that I would be in this role if I hadn’t had so many doors open through the incredible education that I’ve been able to experience,” Wu said.
In response to a question about Boston’s Payment in Lieu of Taxes program, which requests optional payments from tax-exempt nonprofits such as Harvard to supplement lost tax revenue, Wu argued current agreements “definitely need a refresh,” adding to a growing chorus calling for PILOT reform.
“We need to get back to reexamining this system, particularly from an equity point of view,” Wu said. “We need to get to a point where Boston is aligning all of our sectors and all of our resources towards a more proactive and bolder vision, rather than just saying, ‘How do we squeeze and get closer to accountability?’”
As an example of this type of cooperation, Wu referenced a 2018 City Council ordinance she wrote on food procurement, requiring Boston’s municipal government prioritize local, healthy, sustainable vendors with humane and fair labor practices when seeking food services contracts. This most prominently included hot meals for Boston Public Schools, she added.
“We have $18 million of purchasing power across the city,” Wu said. “But imagine if all of our local universities were on board with bundling that together, all of our local hospitals, right — that’s $100 million in purchasing power annually.”
When asked about the role of youth activists in her campaign, Wu said she was “just following the lead” of “incredible” young organizers.
“Young people are leading the way right now — not in the future but right now — when it comes to the issues that are urgent in our communities around racial justice and public safety and healing and climate justice, housing justice,” Wu said.
Wu said she would center youth organizing in her mayoral administration, referencing her first public campaign event, a conversation with youth organizers in Dorchester. Wu has also been endorsed by several progressive advocacy groups, including the youth-led Sunrise Movement Boston.
She added she was “honored and humbled” by the work of the Youth for Wu group, a network of activists emulating the highly effective “Students for Markey” coalition which propelled U.S. Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) to re-election last year.
“Young people have the greatest stake in these policies,” Wu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mercedes C. Becerra ’91 and Salmaan Keshavjee will serve as the new faculty deans of Adams House, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana announced in a Tuesday email to Adams House affiliates.
Becerra is a professor of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School, while Keshavjee serves as an Anthropology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as well as a Global Health and Social Medicine professor at the Medical School. They will begin their roles on July 1.
Khurana wrote that he was “thrilled to welcome” the new pair of deans and also thanked Adams House affiliates for their support during the search.
“Over the course of the last several months, I had the pleasure of spending some time with Mercedes and Salmaan. I was struck by their warm and thoughtful nature, their kindness, and their commitment to building a sense of inclusion and belonging in everything they do,” he wrote. “This fall, as we bring our full community together again, these attributes will be more important than ever.”
“Members of the Adams community dedicated their time and energy and gave meaningful input that was invaluable in helping us make this decision,” Khurana added.
The current deans, Judith S. Palfrey ’67 and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, announced in December 2020 they would retire at the end of the academic year after two decades in their roles.
The Palfreys told The Crimson at the time that their retirement had been planned the year prior, but they ultimately chose to postpone their plans to step down to support students through the coronavirus crisis. They are currently the longest-serving pair of faculty deans.
Judith Palfrey said in an interview Tuesday that her time serving as a faculty dean had been a “blessing.”
“We have just been ultimately blessed by the students, by the tutors, by every aspect of the program, and all of the incredible opportunities that we’ve had to get to know people in the House and to create a community with pretty important values, and to have the opportunity to work with our senior common room, with the staff, with everybody, towards those common values,” she said.
The Palfreys said they were excited about the appointment of Becerra and Keshavjee.
“They are just fantastic people. Both of them are teachers, and they are both involved in global health — they are going to bring so much,” Judith Palfrey said.
As their tenure comes to a close, the Palfreys said they were looking forward to their retirement.
“We will move from [Adams House] physically to the Cape,” Sean Palfrey said. “We will probably continue to teach an Extension School class similar to the one we’ve taught as a freshman seminar for 20 some odd years. We will do things that we haven’t had a chance to do for the past 45 years or so.”
“There are a lot of exciting things happening with our own family, and we’ll be doing a lot with them,” Judith Palfrey added.
