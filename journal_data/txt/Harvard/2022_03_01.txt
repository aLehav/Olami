It’s no secret that Dua Lipa’s music is irresistibly catchy. Songs from her critically acclaimed second album “Future Nostalgia” such as “Levitating,” “Don’t Start Now,” and “Break My Heart” are culturally ubiquitous, almost to the point of oversaturation. However, Lipa’s Feb. 18 concert at TD Garden was a far cry from tired, with the artist delivering a dynamic, technicolor spectacle of artistry and escapist joy. Everything from the vibrant costumes to the innovative set design and stacked setlist created an atmosphere that was equal parts classic and futuristic, paying perfect tribute to her namesake album.
Following a stylized video introduction of Lipa and her dancers made to look like the opening credits to a retro television show, the Grammy-winning singer began the show with “Physical,” one of her biggest hits in recent years. Her neon yellow bodysuit and dance moves, inspired by ’80s exercise videos, made it clear that this show would be a high energy romp.

Giant disco balls, underwater scenes, and cartoon space sequences illuminated the stage throughout. Lipa’s vibrant surroundings did not stop there, as a massive cubic structure made up of hundreds of light-up spheres descended upon the stage later in the show. While secondary to Lipa’s pop vocals, this detail made all the difference in ensuring that concertgoers remained engaged and energetic throughout the performance.
As for Lipa’s vocal talent, the impressive breadth of her musical expertise was on full display. Her trademark playfulness and upbeat tone were most effectively conveyed when singing “Good in Bed,” which she briefly interrupted to point out a fan and adlib a few sarcastic laughs. Moments later, Lipa completely shifted gears, belting out the lyrics to her slower ballad “Boys Will Be Boys” with just as much ease as any of her pop anthems.
The show was not exclusively limited to songs off of “Future Nostalgia,” as Lipa performed some of her earliest hits including “New Rules,” “One Kiss,” and “Electricity.” There was even a surprise guest appearance from a pre-recorded Elton John, who sang along with her to their recent collaboration “Cold Heart,” one of the show's more tender moments.
Throughout the entire show, the energy in TD Garden was palpable. After exploding with screams and applause upon her entrance, fans’ energy only grew. Even when Lipa was absent to change costumes between acts, this energy was maintained by roller skating dancers, club remixes of Lipa’s most popular songs, and an especially well-received interlude of Gwen Stefani’s “Hollaback Girl.”
All this good energy reached its peak during the concert’s encore, which Lipa began with an edgier version of the song “Future Nostalgia,” swinging around her mic stand while powerfully singing about being a “female alpha.” The night then concluded with a showstopping performance of “Don’t Start Now,” which saw Dua Lipa strutting along the stage as multi-color confetti cannons erupted in every direction, creating a fantasy-like atmosphere in the venue. This final track, arguably Lipa’s best, sounded absolutely phenomenal and celebrated the carefree, disco aesthetic of the “Future Nostalgia” era in a way that would excite even the most lukewarm fans.

Nicki Minaj is back, and she did not come to play. On Feb. 11, one week after the release of her single “Do We Have A Problem?” Minaj dropped “Bussin’” with Lil Baby. In anticipation of her upcoming album, Nicki Minaj has set the tone for rap in 2022 and made it clear that she is not going anywhere.
“Bussin’” boasts a driving beat, characterized by a booming bass that compels one to get up and run to the dance floor. It sets the tone for fast-paced verses that force the listener to catch up or get swallowed by the music.
In contrast with the vulgarity and basic flows common in mainstream rap, Minaj approaches this song with a chill vibe, borrowing her flow from “Fefe” with 6ix9ine and showing it takes minimal effort to get the world buzzing about her. Despite starting off tame, she hits with power and repeats her catchy refrain of “B-B-Bussin,’” asserting her dominance and having fun with it. She even starts singing in the last verse, showcasing her mastery of flow and ability to ride a beat. As always, Nicki Minaj is doing things most other artists in the industry don’t do or are unable to do and proves why she is the best. Her bars are exquisite and her flow is impeccable. Minaj starts trends; she does not follow them. It is only a matter of time before others start to copy Minaj’s energy from this new era.
Lyrically, “Bussin’” isn’t one of Nicki’s best works. Yet she is a pro at exuding boss energy and making listeners feel confident. Lines like “Told his ex she ain’t gettin’ that dick back,” make listeners feel her untouchable confidence. This is something Minaj excels at. Despite her lengthy hiatus, she picked up right where she left off. Lil Baby on the other hand did not deliver at the same level with his feature on the song. His verse is mediocre and the lines — such as “I’ma lil’ busy, go shop until I finish / Every bit of seven hundred, this is not a rental” — are exhausted. They illustrate his wealth, which is not uncommon for rap but brings nothing else to the table. His bars provide no sustenance nor do they have any twists to keep the listener guessing.
“Bussin’” provides a great energy essential to Minaj’s return, but the collaboration overall was average and nothing groundbreaking. The two artists have great chemistry, but it is clear only one of them delivered excellence on this song.

Judy Collins’ song covers are nothing short of alchemy. The legendary folk singer’s golden voice, which has charmed audiences since her 1961 studio debut, can transform even the most familiar melodies into innovative yet timeless experiences. On Feb. 25, Collins released “Spellbound,” her first album of all original material that, also as if by magic, evokes collective nostalgia for her own beloved recollections.
The title track opens the album with a piano ostinato that shimmers like the “bright blue water’s shore” Collins remembers from a stay in Honolulu. Even after she leaves the “light of sand and water” behind to “crawl the highways,” her repetition of “spellbound” at the end of every third verse highlights her enduring amazement at life. The shift from past to present tense in the last lines says just as much: “Surfacing in air and light / Now I live, and I am spellbound.”
On lead single “When I Was a Girl in Colorado,” Collins revisits her Denver childhood, where “rivers danced on canyon walls.” The first two verses’ idyllic natural imagery references winter, spring, and summer by name. Perhaps in an attempt to stave off the fading of memories like fall leaves, the only mention of the last remaining season later arrives as a wishful question: “Will you take me to the mountains / Before another summer ends?” As the song progresses, fewer verses separate each chorus, and Collins brings listeners ever closer to her vision of home.
In 2016, Collins wrote one poem every day. Two of the resulting 366 found their way onto “Spellbound” as lyrics to the maritime love stories “Shipwrecked Mariner” and “Wild with Mist.” In both songs, Collins harnesses the sea’s expanse to convey her distance from her subjects. “You had promised me another world,” she sings on “Shipwrecked Mariner” about a former lover who abandoned ship at the first sign of foul weather. The realization of this promise finally takes place on “Wild With Mist,” when viewing William Turner’s turbulent oil seascapes sends Collins “into another, and then another world.”
Although Collins spends much of “Arizona” reminiscing about her past, the track reaches a more forward-looking conclusion. “You must fly from the winter to May / You must fly from the past into today,” she sings in the album’s last lines. By transferring her memory into song, she is also releasing herself from its hold.
Each song on “Spellbound” shines with reflective sincerity, but the album’s lack of structural variety somewhat clouds its overall impact. As Collins’ lyrics take listeners from Hawaii to Colorado, New York, and Arizona, the frequent ballad tempos, repetitive melodies, and ABCB tetrameter make these destinations start to blur together.
Still, that doesn’t mean they’re not worth visiting. Collins’ matchless soprano retains enough strength and clarity to enchant anything she sings, which she attributes to steadfast study of the bel canto style — but even more than her flawless technique, her powerful reverence for music and life will put you under her latest album’s spell.

Most have heard the famous opening of Mussorgsky/Ravel’s “Pictures at an Exhibition,” with its regal brass chorale used in films, TV, video games, and even as WWE entrance music. This year, we mark the 100th anniversary of Maurice Ravel’s celebrated 1922 orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky’s “Pictures” for solo piano. For a century now, audiences have sprinted to concert halls to hear the musical depiction of an art museum experience, as the piece walks from painting to painting and culminates in the famous “Great Gate of Kiev.” This week especially, the piece has received attention on social media for its mention of Kiev amidst Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Not just music about an art museum, “Pictures at an Exhibition” is music about friendship. It mourns and celebrates a friend of Mussorgsky’s, tells a story about memory, and works to stir up Russian pride, all under the guise of music about paintings. And while “Pictures” has many meanings, world events may add another, which Mussorgsky certainly would have disagreed with: Ukrainian pride.
Russian architect and painter Viktor Hartmann was one of the originators of Russian Revivalist design, which restyled elements of medieval Russian architecture and took inspiration from traditional Russian folk culture. In his professional life, he became acquainted with cultural critic Vladimir Stasov and his group of musical mentees, known as “The Five,” a group of composers formed with the aim of creating a Russian national sound, including Modest Mussorgsky, Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and César Cui. Stasov set up a memorial exhibition in St. Petersburg in the spring of 1874, featuring more than 400 of Hartmann’s works, a great many of which are lost today.
It was this exhibition that inspired Mussorgsky to write “Pictures at an Exhibition,” a ten-movement suite for piano, with descriptions of each piece written by Stasov.
Each of the movements describes one of Hartmann’s works, with sections of walking music (“Promenades”) in between the movements, meant to simulate the museum experience. Each Promenade has a different character, meant to show Mussorgsky’s mixed feelings as he walks through a museum full of his dead friend’s works. “Pictures at an Exhibition” was an obscure piece until 1922, when conductor and publisher Serge Koussevitzky and composer Maurice Ravel brought attention to it again in Paris. What results from their excitement is Ravel’s famous 1922 orchestration, praised for its wide range of musical colors, which breathed life back into the work. One hundred years later, the piece is still one of the most frequently performed works by orchestras worldwide.
Though Hartmann was primarily an architect, Mussorgsky chose to memorialize just one architectural drawing (“The Great Gate of Kiev”), opting instead to showcase Hartmann’s catalog as a painter, which included travel sketches, craft designs, and a costume sketch for a ballet. Many of the original artworks are lost, but looking at images of the ones we know, it’s easy to be momentarily underwhelmed.
Other pieces of painting-inspired classical music take great works of art like Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus” (which became one of Respighi’s “Three Botticelli Pictures”) or Hokusai’s “The Great Wave off Kanagawa” (which is said to have inspired Debussy’s “La Mer”). Hartmann’s “Ballet of the Chickens in their Shells,” in contrast, is a sketch of the front and profile views of a dancer in a chicken egg costume, as it was a model for a real ballet costume at the Bolshoi Theater. “The Great Gate of Kiev” is similarly a design sketch for an architectural competition (the construction of which was canceled). The functional nature of Hartmann’s work makes interpretations of “Pictures at an Exhibition” as primarily art-inspired music less compelling.
While program note annotators rush to dig up images of Hartmann’s work in explaining the piece, being familiar with the art itself isn’t particularly important to understanding the work. Mussorgsky and Ravel didn’t immortalize Hartmann as much as they immortalized the experience of mourning Hartmann. While the “picture music” gets its due attention, the ingenuity of the piece lies in the “walking music,” beginning with its famous trumpet solo and brass chorale, its more reflective subsequent treatments, and finally merging with the “picture music” in the “Catacombs,” as if the gallery observer now finds themself in the art itself.
It is difficult to tell a cohesive story with music only, which is why orchestras generally make bad theater troupes and composers with a story to tell generally gravitate towards opera or ballet. “Pictures,” however, is special for its very successful storytelling of someone remembering a friend while they walk through a gallery of artwork, taking time to reflect in between paintings. This makes the piece an attractive and unique member of the orchestral canon, somewhere in between tone poem, theme and variations, and symphonic suite.
While “Pictures” is lauded for its timelessness, it is also necessarily an artifact from its historical moment. Hartmann’s Russian Revivalist style in designing a clock in the image of Baba Yaga’s storied chicken-legged hut inspired Mussorgsky’s fearsome movement inspired by the witch-like folk figure. “Samuel Goldenberg and Schmuyle,” also titled “Two Polish Jews: One Rich and One Poor,” comes from a time of widespread antisemitism in the Russian Empire. Historical depictions like these require thoughtful treatments from orchestras playing “Pictures” in the 21st century. More, “The Great Gate of Kiev” is from a time of Russian imperialism and is evidence of Hartmann and Mussorgsky’s national pride, complicated by those this week using it as a symbol of anti-Russian imperialism and Ukrainian patriotism.
For a century, “Pictures” has consistently drawn big audiences to concert halls. Though the music is steeped in the culture of nineteenth-century Russia and the orchestration very specific to early twentieth-century Paris, we have begun to reinterpret “The Great Gate of Kiev,” the crown jewel of the piece, as a tribute to an independent Ukraine. Next time you hear it — which will probably be soon — please wish “Pictures” a happy birthday.

Ali Wong saunters onto the stage in flats and a red cheetah print dress. The message is clear: Ali Wong has arrived –– not just to the event, but to the peak of her career. The don is here.
In her third Netflix comedy special “Don Wong,” Ali Wong is sure of herself. She isn’t still establishing herself in the world of comedy nor is she pregnant like she was in her previous Netflix specials. By now, we know she owns this stage — and in this special, she takes us through what we’ve missed since her last special “Hard Knock Wife” in 2018: from her colonoscopy after shooting the rom-com “Always Be My Maybe” to her moral disagreements with the viability of “fan pussy” versus “fan dick.” This is, of course, in the context of the glorification that male comics receive versus their female peers: Men get to reap obscene rewards from their fan base whereas women are often put in stalker-esque situations by theirs. Indeed, “fan dick” should therefore be avoided at all costs. In the end, Wong does what she does best. She’s able to intertwine hilarious stories from her own life with a common thread, getting us all to agree that yeah, women do deserve better, even without being especially exceptional. Throughout an hour of slight absurdity, she drives this point home.
In keeping with her usual comedic style, Wong ties her set together with one overarching idea. Tonight's theme? How badly Wong wants to cheat on her husband. (Spoiler: it’s like, really badly.) Isn’t she right though? Wong points out how if a male celebrity cheats on his partner, his actions will likely have little effect on his career. Female comics, however, aren’t afforded the same luxury.
Wong’s smart mix of humor and social commentary is what truly makes the special shine. What Wong is doing in making this point is much bigger than the constant thought of “I wish I could cheat,” but points to legitimate inequities in the professional sphere. Wong manages to hide real and legitimate commentary on gender within her main, very sexual, bit. These overarching themes are what make her such a smart comic aside from her on-the-nose sex-related jokes and skilled delivery.
However, the special does have some moments where Wong waivers a bit. Firstly, as with any performance that is based on a personal narrative, Wong’s comedy is not always as inclusive as it could be. For example, Wong’s discussion of a woman’s right to “have it all” remains within the binary of her heterosexual relationship. Wong critiques the pitfalls of straight men and straight men alone, which is fair enough but ultimately limiting. Of course, we can’t expect her to solve all of these issues in one hour-long set –– still, it’s not hard to want a little more.
Still, Wong makes her point and does so fabulously, anchoring her jokes in reality by talking about her real relationship with her husband. In all honesty, she seems really grateful for him and wants us to know it — her desire to cheat was rather obviously never the main point of her set. Wong continues to fight for women to not have to be excellent or stand out in order to be afforded the same rights as men. Essentially, Ali Wong wants to “have it all” — the family, the career, and the sex hat her male counterparts are afforded –– without having to be exceptional. While she may make this argument within the binary of her own life, it’s a point that can be translated to just about any scenario of injustice. Even while faking an orgasm on stage, Ali Wong keeps her audience engaged and even enlightened.

Inside this cozy Newbury Street art gallery, one will find an exhibition that its producers and attendees alike consider a bridge between the city of Boston and the art world’s future.
“NEW HORIZONS,” the first Non-Fungible Token (NFT) art exhibition to grace the Boston area, features the digital artwork of 10 artists from around the globe. Many of these artist, like Alex Ness (NessGraphics) and Billy Chitkin (Gernge) have already made names for themselves in other pockets of the art world, working on concert sets for top musicians or winning Emmys for designing the opening credit scenes to TV shows such as Netflix’s “The Crown.”
Plastered on monitors mounted against the walls, the artwork hardly takes center stage at the exhibition, and fails to command attention the same way that a roomful of traditional paintings would. But for those with the patience and desire to engage with the art nonetheless — as opposed to munching on the selection of cured meats in the back or schmoozing with the mysterious art collectors traipsing about — there is plenty on offer.
The pieces provide an immersive look into the immense variety one will find in the NFT art world. Some of the featured artwork loops short videos. One in particular transitions from night to day over and over. Some of these works, too, are accompanied by sound clips accessible through headphones next to the monitors, providing a brief respite from the hustle and bustle of the noisy gallery and outside world. For many of these GIF-like pieces, the accompanying sound is a highlight, elevating one’s experience with the art and, finally, giving the art an opportunity to demand full attention.
These works contrast smoothly with the stills on display, most of which have no accompanying sound. These static pieces range from lifeless dystopian cityscapes to dreamlike, colorful psychedelic depictions of dogs in nature.
In their stylistic diversity, each piece is genuinely creative and excellent. It is apparent these artists take their work and medium seriously, and are not jumping on the same NFT hype train as former First Lady Melania Trump and her watercolor eyes. The digital format, too, provides a unique layer of intrigue. Perhaps it's the inaccessibility, but there is a feeling that no matter how hard one tries they will never quite be able to “process” or know the work in the same way as art created in more tangible mediums.
Further adding to this intrigue is the fact that, if it weren’t for the two television monitors at the gallery’s entrance with artist biographies and frequently asked questions about NFTs, one would have no idea that they did not simply stumble upon a particularly well-curated and forward-looking digital art exhibition. While one will certainly leave both with an understanding of the basics of NFTs and the knowledge that this is excellent digital art, they will be left in the dark concerning what the true implications of these works being NFTs are.
Regardless, the focus on the exhibition’s broader mission — to bring the existing world of NFT art, specifically, to Boston — grounds the entire experience in something bigger, asserting the viewer’s position in a greater purpose and cultural movement.
Whether or not NFTs will continue their ascent into the mainstream cultural consciousness and reshape how the public thinks about art, currency, and everything in between remains to be seen. But what this exhibition makes evident is that artists can and do create thought-provoking, beautiful, diverse works of art that they are then able to monetize through the NFT ecosystem, sustaining their particular lifestyle and its unrelenting commitment to autonomy and self-expression.
‘NEW HORIZONS’ will be on view from February 24 through April 23, 6:30-9:30pm. It is housed at Pellas Gallery, 114 Newbury St., Boston, in collaboration with Metaversal.

A New York City cookie institution, Levain Bakery dominates the dessert world and remains a fan favorite for lovers of the big, heavy, and gooey cookies. Pam Weekes and Connie McDonald founded the bakery in 1995 on their love of massive cookies and need for sustenance during triathlon training. With nine locations and new frozen cookies sold at grocery stores nationwide, Levain is a powerhouse and poster child of the growing commercialized mom-and-pop bakery scene, in successful company with the likes of Milk Bar and Tate’s Bake Shop. They’re known for their iconic massive underbaked cookies, and an Instagram story ooey-gooey Levain cookie cross section is a rite of passage for some foodies.
The bakeries all have very limited standing and ordering space, leading to an almost-constant line out of the door, which only adds to the celebrity-sighting-like buzz of activity and Instagram post-inducing energy that surrounds the bakery. The smell of fresh baked cookies and a slew of people squatting outside scarfing down the cookies before they get cold are more than enough to pull in the crowds.
It’s no surprise that when Levain opened its first Boston location on Newbury Street on Feb. 19, that they were met with the same familiar fanfare. From viral food enthusiasts to unsuspecting shoppers, people near and far gravitated to these cookies. This hype begs the question of whether the cookies themselves deserve a cult-like following and sensationalized social media presence.
The well-lit interior crammed full of people and a simple display case of baked goods are set in front of a bustling open bakery, where massive heaps of cookie dough are scooped onto baking trays going in and out of the oven. A fast moving line and friendly staff streamline the entire process, just as any ultra-successful bakery giant with the means to design the perfect experience should be. With five cookie options and a few other miscellaneous baked goods, Levain keeps it simple and keeps its customers focused on what they waited in the freezing Boston winter for: the chocolate chip walnut cookie.
Clocking in at just around four inches in diameter, the cookie is a whopping six ounces, quite heavy, and over an inch thick. Baked every 30 minutes, a necessity considering the volume of cookies that pass through the door each day, every cookie is warm and melty, a move that’s imperative to selling the type of cookie that Levain does. Touted as the industry standard for thick, soft cookies, the Levain cookie doesn’t have a melt-in-the-mouth or ooey-gooey center: It has a raw one. The outside of the cookie has a satisfyingly crunchy top, with a craggy bit of browned dough and melted chips. However, the satisfaction from the cookie, like many aspects of Levain, ends at the surface level.
Likely cooked at an extremely high temperature, the top of the cookie is browned and crisp, while the middle is an undercooked, just-warmed cookie dough with a tough, almost burned bottom. Raw cookie dough enthusiasts definitely have their place among cookie connoisseurs — but this half-baked sugar rush isn’t quite the same. When cookie dough is heated but not completely cooked, the fat used in the dough seeps out and doesn’t bake into the dough. This mistake can be remedied by high-quality butter, but in the case of Levain’s chocolate chip walnut cookie, the palette is coated in a layer of what’s likely mass-produced, low quality vegetable shortening.
The thickness of the cookie is substantial, but in a cumbersome way. After three or four bites, the heft of the cookie begins to take its toll — it’s definitely something to share. The sheer mass and thickness of the cookie leaves the consumer clobbering through a huge mass of underbaked cookie dough.
For a cookie of such acclaim and fandom, it lacks a backbone of vanilla or butter, or really anything besides the texture of dough, melted chocolate chips, and untoasted, waxy walnuts. The dough is begging for a bit more salt to cut through the sweetness and to pull the other flavors out a bit more. Instead, the cookie is dominated by the squishy texture of the dough.
Sure, the cookies are warm, there’s melted chocolate, and it’s not anywhere near inedible, but for a bakery that has garnered so much success, Levain relies too heavily on the shock and awe of the line out of the door, the weight of the cookie, and the posts on Instagram. The acclaimed bakery unfortunately lets the quality of ingredients and the flavor of the cookie fade into the background in favor of the perfect viral food post.

The Harvard Crimson recently joined a college roundtable with acclaimed writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson to discuss the making of his latest film, “Licorice Pizza.” Anderson is best known for crafting bleak, intricate films about difficult characters. For instance, his 2017 period romance “Phantom Thread” was a searing exploration of masochistic love and fretless obsession over art in haute-1950s London. Suffice to say, there haven’t been many rosy stories in Anderson’s films of late. But that’s changed a bit with “Licorice Pizza” — at least on the surface.
Anderson’s latest follows Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman) and Alana Kane (Alana Haim), two misfits stuck between adolescence and adulthood. They’re flawed characters — an odd, explicitly “not boyfriend-girlfriend” pair who could’ve met a darker fate if Anderson was in a foul mood. But in “Licorice Pizza,” Alana and Gary’s flaws aren’t a death-knell, they are a product of youthful insecurities — of feeling just a little out of touch with people their own age. Their winding story navigates the emotionally turbulent boundaries between a friendship and a relationship, all while the pair bounce around episodic misadventures in 1970s Los Angeles.
Gary and Alana can only ever remain friends, and yet they find themselves constantly drawn to each other. Anderson commented on their complicated “platonic romance” dynamic: “The idea that two people can’t be together instantly creates this dilemma,” he said. “This is a very traditional formula for 1930s romantic comedies which really stand the test of time, to me. And it allows you to do endless comedic situations for them to be in.”
Haim and Hoffman have received widespread critical acclaim for their lead performances. “I know what it’s like as an audience member when you see somebody on the screen that you’ve never seen before. It’s a thrilling feeling,” Anderson said. “Imagine that as the director of the movie. I kind of built the whole thing on the premise that they could do it, and they did it. Gives you proud papa feelings.”
Anderson shared especially glowing praise for Haim. After collaborating on music videos for her pop-rock band HAIM in the past, Anderson then decided to write “Licorice Pizza” specifically for her. “I had a story that was floating around that needed help, that needed something,” he said. “And knowing Alana was what that help was. It was written for Alana. There was only one person that I ever considered and it was Alana. She’s the reason the whole thing exists.”
The level of care and attention that Anderson puts into directing his actors is matched by the care he puts into crafting luscious visuals. “Licorice Pizza” is shot on 35mm film, and Anderson captures colors in a way that really maximizes that medium, with gorgeous dream-like frames that reflect a hazy, fuzzy 1970s San Bernardino filled with characters that literally glow off the screen.
Still, Anderson says a lot of his directing approach isn’t always planned to the T. Speaking on the process of how he plans his shots, he said, “It’s all over the map. For some things, you have an idea in your mind. I was writing a film that took place where I lived. So there wasn’t that much that I was supplying with my imagination. You know, these were all real places from real stories. So I knew what they were, or I had to find stand-ins that would fit. What I mean by that is, there was an actual ‘Fat Bernie’s Waterbeds’ and it’s now a tanning salon, so I couldn’t use that. So, ok I’ve got to go find something else.”
“Now a lot of the shots end up really cementing themselves in the location scouting process,” he added. “You have the time to go to these locations over and over again, as many times as you need, and there isn’t a clock ticking of 50 crew members standing around wondering what to do. You get a chance to make the film quietly and without a lot of pressure when you’re location scouting.”
Anderson doesn’t just revisit the aesthetics of classical cinema with luscious cinematography — in many ways, he returns to old distribution methods of getting people into movie theaters. This included an extended two-month preview period between November and December, where the film screened in select locations at many traditional movie houses before being released nationwide. A theater near Harvard’s campus that has screened “Licorice Pizza” since its wide release is Somerville Theater, which was first built in 1914 and has been projecting films for a century. “We’re trying a lot of old-fashioned techniques in terms of getting the movie out there,” Anderson explained. “Making it go slowly, trying to raise people’s awareness over a long period of time rather than what seems to happen recently with films, which kind of get carpet bombed into existence and then forgotten about within two days … To stop and give audiences a chance to breathe, or at least present the film in a more respectable way, in turn gives respect to an audience.”
Part of the freedom to pursue these old distribution techniques can be attributed to how the pandemic has changed the way audiences interact with films. “The exciting thing about releasing a film right now is that normally everybody at the movie studio likes to look at you and think that they know everything and tell you what should happen,” Anderson said. “The great thing is they’re all looking at the landscape of what it means to make a film and release it today and they’ve thrown their hands up and are saying ‘we have no idea what to do.’”
As the roundtable wrapped, Anderson was asked what he wanted audiences to take away from “Licorice Pizza.” “When I started working with HAIM the band, we never had any money, we never had any time. We just did what we could with what we had. And we had a similar situation on this film,” he said. “We had to shoot it quickly, we had to shoot without too much thinking about it, just instinctual. And we were really using all our friends and all our family to make the film. So if anything, it verifies this belief that you don’t really need anything more than the desire and a handful of your friends and a handful of your family to make a great film.”
The Crimson reviewed “Licorice Pizza” and gave it 5 out of 5 stars. “Licorice Pizza” is showing in theaters nationwide.

Ever wonder what it’s like to be a celebrity? Give Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson two hours, and they’ll tell you in no uncertain terms — give or take a few musical numbers. Kat Coiro’s new romantic comedy “Marry Me” emphasizes the burdens of public attention and glosses over its benefits in an unoriginal glimpse into the lives of the rich and famous.
When the audience of “Marry Me” meets pop sensation Kat Valdez (Jennifer Lopez) — whose life bears a striking resemblance to the actress who portrays her — she is lounging on a chaise as an army of aides buzz around her pristine, Peloton commercial-esque apartment. They are preparing for Kat’s upcoming wedding to fellow star Bastian (Maluma), an onstage event that will be televised to an audience of over 20 million fans and oh-so-conveniently coincides with a performance of their new collaborative project, despite Kat’s insistence that she wants the ceremony to be about “just the two of them.”
Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) is introduced as the quaint antithesis to Kat’s life of luxury and superficiality, poised to rescue her from sycophants and a slimy fiancé. A single father to Lou (Chloe Coleman) and math teacher at the local middle school, Charlie stumbles into Kat’s concert/wedding in an attempt to win back his daughter’s admiration and prove once and for all that he is “cool.” Apparently, this includes accepting Kat’s impromptu proposal after she discovers Bastian’s infidelity and inexplicably fishes into the audience for a replacement groom. Luckily or unluckily, the two marry and embark on an emotionally hollow romance: performing for the paparazzi for the first few weeks, then developing real feelings, though the audience can hardly tell the difference.
In many ways, “Marry Me” seems like a desperate attempt to humanize celebrities to the public at large. Undoubtedly, there are moments of emotional poignancy: Kat’s mortification at discovering Bastian’s infidelity is worsened by video evidence widely circulated on the internet, and the bleak image of Kat crying on the floor of her apartment with only her manager to comfort her is certainly memorable. However, Lopez’s performance fails to deliver an emotional punch at these critical moments, and sympathy has its limits for characters who pick Coach handbags like apples from a tree and cannot complete basic tasks without their assistants’ help.
Lopez shines most in her moments on stage — which are numerous, stretching the film to a hefty run time of nearly two hours despite its threadbare screenplay — reminding the audience exactly why Jennifer Lopez is a beloved multi-hyphenate also known simply as “J. Lo.” Surrounded by gauze, sparkling lights, and occasionally a troupe of dancing nuns, Lopez is mesmerizing. But perhaps this flawless showmanship is exactly what prevents “Marry Me” from achieving emotional resonance. The line where Jennifer Lopez ends and Kat Valdez begins is blurry at best, and as such, the screenplay tiptoes around making Kat a fallible, human character and instead makes her a polished reflection of Lopez’s public persona. The film emphasizes her charitable endeavors and humble beginnings, and Kat Valdez remains as distant from the audience of “Marry Me” as she does from her concertgoers in the film.
Where is Charlie Gilbert during most of the action? Either standing in a corner, mesmerized by his “wife” as she records Instagram sponsorships and hit songs, or acting as the willing partner in yet another romantic montage (there are many). Wilson adequately completes his role as the charming rustic to Lopez’s high achiever, proudly declaring that he has neither social media nor a smartphone — totally unbelievable in the year 2022 — and encouraging Kat to step away from her regimented schedule and draining media responsibilities. What does Charlie get in return? The pleasure of Kat’s company, it is assumed, though the pair’s interactions largely consist of flirtatious gibes and incessant references to just how different their lives are.
Perhaps the greatest failing of “Marry Me” is in establishing Kat and Charlie as two people who actually love each other: Wilson and Lopez lack chemistry, and the heavy lifting of romance is left to more cinematographic elements. If anything, “Marry Me” is successful in its depiction of modern-day fame. Cameras relentlessly swarm the two lovers, their Instagram followers know important details about their lives before they do, and their relationships are founded on more than just mutual attraction. Certainly, megastars will find the story relatable, but “Marry Me” has little to offer to a broader audience besides a handful of catchy songs.

Thirty years ago, 19-year-old Masahiro Sakurai created a star.
Sakurai, a new employee at the Japanese game development company HAL Laboratory, was tasked with directing his first game: “a game that anyone could enjoy,” he later recalled.
“Kirby’s Dream Land,” alternatively known as “Kirby of the Stars” in Japan, released for the Game Boy in 1992 and went on to become the first entry in the “Kirby” franchise. 30 years later, with over 35 games, an anime, and several manga, comics, and novels under his belt, Kirby’s still going strong as one of the most recognizable — and cutest — video game characters ever. And through the core philosophy of accessibility and variety that permeates the design of the games, the “Kirby” franchise has left an indelible mark on gaming history.
Among the “Kirby” franchise’s innovations, “Kirby Super Star” is especially notable. Its fighting game-inspired controls went on to form the core gameplay of Sakurai’s “Super Smash Bros.” series a few years later, which Kirby appears in as a fan-favorite character.
The “Kirby” series itself consists of two halves: the mainline games and the more experimental spin-offs. The mainline games are fairly traditional sidescrolling platformers — Kirby must traverse stages by running, jumping, flying, and using his iconic power to inhale enemies and copy their abilities. The spin-offs feature a variety of innovative gameplay styles spanning genres like puzzle, racing, and RPG. The entire series, however, shares the same basic premise: colorful worlds with a whimsical atmosphere, wrapped up in the philosophy of Kirbyism.
Kirbyism, coined by Sakurai, is a design philosophy that has come to define the series. Stemming from Sakurai’s desire to create games that all players can enjoy, Kirbyism dictates that players should be able to choose their own individualized experience.
By puffing himself up into a balloon, Kirby can fly infinitely; some players will choose to fly over the entire stage and reach the goal unchallenged, while others will want to stay on the ground and fight through the enemies and obstacles. Some players will use Copy Abilities that allow them to attack at range, while others will gravitate towards abilities that force them to fight up close, and so on. In this way, players can ensure that they have fun, enjoying an experience unique to them.
The “Kirby” series, in many ways, represents an act of resistance. Whereas many games of the NES and Game Boy era made themselves unfairly difficult to keep people playing, “Kirby” games broke the industry trend by emphasizing accessibility and fun. Whereas other games were gritty and serious, the “Kirby” series proved the value of joy and artistic creativity.
In particular, Kirby challenged conceptions of what a protagonist should be. His design consists of nothing more than a circle with stubby arms and feet. The introduction to “Kirby’s Adventure” puts it best: “First you draw a circle, then you dot the eyes. Add a great big smile and presto, it’s Kirby!”
In fact, this is what many children did: Following the release of “Kirby’s Dream Land,” Sakurai noticed chalk drawings of Kirby appearing in parks.
Kirby’s universal appeal, crossing gender and age demographics, comes from this simplicity and versatility. While Kirby is a cute pink puffball from the country of Dream Land on Planet Popstar, he’s an unparalleled warrior with infinite potential. While he spends his days childishly oblivious to everything around him — he can’t even speak or read — he springs into action whenever someone is in trouble, with his naïve sense of justice sometimes leading him to rash conclusions. Differing from the blank avatars and stock heroes of early video games, Kirby displays a defined personality while still offering something for everyone. His character itself, his metaphorical Copy Ability, encapsulates the core tenants of Kirbyism.
In fact, Kirbyism informs not only the gameplay but also every aspect of the series. The soundtracks, for instance, possess a unique adaptability and deep simplicity which the developers refer to as “Kirby sound.” They rightly define “Kirby” music as being “anything goes.” While much of it is cheerful, with the ability to put a smile on anyone’s face, players can also find everything from jazz to dubstep to hard metal.
The plots of the games, too, exemplify Kirbyism through their presentation. Starting back in “Kirby’s Dream Land 2,” people who only want to play to the end can enjoy a surface-level look at the plot, while those who choose to dive deeper into the world receive a more complete picture.
Consequently, the innocent appearance of the series masks surprising darkness.
“You get drawn in by the cuteness, and find yourself playing until suddenly you and Kirby are ready to face the final battle with the fate of the world on the line,” current series director Shinya Kumazaki explained.
Kirby’s cute design stands in contrast to the terrifying threats he’s protected Popstar from, including witches, several deity-level beings, and a supercomputer bent on eradicating all life in the universe.
In these struggles, although he doesn’t realize it himself, Kirby encounters profound sadness. He often fights to save his enemies from themselves — from their self-corruption, pain and grief. And because of Kirbyism’s malleability, from this despair comes a reaffirmation of the beauty of the world.
“The stars were so beautiful,” the ending of “Kirby Mass Attack” narrates, as Kirby flies home through space after a long journey. “Darkness had its place just as much as light. For the stars sparkled twice as bright in the dark depths of space!”
For only underneath tranquil innocence can tragedy strike with full force, and only in the midst of heartache can love truly shine. This duality marks the ultimate testament to Kirby’s legacy of joining disparate concepts, even as he unites diverse players.
On March 25, “Kirby and the Forgotten Land” will launch as the first mainline 3D “Kirby” game, beginning the “next stage” of the franchise.
Until Kirby lights up screens and smiles once again, players can reflect on 30 years of naptimes and snacks, and they can gaze up at the sparkling stars, each in their own unique way.

In the Spanish language, there’s a duality to the word for “tongue”: “la lengua” translates to both the physical body part, but also to “language.” Edited by Saraciea J. Fennell, “Wild Tongues Can’t Be Tamed” explores the dual importance of the “tongue” — both the powerful voice it produces and the language that it chooses to speak. A collection of 15 short stories from renowned Latinx authors, this piece effortlessly educates and reminds readers of the incredible diversity of Latinx-Americans, and that ethnicity has no spectrum.
One of the most prominent and interesting features of the anthology is the relationship between each Latinx identity and Spanish fluency — or lack thereof. Most of the authors describe the diaspora of their ancestors, resulting in English fluency as a means to find work and survive in America. Because of the shedding of “la lengua” of their ancestors, the authors recount the microaggressions of their life when people questioned if they were Latinx enough. Culminating in one of the most powerful parts of the collection, Zakiya N. Jamal’s story, “Cuban Imposter Syndrome”, confronts that upsetting question. Growing up in Long Island, Jamal writes how her Afro-Cuban identity cast doubt on her Latinx-ness. She terms this self-dissociation as her “Cuban Imposter Syndrome,” the feeling that she “didn’t fit the mold of what a Cuban should be” by not having Spanish fluency or the quinceañera milestone. In a beautifully simple way, she confronts the falsehood that she falls low on America’s constructed spectrum of Latinx identity: “Whenever I or anyone else makes me feel like a fraud, I remember that it is not my skin tone, my fluency in Spanish, or my name that makes me Cuban. I am Cuban because my mother is, my grandma is, and her mother was.”
Admittedly, there are moments when the 15 different short stories feel very disconnected. The anthology begins with Mark Oshiro explaining his childhood as a Mexican-American orphan, piecing together his identity through eating unseasoned tacos in his hometown of Idaho and getting dressed for elementary school, never forgetting to wear his label of “pocho” — a derogatory term that refers to a Mexican who cannot speak Spanish. As a college student, Lilliam Rivera brings us into her mental health struggles in a Latinx family that uses the Catholic religion as the only means of therapy. Ingrid Rojas Contreras confronts her failed interracial marriage with a man and family that claims to “not see color.” Aside from the plot, the stories widely vary in structure and gravity, as some stories uncover darker childhood microaggressions and mental health struggles. The progression of the stories seems confusing and readers might ask how these mismatched stories blend together.
They don’t. And it’s now clear that this aspect is the most beautiful part of this collection of voices.
Since kindergarten, we’re taught what to expect from a story: a beginning that sets the scene with an inciting conflict, a middle sprinkled with obstacles, and the classic happily-ever-after ending. And so reading the stories of “Wild Tongues Can’t Be Tamed” together might initially feel disorienting as the authors whirl through different ages, classes, genders, races, and sense of place. The authors and their stories are different in seemingly every way, though when delicately bound together, these voices — las lenguas — are sewn like patchwork into a universal truth that all Latinx individuals share. Kirkland Vaughans, a clinical psychologist famous for writing about the importance of recognizing and celebrating different races, perfectly explains this truth: “Yes, we’re all the same – in the sense that we’re all different.”
It’s only right that a book uncovering Latinx identity comes in the form of multiple authors, representing the beautiful diaspora of color, language, race, gender, and identity that contributes to the mosaic of America’s Latinx community. After finishing this book, readers — whether or not they are members of the Latinx community — will have a deeper appreciation for Latinx culture, food, and, of course, people.

Cult favorite studio and distributor A24’s newest collaboration with Apple TV+, “The Sky Is Everywhere,” relies on aesthetics to move viewers where plot, premise, and dialogue fall short. Based on Jandy Nelson’s 2010 YA novel of the same name, the film follows teenager Lennie Walker (Grace Kaufman) through the ups-and-downs of grieving, falling in love, and rediscovering her voice in the wake of her older sister Bailey’s sudden death. Punctuated by vibrant flashback sequences, scenes of magical realism reminiscent of those in Jon Chu’s 2021 adaptation of “In The Heights,” and breathtaking shots of the redwood forest, “The Sky Is Everywhere” is cinematically creative and visually stunning. A standout soundtrack featuring everything from Bach to a poignant piano sample of Ashe’s “Moral of the Story” makes the film equally pleasing to the ear as it is to the eye.
Unfortunately, the inspired artistic direction is wasted on a plot riddled with every cliché the young adult genre is often mocked for: an unconvincing love triangle (if you can even call it that), vaguely referenced dead parents, sibling rivalry, secret teen pregnancy, a one-dimensional mean girl who dresses like a wannabe Jackie Kennedy, Juilliard ambitions (albeit slightly more plausible than Troy Bolton’s), and a token quirky POC best friend — just to name a few of many overused tropes. The dialogue often feels canned, and many of the characters’ motivations are never made clear. The nature of several relationships are confusing as most characters display shockingly little empathy or emotional intelligence and are quick to turn on one another, then just as quick to make up.
Commendably, “The Sky Is Everywhere” does attempt to address many of the very real but often taboo realities of losing a loved one. During a voice-over sequence preceding the entrance of romantic lead Joe Fontaine (Jacques Colimon), Lennie admits that “the weirdest part of grief, the most inappropriate part, is that all of a sudden since Bailey died, I can’t stop thinking about just falling into someone’s arms.” The relationship between desire and grief is further complicated when Lennie and Toby, Shaw, Bailey’s longtime boyfriend and secret fiancé, share several confusing romantic moments while connecting over losing the person who mattered most to both of them. Toby reads unsettlingly older than 17-year-old Lennie, but the unbalanced power dynamic is addressed: Lennie and Toby recognize their attraction towards one another as misplaced and go their separate ways before the line of undeniable creepiness is crossed.
The casting is in some ways on point and in other ways completely misses the mark. At 19, Grace Kaufman is convincing as a highschooler and delivers a heartfelt performance as Lennie that saves the story from falling completely flat. 27-year-old Jacques Colimon brings a boyish enthusiasm to his portrayal of Joe Fontaine, the musical boy genius with commitment issues who Lennie falls for, a strong contrast to the third leg of the quasi-love triangle, Toby, played by 30-year-old Pico Alexander. With excellent comic timing, Jason Segel and Cherry Jones are perfectly typecast as Lennie’s endearing stoner Uncle Big and unapologetically candid Grandma Fiona, though neither add much emotional weight to scenes intended to be tear-jerking climaxes of the movie.
An opportunity for an original take on the classic teenage dramedy presents itself in Lennie’s passion for the clarinet. The impact of trauma and grief on artistic performance — especially in an arena as exacting and demanding as orchestral music — is a compelling topic seldom discussed in popular culture, or real life. Using loss and eventual rediscovery of clarinet as a metaphor for experiencing the stages of grief, Lennie’s identity as a musician sets up some truly gorgeous surrealist montage sequences that visualize her magical experience of music. Unsure about continuing to pursue her dream of going to Juilliard now that she will no longer be able to share it with Bailey, who hoped to attend for acting, Lennie finds herself unable to play and quits the honor band at school. It is only with Joe’s relentless nagging and encouragement that Lennie finally picks up the clarinet again and finds she can still play with ease, neatly wrapping up the music storyline and letting it fade to background noise.
When applied to content rather than aesthetics, the principles of maximalism, free-spiritedness, and youthful hyper-saturation that make “The Sky Is Everywhere” sensorially stunning only serve to create a disjointed and hollow script whose inconsistencies cannot be fully smoothed over by any amount of artistic embellishment. Ultimately, fans of whimsical storytelling and beautifully overstated cinematography might be better off waiting for Josephine Decker’s next film.

This review contains spoilers for Season One of “Peacemaker” on HBO Max.
“I’m made for this sh*t.”
Such is the epiphany of Leota Adebayo (Danielle Brooks) a little more than halfway through the season finale of “Peacemaker,” entitled “It’s Cow Or Never”. Earlier in the season, it is revealed that issues in Adebayo’s personal life have left her no option but to join the family business. There’s only one problem: Her mother is the stone-cold intelligence agent Amanda Waller, and the family business happens to involve espionage, superhero shenanigans, and otherworldly threats. While this job doesn’t initially seem to align with the lifestyle of the mild-mannered Adebayo — who previously worked at a dog shelter — her experiences in the field with Peacemaker (John Cena) and the rest of their secret ops team in season one help her settle into her newfound role. And while Adebayo’s burgeoning confidence fully comes to fruition in the season finale, it’s interesting to see that the brash-on-the-surface Peacemaker is as vulnerable as ever, and hence that he is perhaps not “made for this sh*t.” In any case, these inverted character arcs — as well as the careful execution of crucial character moments in general — are what really make this finale shine.
Peacemaker, whose real name is Chris Smith, claims to be a superhero, but his reputation is rather more like a no-nonsense assassin. The character, first introduced on the big screen in 2021’s “The Suicide Squad,” operates by the following logic, as he states in the film: “I cherish peace with all my heart. I don’t care how many men, women, and children I need to kill to get it.” While this line is largely played off as satire in the film, “Peacemaker” adds nuance to the character’s driving philosophy; it is revealed that Chris accidentally killed his older brother Keith as a child, during a fight they were forced into by their abusive father, Auggie. Chris hence swears that he would only ever kill for peace, and as such, he eventually does kill Auggie after being ambushed by him in the season’s penultimate episode.
However, just because Auggie is gone doesn’t mean he’ll be gone from Chris’s mind. During a harrowing sequence in the finale when Chris is by himself in the woods, he hallucinates that Auggie is there with him, and the two begin to energetically curse each other out. Balancing comedy and intensity in this way is something the show’s writers excel at, and its effect is enhanced in this scene when we see Chris through the eyes of Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), another member of the team. From her point of view, Chris is engaged in a heated argument with a tree; there is hence an uncomfortable tonal shift that poignantly portrays Chris’s haunting reality, and this scene’s powerful use of perspective shows us how Harcourt gains a deeper understanding of his oft-hidden trauma.
Fortunately, things aren’t always so complicated for Chris. In a brutal but captivating action sequence, Chris, Harcourt, and Vigilante (Freddie Stroma) surge into battle with the villainous “Butterflies,” parasitic alien beings who use human hosts and are trying desperately to protect their species’ food source: A gargantuan cosmic cow. The sequence, which is set to the show’s hard rock theme song, Wig Wam’s “Do Ya Wanna Taste It,” is decidedly epic. It’s definitely a highlight for Vigilante, who, while being something of a merger between Chris’s best friend and biggest fan, does not share his moral qualms; he instead blazes a berserk trail of blood and guts, providing comic relief all the while. Vigilante and Harcourt are eventually incapacitated, though, which paves the way for Adebayo to join Chris in an effort to kill the cow.
At the episode’s climax, the leader of the Butterflies pleads with Chris to support their cause. She claims that rather than aiming to rule Earth, the Butterflies hope to save the human race from itself, even if that means killing humans along the way. This assumption of authority appears to resonate with Chris’s perennial quest for peace-by-murder, thus providing a parallel that effectively crystallizes his moral dilemma. He eventually decides against helping the Butterflies, a decision which is followed by Adebayo’s murder of the cow — thus further solidifying her place in her new line of work. Nevertheless, towards the end of the episode, Chris asks Adebayo, “Did I just kill the world?”, making his anxiety and self-doubt more apparent than ever. Adebayo reassures him of his choice, though, and the stark difference between her resolve and Chris’s distress in this scene is another indicator of the show’s success in developing these characters in opposite directions.
In the season’s final scene, Chris sits down on his porch, undoubtedly wondering what trajectory his life will take from here. As if this tense moment of reflection isn’t enough, after a couple of seconds, Auggie takes a seat next to him, sporting a sinister grin. Perhaps more stirring than the scene in the woods, this one doesn’t need any dialogue to show that the wounds of Chris’s past are not going to leave him alone any time soon. Evidently, before he can gain clarity on how he wants to bring about peace in the world, Chris must figure out what it means to find peace for himself. This is likely where we’ll pick up in the recently-announced season two.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are too many concerts happening on any given day to wait around for your favorite band to come to town. Going to concerts should surpass fandom and singing along to songs you know. From dancing with a stranger and discovering new artists to escaping from the outside world and being moved by unheard lyrics, the worth of attending a mystery concert is high.
This column explains the phenomena of the live music experience through the shows that are happening right now. This week, I’ll explore how artists create new musical worlds through songs, staging, and performance. It’s this world-building that makes the concert experience universal. No matter what band is playing, a show provides a prescriptive escape from our daily lives. Whether you want to embrace the abstract, contemplate lyrics and instrument technique, or discover a community you never really understood, there’s a concert happening in Boston that can take you away. The War on Drugs, The Wood Brothers, Price & Vilray, Jake Blount, and Eric Nam were some of the artists to come to Boston recently whose live soundscapes took us away.
The War on Drugs and The Wood Brothers: Mesmeric Experiences
The War on Drugs took the concept of building musical landscapes to heart. Each song was a world in its own right, establishing an ebb and flow and following it in lengthy and immersive tracks. The ambience The War on Drugs created was supported by their stage setup. Six musicians populated the stage, each surrounded by their specialty instruments and stacks of amps. Looking at the stage was like looking at a machine. Pedal distorted tremolo effects and copious amounts of delay and reverb defined The War on Drugs performance on the first of their two-night residence at the House of Blues on Jan. 31. At the height of the show, as “Come to the City” morphed into “Living Proof,” Boston was the farthest thing from my mind. Entranced by the rhythm, I could have been anywhere.
I was surprised to undergo a similar spellbinding experience at a folk concert in the same venue later that week. Despite having only three band members, The Wood Brothers found a way to overload the House of Blues with aural force. Without synths or heavy equipment, the source of their mesmerizing tone was total command of their instruments. Basslines put forth by Chris Wood defied the traditional instrumentation of the upright bass in folk music. Moving up and down the neck and simultaneously playing harmonica melodies, his playing was a show of its own. Instrumentalist Jano Rix also brandished simultaneous instrumental prowess. While playing drums with his left hand and two feet, his right hand would scale the keyboard in flashing solos. Oliver Wood’s droning fingerstyle guitar playing and soulful voice anchored each song and led the trio into triumphant choruses.
The Wood Brothers created a world of emotions and passion as they vowed to not read “Postcards from Hell” or “Cry Over Nothing” anymore. They specifically taught the audience to sing along in parts during “Liza Jane,” but the crowd needed no help recalling all of their folk cry choruses. For The Wood Brothers, their mesmeric performance was not just defined by stage output but inclusion from the crowd. Singing along with the easy-to-learn, anthemic choruses made the show.
These shows represent the classic concert expectation for concert goers when they see their favorite artists — the immersion, the sing alongs, the auditory trance. But live music has so much more to offer.
Rache Price & Vilray and Jake Blount: Lyrical Antics with a Side of History
Rachel Price of Lake Street Dive and Vilray brought a classic and subtle sound to the City Winery on Feb. 19 for a rescheduled show. With Vilray on guitar plugged to a single amp and Price on vocals, the two gently serenaded a room full of music enthusiasts sipping wine at candlelit tables. Between sets they would banter together and tell the story behind the writing of each song or who it may have been about. The banter continued midsong as they altered lyrics to suit the audience or commented on the way the other was singing.
Each lyric and story was thoughtful and exuded wit. An unreleased commissioned song by Vilray entitled “Hate is the Basis of Love” exemplified the clever comedy of the show, scoring several hearty laughs from the crowd. Price took the time to praise her inspirations — like Peggy Lee — and speak about the history of their 1940s ribbon microphone, which allowed for Price’s careful crooning. An evening with Price and Vilray could not have been more different than my two nights at the House of Blues, yet both shows shared a language of music that united the audience to the music, lyrics, band, and each other.
Activist, scholar, and musician Jake Blount also made witty comments and lyrical connections with his audience at the Middle East Nightclub and Restaurant last Sunday night. With banjo in hand and backed by a three-piece string band, Blount’s genre was much different than Price and Vilray. Blount seeks to revive Black stringband music, which holds the origins of much of American folk and roots music today. Generally playing songs from oral traditions or archived records, Blount brings the past to the present with his banjo and fiddle arrangements. With fluttering, repeating folk instrumentals, Blount achieved a hypnotic effect at points in his show. The defining characteristics however were the humorous lyrics and thoughtful histories. “(When You See) Those Flying Saucers” and “You Can’t Tell The Difference When It’s Dark” were particularly comic. The story of his new single, “The Man Was Burning,” was inspired by Sister Rosetta Tharp, the rarely credited inventor of roots rock and roll, who sang spirituals in an upbeat, electric guitar backed style. Blount played a stringband version of the song Sunday night but took the time to share its history, beyond just playing the music.
Price and Vilray and Jake Blount offered alternatives to the typical, loud, music hall performance often associated with concerts. A willingness to listen and experience live performances can open up their worlds of musical history and talent.
Eric Nam: Enjoying the Fandom of Others
Eric Nam may seem out of place on this list. A K-Pop star from Atlanta who studied at Northeastern before moving to South Korea to begin a career in entertainment, his story is unique. He has recently risen to new heights of fame as K-Pop continues to take the world by storm, driven by the popularity of BTS. Eric Nam sold out the House of Blues last Monday, Feb. 21, with a line that stretched past Fenway and wrapped around the highway. His show makes this list because — despite his fame — I had never heard of Eric Nam. Discovering the world of K-Pop was different from discovering other artists live because there were so many fans!
Since I have somehow stayed outside of the K-Pop craze, I was shocked as the line to get into the show went on and on. Once inside, I watched people scream and jump at every body roll and high note. While Nam sings mostly in English, both English and Korean lyrics were shouted out by the crowd. Although I had never seen any of the bands mentioned thus far in concert, I had truly never been to a concert like Nam’s. With backup dancers and choreographed movement, backing tracks and tour merch worn on stage, his exhibition of pop was spectacular to watch.
It didn’t take many songs for me to buy in, shouting back the chorus of “Echo” and dancing as Eric commanded me to. Surrendering any of my criticism of the music or potentially cringey lyrics such as “You’re Sexy I’m Sexy,” I rode the energy of adoring fans for a show I may never have gone to other times.
See New Music Live
If this column achieves anything, I hope it will inspire you to seek out live music. Buy a ticket to see a band you’ve never heard of; go to an open mic night; attend a music festival; start a band. Not all concerts seek to give the same experience. Not all venues can provide the same experience. As I continue to explore what’s happening in Boston in live music, I’ll analyze venues, artists, genre, and ultimately try to answer what makes Boston a unique place to make music. Until then, here’s what I can recommend you see:

Talisk at Club Passim, March 2nd
Punch Brothers at Orpheum Theatre, March 3rd
The Tallest Man on Earth at the Royale, March 3rd
Please at O’Brien’s Pub, March 5th
The David Wax Museum at City Winery Boston, March 6th
Colbie Caillat at Boch Center, March 8th

“jeen-yuhs.” It doesn’t get more Ye West than this title: overflowing confidence bordering on arrogance, self-proclaimed brilliance, and an individualized sense of style. A decade ago, many loved Ye for these attributes, but the public opinion of the rapper has since shifted. Ye is somehow always in the spotlight, though almost never for good reason. Even now, he is in the midst of what is probably his most personal controversy, as his divorce from Kim Kardashian has transformed into a social media spectacle. With every new uproar, the question arises: What happened to Ye? How did the young, outward-looking star become the controversial figure he is today? The first episode of the “jeen-yuhs” trilogy brings us back to the man the world loved while simultaneously planting the seeds for the man he would eventually become.
And when it falls down who you gon' call now?
What makes “jeen-yuhs” great is that Ye West is secondary to the documentary as a whole. This is made clear from the start: The episode doesn’t begin with an introduction to Ye, but rather with the backstory of the film’s director and producer, FC. We learn about his career covering Chicago hip-hop in the late ’90s, his first encounter with a young Ye West, and, most importantly, how he embarked upon this 20-year long documentary project. When shooting began, Ye wasn't a star by any means — he was just an up-and-coming producer who was generating some buzz in Chicago. Yet, when he moved to Newark to pursue his dreams of becoming a signed artist, Coodie dropped everything and followed him to document his rise. What is even more impressive is the way in which this first installment is shot. It is visually engaging, immersing viewers in the aesthetics of the early 2000s. Furthermore, it is clear that the docuseries is Coodie’s creation; Ye is merely the subject behind the lens. The result is a refreshingly authentic portrayal of Ye, one that can only come from a documentary free from his control.
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
When we do finally meet Ye, he is neither rich nor famous. It quickly becomes obvious that he’s always had his unwavering confidence. After moving to Newark in 2000, Ye saw success in the music industry, culminating with his production for Jay-Z’s “The Blueprint.” But Ye wasn’t satisfied: He wanted to become a rapper, but the music labels didn’t share this vision. The most striking example came when Ye visited Roc-a-fella Records studio. Coodie’s movement of the camera between Ye’s passionate rapping and the blank faces of the executives created a jarring dichotomy, emphasizing how little people believed in his abilities. However, this visit ends with Ye strolling out, his head held high as ever. This shows the viewer his strong self-belief, and it is inspiring. We know that Ye ends up succeeding, but to see how it happened gives us a newfound appreciation for him.
Even if you in a Benz, you still a n***** in a coupe
In a later scene, as Ye sits in his car doing an interview, we get to hear him open up about his struggles within hip-hop. One of the most compelling ideas he puts forth is that he isn’t recognized because people didn’t believe he came from “nothing” and was “out in the streets” growing up. These ideas dominated hip-hop at the time, and so his divergence from this norm wasn’t easily accepted. He also didn’t get the respect he deserved as an artist in general. Rap is an art form, and for many reasons (including the fact that the majority of those creating it are Black), it isn’t respected as such. This short clip highlights Ye's struggle to convince the whole world of his work, humanizing him in a way that makes him relatable to the viewer.
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it
The emotional core of this documentary becomes clear when we see Ye speak with his mother Donda West. Watching Ye become an excited son is heartwarming, as he gushes to his mother about producing for Jay-Z and his goals for the future. But these lighthearted moments also provide a glimpse into what Ye will become. Donda West praises her son’s confidence, but she warns him that “the giant looks in the mirror and sees nothing.” There is a delicate balance between confidence and arrogance, and Ye has always played with this line, even sometimes crossing. But this episode shows us that his self-confidence is what made him great. The man who can’t take no for an answer. The man who knew he would rise to the top. For 90 minutes, episode one of “jeen-yuhs” sucks us into a world of the Ye we wish never left.

A sinister apartment building and its inhabitants are the suspects in Lucy Foley’s newest novel, “The Paris Apartment.” A thriller with short chapters narrated by characters full of secrets, “The Paris Apartment” is quick to draw in the reader and will leave them hooked with anticipation.
Jess, a Londoner escaping her less-than-ideal job, arrives in Paris to stay with her brother, Ben, only to find him missing. From the very start, every character has something to hide. Foley spends much of the first half of her novel unwinding the threads connecting each character to Ben and their potential motives for his disappearance. The pace is rather slow and focuses more on developing the personalities of apartment building’s inhabitants than on the main mystery at hand. Delving into subplots of roommate drama, affairs, and extortion, Foley takes occasional detours from Ben’s disappearance. Despite leaving the reader impatient and wanting more action, this exposition provides much needed context for the latter half of the novel and builds the tension that makes the ending oh-so-satisfying.
From Sophie, the seemingly perfect Parisienne and trophy wife, to Antoine, a man brewing with violence just beneath the surface, Foley strongly develops the novel’s side characters along with all of their flaws. Frequently switching perspectives from Jess to her neighbors, the reader is organically exposed to the characters’ feelings along with Jess’s interpretation of them. The short chapters rarely span more than five pages and give quick but powerful glimpses into what makes these characters human. Grappling with failed marriages, and unrequited love, the inhabitants of Number Twelve Rue des Amants are all battling inner demons.
A surprisingly subtle but important player in the tale is Paris itself. The bustling city with tourists and boulangeries provides contrast to the apartment building’s quiet seclusion and adds to the frenzied atmosphere of the story with police corruption and riots in the streets. Jess’s ventures into the foreign city are “a breath of fresh air,” showing just how suffocating and oppressive the apartment building really is.
Wealth, or the lack of it, is also tied up in this thrilling tale. The concierge’s cramped quarters juxtapose the luxuriously decorated penthouse apartment and expansive wine cellar, raising questions about the legitimacy of all the affluence we witness. The protagonist is described as essentially broke, putting her at odds with the other dwellers of the apartment building based on social status. An outsider looking in, Jess feels relatable on her journey digging through the secrets of the wealthy neighbors to find her brother.
“The Paris Apartment” really takes off in the second half, as Jess makes crucial discoveries that unearth not only how her brother disappeared but ultimately how Number Twelve Rue des Amants came to be. Action-packed excursions into the depths of Paris and chaotic basement parties keep the plot engaging by adding an element of surprise. Betrayals and emotional revelations from Jess’s neighbors preserve the mystery all the way until its reveal, climactic for the reader and the inhabitants of the apartment building alike.
Foley’s writing is simple and immersive, marrying the elegance and dark undertones of Paris with a reckless but determined protagonist to create an intriguing mystery. “The Paris Apartment” is a sinister puzzle you’ll love solving.

Every year, film buffs across the globe unite for the announcement of the long-awaited Oscar nominations. Collective sighs of relief, groans of anger, and gasps of disbelief abound as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals which actors, creative workers, and films will get the chance to clutch the coveted gold statue.
This year was no exception. It is officially time to conduct a thorough Oscar nominations debrief in preparation for the ceremony on March 27 hosted by Regina Hall, Amy Schumer, and Wanda Sykes.
To begin with the bad news, it was upsetting to see a complete lack of nominations for Rebecca Hall’s magnificent directorial debut “Passing.” This adaptation of Nella Larsen’s 1929 novel of the same name was one of the year’s most beautiful, complex, and thought-provoking films. “Passing” tells the story of two Black women, one of whom is passing for white in 1920s New York, precariously rekindling a friendship after many years apart.
Ruth Negga and Tessa Thompson each offer career-best performances while masterfully developing an odd, foreboding chemistry. To see none of this film’s artistry recognized — while mediocre works such as “Don’t Look Up” bag several nominations — is frankly a shame.
As for individual actors who were disappointingly omitted from Oscar contention, Lady Gaga of course comes to mind. Was “House of Gucci” thirty minutes too long, overly campy, and largely unremarkable? Yes. But Gaga, in pure Gaga fashion, gave this role 110 percent effort and deserved to be recognized for it. The Academy snubbing Gaga’s widely praised and extremely popular turn as Patrizia Reggiani was a missed opportunity. Here’s to hoping Lady Gaga still comes to the ceremony!
A much less discussed, yet even more deserving performance was that of Ann Dowd in “Mass.” Dowd plays the mother of a school shooter who has a conversation with the parents of a victim, a role that demands unimaginable amounts of empathy, emotional range, and sensitivity. Dowd delivered on all fronts and helped shape a jarringly beautiful film that lingers long after the screen fades to black.
Other notable snubs include, but are not limited to: Mike Faist in “West Side Story,” Hidetoshi Nishijima in “Drive My Car,” Cate Blanchett in “Nightmare Alley,” and Caitríona Balfe in “Belfast.” Someone could make a (pretty convincing) case for Willem Dafoe in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” as well.
On to the good news. Though controversial, the most pleasant surprise was the Academy’s somewhat tepid reception of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Licorice Pizza.” This aimless tale of a 15-year-old high schooler falling in love with a 25-year-old woman was simply uncomfortable and unenjoyable to watch. Therefore, it was quite a relief to see that this film only landed three nominations (although one was unfortunately for Best Picture).
Also, it was only right that Jesse Plemons received a nod from the Academy for his wonderful performance in “The Power of the Dog.” While his on-screen and real-life wife, Kirsten Dunst, has received much deserved recognition for her role in the film, Plemmons’s unassuming yet subtly beautiful portrayal of George Burbank seemed to be fading into the background. Through this nomination, the Academy rightfully recognized one of the most versatile and entertaining actors working in Hollywood today.
More so than any other nomination, the inclusion of Kristen Stewart — whose turn as Princess Diana in “Spencer” had been inexplicably overlooked by other voting academies such as the Screen Actors Guild — was a thrilling and delightful surprise (seriously, just ask my roommate how excited I was to hear her name read). Stewart, who many may have come to know and love through her work in the “Twilight” films, embraced a daunting new challenge with this role and deserves not only to be nominated, but to win.
Regardless of who takes home the gold on March 27, this year’s ceremony will hopefully mark a return to the extravagance and joy that was largely absent from last year’s toned-down affair. Viewers can expect musical performances from a star-studded lineup of Best Original Song nominees, such as Billie Eilish and Beyoncé. With the ratings of the Oscars ceremony having seen a steep decline in recent years, nothing is off the table as the Academy plans to kick this beloved tradition into high gear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes I fantasize about being Midge Maisel: a beautiful, fashionable, hilarious Jewish woman who is simultaneously put-together and a trainwreck. But while I have related to her in the past, she is becoming less of a fabulous icon and more of a walking stereotype. For the last three seasons, I have loved watching “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” because, clumsy as it is with stereotypes, I have found it to be one of the only truly funny shows that centers Jewish people.
Previously, Midge has shined as a stand-up comic, and the various plot developments, from the Maisel family trip to Steiner resort in season two to Midge’s stint in Las Vegas in season three, have given fans so many memorable moments and laughs. But after three seasons of witty stand-up and endearing chaos, it appears that the show’s quick pace and punchy jokes might be losing steam. The premiere of season four showcases the characters and family dynamics fans have grown to love but stumbles when it comes to delivering comedy beyond mere caricature.
Following the success of shows like “Euphoria” and “Succession” with their weekly release schedules, two episodes of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” are released every Friday. The first episode of season four of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” released on Feb. 18, opens with what can only be described as a “revenge tirade.” Midge (Rachel Brosnahan), clad fabulously (as always) in black, is standing before the microphone at the Gaslight Café delivering yet another angry, slightly unhinged rant-disguised-as-comedy about a man who has wronged her. Fans of the show will appreciate this callback to the iconic scene from the first ever episode of the show — in which Midge hilariously lambasts her husband Joel for his infidelity.
But Midge Maisel is no longer the perky, foul-mouthed housewife of season one. After a brush with international fame at the end of last season that ended in disaster (because, lest the reader forget, Midge effectively outed her boss in front of his entire community), Midge is more demanding; she has become a prima donna of the comedy scene. Her diatribe against Shy Baldwin (LeRoy McClain) delivers many of the same tropes we have come to expect: poking fun at the audience and making obligatory yet crude jokes about Jewishness. The difference is that by season four, it has become much less funny.
“Hello Prague, remember the Jews?” quips Midge right after learning she has been fired from her tour of Europe. In this episode, the viewer is pummeled again and again with one-note one-liners about Jewishness. Midge implies that Klezmer Clarinet would be a good form of torture; Abe Weissman (Tony Shalhoub) tells Midge to work Jesus Christ into every conversation in order to fit in in Prague; Midge works a random joke about “antisemitic Nazis” (as if Nazis could be anything but antisemitic) doing their taxes into a completely unrelated set.
Now don’t get me wrong. Money jokes can be funny, especially when they come from a self-deprecating angle. But when Abe says to two little boys “did you guys bring any money from home? No, I guess I’m paying,” at his grandson’s birthday party, or when Moishe (Kevin Pollak) harps on Midge to repay the loan he gave her while riding a Ferris Wheel at Coney Island, friendly family banter becomes a dig at Jewishness disguised as a joke.
The audience is supposed to find humor in the fact that Moishe lent Midge money, who then tries to repay him with money she entrusted to Susie (Alex Borstein), who has gambled it all away. Susie must then ask Joel (Michael Zegen) to cut her a check so she can give Midge her money to repay Moishe, who is Joel’s father. Not only is it convoluted and confusing (why is Moishe so preoccupied with the money when he lent it to Midge, his ex-daughter-in-law, so recently?), but it plays into harmful stereotypes and tired antisemitic tropes. And crucially, these jokes are simply not funny or interesting.
The momentum of the episode grinds to a halt as the characters bicker over money owed, and since the audience knows none of the characters will ever be in real financial trouble, the whole sequence is gratuitous. This episode seems to loudly reaffirm that Midge is a Jewish-American princess, Moishe is a stingy Jewish factory owner, and that the show will simply continue to tout stereotypes as comedy as the previous seasons have done.
The episode closes with Midge realizing her desire for autonomy in her comedy, but this potentially empowering moment comes across mostly as a display of entitlement and privilege. Having decided that she only wants to say exactly what’s on her mind, Midge insists that Susie, her agent, only set up gigs in which she headlines (“I wanna be me every time I walk on that stage.”) When Susie, ever the pragmatist, responds brusquely “how am I supposed to do that if I can’t even book you?” Midge raises her eyebrows and responds “I don’t know. You’re my manager. Manage me.” Midge’s lifestyle as a beautiful woman who essentially just carouses around Manhattan and buys the latest haute couture is entertaining to observe, but it is dialogue like this that showcases how out-of-touch with reality she truly is. Her journey to become a self-made woman in comedy will be interesting to watch in the following episodes, but only if it starts to show respect towards Susie’s hard work and a check on her narcissism.
Indeed, the premise of Susie and Midge changing the comedy industry has great potential, but only if their motives reach beyond Midge’s personal success. Forthcoming episodes should play up Midge’s comedic talent and leave the antisemitic coding and diva attitude on the cutting room floor. Fans of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel '' can count on a season full of fashion and flair, but whether the season will be worth kvelling over remains to be seen.

As New York City Fashion Week rolled around again, the city’s pedestrians found themselves running into the likes of Solange, Kim Kardashian, or Addison Rae. As celebrities strolled the streets, they showed out and showed off — but what happens when witnesses take the time to think about where these fashion and beauty trends came from? Some light digging would reveal roots in iconic looks from the Black community, specifically around the height of early Hip Hop in the 1990s.
While fashion week is technically about the shows, street style is the real barometer of what fashion royalty is up to. Every year, the same players — the Hadids, Kaia Gerber, and the likes — parade around, both on and off the runway. It’s hard not to notice the thousands of dollars dripping off their clothes and think maybe they’re eccentric or avante garde. The industry still remains incredibly white and restrictive to a very specific body type.
The fashion world has always had an air of exclusivity, but this functions on an even deeper level than is noticeable at first glance: Efforts to exclude the average citizen from high fashion creates an opportunity for erasure of the looks’ histories.
In honor of this year’s fashion week, Vogue published a list called “The 8 Biggest Beauty Trends.” of the season. On this list, you’ll find elaborate themes such as “sooty, deconstructed gazes” featuring “nocturnal” looks, “statement-making ponytails,” “glass-like complexions, and “gravity-defying updos.” Each of these looks — except for the one which explicitly signals to some kind of nefarious quality — features a model of color, but fails to address the context of these statements. The “statement-making ponytail” is just a Black woman with her hair slicked into a low ponytail and “gravity-defying updos” are far from new.
While some may consider this an attempt at granting visibility to oft-ignored aspects of Black style, this kind of thinking doesn’t address who’s getting the credit for a fun new updo on the New York runways. By removing the history of how Black women have worn their hair in various creative and elaborate styles for decades, institutions like Vogue ostracize Black women from the roles of creators completely.
According to Zippia, only 7.5% of fashion designers are Black or African American. Comparatively, white designers make up almost 60% of the designer population. This statistic is staggering not only because it’s so small, but because Black people make up almost 15% of the U.S. population, meaning that fashion has about half the representation in actual creators that it should.
To fully understand how absurd that is, let’s take a quick trip down memory lane. In the 1990s, female rappers like Lil’ Kim, Eve, Missy Elliott, and Queen Latifah represented a spectrum of Black female fashion — ranging from the fabulously colorful and revealing looks of Lil’ Kim to the more androgynous style of Queen Latifah. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but examples that only scratch the surface of the depth and breadth of Black female artists in the ’90s.
Through her clothes, Queen Latifah created a space for queer women in a male-dominated space, not just because she wanted to make a statement, but because her own identity was at stake. Through skin-tight clothing and the bright colors that mainstream fashion would shy away from, artists like Eve and Lil’ Kim took ownership of their sexuality and pioneered the style that we see in female rappers like Nicki Minaj or Latto today (See: Lil’ Kim’s poster for her 1996 album “Hardcore.”
Tragically, it’s hard not to see outfits that Lil’ Kim did earlier and better reflected in the style choices of the likes of Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian. Furthermore, their hair and makeup choices aren’t just inspired by Black trends, but co-opt them. Just last month, Kim came under fire for her Vogue magazine cover, which bared a few too many similarities to Naomi Campbell’s signature slicked long hair and, let's be honest, Black skin. Unsurprisingly, it’s not the first time the Kardashians or other white celebrities have been called out in this way, but maybe deep down society knows they can’t be expected to change because the entirety of their image is entrenched in claiming Black culture. Thanks to this active erasure, mainstream media acts like the Kardashians are the first women in the world to have big butts and be better off for it.
Fashion Week is a microcosm of the effort to detract from the creative capability and reality of Black beauty and fashion. Only when it’s worn by white people and the historical context is removed do these looks become popular in mainstream culture or celebrated as successful. The consequences of this are catastrophic. Black women are not only further excluded from desirability or agency, but they also miss out on the economic gains that accompany their exploitation. It’s far beyond time that Black women are given their due, but in an industry rooted in their marginalization, it’s unclear if this grace will ever be extended.

Showtime’s new docuseries “Everything’s Gonna Be All White” opens with a narrator who speaks of “countless dreams too long deferred,” a reference to Langston Hughes’ 1951 poem “Harlem.” Although the poem and the show both handle racial inequity in the United States, the poem does so gracefully, while the show seems to, in the words of Hughes, “crust and sugar over— / like a syrupy sweet.”
The series premiere, cleverly entitled “White Lies Matter,” indicates that the docuseries will fall short of its claim to serve as a “deep dive” into racism in the United States. If anything, it will serve as a broad overview. “White Lies Matter” has several powerful moments, but its scenes fail to work together as one cohesive entity. With its wide range of subject matters, the episode might benefit someone with little knowledge of racism. However, its lack of depth renders it inconsequential in the greater context of antiracist media. Most disappointingly, distracted by the misguided attempt to incorporate humor, the premiere of “Everything’s Gonna Be All White” forgets to do what a docuseries is meant to do: teach.
The theme of “white lies” is a clever one, but it lacks focus. The episode begins and ends with clips of the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection of the United States Capitol. In between, the narrator and various interviewees discuss “white lies,” the whitewashing of Jesus, the word “Caucasian,” the transatlantic slave trade, the history of white people in America, present-day racism in America, Confederate flags and monuments, the question of American identity, white privilege, white fragility, whiteness in general, and the American flag. If this list seems exhaustive, it should — the episode is exhausting to watch. Throughout the episode, topics are introduced, discussed at a surface level for a few minutes, then quickly abandoned for the next topic. Nothing is fully unpacked or reflected on, and the transitions from one subject to the next feel abrupt. The work as a whole feels disconnected, as the poor transitions and abundance of subjects result in a lack of cohesion. As a result, “White Lies Matter” is both overwhelming and underwhelming. Watching it feels like learning too much at once while learning nothing at all.
Despite its flaws, the premiere of “Everything’s Gonna Be All White” contains several small moments that effectively convey big ideas. The episode is full of quotable remarks from interviewees. On white fragility, musician Himanshu “Heems” Suri asks, “what is fragile about whiteness when everything has been constructed around it?” It also includes simple, creative visuals that evoke scary societal truths. In one sequence, a series of signs appears on the screen one by one with statements like “Negroes can’t own property” and “Negroes can’t have weapons,” just to end on “White folks can.” Still, these small moments may have contributed more significantly to the show’s effectiveness if they were used more tastefully. Unfortunately, the show’s zeal for catchy quotes and flashy visuals goes too far, especially when combined with its weak attempts at comic relief. It is unclear if the audience is meant to chuckle as an outraged white male actor aggressively covers his Jesus statuettes in white paint. Comedic scenes like this one are silly, clunky, and awkward, and they water down the tone of the documentary. Racism is not funny; “White Lies Matter” should not try to be funny either.
“White Lies Matter” is not a promising start to “Everything’s Gonna Be All White.” If the rest of the episodes are similar to the premiere, then the docuseries is unlikely to claim a spot among the ranks of highly impactful antiracist viewing. The episode presents a few compelling elements — for example, the narrator’s casual tone makes the show engaging and accessible — but ultimately suggests that “Everything’s Gonna Be All White” will be highly ambitious but not quite successful in accomplishing its aims.

Locals and tourists alike flock to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum to view a diverse collection of art and beautiful indoor gardens, but the crowd gathered on the afternoon of Feb. 13 was there to attend a Valentine’s Day concert with Peter and Kara Dugan.
The Dugans, a married couple, created a love-themed program as part of the Gardner Museum’s weekend concert series, with Kara as a mezzo-soprano and Peter playing the piano. The sold-out performance, which took place in the museum’s Calderwood Hall, featured songs from the likes of Florence Price, Stevie Wonder, and George Gershwin.
The Dugans participated in the Gardner Museum’s virtual Valentine’s Day program in 2021 when they were invited to record a snippet of a never-before-performed love song composed by Italian composer Francesco Paolo Tosti that was found in Gardner’s collection. As in-person concerts are again in full swing in Boston, the Dugans were invited to perform live this year.
“There’s something really freeing to be on stage and know that it’s just then, it’s just in that moment, and after that it’s a memory. I love that,” said Peter Dugan in an interview with The Crimson.
Kara Dugan explained that at the core of their musicianship and musical collaboration is a philosophy of experimentation with their instruments and a drive to learn new songs while also performing music that they personally love and grew up with.
“I think it's really fun, and for us it's really personal. We had a wide variety of repertoire on the program because we thought that that sort of spoke to us as artists, and because we thought it told a story in a really interesting way” said Kara Dugan. “We like the idea of bringing people in with a lot of variety in our selections.”
The pieces were certainly personal, including “It’s Not Me, It’s You” — a comedic song composed for them by Peter’s brother Leonardo Dugan — and Jimmy Dorsey’s and Paul Madeira’s “I’m Glad There is You” (1941) — the song they danced to at their wedding.
“I think it’s really exciting to have live music again,” said audience member Martina Diekmann. “I really like the mix of the program, it goes into different directions.”
The Dugans often provided context for their songs before performing, contributing to an intimate and engaging stage presence. Kara, perched on a stool, and Peter, looking up from his piano bench, exchanged glances and bantered candidly throughout the performance.
Art was an important part of the Dugans’ pandemic experience. They created music together, performing and recording from their New York apartment. The social justice movements energized during the pandemic had an impact on their performance, which opened with Stevie Wonder’s “If It’s Magic.” Peter explained that it’s important to acknowledge Black musicians as composers.
“Black musicians have probably done more for musical innovation in the past hundred years than anyone else, in terms of music writ large,” he said. “And for that reason I think it’s really important to us to include someone like a Stevie Wonder, or a Charlie Parker.”
Every piece on the program has immense meaning to the Dugans. As a member of WQXR’s inaugural Artist Propulsion Lab, Kara Dugan created a song cycle called “In a New York Minute: Miniatures for Voice and Piano.” Dugan explained that this cycle, comprising five one-minute pieces, was made from poetry submitted to the Gothamist by average New Yorkers. These poems were then set to music by five different women composers.
“If you ask somebody to name a dozen women composers, I think some people might have trouble doing that within the classical repertoire,” said Kara Dugan. “It was important to me to highlight the fact that women were not given the same opportunities, and to help uplift other women in the community, and to support each other, and to create together.”
The joy felt by the Dugans on stage was echoed by the audience. For audience member Sarah F. Williams, the concert marked the beginning stages of a return to live music.
“I was very happy to have art back in my life. To be two years without that, it was something so big missing. And you don’t know what it is till you don’t have it,” said Williams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Feb. 13, Marvel dropped the trailer for “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.” The movie is the next installment in Phase 5, the latest stage in the MCU that deals with the fallout of “Avengers: Endgame” and introduces new characters, and the trailer teases a potentially massive expansion for the Marvel franchise.
The trailer opens with Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) having dreams of vaguely concerning images — a looming staircase, flashes of magic, and general destruction. A great set up for a film in any genre: The protagonist is worried about something. Next, there is the oh-so-clever imagery of the broken watch, referencing Strange’s previous role as keeper of the time stone and his mistakes tampering with timelines. Given previous Marvel films have hinted at the frailty of the timeline, “Multiverse of Madness” will have to be careful to provide believable stakes instead of vaguely gesturing at the potential end of time itself.
Strange is defensive over a voiceover: “I did what I had to do to protect our world.” His assertion could be referring to his actions in “Avengers: Endgame,” in “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” or even how he meddled with the Time Stone way back in “Doctor Strange.” Regardless, it’s clear that Strange will have a lot to answer for. Hopefully, this interior conflict can prompt some character growth that his many cameos throughout other Marvel movies have not shown.
Next, Wong (Benedict Wong) once again warns Strange about the effect his actions could have on the state of the universe. Hopefully he will have a bigger and better role than the vague subordinate who vanishes after one scene, as Wong’s acting and character have been woefully underutilized.
Similar to the scene teased in the last trailer, Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) is seen talking with Strange by a tree. When he asks what she knows about the multiverse, she says Vision described it as “dangerous.” This weak adjective is a massive understatement and completely undercuts the dramatic moment they were clearly going for. Marvel has had a lot of fun with the multiverse — the idea that there are infinite versions of reality where different choices play out — since “Endgame.” While it is an easy way to create content you can mine forever — in “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” Marvel used a variation of this concept to reboot the franchise and retell the same storyline — it does run the risk of feeling stale. After all, if one reality is destroyed, surely it’s possible to just hop over to another. Even in “Endgame,” the Avengers had to beg and borrow from other realities and put them at risk for the sake of their own. Marvel will have its work cut out to make people believe that characters’ actions matter, particularly after they have shown how the multiverse can be exploited to reset any mistakes.
As there apparently must be for any Strange appearance, doors open into impossible places. Strange is taken before some kind of council for his crimes, where Profesor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) appears to be teased as a future character. The choice of Stewart over James McAvoy (who played Professor X in the reboot of the X-Men franchise) is interesting given that he played the part more recently. Yet despite McAvoy’s previous performance, Stewart is the quintessential Professor X. Though the addition of X-Men to the existing MCU could be exciting, it will also open the door to myriad complications. For example, is Wanda a mutant? She is in the comics, but the concept of mutant doesn’t exist in the films thus far, and would certainly complicate the dynamic of the existing superheroes. Also, will Marvel stand by the canon of the Famke Janssen-Jean Grey X-Men movies, the Sophie Turner-Jean Grey X-Men movies, or something else entirely? If this development does enter the fray, hopefully sufficient runtime will be spent on integrating it in a thoughtful way.
After some screaming, a dark version of Strange, which viewers of “What If…?” will recognize, emerges. This is also fitting for his character as seen in the live action films, as Strange has often been his own enemy — this hint at some internal conflict for Strange has the potential to be intriguing or dull.
Wanda also fights someone else with powers, as well as some new characters who appear to be apprentices of Strange. They could be a breath of fresh air to the franchise, as Strange is a difficult and not necessarily well-liked character. Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), from the original “Doctor Strange” film, is an interesting opposition to Strange as he has more experience with the mystic arts and a longer history with the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). However, most viewers will probably need a crash course reminder on who he is.
Later, in conversation with Strange, Wanda says, “You break the rules and become a hero, I do it and I become the enemy.” She makes an excellent point. This indictment could be referring to “Captain America: Civil War” or the events of “WandaVision,” but ultimately shows how Wanda has been consistently blamed for everything that goes wrong around her. It will be interesting to see how “Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness” acknowledges the events of “WandaVision,” as the Marvel movies are already becoming difficult to access and requiring people to watch nine episodes of a show to understand a film that isn’t even about that character is a bit ridiculous. However, “No Way Home” did ask viewers to remember details of seven Spider-Man movies from three different actors to fully appreciate the plot, so perhaps it isn’t so much of a stretch.
Ultimately, the new “Doctor Strange” trailer teases a number of exciting potential developments for the upcoming summer release. Fans will have to wait and see if they can do all these plot threads justice.

Marie Antoinette is an iconic, larger-than-life historical figure who has long embodied the French cultural and social milieu pre-Revolution. I am equally amused, disturbed, and fascinated by the Rococo lifestyle that suffused every aspect of her life at Versailles, characterized by its gross extravagance often verging into tackiness and frivolity. And yet the portraits of Antoinette that emerged at the time are not necessarily characteristic of such elaborate overindulgence. Instead what we have is a refreshing image of a regal, lovely, yet unusually sympathetic lady. One artist in particular can be held responsible: Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun, Marie Antoinette’s court painter and a talented artist with a keen sensitivity to the nuances and quirks of her patrons.
Her portraits are a clear and vivid depiction of Marie’s likeness, featuring delicate pastel colors and showcasing her dainty features. The fact that these images are so widespread has perhaps contributed to our preoccupation and fascination with Marie Antoinette and the surprising but powerful empathy that people feel towards her. Vigée’s works have almost certainly shaped our perception of Antoinette’s cultural identity, laden with regal elegance and youthful vulnerability, especially in contrast to the larger presence of the French Rococo movement.
image id=​​1354555 align=center size=large caption=true
“Rococo” refers to the ornamental and theatrical style of decoration that arose in pre-Revolution France, permeating everything from the elaborate gilded architecture in Versailles to the pastel-hued frivolity of famous artworks like “The Swing.” While Vigée’s portraits feature this exquisite treatment of light, color, and attention to beautiful details, her works also contain elements of naturalism that defy the typical Rococo aesthetic of excessive luxury. Take the portrait “Marie Antoinette with a Rose.” While Marie’s sumptuous skirts and graceful beauty evoke elements of Rococo, the simple naturalism of the scene and her understated, knowing smile create a sense of timeless elegance that transcends the Rococo artistic tradition. Moreover, it demonstrates Vigée’s particular efforts to understand her patron and depict the truest essence of Antoinette’s self.
Vigée herself was known to be charming and pleasant, an easy conversationalist who could draw out the personalities of her patrons in their sittings and was affectionately known as Madame Le Brun at court. She was well-liked with all the people she worked with and was thus able to draw out the best qualities of them in her portraiture. Today, we are gifted with dozens of lovely portraits that bring out the humanity and vulnerability of the French nobles she painted, shaping our perception of their beauty and character.
image id=1354557 align=center size=large caption=true
Yet even as one of the most popular portraitists of her time, she struggled to gain academic recognition for her art. She was rejected several times from the French Academy of Painting and Sculpture mainly because of her gender and her husband’s profession as an art dealer. It was only through Antoinette’s influence that she was finally accepted.
Her application was not a work of portraiture, but instead an allegorical work titled “Peace Bringing Back Abundance.” This work’s sophisticated blending of styles and technical virtuosity are particularly fascinating. The two figures are allegorical representations of peace and abundance. The rosy and fair Abundance is on the left: The flowing drapery, bursting bouquet of fruits, and delicate flowers in her hair highlight her femininity and embody aspects of the Rococo era. Peace, who guides her, is clad in darker colors and decidedly more masculine in appearance. The relative austerity and realism of Peace’s features, as well as the choice of an allegorical classical theme, all lean towards the rising movement of Neoclassicism that was beginning to emerge in Europe. This work skillfully plays on this tension between the decorative and lavish Rococo and the stately and representational Neoclassicism and displays Vigée’s keen awareness of artistic techniques and traditions.
While Vigée had to flee France at the start of the Revolution, she managed to escape with her life and career relatively unscathed. She went on to paint aristocrats in Austria, Germany, Italy, and Russia, and her works were exhibited in the Paris Salons throughout her exile. Her portraits continued to refuse an era or tradition, and her sensitive and empathetic portrayals of high-ranking individuals garnered even more popularity for her works.
image id=1354558 align=center size=large caption=true
Vigée was finally allowed to return to France in 1802, where she continued to produce virtuosic and charming works. “Self-Portrait in a Straw Hat” is one painting that falls within this period of her work, painted in the style of Rubens that indicates Vigée’s study of the Old Masters. This work is executed with great skill and naturalism; the bright colors of the flowers in her hat, lilac dress, and silk shawl light up the canvas and her rosy blush and delicate features lend her character a coyish and fair demeanor. As a painter in the circles of Marie Antoinette and numerous nobles and courtiers, Vigée valued self-image, and this work is a superb example of how she represented her persona as the beautiful and pleasant Madame Le Brun. She appears both elegant and approachable, her lips parted in a faint and knowing smile, and she holds a palette and brushes, emphasizing her role as artist first and foremost.
As the artist who shaped our view of so many aristocrats, “Self Portrait in a Straw Hat” is a rare example of her shrewd and empathetic gaze turned on herself. This work embodies her skill at rendering forms naturally, knowledge of past artistic precedents, synthesis of newer styles, and acute understanding of the subjects she painted. Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun is truly one of the most notable and talented portraitists of all time, and her talent, ambition, and charm paint a portrait of a truly remarkable artist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The world woke up to history last week, rumors of its death again vastly overstated. Russian troops in Eastern Europe, missiles screaming into residential Kyiv, nuclear sable rattling: Conflict is in the air. News about surging refugee flows, miles-long military convoys, and diplomatic failure blasts out of every screen and speaker. Words alone cannot capture the horror, the carnage — or the grief.
War has come to Ukraine.
Our Board has, for years, argued against a variety of wars, and against unilateral aggression like Russia's more specifically. For those times when we, like too many outlets, have been silent, when we have failed to spotlight conflicts with non-white, non-Christian victims, we apologize. But in Ukraine, like almost two decades ago in Iraq, our opposition to the conflict is — must be — unambiguous.
The effects of Russia's most recent aggression won't be confined to Ukraine's (rightful, breached) national borders. As the invasion presses on, lives are at risk, even in our community. Some of our Ukrainian and Eastern European classmates might simply have nowhere to return to this summer; their families may be forced to flee the country, if they are not struggling to do so already. For those Russian students who, like thousands across their country, bravely choose to speak out against the conflict publically, going home could soon prove similarly unfeasible, if for markedly different reasons.
All of them — every affiliate at risk of becoming another casualty of the meaningless bloodshed — deserve tangible support from our community. That means, first and foremost, ensuring their physical safety. We call on Harvard to provide legal and financial support to any affiliates and their families who are compelled to remain in or flee to the United States, flexing its lobbying power for good. That may include securing visa extensions and summer housing. In the worst case, it may mean supporting claims for asylum. It’s crucial to take these actions immediately, not just to meet the urgency of the crisis but to provide a rare point of stability in the lives of those affected — a respite from a shattering world.
The war will be felt most acutely by those who lose their lives or their loved ones, but its costs will be spread even more broadly. Many will lose their homes, jobs, and meaningful possessions, or be forced to abandon them amid the violence. Ukraine’s currency has hit a seven-year low, and the country will likely take years to recover. Harvard should immediately make emergency expanded financial aid available to students whose situations have changed, perhaps drastically, because of the war. In the face of chaos and uncertainty, the administration’s generosity could have a material impact on those students’ lives.
The rest of us, those who feel too powerless but also too angry to remain unmoved, can contribute in smaller ways. Professors should provide flexibility to those affected, showing understanding commensurate with the situation’s exceptional gravity. We, as students, should make clear that we are here for our friends and classmates who follow news updates with a dread more heavy and concrete than our generalized concern.
We are heartened by the early outpouring of support for Ukraine: Over the past week, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the Yard, and spontaneous get-togethers organized on class GroupMes helped spark an organic, impactful if not at first visible, community response. Harvard itself shouldn’t lag behind. Though less pressing an issue than ensuring visas and increasing aid, the administration, chiefly University President Lawrence S. Bacow, should continue to express their support for impacted affiliates, and do so as publicly and categorically as possible. Harvard’s solidarity, much like our own, will not change the grisly nature of the conflict — but it might just make our peers feel slightly less alone.
A whole new host of our affiliates will now have the reality of war at home looming over them for the foreseeable future, forced to keep pushing through their courses and extracurriculars as if their homeland or their loved ones’ safety were not at imminent risk. As a community and an institution, the least we can do is offer them unusual support for these unusual times.

For years, the Harvard Kennedy School’s flagship policy design course has asked students to write a plan to resume offshore drilling after the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010, in which a British Petroleum rig spewed four million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This past fall, one student noted the economic and environmental risks posed by the continued recklessness of the fossil fuel industry and instead suggested that the moratorium be extended.
Their professor was more concerned that they hadn’t followed the prompt.
The professor’s response was unsurprising to me. As an HKS student, I am accustomed to a classroom experience that reflects the influence of the fossil fuel industry on campus. Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard recently brought the scale of this influence to light in a report (which I helped to write) that documented how oil and gas companies fund research and programming at multiple Harvard schools and lure faculty members to board seats and consulting projects.
For example: BP has funded the aforementioned professor’s research.
HKS is awash in fossil fuel money. HKS has touted taking over $1 million from Shell. The two research centers that house most of the school’s climate work — the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government — are endowed by fossil fuel fortunes. The Harvard Environmental Economics Program is funded by both BP and Shell. The Corporate Responsibility Initiative is funded by ExxonMobil and Chevron.
This influence shapes the intellectual life of the school. I had one classmate who attended a lecture by a well-known professor with both consulting and funding ties to the fossil fuel industry. When this student mentioned the climate impact of the growth of natural gas over the last decade and a half, the professor shut down the comment and dismissed them as a mere ideologue.
Situations like this are part of a longstanding trend of the industry trying to capture academia in order to shape public opinion and serve its bottom line. An industry playbook on this strategy reads: “A regulated firm or industry should be prepared whenever possible to coopt [the] experts” by “hiring them as consultants or advisors, or giving them research grants and the like,” noting that the “experts themselves must not recognize that they have lost their objectivity and freedom of action.”
I want to be clear: The point here is not to pillory any individual actor. For better or worse, fossil fuel companies have been the engine of the global economy for decades. The Kennedy School both cannot and should not blacklist community members with ties to the industry in an attempt at purity. The point is to illustrate the continued reach of the industry’s influence and the necessity of taking what steps we can to limit it.
The administration’s response to this criticism might be that the Kennedy School prizes engagement with the world — one of the school’s taglines — over an attempt at moral purity. To which my question would be: Engagement with whom, exactly?
Who gets engaged in the classroom, and who doesn’t? One of my professors, who received a multi-million dollar grant from BP, mocked the idea of protesting new fossil fuel infrastructure. That’s only laughable because, while BP can buy their way in the door, the Indigenous nations who have their treaty rights violated by unwanted pipelines get frozen out of the halls of power.
We will not be engaging with the African migrants who flee their homelands only to huddle in prison camps on the fringes of Europe, or the Guatemalan farmers who see their yields collapse in the face of unrelenting heat and drought, or even the Gulf Coast fishermen who will never see their livelihoods recover as the oceans now turn to acid in the aftermath of BP’s crimes.
As long as we continue to have a model of engagement in which we allow money to talk, we’ll only be engaging with the people who carry enough untapped carbon on their balance sheets to turn our planet into hell.
Let’s be honest about what the stakes are here. The fossil fuel industry has known about the scale of the crisis, in apocalyptic detail, for more than four decades. Instead of taking steps to address the crisis, industry leaders purchased influence in government, academia, and the media in order to lie, confuse, and delay. Now, as we stand on the brink of the utter destabilization of life on our planet, they continue their time-tested strategies.
At this point, the climate crisis is personal for so many of us. In just the last year, I’ve learned what it feels like to be too hot to think in the midst of an unprecedented heat wave. I’ve choked on wildfire smoke mixed with the rotting stench of a dying river. I’ve seen my sacred mountains go up in flames as my ancestral homelands on two different continents were destroyed by the floods and mudslides of an increasingly hostile planet.
So as a student at the Kennedy School, I cannot help but feel that we are failing to do all we can to face the climate crisis. As both President Lawrence S. Bacow and HKS Dean Doug W. Elmendorf noted in emails last semester, Harvard’s biggest impact comes through its research and teaching. For too long, that research has been up for sale, and found eager buyers in the fossil fuel industry. It’s time to say: no more.

“There were several men in my family, who were very closely related to me that had ADHD and dyslexia, but they were like, ‘You're smart.’” Alyx Britton ’21, who realized they had ADHD in Spring 2020, told me on our call together.
“I was never evaluated for autism because my doctors always saw me as this miracle case of this person with my medical condition, tuberous sclerosis, who did well in school and didn't experience a lot of the severe symptoms that a lot of people with this disease experienced.” Kendall Shields ’24 explained. It was here at Harvard that she began connecting with other autistic and neurodiverse students on campus and related to their experiences.
Teachers “would all see the surface of me needing to study and me being obsessed with habits of being a workaholic.” Anna Roodnitsky, Dartmouth ‘25, continues, “They almost bullied me,” adding, “they would be like, ‘Well in high school, I was lazy and whatnot, you should just be lazy.’ It's like I was hearing the wrong things.” Now, as a college student, she’s finding out that she likely has dyslexia and ADHD.
“You work at this English newspaper, you do the military — there is no way you’re ADHD. So just don't waste your time and money on this.” Seo “Ryu” Ryu, Ewha Womans University ’23, self-diagnosed with ADHD, was told by her psychiatrist.
See a pattern? They’re all quotes from people who were “too smart,” “too hardworking,” “too high achieving” to be evaluated for neurodiversity or even recognized as neurodivergent.
I’ve been very open about having ADHD and anxiety and committed to authentically being who I am, but even so, I still wonder if others truly recognize that I’m neurodivergent beyond me simply telling them.
Often, it feels like people don’t recognize or understand my ADHD until I mess up, upon which my ADHD has suddenly proven itself as the “bad thing” everyone thinks it out to be. I still wonder where the line is between being acknowledged as having ADHD while not being seen as lazy, messy, and incompetent — the success dilemma if you will.
Of course, there is immense privilege to be writing this behind Harvard’s walls or to even have the option of not being seen as neurodivergent and escape significant overt ableism, considering the stigma associated with neurodiversity. Even still, the success dilemma is problematic — at its core, it solidifies the neurodiversity umbrella as one of undesirability. In reality, it’s an “as is” state with its own ups and downs that are critically and fundamentally part of me. Moreover, it erases the legitimate and valid struggles that those who are seen to be “successful” face.
I think about this dilemma a lot because of the countless experiences I’ve had and the stories shared by other neurodivergent folk. Due to our perceived success, neurodiversity was a precluded identity. It’s one form of casual ableism, a form fundamentally says that you can’t be “insert positive trait” and neurodivergent, though that’s far from the case.
Casual ableism is a topic that I’ve touched on in my previous columns, given its tangible and sweeping effects on neurodivergent experiences. However, I’ve always addressed it from the first-person perspective, and this week, I want this piece to be about you.
I want it to be about how you can make the world a better place for us and for everyone.
Daniel Wainstock, PUC-Rio ’23 and exchange student at George Washington University, has been researching the impacts of casual ableism and microaggressions on the mental health of d/Deaf individuals. He provided an example of what casual ableism may look like: “A student that walked with her service dog because she is blind– she walked with her service dog in one of the classes, and the professor told that the dog wasn’t allowed in the class, and she has to go out.”
Towards neurodiversity, casual ableism takes a number of forms. For example, it may look like assuming we’re too smart or hardworking to be neurodivergent, as discussed in other pieces, or, in contrast, it may take the form of infantilizing and speaking over neurodivergent people. Basically, it’s subtle invalidations of who we are. It’s rewriting my own narrative.
But to you, you reading this, if you have the privilege of the time, space, and energy to learn about ableism, you have a responsibility to combat it, blatant or casual. Even if it’s not a personally directed microaggression, unwelcoming and invalidating language is everywhere, from self-deprecating “kms” and death jokes to ableist slurs.
As Wainstock advises, “You can learn the history, read the basics, you can read articles and books written by people of color and by people with disabilities.” He continues, “You can acknowledge that you were raised in an educational system in assistance to a society that has laws and policies that only benefit oppression and power, and you can do whatever is possible to try and change it.”
In doing so, you’ll be able to reflect on the ways you may be excluding the people around you, subtly and overtly undermining and invalidating their life experiences and identities. It’s the first step towards centering and creating space for others.

Want to see a therapist at Harvard?
You may have to wait a while.
With demand for mental health care soaring nationwide, Harvard University Health Services is in the process of hiring additional clinicians, administrators said last month. But the wait time for new patients to get a therapy appointment with Counseling and Mental Health Services is currently around six weeks long, according to Barbara Lewis, the chief of CAMHS.
Lewis said in an interview the current wait times are “not ideal” given that the semester is only 14 weeks long. She pointed to alternative mental health services CAMHS offers, however, including a 24/7 hotline the school launched last August and urgent care options.
Around 3,200 students had clinical appointments with CAMHS last fall, per Lewis — a figure that does not include urgent care, CAMHS workshops and groups, or the CAMHS hotline. The hotline, which allows affiliates to receive immediate support from licensed therapists, has received more than 1,600 calls since its launch, Lewis said. Students can also get same-day urgent care appointments on business days by calling CAMHS.
CAMHS currently employs 36 clinicians and is searching for more, Lewis wrote in a February email — up from the 32 last fall, but a net decrease from 2018 when it employed 41.
“Through the pandemic, a lot of staff decided to either retire or go into private practice, or do something else,” Lewis said. “We’ve had a lot of turnover.”
Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, therapists have seen greater demand nationwide. According to an August 2021 report from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 percent of adults struggle with mental health or substance abuse disorders.
“It’s practically impossible to get a therapist these days,” Nguyen said in the same interview last month. “We’ve seen a lot of folks who have felt like they need to back away from doing that line of work because it’s so difficult — and, in particular, on Zoom.”
CAMHS launched a committee in October to examine and model access to mental health care at Harvard following a recommendation put forth by a 2020 mental health task force convened by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. The group, which consists of around 15 members, meets once per month.
“We are looking at both our model of care — sort of an overall view of CAMHS — and thinking about what we should be providing, what we can provide,” Lewis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will allow faculty members to teach without a face mask beginning later this week, a first step toward rolling back its Covid-19 guidelines as cases plummet in the Greater Boston area.
The announcement comes following new guidance from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Massachusetts saying that most healthy, fully vaccinated individuals no longer need to wear masks indoors. The City of Cambridge announced last week that it would lift its indoor mask mandate in mid-March.
“Despite increased infections in January compared with the Fall semester, recent cases have largely been mild thanks to our community’s high vaccination and booster rate,” University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an email to all Harvard affiliates Monday morning.
Harvard has not yet announced any changes to its own indoor mask requirement — but Nguyen hinted on Monday that the school might do so soon.
“We will be updating our campus guidance in the coming days, and will announce any changes to our masking requirement before March 13,” he wrote.
As of March 3, each of Harvard’s 11 schools can set its own guidelines about instructor masking. Under University guidelines, the schools may allow instructors who are fully vaccinated and boosted to unmask. Only one instructor at a time can unmask in a classroom.
Just over an hour after the new University policy was announced, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay stated in an email to faculty that the FAS would allow vaccinated instructors to teach maskless.
Eligible instructors must have no symptoms of Covid-19 or recent close contact with an infected individual and must meet testing requirements. They are also required to inform their students ahead of time that they will lecture unmasked, Gay wrote.
“This change in policy marks another important step towards reclaiming our in-person, campus-based mission, in some ways the biggest we’ve taken as a community since we made the choice to pursue in-person instruction in the fall,” Gay wrote in the email.
Under the new guidelines, eligible instructors must maintain at least a six-foot distance from their students at all times during lecture.
Harvard’s campus saw 204 new cases last week — up from 153 the week prior. However, its positivity rate remains far below what it was at the peak of the Omicron surge in early January when the school recorded 976 cases in a single week.
“The option of unmasked teaching is appropriate to the campus conditions we are seeing now,” Gay wrote Monday. “I am confident that we can move forward while continuing to maintain a safe environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Council convened Sunday for its weekly general meeting and passed five pieces of legislation, including plans to renew its summer storage program.
The legislation, sponsored by Lowell House Representative and Social and Residential Life Chair David Y. Zhang ’23 and Pforzheimer House Representative Lisa R. Mathew ’24, plans to restore the Council’s summer storage program with Five Star Movers for 2022, allocating $15,600 in funding. The Council has previously partnered with the company to financially assist students who need to store belongings, accommodating 500 students last year.
The proposal to renew the program comes as the UC faces an internal audit, led by a team from Harvard Risk Management and Audit Services.
“Part of the reason why we're doing this internal audit record right now is because there were some concerns about financial mismanagement, about the storage program that we conducted over the summer,” UC Secretary Jane J. Oh ’24 said.
Zhang said the audit has not found evidence of mismanagement in the program that spanned from May to August 2021. Rather, the concerns stem from an additional program during the last two weeks of the summer geared towards students conducting research on campus at the time, he said.
“That ran starting July just because we didn't realize that Harvard did not provide the research students the two weeks of room that they needed to stay on campus and so they were kicked off and brought back in two weeks,” Zhang said.
After the UC debated several proposed amendments to the bill, Eliot House Representative Ryan P. McCarthy ’24 spoke in defense of legislation, noting he saved several hundred dollars through the storage program.
“I’m the guy who never votes to spend money because, as evidenced, we spend our time twiddling our thumbs doing government cosplay.” McCarthy added. “I support this because it actually helps students.”
The UC also passed three pieces of legislation aimed at providing funds for student organizations.
The first — sponsored by UC Finance Chair Daniella M. Berrospi ’24 — allocates nearly $11,000 in funding for more than 30 clubs. Also backed by Berrospi, the second grants Harvard Primus just under $9,000 to host a black tie formal event “dedicated to highlighting our Harvard's FGLI students.”
Cabot House Representative Brooke L. Livingston ’23 sponsored a piece of legislation that will allocate $3,000 to Queer Students and Allies and the Harvard College Office of BGLTQ Student Life to support transgender students seeking gender-reaffirming clothing and legal name changes.
A fourth piece of legislation, sponsored by Dunster House Representative Samuel H. Taylor ’24 and passed without amendments by the Council, recommended student group COMPBIO to be recognized as a student organization by the Committee on Student Life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a national move away from standardized testing amid the pandemic, experts from the Harvard Graduate School of Education are divided over the future of testing in college admissions and K-12 education.
After initially lifting its testing requirement in June 2020 due to Covid-19, Harvard announced in December 2021 it would allow applicants through the Class of 2030 to forgo ACT and SAT score submissions.
The move comes amid a trend toward test-optional or test-blind admissions, with colleges across the country, such as the University of California system, taking similar measures. The College Board also decided in 2021 it would permanently discontinue its SAT subject tests, as well as the SAT essay component.
Education experts are divided on whether the changes would move the college admissions process towards equity or away from it.
HGSE graduate Toby N. Romer ’94, who is the assistant superintendent of Newton Public Schools, noted that the shift away from standardized testing may “level the playing field” among high school students.
“In fact, the college admissions testing industry was created to disadvantage certain groups of students intentionally,” he said. “So moving away from that is nothing but good news.”
Romer added he believes “a diverse cross section” of students within Newton Public Schools have benefited from test-optional or test-blind policies.
“I think there’s not a lot of good data to show that college admissions tests have been a good predictor of student success at selective colleges,” he said.
But two HGSE professors pointed out that a lack of standardized test scores will lead admissions officers to place more emphasis on other parts of the application.
HGSE professor Andrew D. Ho said a student’s letters of recommendation, personal essays, extracurriculars, and academic record may be weighed more heavily in the absence of test scores.
“If you imagine a five-legged stool, or a five-legged table, and you take out one of the legs, well then, everything just rests on the remaining four,” he said.
HGSE professor Thomas J. Kane said other application components, such as extracurriculars, may result in more inequity and depend heavily on the resources available to students. He added elite high schools may be able to provide more opportunities for student leadership positions.
“Even though SAT scores are correlated with family background, family income, they may be less correlated with family background than some of these other measures that colleges would have to rely on in a world with no test scores,” Kane said.
The debate over the future of standardized testing extends beyond the college admissions process. The effects of Covid-19 on learning loss in elementary and middle schools remain somewhat unknown, creating a demand from educators and government officials for testing data.
“There is a continuing need to have some sort of comparative indicators that tell policymakers – and taxpayers for that matter – whether or not students in different districts across the state are learning at a level that prepares them to enter society as workers and citizens successfully,” HGSE professor Paul Reville said.
Reville also said the costs of scrapping standardized testing altogether could impact underprivileged students heavily, pointing to “horribly inequitable outcomes” before schools began administering standardized tests.
“We know who loses in that,” he said. “Poor kids lose. Special needs kids lose. English language learners lose. Students of color lose.”
Despite the potential pitfalls of revising current standardized testing practices, Ho said he was optimistic about its future.
“I do think this reckoning for educational testing will, on average, improve equity in education,” he said. “But it will take a long time, and meantime, results will vary.”

Nika Rudenko ’24, a sophomore from Ukraine, said hearing about her family's experiences abroad while trying to keep up with her academics has been “distressful”.
“My brother wanted to walk his dog with his son, and they were in the park when they saw nearly 30 military Russian jets flying over them,” she said. “Because there is a strategic point near the house where they live, they started bombing that military airport, and my brother was forced to cover his son with his body and just hide in that park for about an hour and a half."
Like Rudenko, other Ukrainian students on Harvard’s campus have struggled to process the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, five days after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded the country.
Calling the situation “devastating,” Yegor Tverdokhlibov ’25 — whose parents and sister are currently in Ukraine — said he has not been able to fully focus on his academic responsibilities since the conflict began last Thursday.
“It’s been four days since I stopped doing anything,” he said. “I could not concentrate on work.”
Tverdokhlibov added he faces an “imbalance” trying to stay on track with his academics as a student while maintaining a commitment to his country as a Ukrainian.
“I'm torn apart because I also want to help my country,” Tverdokhlibov said. “I don’t want to feel helpless — I want to feel like I’m supporting my people there.”
Other students have also expressed similar worries about staying on top of their schoolwork while keeping up with their families in the line of fire.
“I’m alone, and I have to deal with so many things right now, considering that my family is still there,” Rudenko said. "I also have to think about my academics.”
Though Natalka A. Bowley ’23 hails from Canada, she has many friends and extended family members still in Ukraine.
Bowley said she has experienced a mix of “numbness,” “anger,” and “sadness” about the situation as she receives news updates on the conflict.
“I saw pictures of my friend’s house being bombed, and it’s just completely unbelievable,” Bowley said.
Bowley added that while she worries when her family members in Ukraine lose touch, she understands that their priorities are to stay safe.
“Sometimes people will go offline for a really long time,” she said. “Talking to us about how they’re doing isn’t necessarily their greatest priority — it’ll be hiding or getting food, or something else, and they won’t keep in touch.”
Georgiy A. Kent ’22 also said he was “saddened but not surprised” by the invasion and concerned for the safety of his friends and family, including his mother and sister, who fled from Ukraine to Poland at the onset of the invasion.
Kent is currently writing his senior thesis on Russia’s forcible annexation of Crimea but added that Russia’s invasion has actually forced him to change course on his thesis.
“I’m two weeks away from my deadline, and they decide to invade the freaking country,” Kent said. “I’m operating under the assumption that Russia has not launched a full-scale, conventional assault on the entirety of the country.”
On Monday, the University President Lawrence S. Bacow gave opening remarks at a panel co-sponsored by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies and the Ukrainian Research Institute. He condemned Putin’s “deplorable actions” and “wanton aggression” and spoke in support of Ukraine.
“Harvard will continue to support in whatever ways we can members of our community who face grave uncertainty,” Bacow said. “We will continue to share knowledge of Ukraine and advance understanding of its culture, history, and language.”
On Monday, Harvard hung a Ukrainian flag on University Hall in solidarity with Ukraine.
“Today the Ukrainian flag flies over Harvard Yard,” Bacow said. “Harvard University stands with the people of Ukraine.”
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana also condemned the invasion in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
“The effects of these egregious attacks have already had a profound impact on people worldwide, including members of our community,” Khurana said. “I deplore this violence and the human cost of such aggression, and I stand in support of our community members at Harvard, Ukraine, and around the world.”

A collaborative storefront between a yoga studio and a cafe opened in Harvard Square on Tuesday, offering meditation, massages, and meals at its location on John F. Kennedy Street.
The Wellness Collaborative is the first store to open out of a partnership between Life Alive Organic Cafe and Down Under Yoga Studio, though both companies have multiple independent locations in Massachusetts. The businesses plan to open a second collaborative in Boston’s South End in May.
Life Alive CEO Bryan C. Timko said he hopes the collaboration will offer consumers a “third place” to spend time, in addition to their homes and workplaces.
“We’ve really taken the time to work on creating a space that’s very special, space that lifts you up and calms you down at the same time — a space that makes you feel at home and makes you feel welcome,” he said.
Both businesses opened in 2004. The partnership between the two companies came about “in a pretty natural way,” Down Under owner Justine Wiltshire Cohen said.
Cohen said she often patronized Life Alive after yoga classes and eventually began recommending the cafe to her students.
Cohen currently operates three other Down Under locations in the Boston area. In the fall, Cohen faced public scrutiny when the Boston Globe reported that ex-employees had accused her of creating a toxic work environment and berating staff members. After public complaints from dozens of former employees, Cohen did away with a noncompete clause that previously kept ex-employees from teaching at other studios within a year of their departure from Down Under, according to the Globe.
Timko, a Harvard Business School alum, previously served as an executive at Staples and Panera Bread, according to his LinkedIn profile. He took over as CEO of Live Alive in 2019.
The collaborative is “rooted in the fact that we believe that how you eat, move, and think affects how you feel,” Timko said.
“We hear from our guests, for example, that they feel better after coming here to eat with us,” he said. “We were missing ‘the move’ and that’s where Down Under comes into the mix.”
Life Alive Culinary Director Leah Dubois said the cafe’s menu focuses on “positive eating.”
“We’re committed to sourcing organic vegetables and fruits and whole grains,” she said.
The Wellness Collaborative says it is also offering an eight-week “happiness sabbatical,” featuring free food from the cafe, unlimited yoga classes, other wellness advice, and a $2,500 stipend for participants.
“We’re giving people the opportunity for two months to just deep dive into their own wellness,” Cohen said. “I think of it as a series of doorways for them to choose what to walk through. So it’s unlimited yoga for two months, it’s nutrition counseling, and it’s gorgeous, nourishing, Life Alive.”
According to Cohen, the sabbatical program received over 300 applications.
Timko said the collaborative, which plans to provide yoga discounts to Harvard affiliates, was drawn to Harvard Square because of its “energy.”
“There’s a vibrancy here that is sort of unmatched,” he said.

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the Wellness Collaborative plans to open a second location in Boston’s South End in March. In fact, the collaborative plans to open its second location in May.

Following years of activism calling for more instruction on race at the Harvard Kennedy School and the murder of George Floyd, HKS added a race and racism requirement to its Master’s of Public Policy program in 2020.
The new requirement has been a “huge step forward,” according to HKS professor Khalil G. Muhammad. In the fall, HKS expanded the requirement from a two-week-long intensive module to two half-semester courses.
But students say the Kennedy School has failed to provide sufficient institutional support for one of the requirement’s two flagship courses, “Race and Racism in the Making of the United States as a Global Power,” taught by Muhammad.
The second course included in the requirement — a six-week class focused on policy — splits students into four sections, each taught by a different professor. Muhammad teaches the first 240-person course alone.
Ketaki S. Zodgekar, a first-year MPP student, said the class was “pretty under-resourced” compared to other mandatory courses at the Kennedy School.
“It was pretty notable that one professor — Professor Muhammad — was responsible for 240 students taking this course for the first time,” she said. “My perception was that there wasn’t enough support for the course from HKS administration.”
Adam D. Schutzman, a course assistant, said being responsible for an entire cohort of students was challenging for Muhammad.
“It’s a large burden to put on one professor for a course that’s supposed to be fully part of the curriculum,” he said.
Unlike other courses in the program's core curriculum, Muhammad’s course met in person only once a week, with its lectures held virtually.
First-year MPP student Brittney J. Vevaina said it was “extremely unfortunate” the course had fewer in-person sessions than other mandatory classes.
“Given both the importance of starting a new class on this topic that was gravely needed at the Kennedy School, but also recognizing the sensitivity of the material, I think you really need to get support for both students to process it [and] have conversations,” she said. “And that was something that we had little of.”
Erick Boone, another course assistant, said he thinks if the class held lectures in-person, it could have brought in other professors.
“I think that would be a good space or opportunity for maybe additional faculty to come in, just so that the onus doesn’t fall squarely and uniquely on Professor Muhammad,” Boone said.
Muhammad said part of the reason the course seemed under-resourced to students was a dearth of other faculty members who are qualified to teach it.
“The problem is really a faculty problem,” Muhammad said.
Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith wrote in a statement Monday that HKS “has worked hard over the past two years to establish an effective required course on race and public policy for our MPP students.”
“We pay close attention to student feedback, and we look forward to continuing to strengthen this and related offerings as part of our stated commitment to take concerted action on diversity, equity, and anti-racism,” he wrote.
Muhammad said HKS has made “huge progress” over the six years he has taught at the school.
“The fact that the entire MPP cohort, for two years now, has had this course — in whatever form it’s taken — is a huge step forward and a huge benefit to their education,” he said.
Still, Muhammad said it is “obvious” more faculty need to be hired who have the expertise to teach the class.
“If I go on leave, then they’ll have to find someone to teach the first part of it," he said.
“They might disagree and say they think someone else can teach it,” he added. “I beg to differ.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Housing Day is set to take place in-person for the first time since 2019 — but the tradition appears unlikely to return to its pre-pandemic norm.
The College has circulated two Housing Day proposals among undergraduate House Committee chairs in recent days, according to communications obtained by The Crimson. One proposal would move festivities entirely outdoors and the other would allow for a modified dorm storm.
Housing Day is an annual tradition during which freshmen get assigned to one of Harvard’s 12 upperclassman Houses or the Dudley Co-Op. The festivities have been held virtually for the past two years due to the pandemic. This year, the DSO has been working with HoCo members to modify Housing Day’s traditions to adhere to Covid-19 guidelines.
“The Dean of Students Office is continuing to work closely with the House Committees and First-Year Experience on plans for Housing Day,” Harvard College spokesperson Aaron Goldman wrote in a statement Monday night. “Details of what to expect will be shared with students this week. We are excited to celebrate this special event with in-person programming for the first time since 2019.”
Last Wednesday, four HoCo representatives joined administrators from the First-Year Experience Office, Harvard University Health Services, and Environmental Health and Safety to discuss two potential proposals for the pandemic-era in-person Housing Day. HoCo chairs then voted on the two proposals, per an email the DSO sent to HoCo chairs that was obtained by The Crimson, but the results of the election have not yet been revealed.
In 2020, Housing Day was postponed and eventually moved online as the College sent undergraduates home due to the pandemic.
Prior to Covid, Housing Day consisted of upperclassmen congregating in Harvard Yard, carrying signs, and awaiting the signal of a gong at 8:30 a.m. HoCo chairs distributed letters containing the names of freshmen to upperclassmen of the same House. Groups of upperclassmen then “stormed” the freshman dorms to notify blocking groups of their placement and welcome them to their House.
Under the first proposal being considered by the College, the dorm storming tradition would take place entirely outside. Under the plan, freshmen would receive a message directing them to a specific area in Harvard Yard, while upperclassman students gather around the John Harvard statue.
At 8:30 a.m., administrators would notify HoCo chairs of the freshmen’s locations. By 9 a.m., the upperclassmen would storm their assigned locations in the Yard to notify the freshmen of their housing assignment.
The DSO’s proposal advises upperclassmen to “represent their Houses appropriately” while approaching the freshmen. In past years, upperclassmen from river houses have carried signs or worn the merchandise of houses in the oft-undesired Radcliffe Quadrangle while storming dorms in order to prank unsuspecting freshmen.
The second proposal is a revised version of traditional dorm storming that would allow three-person "dorm-storming teams" representing each house to storm freshmen entryways, one at a time. In a break from tradition, though, the groups would be prohibited from entering rooms and instructed to celebrate with freshmen in their hallways — for a maximum of five minutes.
Last Thursday, Director of Residential Programs Charnele S. Luster emailed the two proposals to HoCos chairs asking them to vote for the plan they preferred. The election closed Monday at 9 a.m.
Dunster House HoCo Chair Miyu Imai ’23 said it has been challenging to plan for Housing Day festivities with the morning plans still in limbo.
“We’re kind of making a broad outline with both options in mind,” she said. “We've been planning everything else, but not exactly how to do either the dorm storming or the outdoor option.”
Regardless of which plan is selected, the afternoon and evening festivities remain similar to pre-pandemic times. After students receive their assignments, upperclassmen will line the path outside Annenberg Hall at tables adorned with decorations and merchandise. In past years, the celebration took place inside Annenberg.
In the evening, houses are permitted to host their usual in-person events, including steins and community dinners, so long as they adhere to University Covid-19 guidelines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s squash team has been on a mission this season to solidify Cambridge, Mass. as the epicenter of squash in the country. And this weekend, it succeeded in doing just that by taking home a national title for the seventh consecutive season.
After an exhilarating win last weekend for the Crimson in men’s team nationals, the pressure was on for the No. 1 Harvard women (15-0, 7-0 Ivy League) to close out the season on the highest note possible for team college squash: winning the Howe Cup.
The Crimson have tasted Howe Cup glory many times before, having won six consecutive College Squash Association (CSA) titles prior to this season and 20 championships overall. But whether it was the enticing thought of breaking the CSA record for most championships in a row, or the fiery energy of a home crowd at the Murr Center, Harvard competed all weekend with vigor.
CSA team nationals action started Fridayas the Crimson played host to a fellow Ancient Eight challenger, No. 8 University of Pennsylvania (9-9, 2-4 Ivy League), in the quarterfinals. The last encounter between these two teams on Jan. 15 saw Harvard power its way to a dominant 8-1 win.
The Crimson looked to set the tone of the weekend right away. Harvard did just that, sealing the first two matches in straight sweeps from junior Evie Coxon and first-year Amira Singh. The Crimson had even tidied up its play relative to the January match, only dropping three games to Penn and refusing to concede a single match to secure a semifinal berth, 9-0.
Harvard met up with a familiar foe in the semifinals on Saturday, battling yet another Ivy challenger, No. 4 Yale (7-6, 4-3 Ivy). The Crimson had previously beaten Yale 7-2 in their Ivy League-clinching performance on Jan. 30, dropping two tight sets near the end of the game.
Just as it did against the Quakers, Harvard bettered its performance for the Howe Cup. The Crimson tactically dismantled the Bulldogs’ defensive play with acute shots to the corners.
First-year Habiba Eldafrawy opened the charge, taking her match three games to none, and giving up just 10 points total throughout the match.
“I was working on some aspects of my game before the championship, so I was happy to see that improvement in my game,”  the Cairo, Egypt, native said.
Even though Harvard went undefeated in the regular season, there were noticeable improvements in its play in the tournament, particularly in late, low-point differential game situations. Of games claimed by just two points, The Crimson managed to secure all but one, indicative of its exceptional ability to perform under pressure.
Senior captain Hana Moataz was one such player who had a particularly strong performance against Yale. Against the Bulldogs, Moataz swept her opponent to secure the fifth team point, the win, and a spot in the finals.
On Sunday, the Murr Center was buzzing with fans clad in Crimson.
“The energy was indescribable. Everyone came out to cheer us on and we felt the support,” Eldafrawy explained.
Harvard was scheduled to take on No. 6 Drexel (16-5) in a bid to defend its national title at home.
The expectations of the entire season all led to this final matchup: the Crimson had been favored all season to claim the tournament, having won 97 consecutive CSA matches.
“We approached the weekend one match at a time. The team was so focused throughout the weekend to produce to the best of their abilities,” said Eldafrawy of the possibility of getting distracted by the stakes of the game.
Harvard, no stranger to championship games, managed the pressure from the opening serve and cruised to victory.
Moataz stepped onto the court hoping to lead her team to another title, and decided to lead by example. Multiple athletic lunge-backhands broke down her opponent as Moataz skillfully claimed the victory and the Crimson’s first team point.
Sophomore Serena Daniel and first-year Brecon Welch, down 2-0 and 2-1 respectively, both powered through to claim victories in five games, firing up the home crowd and pushing the Crimson’s team point total to three.
Harvard’s young corps, including but not limited to Daniel, Welch and Eldafrawy showed up big this tournament, exhibiting proficiency under pressure belying their lack of CSA experience.
Eldafrawy put it simply: “We felt responsible to continue the streak.”
Eldafrawy was referring to the streak of six consecutive Howe Cup victories for the Crimson, and Welch’s and Daniel’s victories put the seventh at an arm’s length.
A sweep from sophomore Maria Stefanoni set Coxon up for a chance to win it all. After trading games with the Dragons’ Brooke Herring and pushing the crowd to the edge of their seats, Coxon delivered with an 11-5 win in the fifth game of the fifth match.
The Murr Center erupted, with fans singing “Squash is coming home!” and team members embracing outside Court 4. Harvard had won its seventh CSA national championship, a record for any women’s squash team, and its 21st national championship in program history: the most ever won by any women’s program at any school, for any sport. It achieved all this on home soil for a home crowd to see.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last two times the Crimson was in the Ivy League tournament, it lost the final game to the host team. During the 2020 season, it seems their fortune would be reversed, as it was finally the one hosting the tournament. Unfortunately for Harvard, its season was canceled before it could experience the postseason, and for the last two years, the Crimson had been awaiting the opportunity to play in the Ivy League tournament at Lavietes Pavilion.
Following two losses against Princeton (21-5, 11-2 Ivy) this past week, Harvard (13-12, 5-8) was officially eliminated from postseason contention and will not have the opportunity to defend its home court in the Ivy league tournament.
Contrary to what the team’s record indicates, the Crimson has been competitive against the best teams in the Ancient Eight. Each of its six losses against the top three teams in the Ivy League were by single-digit margins – with several of these games decided by the last possession.
“We've had some tough games all year in different ways, close ones that came down to the last possessions,” Coach Amaker said. “The league has been like that forever. Princeton is really good in my opinion and they have shown they are the best in our league this year.”
Harvard’s games against the Tigers were no different. A Friday night trip to Jadwin Gymnasium saw the Crimson in a nailbiter against Princeton, where the Tigers eventually pulled away with a late scoring burst to win 74-67. Returning home on Sunday, Harvard had a one-point lead in the final seconds of the game before Princeton’s junior forward Tosan Evbuomwan scored the game-clinching layup with three seconds remaining in a 74-73 victory.
“It was just an outstanding performance by them to make plays when they had to,” Coach Amaker admitted. “At the end there, we were trying to take a foul, and we didn't execute it,  so that really hurt us there at the end.”
Despite the disappointing outcome, the Crimson had a bevy of great performances from the team. Senior captain Kale Catchings scored a career-high 19 points while first-year guard Evan Nelson contributed 14 points. Nelson has started coming into his own during the latter portion of the season, scoring in double-digits in three of the past five games.
“He [Nelson] has been finding his rhythm, which is nice to see for a younger player, and his confidence is growing,” Coach Amaker said. “You can see it in him that he's played more and gotten more comfortable. His teammates have confidence in him, and it’s wonderful to witness that.”
Along with Nelson, junior guard Luka Sakota has continued to establish himself as a go-to option during the critical moments of the game. The Etobicoke, Ont. native was an integral part of why Harvard had a chance to win at the end of Sunday’s game. Sakota hit two clutch free throws to put the Crimson up by one with 18 seconds left in the game.
“You know, he really came through and came to life for us to make some big baskets, and those free throws when he got fouled on the break were outstanding,” Coach Amaker said. “It was amazing that he could do that, and we were so disappointed we couldn't hold it down on the other end to get the stop that we needed to get the win.”
Even though Harvard’s chances of advancing to the NCAA tournament have been stymied, its season is not yet over. The Crimson’s last game of the season will be at home against Dartmouth, and this season-ender will be especially memorable for the seniors, who havehad to experience one of the most adverse four-year stretches of any collegiate player.
“I am trying to make sure that the team knows that we should be thinking right away about next weekend for our seniors,” Coach Amaker said. “It's hard for all this to be absorbed right now,but I want them to hear that from me.”
The seniors have been a battle-tested group, which has had to lead a team with numerous injuries throughout the season. This game was especially bittersweet for senior forward Noah Kirkwood, who played through injury and still scored 12 points.
“I was proud of the effort and how they fought even with Noah banged up,” Coach Amaker said.  “He couldn't really go today and tried, and we tried our best to do what we could and get some neat things done.”
It is particularly unfortunate that the Ottawa, Ont. native cannot continue his exploits in the postseason, as he is having the best season of his college career.

As a student at Harvard you’ve definitely heard that you need to burst the bubble, and the easiest way to do that is by taking the T into Boston. Still, it’s possible to get through your four years at Harvard without ever setting foot on anything but the Red Line. But there is a whole rainbow of trains operated by the MBTA, each with their own character and unique metallic screeching noise. So to save you the energy (and the transit fare), we decided to embark on an adventure to find out what each line of the T is really about.
The Red Line
If you’re a Harvard student and you’ve taken the T before, you’ve almost definitely been on the Red Line. It’s our gateway into Boston and beyond, and it creates a nice little ground shake under Wigglesworth. The Red Line is convenient and tends to serve its purpose, but that doesn’t mean that it won’t throw a few surprises your way. On any given weekend, it’s bound to only be running half the time. Sometimes it just stops for a few minutes, and you’ll never find out why. Bonus points because we saw a man going to town on a pint of Ben and Jerry’s while the train crossed over the Charles.
The Green Line
The first time we ever got on the Green Line we were confused: is it a train? A trolley? Both? When you get on at Park Street (having taken the Red Line into the city) things seem vaguely normal, but a few stops later you’re above ground and nothing makes sense anymore. There are cars driving right next to you and pedestrians crossing the tracks. And sometimes when you get on you don’t even have to pay. If we had to put a label on it, we’d say the Green Line is a little ~chaotic~.
The Orange Line
If you think the Red Line looks like it’s been around for far too long, then you clearly haven’t been on the Orange Line. The Orange Line looks like it never left the 1950s and goes about as fast as you would expect for something over 70 years old. In addition to the retro energy (seats with wood paneling??), there’s also a massive turn after Downtown Crossing that had us wondering if the whole train was about to flip over.
The Blue Line
The Blue Line just kind of exists. It’s like that new mall in your city that’s been “opening soon” for years — it looks cool, but that’s about it.  The Blue Line will take you to the beach, but given that most of the time, the thought of going swimming in Boston is a nonstarter, we’ve decided that the Blue Line doesn’t serve much of a purpose.
The Silver Line
Can someone please explain to us why the Silver Line is part of the train system?????? It’s fully a bus. The first time we ever got on the Silver Line we had to triple check that it wasn’t actually a normal bus. Sure, it’s helpful if you’re trying to get to the airport or…the airport, but it’s just not a train and we’re never getting over that. However, bonus points for being partially electric.
Sure, the T is a little ~quirky~. But it’s here, and it’s convenient. We’re pretty lucky to have (mostly) reliable public transportation, and that’s on that.
