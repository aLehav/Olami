After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a would-be game-winning field goal hooked wide left last week, the Harvard football team’s fate was determined by backup kicker Andrew Flesher’s right foot once again.
With 6:31 left in regulation, Flesher attempted a 36-yard field goal. In a kick that looked similar to last week’s 50-yard attempt, Flesher’s attempt strayed just left.
But this time, Flesher was given a second chance. With 51 seconds left in the game, Flesher was called up to kick a 23-yard field goal. His kick sailed through the uprights for the third time that day, giving Harvard a 24-21 lead.
“I felt the kick leave my foot, and it just felt good,” Flesher said. “There was no doubt I was going to miss that.”
Dartmouth, with no timeouts remaining, put in quarterback Alex Park, who overthrew his intended receiver with seconds remaining. Senior cornerback Jaron Wilson picked off the pass to seal the victory.
Back in Harvard Stadium for the final game of its three-game homestand, the Crimson (6-1, 3-1 Ivy) held off Dartmouth (3-4, 2-2 Ivy) in a battle of second-place teams, shutting out the Big Green in the final quarter.
“It’s as tough, courageous, and resilient of a team as I’ve ever been around,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “That’s a really good team we beat. We just made one more play than they did, and we’re just happy to get a win.”
The Crimson defense picked off the Big Green’s starting quarterback and defending Ivy League Rookie of the Year Dalyn Williams once and held him to 156 yards passing and no touchdowns, prompting the change at quarterback midway through the fourth quarter.
Playing without starting tight end Cameron Brate, junior quarterback Conner Hempel targeted seven different receivers and ended the day with 135 yards passing.
Early in the third quarter, Hempel threw to freshman running back Bo Ellis. Ellis dropped the sideways pass and didn’t pounce on the ball. Safety Stephen Dazzo capitalized on the freshman’s mistake, scooping up the ball and returning it for 33 yards to give Dartmouth its first lead of the game, 14-13.
“I was just making an alert play,” Dazzo said. “We never give up on a play. If the ball’s on the ground, pick it up and keep moving.”
But the Big Green’s lead was brief—the Crimson took back the lead on the next drive, when high-school-quarterback-turned-collegiate-receiver Ricky Zorn took a reverse handoff and lobbed up a 32-yard ball to fellow senior receiver Andrew Berg at the back of the end zone. A two-point conversion gave Harvard a touchdown lead, 21-14.
“We’d been practicing it all week, and Berg wasn’t really open when I was getting ready to throw the ball,” Zorn said. “I thought I overthrew him, but Berg came up to me before the game and said, ‘If they call that play and I’m double or triple-covered, you have to throw it.’”
On the ensuing kickoff, Dartmouth kick returner Jon Marc Carrier was carted off the field with a concussion. Two plays later, league-leading rusher Dominick Pierre went down with a knee injury.
But Dartmouth was still able to attack.
Williams hit receiver Bo Patterson for 44 yards before backup running back Kyle Bramble came in for Pierre and barreled into the end zone to tie the game at 21-apiece.
The top rushing defense in the league gave up 167 yards to Dartmouth after limiting Pierre to 22 yards a year ago. The Big Green’s late-game heroics were not enough  to complete a Dartmouth comeback.
After trailing Princeton by 13 early last week, the Crimson reversed the trend. Harvard opened the game with a three-and-out drive but tacked points onto the scoreboard on its next three drives.
On the team’s second drive, Hempel found Zorn and junior tight end Tyler Hamblin for consecutive first downs. The QB showed his mobility as well, ending the drive with a nine-yard touchdown scramble to give the Crimson the early 7-0 lead. Hempel ended the game as the Crimson’s second-leading rusher with 70 yards.
Two plays later, the offense found itself back in the red zone when Williams’ pass bounced off of his intended receiver and into senior cornerback DJ Monroe’s hands. But the Crimson was unable to score seven off of the turnover, and Flesher added three points instead.
The Big Green attempted to counter with its own field goal attempt, but Riley Lyons’ 26-yard attempt sailed wide left.
Tailback Paul Stanton, who led the Crimson offense with 146 yards, set Harvard up on the next drive, using a block by Hempel to take the ball 63 yards to the 17-yard line. But the Dartmouth defense came up with another stop, forcing another Harvard field goal.
An out-of-bounds penalty on the ensuing kickoff gave Dartmouth a short field, and the Big Green capitalized, as Pierre notched a 10-yard scoring run.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Union men’s hockey team dominated the second period to hand Harvard its first loss of the season in a comeback win at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Saturday night. The Crimson (2-1-1, 1-1-1 ECAC) saw a two-goal lead quickly evaporate in the middle frame to fall, 4-2.
Union (3-2-2, 2-0-0 ECAC) wasted no time finding an extra gear after the first intermission, scoring its first of three goals in the middle frame 23 seconds into the second period.
“I think we were still at the Boston Red Sox parade, still celebrating,” Union coach Rick Bennett said of his squad’s play in the first period. “The boys woke up, and the leadership kind of carried us through tonight.
Junior Daniel Ciampini provided the Dutchmen’s first two goals of the night in the first four minutes of the second period, and senior Daniel Carr scored the game-winner with five and a half minutes left in the period to set a Union record for Division I goals scored.
Senior Matt Hatch added an empty netter with 25 seconds left in regulation to seal the deal for the Dutchmen.
Union outshot Harvard 22-4 in the second and 47-22 overall. Crimson junior Steve Michalek made 43 saves.
“To me tonight, the scoreboard was indicative of the play,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91. “[Union] carried the play, they had the better of the chances, and we had a real tough time winning battles. I think they played hungrier and a little more committed to what they were trying to do.”
After a shutout of Rensselaer on Friday and 20 minutes of play against the Dutchmen, it looked like Harvard was well on its way to its first pair of wins on consecutive days since the 2012 ECAC playoffs.
A little extra hand-eye coordination gave Harvard an early lead. Sophomore Greg Gozzo batted his own rebound out of the air and into the Union goal as he barreled past the crease.
The play was reviewed to confirm that Gozzo did not play the puck with a high stick, and the goal stood. It was Gozzo’s second of the year.
Ryan McGregor put the Crimson up two with his first career NCAA goal. The fourth-line center from Switzerland won a faceoff to himself in the Union zone before spinning around and firing a quick shot past Stevens.
The tables turned early in the second as Ciampini hooked around the Crimson goal to stuff the puck behind Michalek. Ciampini tied things up less than four minutes later, burying a rebound off a shorthanded breakaway by linemate Max Novak.
Union’s game-winner seemed almost inevitable as the Dutchmen outplayed the Crimson throughout the second period. Carr delivered it with a one-timer at the top of Harvard’s right wing faceoff circle on the power play.
The Crimson saw a couple opportunities to tie in a more even final frame.
With less than seven minutes left, freshman forward Phil Zielonka could not corral the puck at the Union crease off a 2-on-1 break with classmate Luke Esposito. The Crimson also pressed hard in the final minutes with an extra attacker, but the Dutchmen’s Hatch broke away for the final score with 25 seconds left in regulation.
“[Michalek] played well enough to give us a chance to tie it with one shot,” Donato said. “But in general, it would have been stealing a point because we got outplayed and we got away from our game.”
Harvard looked sharp at times but undisciplined at others. A hooking penalty from freshman Brian Hart abbreviated a two-minute five-on-three opportunity for the Crimson in the first. Harvard’s power play has yet to click and is now minus-one on the year.
“If we were able to get our power play going and maybe make something of some of those early power play chances, maybe we could have found a way to put [Union] in a hole,” Donato noted.
Michalek displayed more consistency in net than he did at RPI on Tuesday. The junior stood on his head at times, but Union’s persistence won the day.
“It’s disappointing,” Michalek said. “We had a big win the night before, and we wanted to carry the momentum. We should be a lot better next weekend.”
Harvard will complete its home stand next weekend against St. Lawrence and Clarkson.
"It's a pretty short season, so every game is a battle," Michalek said. "We have to stay more level-headed and play our game the whole 60 minutes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Confusion, rather than skill and luck, from both sides of the ball was the main factor that dictated the outcome of Saturday’s soccer match between Harvard and Dartmouth.
In the 41st minute, a non-call by the referee allowed Big Green goalie James Hickock to gain control of the ball. Instead of kicking the ball out, Hickock instead let the ball sit as vehement arguing from the two sides essentially stopped play. Senior forward Pascal Mensah was the only player on the field who seemed to realize that the ball was still live, and he quickly ran towards the ball. He swiftly maneuvered the ball away from the diving Hickock and was able to walk the ball into the goal, which proved to be the difference maker in the Crimson’s (5-7-2, 4-1-0 Ivy) 2-1 victory over Dartmouth (5-6-4, 0-5 Ivy).
Harvard’s first goal also came in the first half, as sophomore midfielder Andrew Chang was able to control a rebound at the top of the box and send a strike just over Hickock’s outstretched arm, narrowly missing the top of the goal post.
Although the Big Green was unable to score in the first half, they also had numerous opportunities. In the 23rd minute, sophomore Crimson goalie Evan Mendez came out of the box to head an incoming ball to one of his defenders. A Dartmouth player was able to intercept the ball and take a shot on goal that just missed high while Mendez scurried back to the goal.
The second half of the match was a far different story, as Harvard weathered several Dartmouth attacks as it attempted to hold on to its lead. The Crimson’s defensive mindset reduced the number of attacking opportunities they had, which factored into why they were scoreless for the second half of the game.
In the 82nd minute, the Big Green’s attacks finally led to a goal, as junior midfielder Gabe Stauer was able to head in a goal off of a free kick to get his team onto the scoreboard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team could not quite get a handle on Dartmouth on Saturday, but bounced back against the University of Vermont on Sunday, coming out victorious on Senior Day in the Crimson’s last home game of the season.
HARVARD 4, VERMONT 0
On Sunday, Harvard (7-9, 1-5 Ivy) grabbed the early lead against the University of Vermont and never let go of it.
Harvard outshot the Catamounts (0-19, 0-5 American East) 24 shots to 5 and topped Vermont, 4-0.
Vermont was unable to read Harvard’s attack for the majority of the game. The Crimson capitalized less than five minutes into the game on an unassisted reverse chip shot by sophomore Elizabeth Jacobson.
Harvard did not let up with the early advantage. Junior Noel Painter and freshman Marissa Balleza joined Jacobson, each putting a point on the board before the end of the opening half. Even though her team took a lead into half, Jacobson acknowledged there was an attitude shift after half-time.
“It was a bit low energy in the first half,” Jacobson said, “We definitely stepped it up in the second half. We definitely picked up the pace.”
Balleza found the back of the net again on a corner shot assisted by Jacobson to put to rest any doubts.
“We played with the mentality that we weren’t ahead,” Jacobson said. “That allowed us to keep going in the second half.”
The defense stonewalled the Catamount offense, barely allowing Vermont to push the ball past the 50-yard line for the majority of the game. When the Catamounts did manage to get looks towards goal, senior goaltender Jenn Hatfield came up with big saves to keep Vermont scoreless.
After the game, the team honored its six seniors: Hatfield, Christy Haughey, Rebecca Houser, Bridget McGillivray, Caroline McNeill and Rachel Rosenfeld.
“We are going to miss [the seniors] so much,” Jacobson said. “It was great to see them all in, playing their hardest. The fact that we were able to get the win on Senior Day was so important.”
DARTMOUTH 4, HARVARD 2
A day earlier, the Crimson faced the Big Green (7-8, 3-3 Ivy) in its second-to-last Ivy League competition, and the contest was tight in the early goings.
But late in the first half Dartmouth earned back-to-back corners, with the second proving successful as Eliza Becker tucked the ball into the upper right corner of the net, giving Dartmouth a single-goal lead over Harvard.
But the Crimson responded four minutes later.
“I went around my defender and I literally had 10 feet in front of me,” McGillivray said.  “At first I was going to pass it, but then I saw that nobody was pressuring me so I just took the shot.”
Freshman Marissa Balleza followed up with a powerful shot with 11 minutes to go but missed the lower right-hand corner by inches.
With fewer than 10 minutes to go in the first half, the Big Green buried another goal.  But soon after, Balleza succeeded in getting the ball away from Dartmouth’s goalie and putting it into the cage to knot the score at two heading into the half.
In the second half, Harvard made many attempts to add a goal.  Balleza had a close miss 10 minutes into the second period with the ball flew just over the top of Dartmouth’s cage.
12 minutes into the second half, Dartmouth earned a penalty and was able to capitalize on the opportunity, improving to a 3-2 lead over the Crimson.
“They were getting a lot of two-v-ones against our defenders, and they got a lot of short corners which they were able to score off of,” McGillivray said.  “I think we let their center defender have too much time with the ball as well.”
Harvard was not able to get another goal on the afternoon, though the team saw a shot hit the side post about five minutes later.
Dartmouth scored again with about 16 minutes to go in the second half, making the final score 4-2.
“We let them outwork us, and it [was] really frustrating,” McGillivray said.
“I think we just sat back after it was tied and we let them get way too many offensive plays against us and missed way to many opportunities in the circle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday night in front of a raucous crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center, Corinne Bain prepared to serve, up 13-9 in the fifth and final set against Yale (15-4, 9-1 Ivy). Having broken the 15-year old Crimson record for aces in a single season against Brown (9-12, 5-5 Ivy) on Friday, the freshman belted down two huge serves to secure Harvard’s (12-7, 7-3 Ivy) first victory against the Elis in twenty attempts.
“The players were in tears after the match,” co-captain Natalie Doyle said. “The coach was in tears after the match. This was the first win [against Yale] since 2004. We have worked so hard to be the top of the Ivy League and this just proves that we are the best team in the Ivy League.”
With the victory over the Bulldogs, the Crimson completed a weekend sweep, having also bested the Bears on Friday night by three sets to one.
HARVARD 3, YALE 2
Yale traveled to Cambridge on the back of 25-straight conference wins stretching back to the 2011-12 season as the dominant force in Ivy volleyball. But, through two and a half hours of engrossing play, a casual observer would not be able to tell you which team entered as the favorite as nothing could separate the two teams.
None of the first four sets were decided by anything less than two points as the teams went toe to toe with each other. For everything Harvard threw at Yale, buoyed by an increasingly rowdy cheering section as the match went on, the Bulldogs kept coming back.
The Crimson won the first set, 26-24, only to see Yale narrowly take the second, 28-26, after the home team almost came back from 20-16 down. The teams then traded sets again to set up a tense final set.
“What really did it was everyone did their jobs,” Doyle said. “We didn’t try to do anything fancy. Everyone kept it simple, we played our system and we played the best volleyball we’ve ever played.”
Throughout the game, both teams refused to give away easy points and there were many long rallies. The Harvard hitters had a career night, often bailing the team out with a string of improbable and impressive kills.
Sophomore Kathleen Wallace paced the Crimson with 22 kills as she combined with Grace Weghorst and Caroline Walters to produce 59 kills and .434 hitting percentage on the night.
“To know that when things were crazy and there were a lot of rallies we could just get the ball to them and they would get a kill—that was incredible,” said junior co-captain Kristen Casey. “If the rallies are long and your outsides are struggling it’s always tough, but that was never the case for us today.”
For the first time in the entire match, the Crimson was able to gain separation from Yale, setting up Bain to serve for the win. When Weghorst spiked the game winning kill, fans and players alike stormed the court in celebration of one of the biggest wins in recent program history.
It places Harvard firmly second in the Ivy standings and loosens the stranglehold Yale has held on the conference over the past couple of seasons. The future is bright for the young squad.
“This program is going to continue to win,” Doyle said. “We’re a young team and everyone puts their heart and soul into this team. The team chemistry is so huge. We care about each other on and off the court. It doesn’t matter if one person’s having a good game or a bad game—it’s the team. People really understand that mentality.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
The Crimson outclassed Brown on Friday night, avenging the loss from earlier in the season.
Last time, Harvard had no answer to the Bears’ right side hitters but this time the team came prepared and the adjustment proved too much for the visiting squad.
“Last time we played them, their right sides were really successful against us and we knew going in that we had to shut them down and we really did,” Casey said. “We shut down their right sides and they really didn’t have any other options to come at us with or any sort of plan B.”
During the second set, Bain broke the program’s single season record for aces set by Lolita Lopez ’98. The freshman has also recorded three triple-doubles on the year, which stand as the only triple-doubles in program history.
“It’s incredible [that she broke the record] but Corey does so much for us that her serve isn’t even the main thing on our minds,” Casey said. “She wears so many hats. She’s got a lot on her shoulders for a freshman and she’s one of the most mature, poised freshmen I’ve ever played with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, for just the fourth time in 43 years, a Harvard athlete captured the individual title at the Heptagonal Championships.
Co-captain Maksim Korolev bested the all of the 95 runners who toed the line at Princeton’s West Windsor Fields on Saturday to win the Ivy championship. Korolev averaged 4:43 per mile on the 8k course and crossed the finish line in a conference-record 23:28. He was 16 seconds ahead of the race’s second-place finisher, Columbia’s Nico Composto.
Overall, the Crimson men finished in fourth place at the meet with team total of 103 points. Columbia, which was ranked No. 10 in the latest USTFCCCA rankings, placed three runners in the top five en route to the team title. On the women’s side, Harvard took third, behind Dartmouth and Cornell, who took first and second places, respectively.
“I don’t think there’s another conference in the country that has the kind of parity or the kind of equal playing field that exists in the Heps,” Saretsky said. “The level of competition this year is unbelievable…. It’s one of the most competitive conferences in the country.”
Korolev’s championship performance marked the first time a Harvard athlete won Heps since Dan Chenoweth ’11 took home the individual title in 2009.
Korolev was in the lead pack of the race from the beginning. There was little separation at the first mile mark, with the race’s top 32 runners all within two seconds of each other.
But by the three-mile mark, the massive group had dwindled down to just three runners—Korolev and Dartmouth’s Will Geoghegan and John Bleday. The trio hit three miles in a blistering 14:23.
“Coach told me to get up front and kind of relax and chill as much as I could, and then just take the race over when I felt like I could strike it home,” Korolev said. “At 5K, I felt like I could speed up and I wanted to take it over, so I did that, and the Dartmouth guys just couldn’t keep up.”
The Crimson men were without the squad’s other frontrunner, co-captain James Leakos. Leakos, who has had a stellar senior season thus far, including his wins at the Harvard-Yale dual meet and the Paul Short Invitational, was held out of the meet due to a nagging leg injury.
“He’s a great leader for our team, which is a big part of why both him and Maks are co-captains,” Saretsky said. “But our team didn’t miss a beat, even without him being there. It would have been great to have him out there competing, but I thought other guys stepped up and we finished around where I thought we would.”
In Leakos’ absence, Harvard’s second runner was sophomore Tom Purnell, who missed being in the top-10 by just one second. Purnell took 11th place in the race with a time of 23:58. The squad’s final three scoring runners were juniors Will Geiken, Adam Cotton, and Nephat Maritim, who earned 28th, 30th, and 34th places, respectively.
The gap between Korolev and Leakos and the Crimson’s final scoring runners has hurt the men’s team all season. At Heps, Korolev finished 68 seconds ahead of Maritim. If Leakos would have competed and finished in second place overall, Harvard would have tallied 71 points—still earning fourth, but losing to third-place Dartmouth by just one point.
“The other guys had okay days—no one was really too excited about how they did,” Korolev said. “Even if James had run, we would have gotten fourth as a team because Dartmouth just had a really good day. But it was a solid performance for the team overall…. I think we’re still set to get to nationals and do well there.”
Junior Viviana Hanley and senior Morgan Kelly paced the Crimson women at Heps. Hanley and Kelly were separated by just one second, with Hanley earning eighth place and Kelly taking ninth.
“I was super pleased and really impressed with the gutty performance that [the women’s team] put out there,” Saretsky said.
Kelly, classmate Emily Reese, and Hanley were in fifth, sixth, and seventh places after the first mile of the race. And with two other Crimson runners in 20th and 21st, the Harvard women were in first place as a team at that point.
But the Big Green, led by four-time national track and field champion Abbey D’Agostino, erased the Crimson’s lead by the three-mile mark. Harvard’s first three runners hit three miles between 16:05 and 16:14, while D’Agostino’s three-mile split was 15:24. The Dartmouth senior went on to win the race with a 6k time of 19:40—40 seconds faster than the second-place finisher.
Reese, junior Molly Renfer, and freshman Sarah Gillespie were the Crimson’s final three scoring runners, finishing in 16th, 17th, and 23rd places, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When things weren’t working in the air, the Harvard football team turned to the ground game. And that just may have bought the Crimson a win on Saturday.
Playing against Dartmouth at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson received big rushing performances from sophomore running back Paul Stanton and junior quarterback Conner Hempel. Stanton amassed 151 yards on 26 carries, and Hempel rushed for 77 and a touchdown, as the duo guided Harvard to a tight, 24-21 victory over the Big Green.
The Crimson’s passing game, meanwhile, never really seemed to get into a rhythm. Hempel only threw for 135 yards, with most of his looks coming on screen passes, wheel routes, or short crosses.
According to Harvard coach Tim Murphy, the gameplan going in had been to establish the ground game and adapt according to the results.
“We really need to be a physical team,” Murphy said. “We need to be a balanced team to beat the best teams in our league. We can’t come out there and chuck the ball 50 times and really establish an identity.”
That meant plenty of action was coming Stanton’s way. And the sophomore responded with a big performance.
Stanton demonstrated his ability to create a run from nothing on the last play of the first quarter. Seemingly trapped after taking a handoff on the right side of the line, Stanton reversed his direction on a dime, cut around the line to the left sideline, and—after benefiting from a timely Hempel block—dashed for 63 yards into the Dartmouth red zone for the longest run of his career.
Harvard repeatedly relied on Stanton to barrel the ball down the field through inside handoffs up the gut and option plays to the outside. The back is averaging nearly 120 yards per game over the last three contests.
Hempel supplemented Stanton’s performance by making a number of plays on the ground himself. On the Crimson’s second drive of the game with the ball on the Dartmouth nine-yard line, Hempel faked the handoff and rushed up the middle, absorbing a hit as he drove into the end zone for the score.
Harvard ran the ball 51 times on Saturday, the team’s highest total all season.
COMING THROUGH IN THE CLUTCH
With just under six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, it was anybody’s ballgame.
But the Crimson made all that change on one crucial drive. Marching 56 yards down the field, Harvard knocked in the game-winning field goal and took control of the game by keeping the Dartmouth offense off the field.
Harvard began with good field position at its own 38, but the drive did not come easily. Faced with an early third down and four, senior receiver Scott Miller took the ball on an end around and barely managed to propel himself forward for a first down.
The Crimson had another third down a few minutes later just outside the Dartmouth red zone. This time it was senior receiver Ricky Zorn who took the end around and scampered for a nine-yard gain.
Zorn’s carry moved the ball to the 12-yard line and put the Crimson in the driver’s seat. A few plays later, junior kicker Andrew Flesher—who missed a potential game-winning try last week against Princeton—converted a 23-yard attempt to give Harvard the lead.
Having left the field with 5:46 left in the fourth quarter, the Big Green offense did not get another shot until just 43 seconds remained on the clock. With the game hanging in the balance, Harvard had seized it for its own with one big drive.
“It’s one game at a time, but we knew this was a must-win game,” said senior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu. “We said we’re not going to lose at home. We lost last week and wanted to start a winning streak this game.”
ADAPTING TO INJURIES
Hit hard by injuries this season, the Crimson offense was missing several of its key cogs as it took the field Saturday evening.
Senior tight end Cam Brate was sidelined due to a hurt knee, and sophomore receiver Andrew Fischer was kept off the field with a hamstring injury. Hempel adjusted by relying on junior Seitu Smith, who racked up a season-high seven catches, and also targeted Miller and junior tight end Tyler Hamblin.
The adjustment was not as smooth on the offensive line. With senior center David Leopard out with a broken ankle, Harvard was beset with penalties and committed seven false starts. But the Crimson line did a good job protecting Hempel and only surrendered a single sack.
Harvard was also forced to turn to Flesher at kicker, as a leg injury has kept senior David Mothander on the bench the past few weeks. Despite missing an attempt in the fourth quarter, Flesher converted three other field goals including the game-winner. The junior was named Ivy Special Teams Player of the Week following last Saturday’s loss to Princeton.
“We’re a little bit, on offense, like a team of misfit toys,” Murphy said. “This is an unbelievable group of kids. The thrill ride isn’t over. I think I aged about 10 years tonight, but this team will fight.”

On Tuesday night, Harvard goaltender Raphael Girard watched from the bench as the Crimson had to storm back from a three-goal deficit to earn a draw with RPI. Friday night, Girard made sure that such a comeback would not be necessary.
Behind 28 saves from the senior goaltender, Harvard (2-0-1, 1-0-1 ECAC) emerged from the Bright-Landry Hockey Center with a 2-0 victory over No. 10 RPI (4-2-1, 0-1-1 ECAC).
Friday marked the second time in as many starts that Girard has been perfect between the pipes for the Crimson. He has opened the year with 71 straight saves.
“He’s been great,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He’s tracking the puck very well, he’s controlling his rebounds, he’s played the puck out of the net very well, and it’s certainly given the rest of the team confidence.”
The Crimson got on the board just seconds into the second period, and it proved to be all the offense that the team would need for the night.
With the puck tied up behind the RPI net, freshman forward Alexander Kerfoot jarred the puck loose, allowing sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo to seize it and send it up the boards. Waiting at the blueline, senior defender Dan Ford took the pass and fired a shot toward the net which was knocked down in front of the crease.
Sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey then corralled the puck between two RPI skaters and pushed it through the legs of unsuspecting Engineer defenseman Guy Leboeuf. Moving towards his right, Vesey sent a low shot on net to beat RPI goaltender Scott Diebold five-hole for his first goal of the season.
The goal for last season’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year sparked a sharp turnaround for Harvard. In the first period, the Crimson had failed to score on three power plays, including a 5-on-3 that lasted 1:56.
Harvard was also whistled for three penalties of its own. Girard was able to hold the Engineers scoreless, but the RPI power play unit still mustered seven shots on goal.
“In the second period, we talked about just settling down and getting back into our game plan and getting pucks behind them and using our speed to create some offense, and we got some pucks through,” Donato said.
The Crimson started to dominate play, outshooting RPI 14-3 to open the second and 23-15 for the rest of the game. But Diebold, who finished the game with 30 saves, kept the Engineers in the game.
The second period tally was the only flaw on Diebold’s sheet, but it was still enough for Harvard to earn its first conference victory. The Crimson would not find the back of the net again until the final minutes of regulation after Diebold had left the ice for an extra RPI attacker.
Following an RPI loss of possession in the Crimson zone, Criscuolo took a pass from sophomore forward Greg Gozzo to the top of the Engineers’ left faceoff circle and sent a backhander just out of the reach of RPI defenseman Luke Curadi and into the empty net to seal a 2-0 victory.
With a goal and an assist against RPI, Criscuolo brought his season totals to a team-leading three goals and five points through three games. Between the 3-3 result in Troy on Tuesday night and Saturday’s rematch, Harvard finished its series against the No. 10 team in the nation by scoring five unanswered goals.
“I think when we were down 3-0 [Tuesday night] we could have rolled over and let them have the win, but we fought back,” Vesey said. “I think that definitely carried over into tonight because we knew that for the majority of the last game, we outplayed them, and we knew we were the better team.”
The Crimson defense did well to keep junior forward Ryan Haggerty, the nation’s leading scorer, off the scoresheet despite his seven shots on goal.
“He had two chances in the second period, but otherwise his shots were not big threats,” Girard said. “We did a really good job of keeping him shooting from the perimeter.”
One of those chances for Haggerty was RPI’s best opportunity to equalize over the course of the game.
With 20 seconds remaining in the second period, in the midst of a late offensive push by the Engineers, Haggerty received the puck with his back to the net at the top of the crease. Quickly spinning to face Girard, the junior fired a shot which went just inches above the crossbar, allowing Harvard to maintain its lead into the second intermission and beyond.
“I thought we overall did a lot of good things,” Donato said. “I think we’ll continue to improve, but RPI is an excellent hockey team. I think that will play out, and we’re very happy to get three out of four points against them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team performed well in its final home contest of the fall season this weekend, as it hosted the Harvard Halloween Invite at the Murr Center.
The tournament was different than most of the team’s fall contests. Only a few players from each team competed, and the tournament featured a single draw in both singles and doubles with eight players each.
“This was a boutique-size tournament for us,” head coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “It gives a chance for our guys who don’t get to play high in the lineup a lot to compete against guys who do play for other teams. It’s a great chance to get more matches in.”
This weekend, players from Brown, Army, Dartmouth, Bryant, and Tufts traveled to Cambridge to compete in the tournament. The Black Knights, Bulldogs, and Jumbos sent their whole squads, but the Bears and Big Green only sent players who had not seen as much fall season action.
In doubles, the Crimson represented both tandems in the final. The duo of sophomores Kelvin Lam and Conor Haughey took down teams from Brown and Army before a showdown against juniors Christo Schultz and Alex Steinroeder, who beat teams from Dartmouth and Tufts.
In the final, the sophomores snuck by their top-seeded teammates in a tiebreaker, 8-7, to take home the doubles title.
Schultz, who did not compete for the team last season, saw his first fall action this weekend in a return from a shoulder injury.
“We let Christo play some doubles, but not singles yet,” Fish said. “It was nice to see him back in action. I thought Kelvin and Conor played well too. It was very high quality doubles.”
In singles, Lam came very close to taking home the crown, but suffered an ankle injury in the final and was forced to retire. After defeating an opponent from the Black Knights and then beating classmate Nicky Hu, 6-3, 6-2, Lam faced Brown’s Justin To in the final.  But with the score at 6-5, 5-2 and up match point, Lam sprained his ankle and couldn’t continue playing.
“Kelvin did a really great job,” Steinreoder said. “It was really unfortunate that he got hurt, especially because he was up match point and playing really well.”
Co-captain Casey MacMaster and Haughey also competed in singles. MacMaster fell to a player from the Bulldogs, but Haughey was able to pick up a win in the consolation round.
The team believes that it can benefit from getting extra matches in for players who normally don’t compete, according to Fish.
“Tournaments like these are a great confidence builder,” Fish said. “There are things that happen in these tournaments that don’t happen in dual matches. The guys get a couple matches under their belt and gain more confidence.”
The team will wrap up its fall season next weekend at the Tribe Invitational hosted by William & Mary, and is looking forward to facing strong competition that includes Old Dominion, Penn State, and William & Mary.
“We’re feeling pretty good,” Steinroeder said. “Everyone is practicing really hard, and opefully we can finish on a strong note. It’ll be good competition, and it’s our last time this fall to find out what we need to improve on.”

As the weather continues to drop to chilly temperatures, it’s becoming increasingly harder to convince yourself to change out of your warm and fuzzy pajamas in the morning. The good news is, you don’t necessarily have to. Here are some cold weather fashion trends that we’ve seen around campus:
1) Socks
From festive polka-dot socks paired with Birkenstocks to the stylish fairisle kinds you wear under your boots, socks are making a comeback for the winter. And for those of you who aren’t so fond of caring about socks, consider telling people that your mismatched pair is an intentional stylistic choice—they don’t need to know that you woke up five minutes before class.
2) Pullovers
Pullover sweaters are making a bold statement on campus nowadays. Especially popular varieties include Patagonias of bright colors or cool (and slightly dizzying) patterns and baja hoodies. Now if only they could make pullovers that avoid the social awkwardness of getting them stuck on your head as you take them off...
3) Harvard Apparel
There seems to be an inversely proportional relationship between the temperature and the ubiquity of Harvard clothing—the colder the weather gets, the more inclined people are to wear Harvard apparel. The different types of clothes range from the classic sweatshirt to the stylish crimson and white scarf to the “I just got out of bed” sweatpants.
4) Non-Harvard Collegiate Apparel
There’s also been a fair amount of people who don’t conform to norms and wear sweatshirts from other schools. Maybe it’s the school of your hometown, your parents’ alma maters, or your close friends’ colleges. Maybe you’re just trying to support a school that’s good at sports. Whatever the reason may be, we here at Flyby feel the obligatory need to warn you to wear Yale apparel at your own discretion.
