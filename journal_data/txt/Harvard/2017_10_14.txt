After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week’s slate of Ancient Eight action features Godfather-lookalikes, sparrow serial killers, and Cornell. Let’s not waste any time getting into the picks:
PRINCETON AT BROWN
Last Saturday, Princeton faced a 10-0 deficit against Georgetown with 7:41 left in the first quarter. Over the next 33 minutes, the Tigers went on a 50-0 run.
Let that number sink in—50 straight points! That’s more of a disproportionate response than imprisoning Jean Valjean for stealing a loaf of bread.
Picked to top the Ivy League, Princeton sits 0-1 in Ancient Eight play after a shocking loss to Columbia. This weekend, the Tigers will seek revenge at Brown.
Odds are that the Bears won’t fight back. The 2-2 football team has alternated wins with losses. Last weekend, Brown fell to a program called the Hatters that previously was 0-5.
Led by senior quarterback Chad Kanoff, Princeton will feast on the Bears, while Brown players struggle to find any offensive crumbs. Maybe Jean Valjean can offer some advice.
PICK: Princeton 34, Brown 10.
PENN AT COLUMBIA
This matchup is all about Columbia coach Al Bagnoli, my second-favorite person in Ivy League football.
There are many reasons to like Bagnoli, who gives wonderful interviews and looks like an older version of Michael Corleone. (I can say this because I own The Godfather and my last name is Danello.) Bagnoli epitomizes an American success story—he was born in New Haven but made it to New York. How can you not like this guy?
In the past two seasons, admiration for Bagnoli mixed with pity, as his Lions assumed their traditional role as Ancient Eight doormat. Well, the times have changed. Columbia boasts a 4-0 record. Last week, John Feinstein—yes, that John Feinstein—wrote a column called “‘There’s actually hype around Columbia football’: A longtime punchline is 4-0.” These Lions can roar.
The problem is, Bagnoli is running into my favorite person in Ivy League football. His name is Justin Watson (senior wide receiver), and he will not lose to Columbia. Have you ever read the Book of Revelation? Let me save you the time—Watson descends to earth on a chariot of offensive linemen, and he collects 11 catches for 150 yards and two touchdowns.
I don’t care who covers Watson. I’m never betting against The Terminator.
PICK: Penn 24, Columbia 21
BUCKNELL AT CORNELL
Cornell, I owe you an apology.
For years, I’ve described you as a cloudy wasteland where industries, stray animals, and dreams go to die. Well, last weekend, I made the trip to Ithaca, N.Y., and I wanted to say that I was mistaken. The sun came out.
Remarkably, the afternoon light wasn’t the largest upset on the day. The Big Red overpowered Harvard for 233 rushing yards and a 17-14 win.
Bucknell stands in the way of a second victory. Opponents have pummeled the Bison for 144 rushing yards per game. PETA probably would step in if it weren’t so busy at Yale (more on that storyline later).
A motivated, run-dominant Cornell. A hapless, run-vulnerable Bucknell. This combination seems to make for an easy pick. But the Big Red never meets expectations.
Cornell fans, prepare for some darkness—both literal and metaphorical—this weekend.
PICK: Bucknell 25, Cornell 13.
DARTMOUTH AT SACRED HEART
Strange things happen when you spend too much time in the woods. Take the Dartmouth football team, which has won a string of wacky games.
The season started with a 38-7 whopping of Stetson—no drama there. Then came perhaps the wildest contest in recent Ivy memory. With three seconds left, the Big Green blocked a game-tying extra point, returned it for a safety, but went to overtime after a penalty whistle. In the extra period, Dartmouth won, 27-26, on a stop on a two-point conversion.
How to follow up that act? How about with a last-second win over Penn on a fourth-and-inches touchdown?
Last weekend, Dartmouth merely completed the largest comeback in program history, erasing a 21-0 deficit to Yale. The winning score came on a fourth-down throw with 34 seconds left.
During the offseason, Big Green players must have wondered into the wilderness, found the devil, and sold their collective soul. That’s the only way to explain this nonsense.
Dartmouth should probably crush Sacred Heart, which has lost three straight. But knowing recent history, the Big Green will probably win on a last-second safety when a moose carries Sacred Heart quarterback Kevin Duke out the back of the end zone.
PICK: Dartmouth 36, Sacred Heart 23.
LAFAYETTE AT HARVARD
Established in 1826, Lafayette College was named after Marquis de Lafayette, who had toured the United States the year before. College officials decided to stick with the French hero’s surname rather than his full one—Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de Lafayette.
Alternatively, founders could have used Lafayette’s nickname: “The Hero of Two Worlds.” Switch “Worlds” with “Games” and you have an apt description of the Leopards football team. Lafayette has claimed two victories and looked pathetic otherwise. Those two wins, however, have come in the past two weeks, which means that the Leopards visit Harvard with a head of steam.
The Crimson, meanwhile, is reeling from a loss to Cornell that made the defense look more ramshackle than Adams House. Harvard will respond, assuming the team can field 11 players. Last week, injuries sidelined defensive mainstays D.J. Bailey (defensive lineman), Stone Hart (defensive lineman), and Wes Obsbury (cornerback).
This year’s team is better than the record indicates. I believe so firmly. Even so, Saturday marks a serious test.
PICK: Harvard 31, Lafayette 17.
HOLY CROSS AT YALE
Last Saturday, 15 Yale students gathered to protest the deaths of sparrows. The activists held signs that read, “At Yale, the Caged Bird Dies.” The signs might have read, “At Yale, This is What Social Life Looks Like.”
Those 15 firebrands had come to draw attention to postdoctoral associate Christine Lattin. Backed by PETA, the students have accused Lattin of killing over 250 birds over her career.
“A lot of the research that’s being done at Yale is people in white lab coats,” one protester said. “They’re barbarians, in my opinion, masquerading as scientists.”
That same day, The Yale Daily News published an articled called “Locals Teach Chicken Raising.” The piece detailed the efforts of citizens to raise hens on residential properties.
“No matter what is going on,” one citizen said, “you can always count on chickens.” Unless you’re wearing a white lab coat, apparently.
Why do I mention these avian plotlines? Because Yale will take flight Saturday. Bulldogs don’t normally fly, but this program is putting up 470 yards of offense per game.
Saturday will be a day of canine joy. PETA, you may want to watch this one.
PICK: Yale 41, Holy Cross 27.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its long run of dominance in the 21st century, Harvard football has not lost two consecutive games very often. It recently happened at the end of the 2016 season, however. The Crimson dropped back-to-back contests against Penn and Yale, missing out on a shared Ivy League title.
After its Week One loss to Rhode Island, Harvard responded in typical fashion with a 45-28 victory over Brown. The Crimson (2-2, 1-1 Ivy) will look to respond similarly this week, as it hosts non-conference opponent Lafayette following a defeat at Cornell.
“Honestly, the loss was pretty tough, especially [since Cornell wasn’t] the best team in the league,” said junior wide receiver Adam Scott. “The only thing we can do now is grow, get better, and just take it one week at a time. We’re trying to go 1-0 this week.”
For a college team, Lafayette (2-4, 2-0 Patriot) has a unique offensive scheme. Instead of running the run-pass option like many collegiate offenses, the Leopards place the quarterback under center and call a lot of run plays, which in turn set the stage for play-action passes and screen passes.
“It’s an offense that you see when you turn on the TV on Sundays,” captain Luke Hutton said. “It’s a pro-style attack, and it’s fun to play against. It’s challenging at the same time, but I think it’s kind of refreshing.”
Lafayette’s pro-style offense is the direct product of its rookie head coach. John Garrett, who spent time with the Dallas Cowboys as the passing game coordinator and tight ends coach, is in his first season of leading the Leopards. Garrett’s brother, Jason, has been the Cowboys’ head coach since 2010.
Harvard’s pass game coordinator and wide receivers coach, Mickey Fein, missed coaching under Garrett by one season. Fein spent the last nine seasons on the Lafayette staff, including eight years as offensive coordinator. His time with the Leopards should lead to solid scouting reports on both Lafayette’s offense and defense.
Over the last two weeks, the Leopards’ defense has been nothing short of clutch. The Leopards won each of their last two games by a single score, and they held opponents Holy Cross and Fordham to just 17 total points despite allowing 734 total yards.
“They’ve only given up one touchdown apiece in the last two games to two of the offensive juggernauts of the league, Fordham and Holy Cross,” head coach Tim Murphy said. “So it’s going to be a very different Lafayette team than we’ve seen in a long time.”
The Crimson’s defensive unit will likely have to match Lafayette’s drive-for-drive, and it will also have to contend with a multitude of sidelined Harvard players. After a disappointing finish to last week’s game against Cornell, the Crimson defense needs to hone in on eliminating penalties and stopping the opponent’s rushing attack.
“We’re not really reinventing the wheel here by any means,” Hutton said. “We turned on the film and watched it as a defense, and [what] it came down to [was] the fundamentals were really, really bad in a lot of plays. We had the guys in the right places to make the plays. We just didn’t make them.”
In recent weeks, Harvard has struggled with penalties. Against Cornell, the Crimson picked up eight infractions worth 67 yards.
“It’s not them; it’s us,” Murphy said. “We need to get more out of our kids. We need to eliminate mental mistakes such as penalties, missed assignments. When a team loses, it starts with coaching, not with your players.”
If Harvard’s defense struggles with several of its starters out of action, the Crimson will have to rely on the offense led by freshman quarterback Jake Smith. Smith, who remains Murphy’s first choice as signal caller, has two touchdowns and three interceptions in four games, but he has shown a proficiency for throwing the deep ball and escaping pocket pressure.
Though this Saturday’s appointment with Lafayette will not impact the Crimson’s position in the Ivy League standings, it will serve as a chance to get both the offense and the defense back on track, ahead of the remaining Ancient Eight schedule. Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton, Yale, and Columbia are all showing flashes of competitiveness early on.
“We know what this means,” Hutton said. “I think we understand the weight of every single game that we’re about to play. We’re excited to get back out there and show that we’re a better defense and a better team than what we showed last week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Now that’s what you call a second act.
After giving up 233 rushing yards last week to Cornell, Harvard completely flipped the script this Saturday, outrunning Lafayette 296 yards to 12. With 15 more first downs and 14:56 more possession time, the Crimson (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) dominated its opponent. In its 700th game at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson got back on track with a 38-10 rout.
Harvard exploded on the ground behind two running backs—junior Charlie Booker and freshman Aaron Shampklin. The elder member of the duo rushed for 56 yards on the first Crimson drive and finished with 159 yards and a touchdown. Booker totaled 6.9 yards per carry, just below his season average of 7.2, good for eighth in the nation. Shampklin spelled Booker throughout the matchup and tacked on 82 yards of his own.
“[Booker] keeps his pad level really low, so oftentimes he exhibits great contact-balance to bounce off the first tackler,” Leopards coach John Garrett said. “You really have to gang-tackle him. He’s tough.”
The Harvard backfield was supplemented by the special teams duo of junior receivers Justice Shelton-Mosley and Adam Scott. Before the offense had even taken the field, Shelton-Mosley had put points on the board.
Two minutes into the game, the junior fielded a 50-yard punt and planted his foot on the Crimson 15. Aided by a well-placed block, he found the edge, skirted the sideline, and stayed true to the end zone. The return was tied for the fifth-longest in Harvard history. The longest one happened two weeks ago, when Shelton-Mosley dashed 91 yards against Georgetown.
“[We had an] outstanding across-the-board team effort today, led by special teams,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We got so much energy out of the big returns by our playmakers Justice and Adam Scott.”
Lafayette (2-5, 2-0 Patriot) answered immediately. On the subsequent kickoff, the Leopards’ junior running back CJ Amill pushed through the middle for 65 yards before being pushed out of bounds. The return set up a Lafayette touchdown pass from freshman quarterback Sean O’Malley to senior wideout Rocco Palumbo.
That offensive outburst proved futile, though, as the Crimson special teams had something more to say. At the start of the second half, Leopards kicker Jeffrey Kordenbrock nailed the ball to Scott to avoid a return by Shelton-Mosley. The strategy worked out poorly, as Scott took the kick 90 yards to the end zone, expanding Harvard’s lead to 28-7.
The Crimson offense earned its first points of the afternoon on its first appearance. Booker did much of the damage, driving through several defenders for a 31-yard sprint and then rumbling another 16 to the Lafayette four. Between the two ground gains, freshman quarterback Jake Smith hit senior halfback Ryan Antonellis on an 18-yard strike. The possession ended when Shelton-Mosley found the endzone on a reverse to the left, his second touch of the game and second touchdown.
“We really played well across the board,” Murphy said. “We talked about the importance of this game in really doing a better job on the line of scrimmage, dominating the line of scrimmage. Our kids took it to heart.”
In the second quarter, two fourth-down conversions contributed to Harvard’s dominance. Booker picked up both attempts. The first conversion was followed by a rare Crimson miscue involving Smith and Shelton-Mosley. The receiver stopped for a hook on the right sideline while Smith threw a streak route right into the hands of the waiting Leopards defender, Phillip Parham—effectively a good punt but a lost opportunity for Harvard.
When Lafayette needed fourth-down conversions of its own in the final quarter, it could not seize the chance. Sticking to its bread-and-butter, the Leopards went to the air on its first fourth down attempt, but O’Malley was pushed toward the sideline and threw the ball out of bounds. The Crimson spent nearly a minute-and-a-half before Lafayette got back the ball. Three plays later, the Leopards faced fourth-and-short again. Once more, the team went to the air, and Harvard knocked the pass to the turf.
Errant passes became a theme for the Lafayette offense. The Crimson captain Luke Hutton nearly picked off two throws, one off his foot and another while diving out of bounds. The second near-turnover led to a punt that was uncharacteristically shanked by Leopards freshman Michael Turk—the protege of Matt Turk, a former NFL punter.
The miscue gave Harvard the ball at its own 48 and three plays in, Booker successfully converted his second fourth down of the game. That plunge furthered a seven-minute drive that ended with a touchdown 38 seconds before halftime.
In both losses this season, the Crimson has gone into the locker room and failed to score in the second half. This Saturday, though, Harvard came back with a vengeance. Scott returned the kickoff for a touchdown, sophomore kicker Jake McIntyre nailed a 33-yard field goal, and Smith walked into the end zone on a reverse that left him wide open—the first rushing touchdown of his career.
Coming into the matchup, the Leopards were averaging 12.8 points per game and just 8.7 rushing yards, second-to-last among all FCS teams. Despite this ground-game drought, the team must have watched the Crimson’s film against Cornell because Lafayette put the ball on the ground early.
While Harvard faltered against the Big Red’s offense, The Leopards could not get anything going. On the first drive, Lafayette opted to run twice, and the two rushes for two yards apiece catalyzed a shift back to its normal pass-heavy offense. The Leopards would run the ball 11 more times for eight more yards.
“We were hungry,” junior linebacker Charlie Walker said. “We didn’t put out our best [at Cornell].... We’re going to come out even stronger and hungrier to show other teams that we’re not going to let something like that happen again.”
The Crimson, which had the third-most penalties among Ivy League teams coming into the game, did not earn a single yellow flag until midway through the third quarter. Harvard will need to maintain similar discipline in coming weeks as the team has only Ancient Eight rivals left on the schedule.
“We were just looking to get our identity back,” said senior defensive tackle Stuart Johnson. “These next couple home games are extremely important. We can’t stress enough to the rest of the team how important these games are in terms of, one, winning the Ivy League championship but, two, just earning respect.”
