After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ken Urban, playwright of “A Guide for the Homesick,” to premiere this fall at the Huntington Theater in Boston, has returned to New England to work as a senior lecturer in the department of Music and Theater Arts at MIT. The Crimson sat down with Urban as he enters the theater scene at MIT.
The Harvard Crimson: To start off, what are you most excited about starting this fall at MIT?
Ken Urban: I think theater is not the first thing you think of when you think MIT. When I was teaching at Harvard, I didn’t really know much about MIT and theater, and it seems like in the last few years it’s really grown. In 2015, they started the major in theater arts. We just opened a brand new theater called the W97 this past week, so it’s a pretty exciting time to be involved in the arts there. When I started college, I started as a chemical engineer, and during my sophomore year I began studying English and theater, so I’ve always been interested in the merging of science and theater, and it’ll be an exciting place to explore that.
THC: Why did you switch from chemical engineering to English and playwriting?
KU: My first year in college, I went to Bucknell University in Pennsylvania. I was always really good at math and science in high school and assumed I would do something like engineering. My parents sent me to Bucknell because of their engineering program. The truth is—this might be hard for your generation to understand, but—back in the day when you were eighteen you had no idea what the f*** you wanted to do with your life and that was okay. My parents said, “You should study engineering,” and I just said, “Okay.” After a year of taking engineering classes, I painfully realized that I was good at math and science, but I wasn’t good at working with my hands. They took us on a field trip to a chemical company in Pennsylvania. It was the most depressing place on earth that I’ve ever been, and I realized that I could not have a job like this. So I started flailing around trying to figure out what I wanted to study and I ended up taking a class called “African-American Drama in the Twentieth Century,” and I thought that this was what I wanted to spend my life doing and I started becoming an English major.
THC: Was there an initial spark in the class that was the moment you realized you would do theater?
KU: Yes! There’s a play called “Dutchman” by Amiri Baraka. It’s a pretty angry play and I was a pretty angry college student, so it really resonated with me. I met Amiri before he passed, and I told him about that.
THC: You’ve mentioned a marriage of science and technology to theater, and we wanted to know if you could elaborate more on that. As a playwright, how does technology inspire or impact the way you write?
KU: I’m a pretty low-fi theater artist in the sense that it’s just me and my laptop writing, but I do think a lot about design, and I think about collaborating with designers when I create plays. I’ve gotten bolder in thinking about that conversation. In that way I think a lot about technology, video productions. I’m interested in these conversations between designers and playwrights, and that often has to do with questions in technology. Also, the things I write about tend to be about technology and how it impacts our lives, so that’s another connection. This play I’ve been working on has involved a lot of interviews with biomedical engineers, and it’s been eye-opening to see how other disciplines address questions about the permission to use things. For example, I learned during my interview that when dentists remove things from your mouth, they then sell those things to companies who harvest the cells from that and sell those back to laboratories and nobody ever asks you if that’s okay. I think that we, as theater artists, always collaborate with disciplines outside our own. Whether that be scientific, or visual arts, or dance, I think it’s something that we do naturally.
THC: What was the inspiration that led you to write “A Guide for the Homesick”?
KU: I was able to interview a lot of people who had returned from Doctors Without Borders. Part of that process was just getting to know their story. Something I kept hearing was how difficult it was to come home because there was so much training for what they do when they’re in the field. They would see horrific things or have these tense experiences[,] and then they would come back to New York and they just couldn’t adjust to their daily lives. I felt like I wanted to write a play about that homecoming experience, and so that combined with my interest in what was going on in Uganda in 2010-11, with a rise in anti-LGBTQ violence, came together to help me write the play.
THC: Once a written play is performed for the first time, how does viewing the performance impact the piece? Do you make changes afterward, or is it set in stone?
KU: I’m in rehearsal a lot and make revisions with the actors and the director based on what I’m hearing and seeing. Cutting is always a good thing, because you also learn a lot about the journey of the characters and what needs to be said versus what can be unsaid. You also learn a lot when watching it with a preview audience—when people lean forward, when they’re frustrated, when they’re confused—and I like to just sit in the back and listen.
THC: Is there one aspect—either for “Guide” specifically or for plays in general—that you think should be focused on when being turned into a performance?
KU: I think it’s good to be flexible, but I also like to help a lot with checking that the rhythm of the play is right. It helps convey the emotional life for the play. Sometimes in rehearsal, I’ll close my eyes and just listen to find the emotional journey of the character, because I want that to feel as honest as possible. I go back and forth, but for example if a play has a score, I like to make sure that the score is working. Initially, I don’t focus on visual because it can be distracting. The actor will figure it out, so I listen and focus on what my contribution can be to the room. Director Colman works more on the physical, so I like to think that I’m working to make sure that the story is being told.

Don’t know what sound editing is? That is probably because a sound editor’s work is most noticeable is when they are doing it poorly. The job of a sound editor is to take all the background noise, dialogue, music, and sound effects (which they often add) and integrate them into a smooth sonic experience. If that doesn’t happen, everything from odd noises to awkward musical transitions can get in the way of the filmmaker’s ability to tell an effective story.
Last year the Academy Award winner for Best Sound Editing was the dystopian action thriller “Mad Max: Fury Road.” The sound editors, Mark Mangini and David White, earned their well deserved accolade by weaving together the sound for an action movie with 2,700 cuts.  That means 2,700 times ambient sound changes and 2,700 times music and dialogue must be checked to make sure everything is consistent. Countless more sound effects need to be added between and through the shots. This is only part of the job description, but it’s because of stats like these—and all the work that goes into building unique sound effects—that blockbuster action and sci-fi movies tend to take home this technical award category more often than artsier dramas, which have fewer moving parts.
Of course, as the real die-hard fans of award shows will know, the category of sound mixing is an entirely separate category. The various sound elements that the sound editors have sequenced are condensed into into their final form, the one that gets played through sound systems, speakers, and earbuds. Volume, along with a host of other technical features of unmixed sound like the various frequency components and the panoramic position, is balanced for an optimal final product. At the Academy Awards, the Oscar is given to both the mixer who worked on the post-production (the “re-recording” mixer) as well as the the original production sound mixer who was responsible for first recording all the sound on set.
Working with sound is one of the less glamorized aspects of film production, but even if many don’t know it, sound editors and mixers make the jump scares, dramatic crescendos, and swooning kisses the cinematic moments they are.

For many of us, it has been ten years since we first heard those glorious words: “I’m Chuck Bass.” To us “Gossip Girl” fans, these words are part of our gospel, melting our vacuous hearts whenever we imagine Ed Westwick saying them as his eyes smolder across our screens. Even though the series ended in 2012, we will never get tired of “Lonely Boy” or “B,” especially because this year marks the show’s ten-year anniversary.
For those who do not know, “Gossip Girl” managed to convince thousands of teenage girls that Brooklyn is a cheap neighborhood, that headbands should be worn past the age of twelve, that you shouldn’t take drugs (at least not before the SATs), and that the solution to every problem is to spread gossip through anachronistic blog posts about your fellow New York prep-school friends.
Despite its ridiculous plots, “Gossip Girl” will always remain iconic because of its glamor and New York spirit. Though its acting is not always its selling point, the show provides its viewers with a fanciful portrayal of upper-class New York life and displays the city’s beauty. The creators succeed in doing this by featuring sweeping shots of the different neighborhoods, and bringing the city’s character to life by showcasing local talent through its wardrobe and music selection. The show also delivers some of the most saucy, recyclable one-liners of television history, such as: “A hot lifeguard is like Kleenex, use once and throw away!”
Some of its components are not as empty as some people (mainly my parents) might argue. Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) in particular displays a depth and complexity unusual for any character in a teen drama. Unlike her best friend Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) with her token “daddy issues,” Blair’s problems are much more fleshed out. As clichéd as Blair’s struggles with friendships and eating disorder in her high school years may seem, they are explored with a touching level of honesty and vulnerability.
More than anything, “Gossip Girl” was also a turning point for fashion on TV because of its iconic preppy and ridiculously high-ended style, featuring New York designers like Tory Burch, Jenny Packham, and Marchesa’s Georgina Chapman (who to this day are part of the fabric that makes up this fashion capital). Its attempts to bring to life the glamor of New York, while sometimes fictitious, were grand and carried out in a style almost reminiscent of Edith Wharton’s “The Age of Innocence.” And while its portrayals of romantic relationships might be problematic to say the least, the studied depictions of these chaotic families and societal expectations are nuanced and thoroughly explored. If you’re looking for something stellar, than walk away. If you’re looking for glamor and entertainment, step right up.
XOXO,
Gossip Girl’s Publicist (Sort of)

As a child growing up in the area, Dan I. Byers visited the Harvard Art Museums. He has since traveled the world studying contemporary art and worked as a curator for two museums, including the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. In June, Byers took the helm at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, which houses the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) and the Harvard Film Archive, as its John R. and Barbara Robinson Family Director. The Crimson took a walk with Byers through the Carpenter Center to learn about his career before Harvard, his thoughts on working in the Le Corbusier’s famous building, and the power of curatorial work.
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve been a curator at the the Carnegie Museum and the Institute of Contemporary Art. What is new for you in this job?
Dan I. Byers: I’m used to working in a much larger context. The ICA has about 60 full time staff; we have a staff of four people here. I’ve been a curator for museums now for almost 15 years in various capacities. This is the first job I’ve had in an academic institution. Here, the shows we do are much smaller and more precise and connect to different aspects of the curriculum in VES. Half of what we do is public programs: artist talks, events, screenings. There’s a real emphasis on activity, having people together in the same space, talking.
THC: Why did you become a curator?
DIB: As an undergraduate, I was an intern for 3 years in the contemporary art museum in college. I was a studio art major and a very mediocre painter. When this contemporary art museum opened on campus, I was able to switch my work-study job from the dining hall to the art museum, which was a big upgrade. The curator kind of took me under his wing. I started talking to my fellow art students about their art more than making my own, and I realized there was this job where you’re helping artists bring their work to the world and figure out the context for it.
THC: You work in a great work of architecture. What are your favorite spaces?
DIB: The ramp is my favorite way to enter the building. You get this sense of ascending up into the trees. Once you’re up here, you’re separate from all the activity on Quincy Street. The terrace is one of my favorite places to have lunch.  It’s totally open for the public to use. You have a sense from here of all the different functions of the building: this public space, our bookshop area, and the studios up here. The building was designed to choreograph interplay between display and making. I love seeing the very clean, finished spaces of paintings displayed on the wall across from painting studios and the chaos of creation. This is something you rarely have in one building—the opportunity to understand the creative process and the way in which its product enters into the world, enters into art history and discourse with other disciplines.
THC: What is a piece of art that has influenced you?
DIB: One of my first favorite works of art was the Max Beckmann self-portrait that’s in the Harvard Art Museums. He’s holding a cigarette in one hand and staring straight out at the viewer. It’s one of the first works where I realized the power of thinking about representing one’s self, the ways in which you could fool yourself and fool other people, and the artifice of a self-portrait. But it also has incredibly powerful paint handling, with black and white and minimal gestures that describe a lot. I discovered this painting when I was 12—I grew up around here—and it always is in the back of my mind in a lot of ways.
THC: What makes a good exhibition?
DIB: An exhibition should be something that cannot be a book, that cannot be a movie or a radio show. A good exhibition is an idea or story that can only be expressed through the form of objects and images in space. Exhibitions are similar to theater. There’s an incredible amount of time and effort and expertise that goes into where you build the walls, where visitors enter, what artworks are next to each other. Are the spaces light, are they dark? Do you go from a light space to a dark space—what does that do psychologically or temporally? Ultimately, you want to express the artists’ understanding of their work as well as the way the work has moved through the world.
THC: What’s some of the best advice you’ve been given as a curator?
DIB: The first curator I worked for in college told me you always need to ask what an artist needs. Does an artist need a catalogue to have art historians write about their work and to establish it in art history? Does an artist need a solo show because they’ve never put all their work together in one place? And what do audiences need, what should people see? What are the political issues that are urgent in the day? If you have a platform, if you have public space, if you have a soapbox to stand on, how are you using it? It has to be in a way which is  really pushing culture forward… and expanding people’s understanding of the world in some way. So there’s that responsibility as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Game of Thrones” is the only TV show Racha Kirakosian watches. A professor of German and the Study of Religion at Harvard and an infrequent TV-consumer, Kirakosian made an exception for her students.
“Back at Oxford, where I taught before I came here, students would make the connection to ‘Game of Thrones’ whenever they talked about medieval literature,” Kirakosian says. “Students would say, ‘Oh, this is like “Game of Thrones.’ And I would say ‘Well, if anything, it’s the other way around.’”
The connection stuck with her. “I realized that it’s actually quite sad that what I teach evokes something to the students that I don’t share,” Kirakosian says. “I have no idea about the world that fascinates them.”
So Kirakosian pushed herself to watch the show—and to teach it. Now, Kirakosian is the creator of Religion 59: “The Real Game of Thrones — Culture, Society, and Religion in the Middle Ages.” She has watched all seven seasons of the show, and loves it.
“In a way, it’s our world in a nutshell,” Kirakosian says. “Good stories are often like that because they tell us so much about our own world, but they’re removed enough from our own world that we can actually use it as a projection screen to analyze and observe.”
That logic is how Kirakosian found the inspiration for her second lecture, titled “Gendered Roles.” Throughout the hour, Kirakosian intersperses the lecture with clips from the show. She compares characters to different narrative stereotypes, like Sansa Stark as a lady at court, or Brienne of Tarth as the woman warrior.
“Not all women have equal rights,” Kirakosian points out about the world of “Game of Thrones.” She nods to Cersei Lannister’s elevated privilege as queen.
“Gendered Roles” is only one facet of Religion 59’s extensive syllabus. In the next few months, students will learn about topics like the Hanseatic League, relationships between the church and empire, and Orientalism within the context of “Game of Thrones” and the Middle Ages.
The list goes on, but Kirakosian recognizes that the course won’t cover everything.
“We’ll take ‘Game of Thrones’ as a point of departure to study events and structures in medieval history, and to look beyond a simple concept of history and historicism,” she says. “What can we learn about appropriation of narratives and the context they’re told in?”
Student responses have been exciting to Kirakosian. In the first class, the lecture hall was flooded with eager students, convincing Kirakosian to remove the course’s cap of 50. It doesn’t hurt that Religion 59 debuted in the midst of the show’s highly-anticipated seventh season.
“It legitimizes people’s interests,” Hannah Feldman ’19, a History concentrator, says about the course. While some students are excited for the medieval literature, some have no background in the Middle Ages but just love “Game of Thrones.”
Kirakosian’s own thoughts echo this sentiment, calling “Game of Thrones” a “phenomenon of our time.” “There is a thirst for the past and fantasy … these stories have fascinated people ever since [the Middle Ages].”

The first memoir I ever read was “The Glass Castle” by Jeannette Walls. Mr. Brooks, my eighth grade English teacher, divided the dozen or so students into book clubs of three, and assigned a different memoir to each group. When he slipped Jeannette’s sea-glass-colored volume into my hands, I felt the room’s atmosphere shift. I forgot the stodgy sentence diagramming and half-baked renditions of monologues from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” I wiped the post-lunch slumber from the corners of my eyes and dove right into a fantastic and nuanced story about a charismatic, dysfunctional family. I marveled at how prose so poetic, so magical, could also be so real. Reading this book was not a schoolroom assignment; it was a gift. “The Glass Castle” sparked my ideas about soul searching, developing resilience, growing up, and gaining independence, all via beautiful writing. As Jeannette writes about an unsupervised cooking accident, “I was on fire”—though fortunately for me the flames were metaphorical.
Suffice it to say, I had high expectations when I learned that “The Glass Castle” would become a movie in August 2017. It’s important to mention, here, that I’m not a purist who thinks that anything less than the original version of a text is heresy. The movie, written by Destin Daniel Cretton, Andrew Lanham, Marti Noxon, and directed by Cretton, made me sad—but not because of potent storytelling, cinematography, acting, or even music. No, I was sad because the movie disappointed me. Its pretentious opening voiceover, manicured look, scripted dialogue, and curated coffee-shop playlist made the movie slow, tedious, and affected. The choppy and partial delivery of Jeannette’s narrative and clunky transitions from present to past gave me whiplash. Somehow the movie manages to be too formal and all-over-the-place at the same time.
The actors float through a story that’s clearly not their own, with the exception of Ella Anderson, whose sheer youth captures the wonder and unconditional love that Walls as a child has for her charming, troubled father. Brie Larson, who plays the adult Jeannette, is more Brie than Jeannette. As Jeannette’s father, Rex Walls, Woody Harrelson hams up Rex’s tendency to self-destruct, using an Appalachian twang and twinkling his turquoise eyes (color contacts?) each time the camera pans across his face. Max Greenfield, who plays Jeannette’s fiancé, seems to recycle old material from other roles. Greenfield’s “David,” who replaces Jeannette’s real-life first husband, Eric Goldberg, as described in the memoir, isn’t a far stretch from Greenfield’s role as Schmidt, the humorously uptight, materialistic, and at times whiny control freak Greenfield plays on the television show “New Girl.” The rest of the characters, such as Jeannette’s siblings and Rex’s mother, are also unmemorable.
Furthermore, the movie omits swaths of the memoir, including most of Jeannette’s nomadic, fantastical childhood. Cut with a thrumming, folksy soundtrack, the movie features still shots of cracked mountains, nubby Joshua trees, and flat terrain, simplifying this essential part of Jeannette’s coming-of-age story. In addition, several iconic moments of the memoir—when Jeannette collects geodes in the Battle Mountain desert in Nevada desert, or when she learns how to make Ginnie Sue’s chicken rolls after moving back to Rex’s hometown of Welch, West Virginia—are left out. While Cretton likely had to consider the movie’s length in eliminating scenes from Jeannette Walls’ book, including these memorable examples might have enhanced the movie’s storytelling, montage, and overall poignancy.
The real Jeannette Walls does, however, make an appearance in the film as an extra in one of the opening scenes. As Larson and Greenfield exit a restaurant into a waiting cab, a man and the real Jeannette walk arm-in-arm in the background. She’s probably not “blessing” the movie with her presence. Instead, her presence here reinforces that the movie is but a walking shadow of its former self, bursting with gut-wrenching genuineness on the page but schmaltz-ing it up on screen.
Both the film and the memoir end with the same Christmastime scene, as Jeannette, her siblings, and her mother sit down to dinner a couple of years after Rex’s death. The movie’s idealized family reunion seems to have jumped straight from a greeting card. There’s plenty of food, a warmly lit home, and a sense of familial comfort and camaraderie, and the scene ends with a close-up of Jeannette’s happily glowing face.
But the memoir takes a different, more unsettled approach. “It had grown dark outside,” Jeannette writes, “A wind picked up, rattling the windows, and the candle flames suddenly shifted, dancing along the border between turbulence and order.” Jeannette herself knows that newly polished appearance of her family belies the chaos underneath, that Rex walked a fine line between adventure and destruction, putting his family likewise through the wringer, and that she has been forever shaped by that corrosive childhood. While the memoir lacks a Hollywood ending, its complexity is ultimately more satisfying.

On Sept. 13, Radcliffe Institute Fellow Jonathan Guyer gave a lecture on the “Mad Cartoonists of Cairo.” A journalist and contributing editor of the Cairo Review of Global Affairs, Guyer has lived in Cairo for the past five years, exploring and researching the new wave of comic art in the Middle East and North Africa for a book he is currently writing. Guyer presented a survey of comic art mainly from the turbulent city of Cairo, analyzing the medium’s ability both to critique and influence Middle Eastern society and culture.
Guyer began his lecture with the question that guided him through his studies: “What is the importance of this Arab comic movement?” He argued that comics are windows to the current social and political situation of the Middle East. He began to substantiate this thesis with a stylized cartoon drawing of Cairo by cartoonist Shennawy from the Cairo publication “Tok Tok.” The text in the corner of the image, translated from Arabic, reads “Cairo, 60 years from now, and nothing has changed,” a derisive statement that, as a recurring theme in the lecture, pervaded through each series of politically-charged cartoon he presented. For example, one of the cartoons— a hyperrealistic depiction of Cairo—comments on the city’s increasing urbanization while a sardonic drawing of a smiling Egyptian family, splattered in blood, criticises the violent rise of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the incumbent president of Egypt who came to power through a 2013 military coup. For Guyer, art and politics work in tandem, constantly fueling both creativity and policy.
After presenting a variety of controversial work—selected from various magazines and newspaper articles— Guyer turned to the cartoonists themselves, mad in every sense of the word. These artists, Guyer observed, are frantically mad at the state, outrageously mad for defying tradition, and eccentrically mad in their art’s absurdity. A unique feature of cartoons depicting Cairo is their sense of black humor. For example, just days after Hisham Barakat, the Egyptian prosecutor general, died in a car bomb assassination, cartoonist Anwar drew a citizen nagging a cloaked assassin to at least pay for his parking before he blew the car up.
While some may believe this to be in bad taste, for Guyer, these comics use absurdity to undermine the power of terrorists. Guyer believes that by mocking these killers through caricature, the cartoonist belittles their intentions. Stenciled eyebrows are good for laughs, but not for perpetuating a fear-mongering agenda.
Guyer uses the term “creative insurgency” to describe this current artistic movement. The current Egyptian government censors many of these comics. Guyer argues, however, that the censorship of controversial art only speaks louder about the power of the medium.
Lizabeth Cohen, Dean of the Radcliffe Institute, had this to say about Guyer’s research in an email:  “Jonathan’s work is a vivid reminder to me of the value of an institute for advanced study at Harvard—a space in which a brilliant journalist can step back from his day-to-day responsibilities and explore what he calls ‘a creative insurgency’ under way in the Middle East.”
Following the lecture, the Radcliffe Institute showcased a comic from Guyer’s amassed collection at [the Visual Intelligence exhibit, which is a multidisciplinary group exhibition that introduces the 2017-2018 Radcliffe Institute Fellows that will run through Sept. 14 until Oct. 28 in the Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty years after the death of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, his bandmates have chosen rather different paths toward middle age. Bassist Krist Novoselic lives on an overgrown patch of land somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, surrounding himself with goats and making weird dad music with his recently-formed band Giants in the Trees. Drummer Dave Grohl, however, formed his band Foo Fighters shortly after Cobain’s passing. Nirvana-era Grohl was kind of skinny and dopey-looking. By now, Grohl has matured: he’s grown a stylish goatee, and he wears pre-distressed t-shirts and designer flannels with tight black jeans, as a rock star should. With a net worth of over $200 million, he is both a household name for all things modern rock and a presentable representative of the hazy, druggy world of ‘90s alternative.
Foo Fighters’ ninth studio album came out Sept. 15. “Concrete and Gold” follows 2014’s “Sonic Highways,” an elaborate production that received mixed reviews. The band recorded each of its eight tracks in a different city known for its music scene, followed all the while by an HBO documentary crew. After the spectacle of “Highways,” along with a personal crisis, Grohl decided that “the strangest thing for this band to do at this point” was to “go into a studio and make a f***ing album like a normal band.”
But don’t let the gritty cover art fool you. “Concrete and Gold” is not just some album by a normal band. It’s a bit heavy on the gold, light on the concrete. First of all, the album was produced by Greg Kurstin, who has worked with a star-studded list of pop artists, including Sia (Hurstin produced “The Greatest” and “Cheap Thrills”) and Adele (“Hello”). Justin Timberlake is featured on the hard rock standard, “Make It Right,” and Paul McCartney plays drums on the sweet-sounding “Sunday Rain.” Grohl’s well-groomed and well-adjusted celebrity is completely at odds with the music that got him famous in the first place. Foo Fighters put on a show of being angsty and defiant, but it’s not all that believable. The greatest rock musicians are often innovative (in other words, scary to the older generations), frighteningly unstable, excitingly flamboyant, or some combination. “Concrete and Gold,” like the rest of Foo Fighters’ discography, isn’t really any of these things.
Of course, Foo Fighters do all they can to give the album an edge. For example, the eponymous last track ends with a wave of fuzzy guitar feedback and Grohl yelling, “F*** you, Darrell!” at Darrell Thorp, who mixed the album. It almost feels like they’re overcompensating. They know they’re too good at playing their instruments, and everything feels a bit too tight, too perfect, so they need a really rock-and-roll, spontaneous, “I’ve got blisters on my fingers!” moment. But this doesn’t make up for the uninteresting instrumentation throughout the album.
Foo Fighters also followed in the trend of older bands seizing the unfavorable political climate as an opportunity to make brave statements in the form of music. Last year, Le Tigre reunited to make their uncharacteristically bad pro-Clinton single “I’m With Her” (“Trump thinks Putin is a ‘very strong leader’ / […] / Bigotry colors his every decision,”), while Green Day sang about gun violence on their latest album, “Revolution Radio” (2016), which, despite its title, was not particularly revolutionary. On “Concrete and Gold,” the track “Dirty Water” characterizes the Flint water crisis with a first-person narrative. Grohl sings, “I’ve been drinking dirty water,” though, unlike the residents of Flint, Grohl lives in an area privileged enough to have access to clean water. The song “La Dee Da” refers to cult leader Jim Jones and certain bands associated with neo-Nazism, while “Arrows” seems to tell the story of a female refugee. All these songs seem to have been written with the purpose of making a profound political statement, but they’re all pretty inconsequential. It’s like when your aunt, from her Upper West Side apartment, reposts scathing New Yorker exposés to Facebook. It’s not as sexy when there’s no risk involved, and the Foo Fighters aren’t adding anything unique to the conversation.
Not all the songs seem to have a purpose, however. Their titles and lyrics are so cryptic and unoriginal, they might not be about anything at all. When Grohl sings, “All I ever wanted was a body to share” in “The Line,” who exactly does he want to share the body with? And what does it mean to share a body? Cryptic lyrics are often interesting and fun to parse, but it sounds here like Grohl is just trying to be inexplicably melodramatic and somewhat rock-and-roll-sounding (“The tears in your eyes / Someday will dry / We fight for our lives”). The entire album can probably be best described as “somewhat rock-and-roll-sounding” with its fuzzy guitars and its choruses that can either be screamed or sung. In an interview, the band said they wanted the album to sound like “Motorhead’s version of ‘Sgt. Pepper’” or “Slayer making ‘Pet Sounds.’” But “Concrete and Gold” only samples from the biggest hits of all the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, so it resembles a “Guitar Hero” video game more than the great rock band they’re trying to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The state of just having lost something is like … the most enlightened state in the world,” whispers Jasper, a recently single, self-proclaimed novelist, to his best friend KJ. Boston’s Theater on Fire’s production of Annie Baker’s play, “The Aliens,” is a magnifying glass on the lives of two 30-something slackers who spend their days together loitering behind a coffee shop in small town Vermont, drinking “‘shroom tea” and imparting wisdom upon the shop’s awkward teenaged employee Evan.
A whisper is a suitable volume for the stage, a rocky outdoor clearing nestled between the ivy-strewn brick walls of the Charlestown Working Theater. An audience of 20 or so sit in wooden folding chairs arranged in a semicircle just a few feet from the picnic table, two lawn chairs, and pair of recycling bins that make up the show’s minimalistic set. Fairy lights criss-cross the space overhead, bathing the stage in a soft glow accompanied by the hum of the acoustic music played before each act and during scene transitions. Director Darren Evans has crafted an atmosphere that borders on magical, a beautiful complement (and also juxtaposition) to a play so deeply embedded in the mundane. It is the combination of this setting and the authenticity of the actors’ performances that make this production one of intimacy and evocation.
While the set is absolutely gorgeous, what really makes the show is the skill of the actors. Christopher Sherwood Davis and Jeff Marcus, who play KJ and Jasper, respectively, are believable in their roles of eccentric townies without being stereotypical or caricatured. Marcus’s Jasper is intense and brooding, punctuating Annie Baker’s signature silences with his dramatic cigarette smoking and nervous bouncing of his knee. Davis’s KJ, however, is much more relaxed. Wide-eyed and comfortable in his character, KJ moves through the space around him with the kind of fluidity that could only come from what he lackadaisically refers to as “psilocybin tea.” The greater part of the first act consists of the two alternating between sitting in silence and shooting the breeze, talking about topics ranging from breakups to friends who live on wind farms to Jasper’s unfinished novel and everything in between. The actors maintain their easy chemistry through moments of fun and of friction, each playing off of the other’s performances to heighten the quality of his own.
The daily routine of the two protagonists, however, is interrupted by the entrance of the coffee shop’s employee, Evan, played by Ted Kearman and comically described by Baker in her stage directions as, “seventeen and in a constant state of humiliation.”  The stuttering teen, clad in a stained white apron and a pair of windbreaker pants that unzip into shorts, tries unsuccessfully to tell KJ and Jasper that they can’t be outside the coffee shop, that it’s “staff only.” He finds friends and mentors in the two, relishing in their invitation to a Fourth of July party located, of course, on the very patio he has repeatedly told the two they cannot be on. Kearman’s performance is awkward in all of the right, or intentionally wrong, places, embodying the uncertainty of being a teen looking for a place to fit in.
It is this scene, the Fourth of July party, where the set, the stage, the actors, and the misty, post-rain air of Friday evening melt together into magic. Jasper and KJ practically reverse roles, the former coming out of his shell, joking and reading from his novel, while the latter has a momentary breakdown, retreating to a small iron staircase to sit until he is coaxed back out. Marcus and Davis hit their perfect stride, showing the intense dependence their characters have on one another and are able to transition seamlessly into playing nonsensical songs on the guitar and singing for their audience of one, Evan. The actors are adeptly lighten the mood without detracting from the previous events. As the fireworks begin to go off in the background, the three dance and talk and eat brownies until KJ’s sparkler burns out and the stage is plunged into darkness. It radiates a warmth felt long after the lights have gone out, and this is only Act 1, which precedes a sharp turn of events in Act 2.
A testament to Baker’s keen sense of the intricacies of the everyday, “The Aliens” is a reflection on the meaning of friendship, the fine line between loser and genius, and the creation of art for the sake of creating anything at all. It is endearing and intense—funny at times, unforgiving at others. Theater on Fire’s production set itself apart by creating a set so close to the audience and cohesive with the acting that it draws all those who watch into the inescapable performance.
“The Aliens” is playing at Charlestown Working Theater until Oct. 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am a doctoral candidate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. For nearly a decade, I taught creative writing and literacy workshops inside Chicago’s Cook County Juvenile Detention Center, and now I am writing about the education of young people in prison.
My work as a teacher was rooted in my belief that no young person’s life should be defined by the worst thing they ever did. What I wanted most for my students was for them to understand themselves as more than the labels that had been slapped on them by the police and criminal legal system. They had been told they were gangbangers, thugs, criminals, felons, foster kids, and worse. Very often, the names they called themselves were even more harrowing. I wanted my students to expand their identities to include “poet,” “writer,” among their list—to expand far beyond the limitations that the drab uniforms of the detention center had imposed on them.
I wanted them to imagine a future like the one Michelle Jones has so courageously forged for herself by applying to Harvard and other doctoral programs in History and American Studies this year. While serving 20 years of a 50 year sentence in Indiana Women’s Prison, Jones earned her bachelor’s degree from Ball State University in 2004. As part of a course inside the prison, Jones also began researching the history of the women’s prison in which she was incarcerated.
Without access to Internet and relying on books she got through library requests and the archival papers of the prison itself, Jones published a paper on the “ladies of the night” who were held in the prison a century prior. The piece was named Indiana Historical Society’s best research project last year. In addition to this scholarship, Jones became an accomplished playwright, with one of her plays opening at an Indianapolis theater in December 2017.
Jones had been incarcerated since 1996 for the murder of her four year old son, Brandon. She became  pregnant after “non-consensual sex” at 14 and was beaten in the stomach with a board by her mother in response. She describes having had a psychotic episode a few years later, which resulted in her committing violence against her child, who died. It’s a horrific and tragic story, and one that she clearly regrets. She says now that, “I have made a commitment to myself and him that with the time I have left, I will live a redeemed life, one of service and value to others.”
And she has so far succeeded in this mission. According to the New York Times, “N.Y.U. was one of several top schools that recruited her for their doctoral programs. She was also among 18 selected from more than 300 applicants to Harvard University’s history program.” Professor Elizabeth Hinton, a Harvard historian of mass incarceration, calls Jones “one of the strongest candidates in the country last year, period.”
What more could our legal system ask of a person who made such a grave mistake so long ago? Her story should have been used to affirm for all of us who work in the justice system that what we most hope for is possible—that young people who have made terrible mistakes (and who have been victimized) can grow and change. That their lives need not be wasted. That they can, in fact, become the moral and intellectual redeemers of our society. In spite of these accomplishments, and in spite of having been selected for admission by the History Department faculty committee, Jones’s admission to Harvard was overridden by higher-ups. I was dismayed to read Professor John Stauffer’s comment that, “we knew that anyone could just punch her crime into Google, and Fox News would probably say that P.C. liberal Harvard gave 200 grand of funding to a child murderer, who also happened to be a minority. I mean, c’mon.”
Are we left to believe that Harvard is choosing whether or not to admit (black) students based on how their admissions decisions will be received by Fox News? In these times, when white supremacists are in the highest levels of government, the Harvard community should be using our tremendous platform and privileged position to defend the vulnerable and resist racism. I am saddened to see that Harvard has, in this case, chosen to do the opposite.
By turning away Jones, who was apparently among our very strongest candidates this year, what message is Harvard sending to my students about the possibilities for their own futures? My greatest hope for them was that they would not be erased, locked up, killed, or disappear into the prison system. That they would instead become students, and through the process begin to heal from childhood trauma and build lives as poets, lawyers, historians—that they would use their voices to critique the society they live in, be heard, and create change.
I wish Michelle Jones the best as she begins her doctoral studies at N.Y.U. this fall, but I suspect she does not need my wishes. As she put it, “People don’t survive 20 years of incarceration with any kind of grace unless they have the discipline to do their reading and writing in the chaos of that place…Forget Harvard. I’ve already graduated from the toughest school there is.” Her rejection from Harvard is clearly our loss as a community of scholars, not hers.

“I know you’re queer, but you just seem very straight.”
I’ve been told this on multiple occasions, usually by people who haven’t known me for a very long time. At first glance, most people do assume that I’m straight—I have long hair, a higher-pitched voice, and I almost exclusively wear dresses in pastel. If you actually hear me talk candidly about girls, it becomes very clear that I’m far from straight. But, just from appearances, I don’t fit the stereotypical idea that many people have of what queer people look like.
And that’s got me thinking. Clothing doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and people do make judgments about my identity based on my appearance. I can choose to embrace, oppose, or ignore those judgments, but they still exist. And they affect the way that I move around in the world as a cisgender queer woman. It’s important to note that I can only speak to my own experiences of womanhood and that other queer women, specifically transgender women, may have different experiences with presentation and perceptions of queerness.
Femme-presenting cis queer women are often erased from the LGBTQ+ community because they’re seen as “not queer enough.” Even in queer spaces, they are perceived as straight and may have to constantly come out in order to be recognized as queer. On the other hand, femmes have the benefit of being able to hide their queerness in environments where it wouldn’t be safe to come out.
Less feminine-presenting cis women, some of whom might be described as butch, often face different issues. These include not being seen as “real women” or having their gender questioned and invalidated. Butch women have been queering gender norms for decades, and they’ve faced a great deal of harassment for their presentation. But, many people do stereotype them as queer, which makes it easier to find other potentially queer people in a crowd. And very few in the LGBTQ+ community question their queerness—they can enter queer spaces without people wondering if they’re just allies.
The fact that the gender binary of masculine versus feminine exists even in the LGBTQ+ community is a testament to the pervasive ways that binary thinking harms everyone. While there’s nothing wrong with identifying with a particular presentation style, just as is there’s nothing wrong with identifying with a particular gender, the problem begins when we box people in by telling them how they’re “supposed” to look and assuming their identities based on appearance.
I’ve always strongly identified as femme. I love dresses and skirts, polka dots and hearts. I’m also pretty used to the perceptions and assumptions that come with being femme, as I’ve dealt with them my whole life. For better or for worse, I know that many people assume that I’m straight until proven otherwise.
But I’m not gonna lie: Sometimes I’ll watch a Tegan and Sara video and wonder, “What if I dressed like that?” I mean, their clothes are stylish, and their general vibe is fun and fresh. I kinda dig it. I want to try on vests and overalls, blazers and combat boots. And maybe a bit of flannel. I want these things not necessarily because I want to personally validate my queerness, but because they look cool.
But then the worry sets in. What would it feel like to walk around campus knowing that every single person who’s laid eyes on me has immediately pegged me as queer? What would it feel like to not be able to hide a part of my identity that I’m still at least a little bit ashamed of?
Less than a year ago, I was at the mall and saw a butch-presenting person trying on a jacket. I loved the way the jacket looked on them and how it fit their entire aesthetic. After much deliberation, I bought the jacket with the full intention of wearing it all the time. But, once the initial excitement of the purchase wore off, I didn’t have the guts to leave the house with it on. To date, I’ve only worn it once: during an interview for a queer organization. Immediately after the interview, I took the jacket off and changed into a dress and cardigan for the rest of the day. In my mind, the jacket was fine for explicitly queer events and spaces, but too queer for my everyday life.
Now, I’m re-evaluating the importance of  these rules and guidelines that I’ve created for myself.
There is a part of me that’s inherently feminine and genuinely loves traditionally feminine things, and that should be embraced and validated. But there’s another part of me that wants to explore different ways to look and exist in the world. Right now, my fear of subverting gender norms and being truly open about my sexuality is the main thing stopping me. In a nutshell, I’m afraid of being seen as “too queer.” Which is ludicrous.
I am queer, so there’s no such thing as me seeming “too queer.” In the same way, I am black, so there’s no such thing as me seeming “too black.” I should wear what I want to wear, and if it fits a stereotype, so be it. If people look at me and assume that I’m queer, great. They guessed right.
And if I choose to present as femme, it should be because I like it, not because I’m afraid of being perceived as “too queer.”
I need to spend more time actively combatting internalized homophobia and becoming more confident in my queerness, which will give me more freedom to explore all the ways that I want to express myself.
So, the next time someone tells me I look straight, I hope I don’t feel relieved. And if I do feel relieved, I hope I think a little more about why.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a highly public affair, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, within the span of two days, announced and withdrew former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, whistleblower, and transgender activist Chelsea E. Manning’s visiting fellowship at the Institute of Politics. The Kennedy School appeared to cave to political pressure: Shortly before her fellowship was revoked, Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo no-showed at an IOP event and former CIA deputy director Michael J. Morell resigned as an IOP fellow.
This decision—coming only a week after Harvard publicly withdrew the acceptance of Michelle Jones, a woman convicted of murdering her four year old son, to a history Ph.D. program—has demonstrated that Harvard is all too comfortable serving the interests of those in power, prioritizing questions of image over those of substance.
When the likes of Sean Spicer, Corey R. Lewandowski, and Jason Chaffetz are granted fellowships without a word or debate on whether their prior actions merit Kennedy School honorifics, it is clear there are different standards for those with access to government power.
In a statement announcing the withdrawal, Douglas W. Elmendorf, Dean of Harvard Kennedy School, wrote, “We should weigh, for each potential visitor, what members of the Kennedy School community could learn from that person’s visit against the extent to which that person’s conduct fulfills the values of public service to which we aspire.”
By choosing to keep disgraced political figures who have participated in or abetted a deeply destructive administration—whether assaulting reporters and protestors, lying from the White House podium, or peddling Benghazi conspiracies—Elmendorf has put Harvard’s stamp of approval on their actions. It is now their conduct which fulfills the values to which the Kennedy School supposedly aspires. Indeed, unlike Lewandowski, who assaulted a reporter and protestor, Manning served time and continues to acknowledge her past deeds.
We understand that Harvard, as both an academic institution and a brand dependent on external sources for endowments and high profile speakers, has a distinct interest in maintaining its political capital. Yet in the face of ongoing national discourse on free speech, from college campuses to football fields to streets across the nation, Harvard chose to silence a voice, determining that Chelsea Manning was unworthy in the face of pressure from CIA officials.
Beyond simply the public relations disaster of announcing and then reneging on an invitation, the Kennedy School helped demonstrate that public opinion and optics outweigh choosing fellows based on a commitment to the ideals of open intellectual inquiry and diverse, critical academic discourse.
Moreover, the Kennedy School’s decision was wrong if only because Manning has a valuable point of view. Her release of tens of thousands of military and diplomatic documents helped spark renewed domestic and international discourse about American foreign policy.
Harvard’s nearly four centuries of history, size, and global influence should make it more, not less, resistant to popular pressure. The notion that this institution’s reputation would suddenly change or its political clout suddenly be jeopardized by inviting a controversial fellow for a semester is laughable. It is a poor excuse, and one that demonstrates intellectual cowardice in the face of external pressure.
Past leakers have too been labelled traitors, unworthy of public honor. Daniel Ellsberg ’52, a former Crimson editor, released classified Department of Defense documents on the Vietnam War to the New York Times. His act of public disclosure, however, gave the nation transparency about a war that claimed the lives of its young each year. History will reveal whether Manning’s disclosures ultimately are seen in the same light. In the meantime, however, we condemn the Kennedy School’s decision to shut down this debate before it has even started.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 19, 2017 at 11:05 a.m.
A string of properties on Brattle St. that include Felipe’s Taqueria, Crema Cafe, and Cardullo’s have been put up for sale in a real estate deal that could reshape the face of Harvard Square.
The Dow and Stearns family trust, which has owned the real estate for a century, listed the properties earlier this summer. They include the row storefronts at 1-8 Brattle, home to Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, and 17-41A Brattle St., which includes Rebekah Brooks Jewelry, Felipe’s Taqueria, Crema Cafe, and Flat Patties. All told, the properties could fetch more than $100 million.
The properties further along Brattle St. are zoned for buildings as high as eight stories, a draw for potential buyers. Harvard Square residents say they worry that large multinational firms could buy up the property, driving up rents for current businesses.
Thomas J. Brush, co-owner of Felipe’s, director of Flat Patties, and a partner in Crema Cafe, said he hopes all three businesses can remain in their current locations in the Square. He said that although their leases are ongoing, there are provisions that could require them to relocate for renovations or construction.
“It’s possible that it could be two years, five years, ten years, we just don’t know,” Brush said. “But certainly our hope is that will will be able to continue our businesses here, and if not, we’ll just have to figure out what we’re going to do next.”
This spring and summer, the Dow and Stearns family trust decided to sell the 1-8 Brattle St. properties for at least $25 million, and the 17-41A Brattle St. properties for at least $70 million, according to the Boston Globe.
A week after posting its recent market listing, real estate agency CBRE New England has already received over 100 statements of interest from parties looking to buy the land.
In 2015, the same family trust sold the row of buildings across the street at Brattle and JFK, including buildings housing the Curious George Store and Urban Outfitters, for $85 million. Jacksonville-based real estate trust Regency Centers plans to build up the property to create the Collection at Harvard Square—an upscale pedestrian mall—pending City approval.
At a Sunday evening meeting hosted by the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association—a residents’ association formed last spring in the midst of what residents saw as a key time of change for the Square— some expressed concern over what some residents have named the “battle over Brattle.”
Suzanne P. Blier, Harvard professor and steering committee member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said the sale of Brattle St. properties represents “a crucial moment” for the Square.
“They’re going to be sold in today’s market, so we have to be prepared for that,” Blier said.
Blier said that early generations of the Dow and Stearns families were supportive of small businesses and nonprofits in the Brattle St. properties as well as across the street in the Curious George Store and Urban Outfitters buildings. With an expensive sale ahead, though, changes could be on the horizon.
Members of the association are currently discussing the possibility of partnering with architects, urban planners, and members of City Council to draft a citizens’ zoning petition. They said they hope to propose changes to current zoning regulations to preserve the “history and character of the Square” and maintain space for small businesses.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: September 17, 2017
A previous version of this story included a photo caption incorrectly indicating that Cardullo's Gourmet Shoppe was up for sale. In fact, the property that houses Cardullo's is up for sale—the store itself is not.

Harvard marked the official launch of a new Data Science Initiative Monday afternoon, kicking off a multi-year plan aimed at bringing the University to the forefront of the field.
Richard D. McCullough, vice provost of research, organized the launch event as part of what spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga called a five-year plan dedicated to expanding Harvard’s data science programs. Francesca Dominici, a Biostatistics professor at the School of Public Health, and Computer Science professor David C. Parkes were appointed co-directors of the Data Science Initiative earlier this spring. Dominici said the initiative is part of a broad effort “to empower the faculty” across all disciplines to get involved with data science.
At this first event, two professors discussed how they use data science in their work. Isaac S. Kohane, a Bioinformatics professor at the Medical School, criticized the lack of data science usage in medicine right now. Drawing on examples from autism to potentially carcinogenic foods, Kohane said the proper use of data science is crucial to the medical field.
“The best way to is to change medical education, to actually make doctors think of medicine as a data processing endeavor,” Kohane said.
Following Kohane, Computer Science professor Cynthia Dwork presented the applications of data science in statistically ensuring digital privacy. Dwork said offering guarantees of privacy for potential survey respondents or subjects of study could lead to more revealing, statistically backed findings in several areas of research.
“Maybe a strong privacy guarantee like this will encourage people allow their data to be used for this kind of study,” she said.
In attendance were some of the eight new Data Science Postdoctoral Fellows that arrived this fall. More than 150 proposals were received for the positions, and the eight fellows were chosen in March. Statistics professor Joseph K. Blitzstein—who teaches the third-most enrolled in class at Harvard, Statistics 110: Introduction to Probability—also attended.
Though few undergraduates attended the event, Blitzstein said that “hopefully, with the Data Science Initiative, we’ll be seeing more and more events at all levels.”
Kohane noted that the initiative launch preceded Brown University’s data science initiative launch by one day. Several other Ivy League Schools have started similar initiatives, including Yale, which announced its new “Department of Statistics and Data Science” in March.
Blitzstein said that it’s important that Harvard recognizes the importance and applications of data.
“We’re not doing it first,” he said, “but I think we’re doing it right.”
To conclude, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 emphasized the need for data science as an inseparable part of disciplines ranging from medicine to English literature.
“It is the breadth of our academic activity that’s going to make this immensely to us,” Garber said. “It’s a tremendous time for this field at Harvard, and we need to bring the resources here.”

Discussing an ordinance that asks Cambridge’s City Manager to review the City’s wildlife management plans, Cambridge residents and City Councillors debated the merits of living among deer and rabbits in an urban environment.
The ordinance attempts to make sense of a new population of wild animals who have found “new habitats in Cambridge’s urban environments" and asks City Manager Louis A. DePasquale to review Cambridge’s current plans for handling such animals. Councillor Craig A. Kelley, who proposed the policy order at Monday night’s City Council meeting, drew joking criticism when he listed bunnies alongside deer as a concern for residents.
Several other Councillors said they are fond of the City’s rabbit population.
“I don’t want to see us rounding up bunnies,” City Councillor Jan Devereux joked.
Councillor Leland Cheung added that rabbits often help manicure his lawn.
“They’re eating my lawn and my weeds perfectly,” Cheung said. “Let’s exclude bunnies, please.”
Also at the meeting, local government officials devised a plan to combat “light pollution” in the city. Both residents and Councillors noted that outdoor lighting from businesses is often too bright and distracting.
In a policy order proposed by Devereux and City Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, the city manager has one week to present a revised and simplified Outdoor Lighting Ordinance so that businesses are aware of lighting regulations for their storefronts.
The councillors wrote that “light pollution and excessive glare from outdoor lighting” present a health risk to Cantabrigians, and that the previous lighting guidelines were unclear and had too much “technical jargon.”
“It’s a health risk, it’s a stressor, and we really need to get control of outdoor lighting in our city,” Devereux said. “We need to do this.”
Councillors also discussed affordable housing initiatives that would place fees on real estate purchases over $2.5 million. Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., who sponsored the policy order, said the fee would be used to help fund future projects to research and expand affordable housing options in the City.“As the affordable housing crisis gets greater, we need to take bold steps to approach it,” Toomey said.
The fees proposed in Toomey’s Policy Order closely mirrors Massachusetts House Bill 3512, which also places a fee on large real estate transactions to generate funding for affordable housing. The councillors unanimously endorsed that bill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 20, 2017 at 12:21 p.m.
One year after the College’s largest class mandated that students purchase a $131 set of course materials, Economics 10 professor N. Gregory Mankiw is sticking with the system—but donating all royalties from the materials to charity.
Last year, Mankiw announced that students in the College’s introductory Economics course would have to purchase access to an online learning platform with a roughly $132 price tag to access required review materials, problem sets, and quizzes. Though Mankiw said at the time that he had negotiated to obtain a lower price for the course, many students criticized the move, arguing that the materials were too expensive for a popular introductory course.
This year, the 633 students enrolled in Economics 10a will still be required to purchase the course pack. But, in the course’s syllabus, Mankiw wrote that he would now “donate to charity all royalties earned from Ec 10 students’ purchase of these materials.”
Mankiw also noted in the syllabus that the course package also includes materials for the second semester of Economics 10, for a per-semester cost of about $66.
Still, some current Ec 10 students said they felt that the mandatory course package—which cannot be resold—was too expensive for the course, a gateway to the economics department and other social sciences concentrations.
After Ec 10 mandated the $132 course pack, the Committee on Undergraduate Education added a question about the cost of course materials to the Q Guide.
But for George F. Wang ’21, another Ec 10 student, the cost is worth it.
“I think it’s important to keep things in perspective. We’ve already paid close to tens of thousands of dollars for a Harvard education,” Wang said. “I think, if you are here at Harvard and make the most of Harvard and that takes an extra $100, so be it.”
Some also criticized the online software itself.
“In all honesty, I don’t find it that helpful,” said Davis J. Tyler-Dudley ’20.
Thomas H. Baranga, the head section leader for the course, acknowledged in an email that “the MindTap software is imperfect,” but wrote that he thought most of the problems had been cleared up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 19, 2017 at 11:25 a.m.
Amid tensions over the Institute of Politics’ choices for this semester’s visiting fellows, more than 600 Harvard alumni have signed an open letter calling on the IOP to retract its fellowships for Corey Lewandowski and Sean Spicer, two former aides to President Donald Trump.
The petition, delivered Monday to University President Drew G. Faust, Kennedy School of Government Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, and IOP staff,  argues that inviting Lewandowski and Spicer to be fellows gives “intellectual and moral legitimacy – in this case, to those who have done much to degrade public discourse in this country, re-ignite white nationalism, and further reactionary policies that harm millions.”
“We thought that as Alumni, Harvard reflects on us, as well,” said Talia B. Lavin ’12, one of the organizers of the petition.  “And I think we should have a voice, and an extra responsibility to raise our voices and say, ‘You know, this is not an action that is fitting of the University that I got my degree from, and that I chose.’”
Lavin, Paul B. VanKoughnett ’12, and Pete D. Davis ’12,  who have been friends since they were undergraduates, said they decided to take action when they heard Lewandowski and Spicer had been appointed as fellows. They drafted a petition and circulated it to fellow alumni.
 Lewandowski served as Trump’s campaign chairman from its start until June 2016, when he was fired after police charged him with misdemeanor battery of a reporter. Spicer, who served as White House Press Secretary until July 2017, was widely criticized for his combative relationship with the press and false statements he made from behind the podium.
“Harvard’s motto is Veritas. You cannot hold that up and invite Sean Spicer, an incompetent liar,” Lavin said.
The IOP has come under fire in the last week over its selection of visiting fellows for the semester. Selected fellows occasionally come to campus to engage with students and faculty on political work.
Last week, the appointment of Chelsea E. Manning, a former U.S. soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks, as a visiting fellow drew conservative backlash, escalating when CIA director Mike Pompeo refused to attend a speaking engagement at the IOP in protest.
Hours later, the IOP withdrew its fellowship invitation to Manning.
The reversal unleashed an even larger backlash, this time mainly from liberals who accused Harvard of caving to government pressure in snubbing Manning.
“When they rescinded Chelsea Manning’s fellowship they admitted that the title of visiting fellow conveys a certain imprimatur of legitimacy. So they’re tacitly granting the same imprimatur of legitimacy to Spicer and Lewandowski, and I just don’t think that’s acceptable,”  Lavin argued.
VanKoughnet said ultimately, his team acted out of a worry that the IOP featuring Spicer and Lewandowski would normalize political stances they found troubling.
“There’s this idea...that it’s just speech, just people talking, and they can disagree at the end of the day, and whatever.  But it actually has a real-world effect, and that’s what we’re worried about,” VanKoughnet said. “We’re worried that the further normalization of these men and of Trumpist ideas are going to have awful material effects on people in the real world.”
An IOP spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As athletes return to the courts and fields, some will be stepping into a new role—“chief marketing officer”—as part of a new initiative within the Athletics Department aimed at boosting game attendance and team awareness.
As “CMOs” for their teams, student athletes will work with Athletics marketing and communications staff to promote important games and publicize team events and games in the Houses. The new program seeks to increase communication and support between the College’s 42 varsity teams and Athletics marketing department, according to Associate Director of Athletics Susan Byrne.
The head coaches from each team have recommended student athletes to serve as the chief marketing officers for their teams for this year. The position is not paid.
“We hope that they can serve as a liaison to the marketing department,” Byrne said. “We’ll be here as a resource for them, and then they really will act as their team’s brand ambassador.”
Student CMOs will also be involved in coordinating the student rewards program, an Athletics initiative that using the Harvard CrimZone Rewards mobile app to promote certain games by giving away Harvard merchandise or advertising free food.
Students involved in the program will attend three meetings with the marketing and communications staff throughout the year in addition to working with them on specific team projects. Athletics administrators stress that the new responsibilities will be manageable with student’s academic and athletic schedules.
“It’s more than just Tweeting a picture from practice, and it’s supposed to be,” said Timothy J. Williamson, a spokesperson for the department. “But obviously knowing that for someone on the team, with all the commitments they have, it’s not going to be an all-day, everyday thing.”
Initial response to the initiative has been positive, according to Byrne. Head coach for women and men’s squash Michael D. Way emphasized the potential of the new marketing program to help smaller teams promote the team and grow their fan bases.
“When you think of football and basketball and probably even ice hockey, it’s not too tough to get bums in the seats,” he said. “For the smaller sports, of which we are one, anything that is going to promote our program and promote our sport and hopefully raise awareness and increase attendance is a going to get our attention.”
Way said he hopes that students involved as the chief marketing officers for the men’s and women’s teams will be able to bridge the gap between the Athletics Department and the broader Harvard student body, especially when it comes to raising attendance at big events like the women’s national competition.
“Anything that can get more students to cross that bridge, the chasm between Harvard Athletics and the campus, and get them to court is also going to help,” he said.
In addition to increased communication between the varsity teams, the Athletics Department, and the College, Byrne emphasized that the new initiative provides student athletes with additional leadership and networking opportunities.
“I think there is a lot of opportunity to learn on the parts of the students and put this leadership role on their resume,” she said.
The program will kick off on Wednesday evening with the new chief marketing officers' first meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 19, 2017 at 4:42 p.m.
A School of Public Health student is among a half dozen undocumented young people suing President Donald Trump over his move to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Filed in a San Francisco federal court Monday, the lawsuit charges that the Trump administration violated the due process rights of young people protected from deportation under DACA.
Jirayut “New” Latthivongskorn, a master’s candidate at the School of Public Health and medical student at the University of California-San Francisco, is among the plaintiffs bringing the lawsuit. He is joined by five other “Dreamers”—undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children—in the case, the first to be brought against the Trump administration by DACA recipients.
According to the lawsuit, the plaintiffs have each “achieved remarkable success through hard work, fierce determination, and incredible resilience.”
“The decision to end the DACA program is a broken promise and an unprecedented violation of the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and other young people who relied on the federal government to honor that promise,” the lawsuit read.
Latthivongskorn, who came to the United States from Thailand at age nine, said in an interview that he didn’t realize the implications of his immigration status until he was denied financial aid as an college undergraduate. Latthivongskorn said DACA gave him “a sense of security” and a way to “give back to the community” as a doctor.
“The way that the government is taking away this program is done so without administrative procedure and will violate due process,” Latthivongskorn said. “All those goals and aspirations that I have and for the communities I work with will not be realized with this decision.”
School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams also released a statement on Monday urging Congress to create a "permanent legislative solution" for DACA and voicing her support for Latthivongskorn.
"We stand behind Mr. Latthivongskorn without reservation," the statement read. "As a dedicated student of medicine and public health, Mr. Latthivongskorn offers an outstanding example of the value that immigrants—both documented and undocumented—provide to communities across this nation."
According to the complaint, Latthivongskorn said he was robbed at gunpoint while an undergraduate at UC-Berkeley, but did not report the crime out of fear of deportation. Before DACA was announced, he was initially turned down from several medical schools because “no medical school would invest their resources in training someone who might not be able to stay in the United States,” the complaint reads.
The lawsuit’s other plaintiffs include two middle school teachers who work with at-risk youth, a formerly homeless attorney, a Ph.D. candidate in clinical psychology, and a law student. Harvard Law professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 is on the legal team providing the Dreamers pro bono counsel.
Since the inception of the policy in 2012, DACA has granted renewable, temporary work permits to over 850,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. On September 5, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the federal administration will end the program in six months.
The decision prompted widespread condemnation from Harvard students, faculty, and administrators. Shortly after Sessions’ announcement, University President Drew G. Faust wrote an email to Harvard affiliates that “this cruel policy recognizes neither justice nor mercy.”
Later that day, hundreds of Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents gathered at Memorial Church in protest of the proposed end to DACA. Two days later, 31 professors from Harvard and other Boston-area universities were arrested for blocking traffic on Mass Ave. in protest of the federal government’s decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard unveiled the list of students who will formally weigh in on the University’s ongoing presidential search Tuesday—the last of three advisory committees the search committee promised to appoint after University President Drew G. Faust announced she will step down next summer.
Third-year Law student and Cabot House tutor Jyoti Jasrasaria ’12 will chair the 18-member committee, which includes at least one representative from each of Harvard’s 12 degree-granting schools. Students will “provide advice to the presidential search committee” and “assist in ensuring broad outreach to the wider Harvard community,” according to the announcement.
“As the presidential search progresses, we look forward to benefiting from the varied perspectives of this impressive group of students from many different parts of Harvard,” said William F. Lee ’72, senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation and chair of the presidential search committee.  “We hope and expect both to learn from their insights and experience, and to enlist their help in ensuring that we are hearing views of a wider range of students about Harvard and its future.”
This presidential search is only the second in recent memory to formally involve student input. The 2006 search committee appointed the first student advisory body after students decried their exclusion from the secretive process in 2000.
Two days after Faust announced she would step down, Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 sent an email to Lee, requesting a meeting to discuss the process. Student leaders called for an expanded role in the search, with some urging the search committee to add students to their ranks.
The search committee—comprised of the 12 members of the Harvard Corporation plus three members of the Board of Overseers—has not taken that step, opting instead to create a separate advisory body as in 2006.
The search committee appointed faculty and staff committees in August, two months after Faust made public her intention to leave her post. Lee also sent a Harvard-wide email over the summer, calling on University affiliates to submit their thoughts on the search to a designated email address—an overture the University repeated in Tuesday’s announcement.
The search remains in "information-gathering" mode, according to a member of the search committee.
The full composition of the student search committee is below:
• Jyoti Jasrasaria ’12 (chair), Harvard Law School
• Grace Cho, Harvard Extension School
• Christopher Cleveland ’14, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
• Carlos Estrada Alamo, Harvard Medical School (joint with Harvard Business School)
• Thomas Fox, Harvard Kennedy School of Government
• Eamon O’Connor, Graduate School of Design (joint with Harvard Kennedy School of
Government)
• Bora Plaku-Alakbarova, Harvard Chan School of Public Health
• Federico Roitman ’18, Harvard College
• Lisa Utzinger Shen, Harvard Graduate School of Education
• Nina Srivastava ’18, Harvard College
• Roodolph St. Pierre, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
• Jacob Steiner, Harvard Law School
• Taylor Stewart, Harvard Divinity School
• Kelly Suralik, Harvard School of Dental Medicine
• Nathaniel Vincent ’20, Harvard College
• Becca Voelcker, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
• Andrea Weber, Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
• Kenneth Zauderer, Harvard Business School

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past three seasons, Harvard has lost only four games. In those same seasons, Rhode Island has won only four. Saturday’s contest increased both numbers to five.
The Crimson came into the season’s inaugural matchup with history on its side. Not only had Harvard never lost to the Rams, but also the Crimson had won the past two matchups by at least 30 points.
Further, Harvard had not dropped a season opener since 2011. But history is apt to change, and the Crimson figured out pretty quickly.
“We knew it was a different Rhode Island,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They were the better coached team today, they played better than we did, and they deserved to win “
While the Crimson got on the board first with a field goal, the Rams responded with a 51-yard touchdown pass eight minutes later. Rhode Island never looked back, taking the upset victory, 17-10, and picking up its first win of the season.
ABERCROMBIE INJURED
Harvard maintained its initial 3-0 lead throughout the first quarter. The woes began with the start of the second.
Barely over a minute into the quarter, tragedy struck. Rolling to the left, Rams junior quarterback Tyler Harris found classmate Marven Beauvais on an 18-yard route. As he caught the ball, Beauvais touched down by the Crimson sideline only to be pushed out by the barreling Ben Abercrombie, a Harvard freshman corner. Rhode Island converted the first down, but Abercrombie did not return to his feet.
Surrounded by his teammates, Abercrombie lay on the ground for several minutes with medical personnel working on him.  Attendants eventually placed him on a stretcher, removed him from the field, and took him to a Rhode Island hospital. The scene affected both teams.
“In spite of a great victory for the University of Rhode Island football team...our most prevalent thoughts are for Ben Abercrombie, who sustained a significant injury today,” said Rams’ coach Jim Fleming in a post-game interview. “Our thoughts and prayers today are with him and his family for a speedy recovery.”
The injury must have rattled the Crimson, and on the very next play, Rhode Island sensed it. The Rams struck hard on the next play. Harris hit his sophomore wideout Aaron Parker on a 51-yard streak that finished in the end zone. The Rams took their first lead of the afternoon and did not trail again.
After the game, Harvard Athletics  circulated an email statement reporting that Abercrombie had undergone surgery to address a serious cervical injury. The message also reported that he did not have feeling in his arms or legs but is experiencing normal brain functions.
“Our hearts go out to Ben and his family right now, and they have our full support,” the statement continued. “We are doing all that we can in aiding in his recovery.”
NOWHERE TO GO
It naturally follows that in order to win games, you need to score points. On Saturday, Harvard lacked in this particular category, especially when compared to previous seasons. In 2015 and 2016, the Crimson put up 41 and 51 points, respectively, in its season-opening games. On Saturday, the program barely hit double digits.
One factor contributing to this lackluster offensive performance was the field positioning that the team faced on nearly every drive. The Rams’ freshman punter, Satchel Dento, was exceptional. Out of his five punts, four landed within the Crimson 20. In contrast, Harvard’s punter, senior Zach Schmid, landed only a third of his six punts in the red zone.
Denton didn’t just land the ball in the red zone, though—he pinned the Crimson solidly against its goal line and left Harvard’s explosive returner, junior receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley, with only one attempted punt return. Denton dropped kicks at the 12, 7, 35, 12, and 14. Shelton-Mosley attempted a return on the punt by the 35, earning a hard-fought 13 yards. The rest of the kicks either were fair-caught, downed, or rolled out of bounds, stymying any opportunity for the Crimson to start at a favorable position.
A LEAKY FRONT
Field position wasn’t the only hindrance to the Harvard offense. The Crimson’s blocking upfront proved weak. That weakness disrupted nearly every play. Many times, senior quarterback Joe Viviano was flushed from the pocket. And many times, junior running back Charlie Booker III hit a wall at the line of the scrimmage. Harvard couldn’t secure the backfield, and the whole offense suffered as a result.
“Offensively, we just weren’t in sync enough. No excuses for that. First game or not, we just weren’t in sync,” Murphy said. “We know on our schedule [that] everybody’s good,everybody’s well coached, and every game is going to be a dog fight.”
In a stark comparison to Rhode Island, the Crimson’s backfield was sacked five times for 33 yards. The Rams lost only seven yards on two sacks. Viviano finished with negative rushing yards on the game. The senior lost a total of 36 yards and picked back up enough to finish with -19 on the afternoon.
The most salient instance of the breakdown of the offensive front came at Harvard’s time of greatest need. The drive began at the team’s own 14-yard line. The Crimson drove the length of the field to the Rhode Island 16. A few short runs landed Harvard seven yards from the goal. With just above six minutes left to play, the team faced a fourth-and-one conversion. In unison with the snap of the ball, two defenders broke immediately through the line, hitting Viviano as he faked a handoff. The quarterback coughed up the pigskin into the chest of the awaiting defensive back Momodou Mbye. That turnover ended a drive that had bled 5:23 off the fourth quarter clock.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team opened its fall play with the annual Chowder Fest tournament at home. The Crimson hosted Buffalo, Notre Dame, and Wisconsin at the Beren Tennis Center throughout the three-day tournament.
Wisconsin senior Josef Dodridge was the singles champion, with Harvard co-Captain Kenny Tao finishing as the runner-up in singles, with a 2-1 record for the weekend. On the doubles side, Dodridge and his partner Wisconsin senior Chema Carranza claimed the championship, with the Crimson’s junior Christopher Morrow and sophomore Logan Weber as the runner-up doubles pair with a 2-2 record.
“It was great getting back into the season and opening up with a strong weekend,” Tao said. “I was a bit shaky going in because I hadn’t played much all summer, but this definitely boosted my confidence and set a tone for the rest of the season.”
DAY THREE
On Sunday, the Crimson won five of its eight singles matches, with victories coming from Tao, senior Jean Thirouin, Lee, Weber, and senior Xavier Gonzalez. Tao defeated Wisconsin junior Osgar O’Hoisin in Flight 1 in straight sets to earn the title of singles runner-up.
Lee had a rollercoaster game against his Buffalo opponent, taking the first set, dropping the second, and winning the third. Weber also had a three-set battle against a Buffalo opponent, coming from behind to win 2-1.
On the doubles side, Harvard won three of its five matches. Morrow and Weber beat out their Notre Dame opponents 6-4, while senior Grant Solomon and junior Sam Beren handily defeated their Notre Dame opponents 6-1. Lee took to the court for doubles as well with junior Michael Peters, and the pair overcame their Buffalo opponents 6-4.
The freshmen had the opportunity to gain some valuable game time in doubles play. Tao partnered with rookie Lucas Koelle, barely giving up the doubles point 7-5. Thirouin and freshman Robertas Wrzesinksi also had a close match against their Wisconsin opponents, ending 7-5 as well.
“As a team it was good seeing the freshmen in action for the first time,” Beren said, “Everyone was excited to compete after a long summer of working on our games.”
DAY TWO
On Saturday, of the 10 singles matches that the Crimson played, Harvard took home two wins. Tao defeated his Wisconsin opponent in straight sets, 6-1, 6-0, and Weber rallied after dropping the first set to take the next two sets form his Wisconsin opponent.
Solomon, put up a fight against his Wisconsin opponent, falling by only 7-6, 7-5. Beren also came back in the second set of his match after dropping the first setbut was ultimately unable to come back.
The Crimson also played 10 doubles matches, with four pairs playing two matches each. Morrow and Weber again took home a win for Harvard, eking out a win over their Wisconsin opponents 8-7, but fell to another Wisconsin pair 8-2.
Thirouin and Peters also split their two matches, beating out a Wisconsin duo 9-8, but falling to a Buffalo pair 8-4. Tao and Koelle teamed up for two matches as well, giving up both to their Wisconsin opponents.
Beren alone won both the doubles matches he played in. Against a Notre Dame duo, Beren teamed up with Andrew Ball to claim the victory 8-5. Beren and Wrzesinksi also took home an 8-5 win later that day against a Wisconsin duo.
“It felt good. It was the first time my family has come to watch me play so it was really fun playing well in front of them,” Beren said.
DAY ONE
Friday afternoon marked the first day of the tournament and the Crimson squad’s first competitive play this season.
Eight singles players took to the courts, with rookies Koelle and Wrzesinski, Morrow, Solomon, and Lee all taking home wins. “Overall our team is looking good. Our freshmen are very talented and we have a lot to work with,” Tao said.
Tao, Beren, and Thirouin all fell to their opponents in close three-set matchups.
On the doubles side, Harvard claimed two wins. Tao and Koelle earned their first doubles win, while Solomon and Lee defeated their Buffalo opponents 8-2.

Ah, Sophomore fall: a time to put down those Pumpkin Spice Lattes and pick up some social climbing habits for punch season!  For the uninitiated, Punch might just be one of the rudest things on this campus already (aside from tourists that block the path to your 9 a.m. when you're already ten minutes late), so don't make our lives worse by committing these punch missteps.
Being “too busy” and taking three classes
No matter how cool you think you are, your social climbing ways should never take the time commitment of a fourth class (yes, even Hebrew Bible). The rest of us are out here trying to “play school” and we don’t need this reminder that you’re planning on using your final club connects to get a job while we struggle to maintain a decent GPA, even with grade inflation.
Slipping that you were punched by the PC into every conversation
Honestly, there’s something to be said for the fact that even calling it the PC (instead of the Porcellian) is rude by assuming that everyone knows what you’re talking about. Even so, we truly don’t care that you’re among the “chosen ones”, so just stop talking about it.
Wearing your cocktail business-casual attire and nametag the whole day
If you come to the dining hall in a suit with a nametag still on, you’re just asking us to ask you where you’ve been. There are only two possible answers: a recruiting event or a punch event, and neither bodes well for your image. This move is simply PDA—public display of attention seeking.
 Swarming the punchmasters and ditching your friends at the event
Don’t think we don’t know what you’re up to when you make a beeline (it’s a pun, get it?) to the punchmasters the second you step into the room. Like the good Harvard student you are, you see punch as a zero sum game where any chance of your friends' success detracts from your own. It’s rude.
This list is by no means exhaustive, since punch is a prime time for rudeness. But please, watch out for these glaring punch mistakes. And don’t be surprised if you find your friends calling you out with their new catch phrase: Dude, that’s rude.

Today is the last day you can add/drop a class. Or, actually, the last day you can add or drop a class for free.
If you're a professor reading this at the end of the day, chances are you're staring at your course enrollment and scratching your head. Where did all the students go? Surely the candy I gave them on the first day of shopping week was enough to trap them for the entire semester?
While we Harvard students are a ravenous breed, we're also extremely lazy and will not be duped by your cheap tricks. Here are a few likely reasons why your course enrollment shrank from 50 to 5.
A Spot Opened Up for a Class That's Way More Fun 
We were brutally honest when we slipped into your class during the last ten minutes it met on shopping week: this was our back up in case we didn't lottery into the class we really wanted to take. For a while, it looked like we'd be enrolled, but luckily for us, one of the other students ditched Harvard to launch a startup so we're so not dealing with the 500+ pages of reading you assign every week anymore. 
You assigned a response paper/blog post during shopping period 
Don't they teach manners in Kindergarten? There's an unspoken rule that you should not assign homework during shopping week. What motivation have we to complete your busy work when we're still having an existential crisis about what classes to take? If you assigned a response paper — or worse, a dreaded blog post! — during shopping period, rest assured there's a mass exodus that's going to happen today.
You scheduled a section on Friday at 8 a.m. 
Duh. What did you expect? That we would all give up our chance to rage on Thursday night, or trudge into section with a hangover?
The first class was great, but the second class was a snoozefest. 
Your class sounded great on paper (*ahem* Game of Thrones *ahem*) but the second lecture had us all running for the hills. Better luck next time.
Our awkward hookup is enrolled in the class
For once, it's not you, it's us. We hooked up with this person freshman year, and then never responded to their frantic texts. We know we're horrible, but we haven't quite hit that responsible adult age where we'll suck it up and subject ourselves to an hour-long awkward fest for the next semester.

With punch season in full swing and recruiting events happening all around campus, dress code etiquette can rank pretty high up on the list of unnecessarily nerve-wracking concerns. It's already tiring enough to make small-talk and regurgitate the same basic facts about yourself to 15 different people in half an hour. We shouldn’t need to waste even more time deciphering the seemingly endless list of dress codes tailored to each event. Here is a breakdown of what some of these cryptic codes mean, and how we can avoid any fashion faux pas in the future.
Semi-Casual Formal
AKA smart casual: an ambiguously-defined term that typically implies a look somewhere in between neat and casual. Different contexts, events, or venues can merit a ramping up or ramping down of "smart casual", so lookout for who’s dishing out this wardrobe assignment.
Business-Casual 
A standard favorite in the fashion world. Usually denoting a style that’s less formal than traditional business attire, but still gives off a professional vibe, this particular dress code calls for a subtle sophistication that says, “I’m calm and collected, but classy af.”
Business-Formal 
Generally the go-to for semi-formal events taking place during the day. Business-formal might be the move for conferences, business meetings, or an average day at the Porcellian.
Tea Attire 
Ah, the classically cryptic dress code. It implies some level of sophistication that nobody is quite sure how to classify. To be clear, nobody is attending the Kentucky Derby here. Fancy dresses and extravagant hats are not the way to go. It’s better to think “classy visit to afternoon tea with your favorite squad of grandmas.”
Cocktail 
Most are familiar with this recurring dress code calling for short dresses and suits and ties. Unlike other wardrobes, cocktail attire is your chance to spice things up a bit and bring your spunk to the party. This is what the average Harvard student might sport at formals.
Casual
Anything goes in the casual world, including jeans, sneakers, and even your ex-hookup’s athletic sweatshirt. While you probably won’t have the chance to sport this style at any punch events, the thought of your favorite sweats waiting for you back in your dorm will probably motivate you to power through your rounds all the more quickly.
We hope this guide can be of some service to you, no matter how minimal. The bottom line is: you are not alone. Dress code etiquette has us all equally screwed. Happy punching/recruiting!
