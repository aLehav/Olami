This article contains some spoilers for "Life of Pi."
“Life of Pi,” which is currently playing at the A.R.T. through Jan. 29 and set to move to Broadway in March, is filled with platitudes, but the play is not really about almost any of them; nor is it, thank God — or Allah, or Shiva, or a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker — a platitude itself, though it comes dangerously close.
The play, based on Yann Martel’s 2001 novel of the same name, follows an Indian teenager whose family, seeking a better life and political stability, embark on a journey to Canada. En route, a storm sinks their ship, leaving Pi (short for Piscine, after Paris’s Piscine Molitor; played by Adi Dixit) stranded on a lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra — all from the zoo run by the Patels — and the aforementioned Mr. Parker. That is the premise for most of the plot, which concerns itself with, one, Pi’s struggle to survive at sea, and, two, his recollection of his survival to Lulu Chen (Kirstin Louie) of the Canadian embassy and Mr. Okamoto (Daisuke Tsuji) of the corporation that owned the sunken cargo ship. Mr. Okamoto, who has an insurance report to fill out, is more than a little keen on getting the details right, and his resistance to Pi’s fantastical story serves as the central metaphor for the play, which is, quite explicitly, an allegory on religion.
Young Pi is a deeply religious man and a believer, above all, in playing all sides of the spiritual fence. In an early sequence, the Patels are visiting a market in the last days before their departure when they are confronted by representatives from a local mosque, church, and Hindu temple. It emerges that Pi has been visiting all three, for which the adults unanimously scold him: You have to pick one, because that’s how the “real world” works, his mother (Mahira Kakkar) tells him. Pi objects: “You all are asking me to choose between different versions of the same thing,” a protest supported by the tedious repetitiveness of the three clerics’ repeated pitches.
“Life of Pi” might be a different play if the Christian (Avery Glymph, who also plays a credible Navy Admiral) and the Hindu (Sathya Sridharan) got into an argument over the distinction between and relative merits of monotheistic and polytheistic frameworks for understanding the world, or if the Muslim (Salma Shaw) and the Christian entered into a detailed discourse on the ontological stability of the Trinity but there is no room for such discussions in “Life of Pi,” which takes up such subjects as reincarnation versus ascension to Heaven and discards them as frivolous and academic. This is one of the play’s weak points: If art is to take up philosophy, it must do so with some measure of rigor and depth. The moment when a thirst-addled Pi sees a vision of his sister demanding to know what kind of God would have allowed her to drown was probably quite astounding to all two or three members of the A.R.T. audience who had never encountered the problem of evil before.
Where “Life of Pi” succeeds is in its dramatic power and the ability to channel it into ideas. The play’s thesis is that since there is no evidence for or against God’s existence, the question of religious belief is really a choice: Which story do we like better?
Late in the play, the tiger story, already of tenuous realism, becomes unacceptably incredible when Pi reports that he and Richard Parker eventually landed on a carnivorous island. Mr. Okamoto demands to know once and for all what “really” happened to Pi, and Pi, giving in, tells a far more mundane story about the human survival instinct in dire straits. He asks Mr. Okamoto which story he prefers, and Mr. Okamoto admits that the animal story is better. “Yes, and so it goes with God,” Pi smiles while the music swells. The play ends on the revelation that Mr. Okamoto has chosen to recount Pi’s original version of events in his official report to the insurance company.
This shouldn’t work — and, indeed, the play could do without Pi’s Aesopian final line and the prerecorded “Behold! A theme!” music that follows it — but it does, because the puppetry that makes Richard Parker and his fellow animals come alive is so good, and Pi’s starving delirium and Crusoean survival techniques are so credible, that the story speaks for itself simply through how compelling it is.
It is true that we have seen puppetry before, and it is true that “Life of Pi”’s does not seem to break new ground, but neither fact detracts from this puppetry’s excellence. The animals’ motion is superb, and their design — fleshy, decaying, as if they are already dead the moment they prance onstage — lends “Life of Pi” a much-needed haunting edge. Richard Parker in particular moves with so lovely a skulk that we join Mr. Okamoto in choosing to believe in his existence at the play’s end. Sure, a carnivorous island is a stretch — but look at how his paws lift off the ground, and look at how his shoulders shift when he walks!
If “Life of Pi”’s final message is that epistemic virtue has less to do with rigorous provability than with the fullness or liveliness of a given narrative, it is a message that lands because of how fully “Life of Pi” has made itself felt to its audience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON – Federal prosecutors and defense attorneys sparred over the credibility of a self-described “middleman” in the alleged admissions bribery scheme between ex-Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand and a Harvard parent in closing arguments Tuesday.
The government alleged wealthy Maryland businessman Jie “Jack” Zhao paid $1.5 million in bribes to Brand in exchange for his sons’ recruitment and admission to Harvard College – while defense attorneys for both men contended that the prosecutors’ case had significant holes and a lack of supporting evidence.
On the eleventh day of trial, defense attorneys and prosecutors presented their closing arguments to jurors before an audience of spectators that spilled into two courtrooms — with Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. instructing the attendees in the second courtroom to view the proceedings over Zoom.
Defense attorneys sought to demonstrate that the government’s argument depended heavily on key witness Alexandre Ryjik, a fencing coach for Zhao’s sons who told jurors through three days of testimony that he arranged a deal between Zhao and Brand, facilitating the transfer of bribes through his charity to a nonprofit run by Brand.
In his closing argument, Brand’s attorney Douglas S. Brooks argued that Ryjik’s testimony could not be trusted and that Ryjik told prosecutors what they wanted to hear in exchange for a “get-out-of-jail-free card” in the form of an immunity deal.
“Alex Ryjik is a liar and a criminal that the government chose to let loose,” Brooks said. “They gave this thief, this cheat, this liar a license to commit crimes without any consequence.”
“Ryjik is the perfect cooperator because he will throw anyone under the bus to keep himself out of trouble,” said William D. Weinreb, an attorney for Zhao.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen E. Frank ’95 said in the government’s rebuttal that the case was not about Ryjik or his character but about the actions of Brand and Zhao.
“You’re going to have Mother Teresa be the middleman in this case?” Frank asked jurors. “No, you’re going to have Alex Ryjik.”
Frank told jurors they didn’t need to rely solely on Ryjik’s testimony — advising them to look at Zhao and Brand’s “own words” and actions as evidence of the scheme.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mackenzie A. Queenin began the government’s closing argument by reading aloud a May 2012 text from Brand to Ryjik — in which Brand appeared to solicit bribes for the recruitment of the Zhao brothers.
“Jack doesn’t need to take me anywhere and his boys don’t have to be great fencers,” Brand wrote. “All I need is a good incentive to recruit them[.] You can tell him that[.]”
“You know what that incentive was – money,” Queenin told jurors.
Throughout her closing remarks, Queenin presented slides with diagrams mapping out the alleged scheme, illustrating the series of transactions that made it up, and supporting the case with evidentiary documents presented throughout the past two weeks, including call records, emails, text messages, and checks.
Among the documents shown were signed agreements in which Brand attested he was aware of and would follow Harvard’s conflict of interest policies in his role.
“He knew what he was doing was wrong. The certifications are false, full stop,” Queenin said of the agreements.
Brand was dismissed from his position as head coach of Harvard’s fencing team in 2019 after an internal investigation conducted by the university found that he violated conflict of interest contracts by not disclosing payments from Zhao.
Brooks said the transactions between Zhao and Brand amid the recruiting process were not bribes, and whether or not Brand abided by Harvard’s conflict of interest policy was irrelevant to the charges.
“It might feel wrong, but it’s not a crime,” Brooks said. “A thank-you gift is a conflict of interest, not a bribe.”
Prosecutors sought to show that Zhao paid a series of bribes to Brand, challenging the legitimacy of these payments as loans or charitable donations.
Queenin referenced witness Darlene S. Lesser’s testimony during the fourth day of trial, who said that after donating $1 million to Ryjik’s charity, the National Fencing Foundation, Zhao asked for the money back when Ryjik refused to transfer all the funds to Brand.
“When you give a legitimate charitable donation, you don’t ask for the money back,” Queenin said. “You don’t reach into the Salvation Army jar and stick your hand around and pull your dollar back out.”
Brooks appealed for sympathy from the jury, arguing that Brand had “suffered devastation” and “incredible public humiliation” after the Boston Globe revealed his dealings with Zhao and Harvard fired him for violating its conflict of interest policy.
Queenin objected to these remarks, calling Brooks’ statements “highly prejudiced.”
Weinreb said the irregular financial exchanges could be explained by cultural differences, noting Zhao’s history of generous loans.
“It’s partially a Chinese cultural thing, and it’s partially just who Jack is,” he said. “But one thing that it isn’t is bribery.”
In the government’s rebuttal, Frank compared the cultural defense to “throwing a bunch of spaghetti up against the wall to see if anything sticks.”
Attorneys for Brand and Zhao sought to demonstrate that no one was harmed by the actions the government argued made up the bribery scheme.
“There is no victim,” Brooks said. “This is an alleged crime in search of a victim.”
Weinreb told jurors that the Zhao brothers’ recruitment benefited Harvard by bringing in money to the university and bolstering its fencing program, calling the sons “no-brainer recruits.”
Frank pushed back against the argument that no one was harmed in this case during his rebuttal.
“The victim was the entire college admissions system,” Frank said. “The victims were the tens of thousands of kids who apply to Harvard each year and do it in good faith and the millions of kids who apply to other colleges and universities.”
“They are all victims,” he added. “Because when the system is corrupted, everybody loses.”
The trial will resume Wednesday at 9 a.m., with the jury expected to begin their deliberations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 21, 2022 at 10:00 p.m.
BOSTON — Former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand and Harvard College parent Jie “Jack” Zhao are not guilty on all counts of a bribery scheme to recruit Zhao’s sons to Harvard, a jury decided Wednesday.
Federal prosecutors alleged Brand accepted over $1.5 million in kickbacks in exchange for recruiting Zhao’s two sons to Harvard’s fencing program. In 2020, Brand and Zhao were arrested and indicted on bribery charges, and in June 2021, a federal grand jury added a charge of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud.
But both men were acquitted after more than two weeks of trial, following a successful effort by defense attorneys for Zhao and Brand to portray the almost $500,000 Zhao used to erase Brand’s debts as personal loans that Brand intended to pay back with anticipated inheritance money.
Jurors came to the unanimous verdict after just over six hours of deliberation.
Immediately after the decision was announced, Zhao broke into a wide smile as his attorney William D. Weinreb patted him on the shoulder. Brand shook his head in relief and hugged each of his attorneys, R. Matthew Rickman and Douglas S. Brooks.
“I just want to thank my family for the last couple of years,” Zhao told reporters after proceedings concluded Wednesday. “I’m very happy.”
In a government statement released soon after the acquittal, U.S. Attorney Rachael S. Rollins wrote that “although we fundamentally disagree, we respect the verdict.”
The government's case relied heavily on self-described “middleman” Alexandre Ryjik, a fencing coach for Zhao’s sons who said he facilitated the transfer of bribes between Zhao and Brand. Brooks was able to cast doubt on Ryjik’s testimony in his closing remarks Tuesday, calling the key government witness “a liar and a criminal.”
“All of these holes add up, and they create a sinking ship of reasonable doubt,” Brooks told jurors Tuesday.
Throughout the trial, the defense called 11 witnesses to testify and presented hundreds of evidence exhibits to show that Zhao’s sons — Eric Y. Zhao ’18 and Edward Y. Zhao ’21 — deserved their acceptances to Harvard based on merit. The Zhao brothers testified on Monday, and their high school and college transcripts were displayed for the jury, as well as their full Harvard applications.
“The jury saw through Alex Ryjik’s lies,” Brooks told reporters after the verdict. “I think the jury recognized how incredible Eric and Edward Zhao were, and I think that made the difference.”
Attorneys for Brand and Zhao sought to demonstrate that neither of the defendants had motive to participate in the alleged bribery scheme and that none of the transactions were hidden from the public.
Brooks said during Tuesday’s closing remarks that no one executing a bribery scheme would have approached it the way the two men did, referencing the extensive paper trail documenting Brand and Zhao’s transactions.
“This would be the equivalent of going to rob a house, taking off your gloves, sticking your bare hands into a vat of black ink, and when you’re in that house, putting out your hands up against every white wall or table in the house,” Brooks said. “There could not be more fingerprints on this transaction if they tried.”
The acquittal comes on the heels of the high-profile Varsity Blues scandal that swept the nation in 2019 and ignited a global conversation on corruption in college admissions. As part of the scheme, 33 parents — including high-profile executives and celebrities — paid William “Rick” Singer, the CEO of a college admissions prep company, more than $25 million to inflate their children’s test scores and bribe admissions officers.
Rollins wrote in a statement that she was proud of her legal team’s work, adding that the case “exposed such profound levels of privilege, entitlement and wealth abusing the college admissions process.”
“Their efforts were not in vain,” she wrote. “This case and all of the college admissions prosecutions have led to significant reforms at colleges and universities across the country.”
Defense attorneys sought to show that no one was harmed by Zhao and Brand’s actions, and that the case had no victims. Weinreb said during the tenth day of trial that in all of the Varsity Blues cases, the judges ruled that there was “foreseeable economic harm done to the schools.”
“Once they were admitted, Eric and Edward paid full tuition to Harvard. They fenced all four years. Their family donated over $300,000 to Harvard generally and the fencing team,” Brooks told jurors on Tuesday. “Does that sound like Harvard was victimized to you?”
After the verdict was announced Wednesday, Weinreb told reporters, “We’re grateful to the jury for their service and thank them for doing justice in this case.”
The federal investigation into Zhao and Brand followed a 2019 Boston Globe report that Brand sold his Needham, Massachusetts home to Zhao for almost twice its market value.
The Boston Globe story prompted Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay to launch an internal investigation into Brand’s conduct later that day, which ultimately led to his firing for violating Harvard’s conflict of interest policies.
In addition to scrutinizing the 2016 house sale, the trial also delved into Brand’s short-lived charitable organization, the Peter Brand Foundation, which prosecutors alleged had been used to funnel $100,000 to Brand from a non-profit run by Ryjik.
Ryjik, a key government witness who claimed to broker a scheme between the two men, testified on the second day of the trial that he used his charity, the National Fencing Foundation, to facilitate the transfer with the understanding that the payment was to be used to secure admission for Zhao’s eldest son.
Brand’s wife, Jacqueline Phillips, testified on the eighth day of trial that the couple sold their Needham home to Zhao for what she believed was an accurate price, and that the foundation had been solely intended to direct grants to charitable causes.
“I took nothing from the foundation, not a dime,” she said during her testimony last week.
Brand thanked his wife in an impromptu press conference with reporters outside the courtroom Wednesday, appearing visibly relieved following the verdict.
“This is probably the greatest win in my lifetime,” Brand said.
