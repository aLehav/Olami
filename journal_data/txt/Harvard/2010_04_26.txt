After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For those living comfortably on the River, consider Quad life. Aside from the fastidious timing of schedules to match with shuttle times, Quad residents must spend 10 or so minutes traveling every time they want to go from their Houses to the Square or the Yard. The inconvenience of living in the Quad merits the Quad’s newest planned amenity: an ATM in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. As equality for Quadlings is long overdue, this move is one step toward making the Quad as desirable a location to live in as the River.
The Undergraduate Council deserves credit for lobbying for the ATM for over a year and a half. In particular, George J. J. Hayward ’11, an inactive Crimson editor and former UC presidential candidate, deserves praise for spearheading much of the ATM initiative. Hayward’s genuine interest in improving student welfare is laudable; his dedication in pursuing the issue shows he was interested in more than just making empty campaign promises.
Although we are pleased the SOCH is being used for its original purpose—improving the lives of students—the plans are not perfect. It is troubling that the current surcharge set for students who are not members of the bank set to install the ATM will be $1.75. As this will be the only ATM in the Quad, students who use it should not have to bear exorbitant fees given that students in River Houses have numerous ATM options available in Harvard Square, allowing them to choose an ATM which will not charge them a high fee. The UC Student Life Committee has said it will seek to eliminate or reduce the fee, and we hope it follows through.
In addition to protecting students’ checking balances, we hope that the College will line up appropriate security measures, such as a security guard and a camera.
Even though it will undoubtedly make life more convenient for Quadlings, the ATM is only a minor appeasement, considering that the College eliminated the Quad’s library and decreased shuttle schedules due to budget cuts. The College forces a sizable amount of students to live in the Quad, and both the UC and the College should continue to work on measures to improve Quad life. The UC itself helps to bridge students and the administration by channeling grievances into progressive proposals, and then it is up to the administration to turn students’ dreams into reality.
Coupled with the administration’s understanding that separate is not equal, the ATM and future proposals will ideally chip away at the discrepancies between life in the Quad and life on the River. With sustained effort, the Quad will receive all the amenities it deserves.

Sorry Jason Bourne, you’ve got to lose the second job on Wall Street. On Feb. 25, 2010, the House of Representatives adopted an amendment,  to the 2010 Intelligence Authorization Act, that restricts the ability of Central Intelligence Agency officers to hold a second job in the private sector. The amendment, which was sponsored by Representative Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), came as a reaction to a story published on Feb. 1 by Politico.
The article revealed the CIA’s practice of allowing employees, like the fictional Jason Bourne, to use their skills in the corporate world (provided they get approval) as a source of secondary income. This amendment  allows far fewer forms of secondary employment for Agency personnel, which is a serious threat to the strength of our country’s intelligence force.
Eshoo proposed the amendment, which would make the review process for outside employment more stringent, because she feels it is currently “a rubber stamp deal. No one’s really looking at it or keeping a close eye on it.” Her statements have suggested that instead, the government should allow considerably fewer forms of secondary employment. This would mean, for example, reconsidering jobs in “deception detection,” in which officers help private firms tell when executives are lying about their companies.
It is true that CIA officers only have the skills that make them valuable to their secondary employers because of CIA training. If they leave, their training, an expensive investment for the CIA, leaves with them. However, the reality is that once someone has been trained, they own the skills they have acquired.
Moreover, this type of employment is exactly what Agency employees not engaged in the field need to have. For them to use the skills that make them good agents to make a little extra money is good for everyone.
It is good for the Agency, because working in a job such as deception detection is the equivalent of Jason Bourne doing trick shots in the circus; he gets practice, and the circus gets customers. Financial firms get to use tested intelligence skills to make better market decisions, and the Agency gets employees that are better practiced, without having to pay for it.
Second incomes are also good for the agents, because they yield a lot of money, and officers’ monetary satisfaction is vital to the CIA. Many CIA officials already fear they will lose their most talented employees to the private sector because of better pay and reduced stress.
Currently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and the Drug Enforcement Association give employees full retirement benefits after 20 years to compensate for the stress inherent in their work. CIA officers do not get the same treatment. Furthermore, the  compensation given to the family of a CIA officer killed in action is smaller than that which any of the other agencies provide. And additionally, this is anything but a unique practice. Many government agencies—including the military—allow employees to hold secondary jobs, with approval.
Shouldn’t CIA employees be allowed to use the skills that they have acquired to provide for themselves in a way that the government won’t, if they get approval? Shouldn’t we just be thankful that they use their skills primarily in our nation’s service, even though there are many higher-paying options? As noted by CIA staff, the option for employees to use their unique talents in the private sector is the only way to prevent a “brain-drain.”
Eshoo said in support of her amendment, “The American people must have confidence that government employees are working in the best interests of the nation, not in their personal self-interest.” It’s a nice sentiment, and in an ideal world it would be true. But if Eshoo gets her way, the next time Robert Ludlum publishes a story, don’t be surprised if Jason Bourne is working full-time for Goldman Sachs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, I joined my fellow seniors for a nostalgic rendezvous at Annenberg, courtesy of the Senior Swap dinner. As I was helping myself to water, I noticed a little sign above the coffee maker that read something to the effect of, “Our coffee grounds are an essential component of Harvard’s new, all-natural fertilizer.” In any case, it was one more proof of how Harvard’s new slogan “Green is the new Crimson” has permeated campus life.
Over the course of the past decade, green culture and investments in green technology have skyrocketed in the U.S. From 2004 to 2005, sales of the hybrid Toyota Prius nearly doubled, as they did again from 2006 to 2007. Green construction, unknown just 10 years earlier, had by 2007 blossomed into a $12 billion industry. Shoppers everywhere have started toting around little reusable sacks as an eco-friendly alternative to the disposable paper and plastic bags of yore.
But this interest in going green has been accompanied by a growing demand for energy—a demand that is expected, according to the Energy Information Administration, to rise nearly 26 percent by 2030. In my class on thermodynamics last semester, fuel-cell technology received a lot of attention, and I’ve been flagged down countless times by insistent, blue-shirted activists who solicit signatures for the proposed wind farm on Nantucket Sound. However, there is another technology being embraced by the proponents of green technology and by evolving government policy, that is making headlines. It generates no carbon dioxide, its marginal cost of production is extremely low, and it has proven reliable. It’s nuclear.
A detailed report by IBISWorld stated, “Although concerns over the safety of nuclear power plants, especially relating to waste disposal, are likely to persist, rising concern over climate change is expected to improve the image of nuclear power.” This is indeed proving to be the case, with two-thirds of self-described environmentalists now declaring in favor of nuclear energy. All told, 67 percent of all Americans are now positively disposed toward constructing new nuclear power plants, with 46 percent emphatically so.
Already 19.6 percent of all the United States’ energy comes from nuclear sources, and although the most recent plant to come online did so in 1977, the green proponents are pushing for a wave of new construction. According to the Department of Energy website, the Nuclear Power 2010 program unveiled in 2002 “has succeeded in building momentum toward a ‘nuclear renaissance’ in which nuclear plants are effective options for zero-carbon electricity production.” Together with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, this program put in place a set of initiatives that provide for some degree of cost sharing between the DOE and industry and expedite “approval for construction and new plant designs.”
For example, the process of obtaining government approval for building new nuclear reactors will be streamlined by developing standard certification procedures for certain generic types of reactors. Also, the “early site permit” component allows firms to receive government approval for their proposed site prior to making their final go-ahead decision. The program sets up a mechanism for firms to simultaneously obtain construction and operating licenses, with the latter conditional on the plant being built to specification. Furthermore, specific provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 offer tax breaks, cost-over run aid (up to $2 billion for the first six new nuclear power plants), and various types of loan guarantees.
Once up and running, nuclear power plants can be very economically efficient: According to the World Nuclear Organization, “The operational cost of nuclear power—1.87 cents/kWh in 2008—is 68 percent of electricity cost from coal and a quarter of that of gas.”
Furthermore, nuclear power plants have the advantage of being proven technology: France, a technology leader, has used nuclear energy for nearly 50 years and since the 1970s has gone from being an electricity importer to the largest exporter in the world. France itself obtains 78.8 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources, and with its pressurized water reactors, France has yet to experience any major accidents.
In response to the Nuclear Power 2010 program and Energy Policy Act, the DOE has already received 17 new applications to build 26 new nuclear reactors. With the growing demand for clean technologies, energy companies have banded together to form three separate consortiums, each of which has been granted early site permits. These consortia carry the technical expertise and solid credibility of established U.S. and international organizations, including players such as General Electric, Constellation Energy, Westinghouse Electric, EDF Energy, AREVA, Bechtel Corporation, and Duke Energy.
According to Cold War era satirist Fred Lehrer, “when the earth becomes uranious, we will all go simultaneous…oh, we’ll all fry together when we fry.” However, with nuclear power rising to the forefront as the new green, it seems he may have gotten it backward. It actually looks like nuclear may prove a valuable ally in the fight against global warming.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday marked the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, and the celebration showed that if there’s one thing America can do, it’s take something sacred and stamp signs of corporate profiteering all over it. In California, Chevron and PG&E, two of the state’s biggest polluters, headlined an Earth Day event. Toymaker F.A.O. Schwartz used the eco-holiday to push its line of Greenzys plush dolls made from soy fibers, while companies like Disney and Pottery Barn are giving away baseball caps and plants. Even the National Park system tried to get in on the act, offering free admission. Okay, that last one actually makes sense.
The corporate hypocrisy is aimed at wooing consumers, who, in spite of everything, still seem to care about the environment. Even in this recession, four out of five consumers actively target “green” products, even if they are more expensive. Exactly why they care is still open to debate—a recent study at the University of Minnesota  showed that people are more likely to buy eco-conscious goods in public rather than online, suggesting that buying green may be a way of exerting status.
Unlike consumers, corporations have no reason at all to care about the environment, and if they are publicly held companies, it would actually be criminal to put environmental concerns ahead of their bottom line. Free-market stalwarts argue that consumer preference for green products will cause corporations to adopt their own high standards of environmental ethics. However, if many consumers care more about the perception of being green than about actually making eco-conscious decisions, these corporations will simply promote their products as green, regardless of whether their environmental record warrants it. Until the average consumer has enough time and energy to verify all the claims they see on packaging (read: never), corporations will continue to disingenuously promote their products as eco-friendly, a technique known as “greenwashing.”
Broadly speaking, greenwashing refers to marketing campaigns by major corporations to rebrand themselves as eco-friendly, even though their practices continue to hurt the environment.Though it has increased in recent years, greenwashing is as old as the environmental movement itself.  In 1969, even before the first Earth Day, public utilities spent eight times more money on advertising their reductions in pollution than they did on the anti-pollution research itself.
The biggest greenwashers in recent decades have been energy companies. In the 1980s, Chevron’s “People Do” campaign included a series of TV ads featuring the company and its employees saving the world. Two years later, polls in California found that Chevron was the oil company Californians trusted most to protect the environment. Similarly, the oil supplier BP (formerly British Petroleum) launched a $200 billion green rebranding campaign in 2000, which included the slogan “beyond petroleum” and adopted a new green, yellow, and white sunburst logo. However, a study by Greenpeace in 2009 found that BP only allocated 6.8 percent of its funds to non-fossil-fuel energy sources.
Oil companies’ biggest eco-crime is pollution, most of which is still legal despite being a textbook example of an economic externality. In most cases, society—not the polluter—has to pay the long-term cleanup costs. But if Uncle Sam won’t make certain kinds of pollution illegal, it can certainly cut down on false advertising. The Federal Trade Commission tried to set guidelines for environmental marketing in 1998, which included a section that allowed the agency to act when companies were misrepresenting their business practices through advertising. Sadly, the FTC filed no complaints against greenwashers during the Bush years, and by February of this year, only seven have been filed under the Obama administration. However, the guidelines are currently under review, which will ideally yield stronger restrictions against polluters.
Rather than simply expose fraudulent advertising, however, the federal government should also set up a national labeling system for products so that consumers don’t have to do the hard work on their own. Ideally, every product would be stamped with a list of its component materials and their origins, like nutrition facts for manufactured goods. More practically, the government could set up several certification boards in industries from lumber to consumer electronics which identify products made using sustainable practices.
Greenwashing has yet to be a problem for universities, but the temptation is surely growing as environmental rankings proliferate. Harvard scores very highly in the environmental rankings of colleges, although a recent Crimson article found that the University may have trouble meeting its goal of reducing emissions by 30 percent. Additionally, Harvard sometimes falsely lumps its successes in related areas under the heading of environmentalism: For example, the HUDS sustainable dinner last Thursday was probably the only Earth Day-related event most Harvard students witnessed, whereas wildlife conservation and global warming are arguably much more important issues to Massachusetts. Ideally, Harvard will continue to lead by example in having high environmental aspirations matched by concrete actions to save the planet.

Second-year Master’s in Public Policy candidates at the Harvard Kennedy School completed their Policy Analysis Exercises earlier this month, addressing real-world problems for a variety of national and international clients.
The Policy Analysis Exercise is intended to provide a “capstone experience” integrating the skill set and knowledge cultivated through the Public Policy curriculum, according to Debra E. Isaacson, director of the Master’s in Public Policy program.
“The goal is to give students an opportunity to go out into the world and to solve the world’s most intractable problems,” she added.
Exploring a diverse set of topics individually or in groups, students said they were eager to make full use of the opportunity to translate theory into practical application.
Jonathan H. Faull, a second-year Master’s in Public Policy candidate, designed his Policy Analysis Exercise to evaluate the practices employed by the European Investment Bank in the Mediterranean region.
“It was a very memorable experience to engage critically and creatively with a set problems that have real implications,” Faull said of his experience traveling to Jordan and Tunisia. While he was there, he said he and his partner had the opportunity to meet with officials, delegation members, and members of industry associations.
According to Faull, his analysis was designed to critique the EIB’s practices and ultimately offer the organization specific recommendations.
“Every indication that we have is that the EIB is appreciative of our recommendations and that they will consult them in the future,” Faull said, adding that he and his partner may present their findings to the management of the EIB this summer.
Through his Policy Analysis Exercise, Mark S. Bell, another second-year Master’s in Public Policy candidate, offered recommendations to the U.S. Department of Defense concerning U.N. Resolution 1540, a resolution that created guidelines to curtail the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Noting that “it was nice to do something that was developing in real time,” Bell noted the uniqueness of the Policy Analysis Exercise.
“I think the combination of doing academically rigorous work with work that has the potential to have a real impact on policy is key to everything that gets done at the Kennedy School,” Bell said.
“It’s not something you really get in undergraduate or post-graduate courses anywhere else,” he added.
Bell said he hopes to present his findings with his partner to the Department of Defense in May, and that his Policy Analysis Exercise will continue to play a role in the future of the debate.
Another second-year Master’s in Public Policy candidate, Antoniya M. Owens, chose to analyze the demographics of the teaching workforce across the state of Massachusetts in order to forecast what areas may suffer teacher shortages in the future.
Owens presented her findings to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education last month, and expressed gratitude that the Kennedy School provides the opportunity for in-depth policy analysis.
“I’m definitely glad that the Policy Analysis Exercise was offered. It synthesizes and encapsulates all the work that you yourself, as a student, are capable of doing,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High school seniors and their families traveled from all regions of the country and the globe to Cambridge this weekend, hoping to sample life at Harvard before making their college decisions.
The visiting students, about 1,000 of the 2,110 admitted to the Class of 2014, were treated to a weekend jam-packed with panels, presentations, and parties.
University President Drew G. Faust described this attempt to lure students to Harvard in terms of a romantic relationship during her speech to the prefrosh on Saturday.
“We’re ready for the long-term commitment, and you’re still checking us out,” she said.
Faust recounted stories of students’ successes in a variety of fields and emphasized several new initiatives at Harvard, including the the Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentration and the College’s increased emphasis on the arts.
“That’s Harvard, the research university that puts no ceiling on your mind and your imagination,” she said.
The admitted students—who filled Sanders Theater and spilled into Science Center B, where the presentation was simulcast—inquired mainly about academics at Harvard. They questioned the president about cross-registration at MIT, opportunities for field work in biology, and the effect of attending Harvard College on acceptance to a Harvard graduate program.
However, several visiting students said they were glad to find out during the weekend about the non-academic side of student life.
“Some people get really drunk a lot, based on what my host says,” said Michael F. Trang. “I think you will get the college experience even though it’s Harvard.”
“I’m really glad to see how open and almost aggressively friendly everyone is,” said Michael E. Mitchell, noting the students outside the Science Center and Annenberg who peppered prefrosh with flyers for their student groups’ activities. “It’s very easy to stereotype Harvard students. I really feel like I’ve been welcomed.”
In addition to over 100 events hosted by student organizations, prefrosh were invited to performances, social events, and panels on topics like “What It’s Like to Be a Harvard Freshman,” “Queer Life at Harvard,” and “Financing a Harvard Education.”
Today, most academic departments will hold open houses, and students are invited to sit in on classes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than two weeks after announcing to the Computer Science 50 course staff that the class would be offered satisfactory/unsatisfactory next fall, course instructor David J. Malan ’99 wrote in an e-mail to teaching fellows and course assistants Saturday night that “sufficiently many concerns have arisen” such that “SAT/UNSAT will not happen this fall after all.”
In an e-mailed statement to The Crimson, Malan also wrote that there are no longer plans to implement sat/unsat for CS50 at any point in the immediate future, meaning students will only be able to take the course graded or pass/fail.
Within a few days of Malan’s April 15 announcement of a new grading plan, faculty within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences voiced worries about whether changing the CS50 grading scheme would complicate students’ abilities to take the class for credit.
While Malan’s preliminary sat/unsat plan would still have allowed students to take the course for a grade in order to satisfy concentration or General Education requirements—or if they simply wanted to receive a letter grade—SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray said that any final decision on the grading structure would have required a faculty vote in May.
“We don’t have enough time for an adequate discussion,” Murray wrote in an e-mail, adding that even a vote in May would be “too late for the handbook for Fall.”
In his e-mail to The Crimson, Malan said that his future plans for CS50 would revolve not so much around changing the course grading scheme as changing student attitudes toward the introductory coding class.
Malan wrote that he wanted to strive for the “creation of an atmosphere in which students feel empowered to explore a world unfamiliar to them without fear of ‘failure,’ without fear of competition from those already ‘more comfortable’ than they, and without fear of dark marks on their transcripts.”
A. Cansu Aydede ’11, the Head TF for CS50, wrote in an e-mail that while she would have liked to see the class be offered sat/unsat in her final term as TF, she hopes that the discussion “will continue in the future.”
Students had mixed feelings about the decision to retain the current CS50 grading scheme.
Kartikeya Mital ’13 said that while he had planned to take CS50 regardless of whether it would be offered sat/unsat, he was glad to know that taking the class for a grade will remain the norm in the fall.
“If I were to take CS50 sat/unsat... I wouldn’t really get much out of it,” he said.
But Rishabh K. Sinha ’12 said that while he had been strongly considering CS50 when he heard about the grading change, he does not believe he has a strong enough technical background to take the class for a grade.
“I would like to get some relevant CS background at some point during my college experience,” Sinha said. “When CS50 was being offered sat/unsat, that was the most attractive class to take.”

Harvard Law School has announced ten new fellowships to support students entering the public sector after graduating this year as part of the school’s efforts to promote public service careers.
Media mogul Sumner M. Redstone ’44,  who is also a 1947 graduate of the Law School, donated $1 million to Harvard College and the Law School to establish a total of 30 scholarships for students dedicated to public service.
The Law School will distribute $500,000 to 10 students pursuing work in the public sector after they graduate this spring, Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow said.
The fellowship is intended to fund one year of service work and can be used to supplement income in public sector jobs.
Recipients must have public service work lined up before graduation and must submit a proposed budget.
“I have experienced firsthand the culture of excellence and public service that is a fundamental tradition of these schools,” Redstone said in a Law School press release.
Redstone is the executive chairman of media conglomerate Viacom, which includes MTV Networks, BET Networks, and Paramount Pictures.
Over the past year, the Law School has unveiled multiple new initiatives to support students entering the public sector.
In February, the Law School announced the creation of a new Public Service Venture Fund, which will provide graduating students with grant funding for work in nonprofits or government. This fund replaced the Public Service Initiative, a pilot program that waived third year tuition for students who committed to five years of public service work.
In November, Minow also established 12 Holmes Fellowships for public service work, with which the Redstone fellowships share many features and stipulations.
Minow said she believes that the Redstone fellowships “amplify” the school’s commitment and ability to fund students’ public service work.
“This man, who is a man of great vision and leadership, heard our request,” she said, noting the increased demand from students for support for public service work.
At the College, the gift will fund scholarships for the upcoming school year for 20 students who have demonstrated a commitment to the public service and ideals of President John F. Kennedy.
“As the fiftieth anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s presidency nears, we reflect on how his influence sparked an era of optimism, activism and national service,” Redstone said in a press release. “I have established these scholarships to help celebrate President Kennedy’s spirit by fostering a focus on education and a renewed commitment to public service.”
Redstone also gave $500,000 to his high school, the Boston Latin School.
This gift marks Redstone’s largest contribution to the Law School, and Minow said that his philanthropy “speaks volumes of his recognition of education and public service.”

Students traded formal dresses at a campus-wide dress swap—sponsored by student-founded fashion nonprofit Styleta—to raise money for charities geared toward women’s needs.
In the first half hour on Sunday, a line already began to form outside the dressing area in Lowell.
Yifan Zhang ’10, the founder of Styleta, and Charlene C. Wang ’11 organized the swap where students could borrow dresses on loan from fellow students. Students who lent their own dresses received a $5 discount off the $10 borrowing fee.
Zhang estimated that throughout the course of the day, over fifty people attended the dress swap. She also estimated about 100 dresses were on loan at the event.
Though many of the dresses did not get chosen, Zhang said she felt that the swap was a great start in the right direction for Styleta, bringing in a little over $100.
Zhang said that while she “wishes they had had a bit more time to sell—perhaps during a less busy weekend due to the visiting prefrosh,” she thought the event, the first of its kind at Harvard, went “pretty well.”
Zhang, an economics concentrator, came up with the idea for Styleta after attending a Women In Business event that focused on bringing the sample sale industry online. She decided she wanted to bring the thrift store concept online as well.
“I wanted to revolutionize the charity thrift store with a focus on designer clothing that can sell for very low prices and really make a profit and make a difference,” Zhang said.
According to Zhang, she chose to focus on designer clothing because many buyers associate a designer label with quality.
Marguerite Thorp ’11, who hoped to find a dress for Eliot Fête, said she thought the swap was a great concept, especially during formal season.
“The idea of reducing waste, giving people access to clothes who might not otherwise buy a designer dress, offering dresses that are otherwise way out of league—I think it’s an awesome one,” she said.
Thorp donated three of her own dresses to the swap after she heard about it from her house e-mail list, a Facebook event, and friends.
“I do definitely want to find [a dress] here,” she said. “I guess if I don’t find one, I might be in a tight spot.”

In the middle of a field in the heart of coal country in the summer of 1989, John J. Sweeney—who only six years later would become the president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations—was missing in action.
Sweeney, then the president of the Service Employees International Union, was scheduled to give a speech to the crowds gathered to protest the lack of health insurance for retired mine workers. But, according to United Mine Workers’ then-President Richard L. Trumka, Sweeney was nowhere to be found.
Trumka, now Sweeney’s successor at the AFL-CIO, eventually discovered the lost labor leader amidst a group of displaced mine workers and had to “drag” Sweeney away from the workers and up to the stage to give his speech.
After demonstrations that led to Sweeney’s and Trumka’s arrests, the two union presidents and their fellow protesters could call this strike a success—the mine retirees eventually obtained health care coverage.
After years of fighting for workers’ rights, Sweeney ended his four-term tenure as president of the AFL-CIO in September and is now a resident fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics.
Although he no longer leads America’s largest federation of unions, Sweeney has continued to feel pulled towards the plight of everyday workers, even during his semester at Harvard.
On a recent Wednesday, in between meeting with students at the Kennedy School and running his 4 p.m. study group, Sweeney briefly stepped out of the office to join a group of workers protesting for jobs outside of the Bank of America in Boston.
Although he could only stay at the rally for an hour, he smiles remembering the opportunity he had to speak individually with 20 of the workers.
“If I was to talk about where I would like to be, I would say that I would like to be back in the local union in New York City, representing workers and really interacting,” Sweeney says.
From his experience negotiating with international leaders to his time spent at the IOP this semester, Sweeney has maintained this emphasis on the power of individual, personal connections to make meaningful change.
LABOR LEADER
Years before Sweeney held his first job, he already knew the power of labor unions.
Growing up among a family of Irish immigrants in the Bronx, Sweeney saw firsthand the power of organized labor. His father, a unionized New York City bus driver, received salary and vacation benefits unavailable to his mother, a domestic worker.
Sweeney’s experiences growing up, including working unionized jobs in college—such as a grocer and a gravedigger—inspired his decision to pursue a career in the labor movement.
His first union job was with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, where he worked in the research department. Three years later he moved to the Building Services Employees Union (now the Service Employees International Union), where he quickly rose through the ranks, ultimately becoming the union’s president in 1980.
Sweeney took over the AFL-CIO in 1995, where his main legacy was restoring progressivism to the labor movement through reaching out to groups such as youth, the elderly, and minorities. Trumka said he aims to continue this focus on bringing more workers into the movement during his tenure at the AFL-CIO.
“I’m going to take credit for everything Rich Trumka does,” Sweeney says with a small laugh.
A MAN OF THE PEOPLE
While Sweeney jokes about taking credit for Trumka’s work, he is quick to give credit to others for making his union accomplishments possible.
IOP Director Bill Purcell says Sweeney is best described as “a mentor,” who is invested in the helping those around him.
“He’s always exhibited an interest in each of us here—our families, where we’re from, and where we’re going,” Purcell says. “Not just an interest, but an interest in helping if he can.”
And over the past few months, Purcell says, Sweeney has jumped into all aspects of life at Harvard. He is constantly meeting with students, attending events, and sitting in on classes.
“It seems like every time I look up, he’s headed off to another meeting with another group of students, usually to eat a large pizza dinner,” Purcell says. “He has simply been game for anything that our students want to do.”
IOP President P. Kenzie Bok ’11 said the advisory group of students and staff that selects the IOP fellows was in “complete agreement” over Sweeny’s selection.
“It was clear that he wasn’t just looking to be in residence at Harvard, but that he was looking to engage with young people,” Bok says.
Sweeney says that one of his favorite parts about his time at the IOP has been the connections he has made with students from across the University.
“I leave it up to them what I talk about, I’m not pushing my agenda,” Sweeney says. “It’s up to them what they want to get out of Sweeney,” he adds with a smile.
Harvard Kennedy School student Jesse W. Lava, a regularly participant in Sweeney’s study group, says Sweeney’s attendance at a recent event Lava organized for the Kennedy School’s Progressive Caucus exemplifies how committed he is to engaging with the Harvard community.
“Most big shots will pop into the room and leave,” Lava says. “He got there early, he stayed through the whole thing, and he talked to people afterwards. He’s not just phoning it in.”
According to Lava, Sweeney’s interactions with students have made it clear that, “he’s not just using it as a way to take a few months off.”
Sweeney has not “taken a few months off” in years, and came to the IOP only months after stepping down from the AFL-CIO. He says his wife Maureen, a retired school teacher who has shuttled back and forth from their D.C. area home and Cambridge many times this semester, sometimes says, “‘When are you going to retire?’ and I say, ‘the pension checks come.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In concert with the second annual Gay Rights as Human Rights Conference’s theme of “building coalitions, changing culture,” featured speaker Shannon P. Minter discussed “Do Transsexuals Dream of Gay Rights? The Struggle for an Inclusive Queer Movement.”
Minter’s Friday speech was the fifth annual Papadopoulos lecture, coordinated by QSA in memory of Nicholas Papadopoulos ’77, who died of complications due to AIDS in 1994.
Minter, the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said some people object to the term ‘LGBT community’ because disparate individuals in a range of groups should not be considered a community.
“We need to talk about the LGBT community as an aspiration, something we choose to create and build,” he said. “And building a community requires constant attention and work.”
He added that until very recently, LGB groups were reluctant to include the ‘T’ in their advocacy, suggesting that because gay people have had to fight so hard for their own humanity, it is difficult for them to embrace a group that tends to be even more vulnerable and marginalized than they are. In order to be included, he said, transgender people had to adopt an alternate way to address the issues.
“Transgender activists started arguing that gay and lesbian people are not discriminated against just because of their sexual conduct, but because they are seen as violating the rules of gender,” he said, adding that this notion of common resistance to gender stereotypes and the gender binary played a major role in uniting the movement. However, he cautioned against using this as the dominant framework.
“It’s served a purpose, but we’re in danger of losing sights of transgender in the midst of the discussion of gender nonconformity,” he said, noting that he spoke more out of concern than cynicism. “If I don’t say transgender issues are at the very center of gay identity, why should they care?”
Chair of the Transgender Task Force Eva B. Rosenberg ’10 said the talk inspired her to think more closely about TTF’s organizing premise.
“Do we consider gender nonconformity the principle that unites our community?” she asked rhetorically. “It’s important to organize in a way that represents and meets the needs of people under the trans umbrella and think about community in the most inclusive way possible without losing our sense of focus.”
The focus of TTF, she said, was less to be a part of the mainstream queer community and more dedicated to advocacy and education.
The rights conference, organized by Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, marked the finale of the University-wide week celebrating Gaypril, a month dedicated to LGBT pride and awareness.

The Harvard College Environmental Action Committee hosted the annual Earth Day Festival on Saturday afternoon, attracting crowds of students and prefrosh with freebies in an effort to promote environmental awareness.
The festival, held in the Malkin Athletic Center Quad, featured educational booths run by environmentally concerned Harvard students and citizens of the greater Cambridge community, along with free b.good burgers, musical performances, and clothing sales. Students from a variety of organizations, such as the Harvard College Vegetarian Society and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Green Labs Program, presented their cause and their goals for the year.
“Earth Day is just a big celebration. It’s mainly for everyone to get out and have fun and enjoy the earth,” said Lila G. Brown ’11, president of the EAC. “We’re trying to educate people but we’re not trying to send anybody home with a political message.”
But the campaign against Facebook’s fuel usage policies attracted the attention of many students, as University of North Carolina Wilmington student Brinkley Hutchings strolled around the grassy expanse dressed as a Facebook profile page.
In January, the social networking site announced that its new data center in Prineville, Ore.—which the company has described as one of the most energy-efficient in the world—would run on coal instead of cleaner energy sources, drawing criticism from environmental activism groups such as Greenpeace.
“What people don’t know is that the amount of energy to just do one search on Google, for instance, is quite a bit. It really adds up,” said Sophia Wen ’12, environmental justice chair for the EAC and a Crimson photography editor.
In recent years, the University has taken steps to reduce its environmental footprint on many different levels.
In July 2008, University President Drew G. Faust challenged Harvard to cut all greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2006 levels within 10 years. The Office for Sustainability was founded to oversee this effort and has also coordinated other initiatives such as increasing the amount of locally grown food in undergraduate dining halls and generating more electricity from renewable sources.
Brown said she hopes that Harvard will continue to make progress toward its green goals, though she acknowledged that it is a long-term endeavor.
“One day, we could completely change the entire school and make it completely carbon-neutral,” Brown said. “But that would take lots and lots of money and wouldn’t happen any time soon.”

Most of the food that ends up in Harvard dining halls is grown off campus, but now students can observe the process of cultivating food in their own backyard. The Harvard Community Garden, which officially opened last weekend, was featured in this past weekend’s Earth Day celebration.
The Harvard Community Garden—located on Mt. Auburn Street near Lowell House—is the result of a collaboration between several University organizations, including the Environmental Action Committee, the Office for Sustainability, and the Food Literacy Project.
The garden’s name, “Harvard Community Garden,” beat out “Veggitas” and other alternatives in a vote by the Harvard community.
According to the project’s website, the raised-bed style garden will be used to create community awareness about the role of food in the environment and its effect on people’s health.
Two students have been selected to work as interns at the garden this summer. Their responsibilities will include not only tending to the garden itself, but also staffing the Harvard and Allston farmers’ markets, organizing community events involving the garden, and running a blog about the garden’s progress.
The interns will be allowed to eat what they grow, but some of the produce—which includes mizuna, arugala, onions, and chard—will either be donated to the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter or sold at higher-than-market prices to avoid competing with local producers at the farmers’ markets .
Louisa C. Denison ’11, a member of the Dudley Co-op and a former Currier House FLP Rep, said she thinks the garden will be useful because “Harvard students need to get some dirt under their fingernails.”
She added that she hopes people will use the garden as an educational experience. “I’d love for people to see this as an opportunity to become more educated about their environment and where food figures into it.”
Although community workdays will be organized by the garden administrators for community members to work on the garden, the site is always open to visitors.
“People have come from as far as Watertown,” Denison said. “It’s like they hear the cry of gardening.”

Harvard students often claim to be world-class. As of Friday night, 404 students from Harvard and four nearby schools can officially claim to be world record breakers.
At the Relay for Life event, held at Harvard’s Gordon Indoor Track this past weekend to raise money for the American Cancer Society, participants broke the world record for most simultaneous fist bumps.
On the count of three, 202 pairs of students pushed their raised fists together, surpassing the 250 participants needed to set a new fist bump record.
Harvard’s Relay for Life Co-Director Christopher Ding ’12 said the record attempt was inspired by a Crimson video of Laura E. D’Asaro ’13, who broke the world record for fastest one-mile crawl at a Relay for Life event in Seattle two years ago.
“We really want this girl on our board,” Ding said after seeing the video.
D’Asaro eagerly signed on, and the board selected simultaneous fist bumping as their record to break.
“We wanted something positive, because Relay for Life is all about hope and celebration. Fist bumps are all about these themes,” D’Asaro said.
Additionally, only 250 people were needed to break the record, meaning that it was a feasible target for the Relay for Life participants.
“My mom told me I would never amount to anything, and today I’m getting my name in the history books,” said J. Michael Beckham ’12 just before his fist bump.
The all-night Relay for Life event, held from 6 p.m. on Friday to 6 a.m. on Saturday, featured a variety of other light-hearted moments—such as a rowdy game of Capture the Flag and a drag “Miss Relay” pageant—but included solemn moments as well to address the fight against cancer.
The luminaria ceremony, which many participants said was their favorite part of the night, began with three speakers who recounted their personal experiences with cancer, continuing with a silent glowstick-lit lap around the track.
“Cancer is having a little brother who can’t play with me, a mother that breaks into tears with every piece of news, a father who’s so worried that he doesn’t know I exist,” said Wellesley student Jess Haladyna.
“I’m pretty sure he has no idea about the countless nights I’ve cried myself to sleep,” Wellesley student Lisa Koplik said about her father, who is currently battling cancer. “I don’t think he knows how terrified I am that he won’t meet my children or come to my wedding or be around as I get older and need his help.”
Later in the night, Wellesley, Mass. resident Laura Witheford discussed her mother’s recurring cancers, the three children she is raising whose mother died of cancer, and her own fight against breast cancer.
“There are still too many stories that do not have a happy ending, as my own children know all too well,” she said. “I am a mother with cancer, raised by a mother with cancer. May my children live in a world where that chain is finally broken.”
Relay for Life is a national program held at sites around the world. Participants in the Relay held at Harvard this weekend raised about $88,000 for the American Cancer Society through donations prior to the event and fundraisers held during the night.

As the chatter and giggles erupted throughout the auditorium, speaker Megan Andelloux banged on the table with a translucent green dildo with ridges of shimmering gold to call for silence.
Abby P. Sun ’13, co-president of Radcliffe Union of Students, the campus feminist group that sponsored the sixth annual Female Orgasm Seminar, helped hand out 1500 free condoms and cupcakes decorated with candied breasts and vulvas to the nearly 700 audience members.
“It’s a fun and communal event,” she said, trying to usher entryway groups, teammates, and groups of friends—spilling into aisles and standing in the back of Science Center C—into seats. “Hopefully it will get some conversations started, too.”
Andelloux, a sex educator and sexologist, launched into her discussion about what an orgasm is, how to have one, female anatomy, and safety.
“Sex is not just about having that climax; it’s about the whole experience,” she reminded her audience, noting that goal-focused sex can end up less pleasurable than just having fun. But that didn’t stop her from talking about how to reach that goal.
“Direct clitoral stimulation is how orgasms happen,” she said. “Trying to have an orgasm without clitoral stimulation for most women is like men trying to have one without touching their penis.”
In addition to talking about tips, techniques, and toys to make sex fun, she highlighted the importance of being comfortable in one’s body, noting that rather than feel self-conscious about their bodies, all people should embrace their uniqueness. She emphasized this with a clip from the film “Viva La Vulva,” which celebrated how varied female genitalia can be. She also showed a scene of g-spot stimulation to demystify female ejaculation, also known as squirting. The entire seminar was punctuated with laughter, questions, gasps, and audience participation.
After the presentation, RUS raffled off a variety of sex toys including an assortment of dildos, a rubber ducky vibrator, a vibrating butt plug, and a Hello Kitty massager. Audience members exploded with cries of “yes,” “oh my god,” and “I’m so happy,” as well as nonverbal expressions of delight, when their numbers were called.
“This is what winning looks like!” said audience member Ian H. Clark ’12, who won a butt plug shaped like Marge Simpson’s coiffure. His friend Anneika M. Verghese ’12, who also won a prize, noted, “I didn’t know vibrators came in this shape.”
The two were not only surprised by their prizes, but by the focus of the seminar as well.
“I did not expect to watch porn,” said Verghese. “It was uncomfortable, but interesting, especially because the focus was less on sex and more on different kinds of stimulation.”
Clark agreed that Andelloux’s discussion, and especially her focus on individual differences, was informative and fun.
“It was surprising that there was so much emphasis on how people are different and how to enjoy what people have to offer,” he said.
Brandishing the purple butt plug he won, Clark joked to his friends, “who wants to go home and practice?”

Ten Harvard Business School students piled into rental cars to be whisked from the Allston campus across the river to Business School Professor Howard H. Stevenson’s Cambridge home for dinner one mid-April night.
The dinner event—hosted by Stevenson’s son Andrew L. Stevenson, who graduated from the Business School in 2001—was one out of the eleven total in the Alumni Dinner Series. The dinners, which kicked off on March 24 and concluded on April 14, were organized through the joint effort of the Business School’s Alumni Relations and Student Association.
“It was great hearing the hosts talk about their lives after HBS, especially how they still interface with people from sections and class and how to take away most from relationships you make at your time at the Business School,” outgoing Student Association Co-President Patrick S. Chun ’04 said.
Justine K. Lelchuk, another one of the first-year Business School students who dined at Stevenson’s home, said the dinner was “a seamless night in terms of good food and great conversation,” describing the three course catered dinner as “a smorgasbord of  delicious food.”
Lelchuk, who also helped organize the series, added that the dinners were a great opportunity for students to get to know alumni outside of recruitment and classroom settings.
“It was a really personal way to get to know an alum and a chance to hear the good, the bad, and ugly after graduating the Business School,” she said.
According to Assistant Director of Alumni Relations Lauren Y. Gilbert, a total of 104 of the Business School’s nearly 2000 students attended these dinners.
“For alums, the dinners are a great way to connect back to the Business School,” Gilbert said.
Student Association representatives advertised the dinner events, and Alumni Relations offered dinner spots through e-mail.
Gilbert noted that students and alumni alike praised the dinner series highly.
“This was a really successful program, and we received excellent reviews from both the host and students,” she said. “This program is something we will continue in the future.”
Lelchuk said her favorite moment of the dinner she attended was witnessing the relationship between Professor Stevenson and his son Andrew.
“It was a great moment to see these two incredibly intelligent bright men who happen to be father and son and business partners,” she said. “It was nice to see that the HBS network extends beyond campus—and that there’s a human aspect to it.”

Student government leaders from seven of the nation’s top business schools gathered last weekend at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School to finalize the charter of the MBA Peer Schools Forum.
The charter, which formalizes dialogue that has taken place among the institutions for the past several years, joins Harvard Business School, Wharton, Columbia Business School, Northwestern’s Kellogg School, University of Chicago’s Booth School, MIT’s Sloan School, and Stanford Graduate School of Business in an official consortium.
Patrick S. Chun ’04, co-president of the Business School’s Student Association, said that the charter addressed practical matters as well, such as the format of the annual conference and the addition of other schools. Monthly conference calls involving the seven schools’ student government officials have also been planned.
The Forum provides the MBA students an opportunity to discuss their “best practices and challenges,” said Justine K. Lelchuk, incoming co-president of the Business School’s Student Association.
“The Forum seeks to provide a platform for inter-school cohesion and collaboration among the different MBA student bodies from seven of the top business schools in the country,” Lelchuk said.
Chun noted that the collaboration and communication with other student government leaders has been very helpful, particularly in the tough economic times.
“This Forum helps us evaluate how we as leaders in MBA programs are adapting to a downturn in the recruiting environment, to the decreased budgets, and what that means about types of offering of student government,” Chun said.
Last year, representatives from the seven schools held a similar conference at Kellogg.
Chun said that one of the Student Association’s new initiatives, this year’s ski trip in February, was loosely inspired by a Kellogg event.
Lelchuk also said that the greatest benefit of attending the conference was the opportunity to learn from the experience of her peers.
“For me, the best part of the conference was at the end of Saturday reviewing my notes and seeing how much I had gleaned from what the other school said they were doing,” she said. “I am very excited about incorporating this into our agenda.”
Lelchuk added that “having six diverse perspectives in the same position lends a great amount of support,” especially for those students who do not have the benefit of a co-president.

After quickly passing legislation to issue Phillips Brooks House Association annual block grants of $20,000 over the next two years, the Undergraduate Council general assembly erupted into a long debate about the current UC Executive Board re-election policies.
According to UC Treasurer Brad M. Paraszczak ’11, the Council—which currently dispenses funding to PBHA-affiliated programs on a case-by-case basis—felt that the allocation of funding in yearly block grants will be in the best interests of both PBHA and the UC.
PBHA Vice President Christopher J. Loney ’11 said he agreed that the change will “ease the process” of funding dispersal.
“This helps the UC side of things in that they don’t have to deal with each of our 86 different programs applying,” Loney said. “It also allows us to better distribute the funds internally because we understand the finances of our programs better.”
But after the unanimous passage of this legislation, the meeting escalated into a heated discussion about re-election policies that culminated in two separate preliminary votes on two proposed amendments to the UC constitution.
The first amendment requires that Executive Board members—which include the secretary, treasurer, and five standing committee chairs—must seek re-election if they switch districts, either due to transferring Houses or moving from a freshman dorm to an upperclassmen House.
The second amendment is similar but stipulates that all members—not just those that switch districts—must run for re-election every fall.
Under existing UC bylaws, each Council member is elected annually in the fall. But Executive Board members—who serve as executives for a full calendar year and are typically elected internally by the UC at the end of the fall semester—have their terms extended by an additional semester before being subject to re-election.
This policy entails that Executive Board members can serve for three consecutive semesters, with special elections held for them in February. Other members are subject to re-election every two semesters.
“Basically, the current system makes us seem very shady,” East Yard representative Nicholas Oo ’13 said. “It does entail one extra semester for chairs and it makes the UC lose a sense of legitimacy.”
Adams House Representative Harry T. Rimalower ’10 said he is glad that none of the Adams representatives are on the Executive Board.
“If I didn’t have a chance to elect one of my reps every year, I’d be pissed off,” Rimalower said.
But others argued that the benefits of a yearlong chair outweighed the possible shortcomings.
“There are large amounts of benefits to a yearlong chair,” Finance Committee Chair Amanda Lu ’11 said, pointing to an increased sense of commitment that Executive Board members demonstrate over the summer months.
UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said that the current system yields “an insane amount of benefits,” fosters an increased work ethic, and provides valuable institutional memory. “It’s worth it,” he said.
Although Hysen voted against the second amendment, UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 voted in favor of it. The entire council was divided on both amendments, with representatives occasionally yelling over each other during the meeting. Several even walked out in apparent frustration before the Council’s formal dismissal.
Now, due to existing UC rules, the Council must wait one week before taking a final vote to accept or deny the constitutional changes. Hysen said the waiting period will give members time for more thorough reflection and offer them the chance to change how they originally voted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following yesterday’s 18-10 trouncing of Columbia, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team had done all it could do for itself to earn one of four playoff berths in the Ivy League Tournament.
After getting the job done in New York, the Crimson’s fate now lay in the hands of two conference rivals. If No. 6 Penn and No. 7 Dartmouth came away with victories the next day, Harvard would sneak into the fourth spot.
But unfortunately for Harvard, Princeton’s upset of the Big Green in overtime this afternoon will keep the Crimson on the outside of the Ivy League’s inaugural postseason tournament.
With its 11-10 victory over Dartmouth, Princeton improved to 4-3 in conference play, putting the Tigers one game ahead of the 3-4 Crimson in the conference standings. If Princeton had lost its final Ivy match, Harvard would have won the tiebreaker due to its superior record against the top three finishers.
Cornell, which ended league play today with 12-5 win over Yale, finishes third and will take on Dartmouth in the tournament’s first round. Meanwhile, the Tigers will travel to regular-season champion Penn for their opening-round matchup.
While the Crimson may be out of the running for the Ancient Eight championship, the team still has business to take care of. Harvard plays its final match of the season against Boston College May 5 at Harvard Stadium.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday afternoon, Harvard men’s lacrosse hosted No. 6 Princeton in perhaps the most symbolic game of the regular season. It was Senior Day, prefrosh weekend, and Alumni Day—when some Crimson lacrosse legends returned to their roots—all combined into one at Harvard Stadium. And if the crowd of nearly 3,000 fans wasn’t enough motivation for the Crimson, the prospect of qualifying for the Ivy League tournament was a compelling reason to leave it all out on the field.
Harvard did not disappoint its diverse array of fans, as the Crimson (6-5, 2-3 Ivy) toppled the Tigers (9-3, 4-1) for the first time in nearly 20 years. With an 11-8 victory, Harvard not only snapped Princeton’s perfect record in Ancient Eight competition this season, but also pulled within one more win of an Ivy League tournament berth.
Sophomore attack Kevin Vaughan posted a hat trick for the Crimson, scoring once in the first quarter and twice in the fourth.
“Vaughan’s been huge for us, more than in just attack,” co-captain Billy Geist said. “He’s played some midfield, and he’s just a ground-ball machine. Whenever we want the ball in safe hands, we give it to Kevin.”
Vaughan’s fellow attack, junior Dean Gibbons, added a pair of goals and posted an assist, as Harvard dictated play for almost the entire game.
“The offense shot the ball really well today,” Geist said. “[Princeton’s] goalie is one of the best in the country. He was an All-American last year.”
Vaughan got the scoring started midway through the first, whipping a pass from Gibbons past Tiger netminder Tyler Fiorito.
Though Princeton came back to tie it less than two minutes later on a Jack McBride shot, Gibbons put his squad back on top with two minutes to go in the first.
With Tiger Mike Grossman’s goal in the second quarter at 11:32, the game was tied, 2-2. But that’s as close as Princeton would come. Three straight goals by Crimson senior midfielder Jason Duboe, sophomore midfielder Andrew Pataki, and freshman attack Peter Schwartz allowed Harvard to pull away at the close of the first half.
“I used to play offense,” Pataki said. “But the coaches moved me to midfield a month and a half ago. That really gave me a lot of freedom to push in transition. I saw an opportunity in the middle of the field, and I was able to put it away.”
The Crimson’s win also confirmed a timeless mantra: defense wins games. Despite being outshot, 25-12, in the second half, Harvard managed to surrender only four goals. Freshman goalie Harry Krieger recorded 13 saves before senior Sam Michel took over between the pipes to end the game.
Vaughan’s third goal of the game, which came off an assist from classmate Terry White with 3:44 to play, gave the Crimson its biggest lead of the game at 10-6.
Though Princeton would score two of the game’s last three goals, an unassisted tally from sophomore Evan Roth gave Harvard some added insurance, and the team rode out the 11-8 win.
“It was definitely a lower-scoring game than we’re used to,” Geist said. “But the defense finally came through for us.”
This last home game for the Crimson also marked Senior Day, a tradition in which the younger players recognize the achievements and leadership of veteran team members.
“We have seven seniors on the team, and this [win] was definitely for them,” Pataki said. “All week, our mindset was to give it our all today. The seniors have given so much to the program, especially during the turnaround period.”
Senior Day may have come and gone, but the season isn’t over just yet for Harvard. If the Crimson defeats Yale in its last regular season game next Saturday, it will clinch a spot in the Ivy League tournament.
The outcome of this tournament decides which Ancient Eight teams will move on to the 16-team NCAA field.
“We have to take it one game at a time,” Geist said. “I’m not sure how it all shakes down mathematically. Yale has beaten a lot of quality opponents this year, but the [Ivy tournament] will certainly be our focus this coming week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is probably no other team in the country that spends as much time on the water or focuses as much energy on understanding the seas as the United States Naval Academy Midshipmen. But this weekend, the No. 2 Harvard men’s lightweight crew taught the No. 3 Midshipmen a lesson in winning a battle between oarsmen.
After a 10-hour drive to Annapolis, Md., the Crimson claimed four victories out of five contests early Saturday morning.
The Harvard varsity eight continued its undefeated streak, beating Navy by 5.5 seconds in a time of 5:52.2.
“We managed to get up off the start,” captain Martin Eiermann said. “[Navy] made a move around the 500-meter mark, and we knew to be cool and stay calm while they made their move and not let it rattle us. But then afterwards, we knew to push back into them.”
The Crimson had a comfortable lead coming through the 1,000-meter mark with about a length over the Midshipmen. Navy clung to that margin through the second thousand of the course. Harvard stuck to its race plan, though, and outpaced the Midshipmen through to the finish.
The Crimson’s second and third varsity eights also came away with wins over Navy. The second varsity defeated the Midshipmen with a time of 5:59.7 to 6:03.8. The third varsity edged out its opponent in the closest race of the morning. The Crimson finished just 0.4 seconds ahead of Navy in 6:06.9.
The Harvard first freshman eight notched yet another victory in a thus-far undefeated season, clocking a time of 6:14.6 to its opponent’s 6:17.2.
“We came out pretty hard and established a good lead,” freshman James Groeneveld said. “We were pretty comfortable during the middle thousand. Then in the last 500, Navy really came back strong. They never gave up and pulled hard, which they always do. But we came here to win and were happy to do that.”
The second freshman eight was the only boat to fall to the Midshipmen on Saturday. The rookies were behind off the start, and despite trying to battle back through the rest of the race, they were off the pace by a final margin of nine seconds, finishing in 6:33.7.
“The 2F just got beat off the start, but they are a strong crew,” Eiermann said. “The 1V had a very solid race, as did the other boats, but it’s all still part of an adaptation process.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. NO. 16 NAVY/NO. 18 PENN
Though collegiate rowers don’t normally look beyond their next race, they often talk about how they’ll remember the glory days long after they are over. For Harry Parker, head coach of the No. 4 Harvard men’s heavyweight crew, this weekend’s victory against the No. 18 University of Pennsylvania Quakers for the Adams Cup on the Charles River marked 65 glorious years of success.
Parker first won the Adams Cup in 1955 when he was a member of the Penn varsity squad. On Saturday, his fellow oarsmen from the 1955 crew were in Cambridge to celebrate Parker’s 50th victory out of 74 annual contests between the Crimson and the Quakers.
“Earlier in the week, Harry told us that this was one of his most sought-after cups,” said sophomore and varsity three seat Mike Disanto. “[Harry said] he loves to win this cup just as much as he loves to win anything else.”
The Harvard varsity claimed the Adams Cup, defeating Penn as well as the No. 16 US Naval Academy crew that joined Saturday’s competition.
The Midshipmen proved more of a challenge for the varsity eight than the Quaker crew. Navy jumped out to an early two-seat advantage in the first 20 strokes. Through the 500-meter mark, though, Harvard pushed out to roughly a three-seat lead. In the middle thousand, the Crimson’s margin grew to a stern deck on the Midshipmen’s bow deck. But Navy chipped away, narrowing the lead to half a length.
“Navy did a pretty good job and didn’t roll over or give up an inch,” Disanto said. “And up until 200 [meters] to go...it was a real dog fight.”
Harvard reclaimed a few seats in the final 200 meters of the race, finishing nearly two seconds ahead of Navy and over 12 seconds ahead of Penn in a time of 5:57.25.
In the second varsity race, the Crimson gradually pulled away from Navy over 2,000 meters, extending an early two-seat lead to a final 9.3-second margin. The second eight won in a time of 6:04.6.
The third and fourth varsity boats competed in the third varsity event, with the third eight pulling away from the field in the second half of the race, and the fourth varsity finishing ahead of the Quakers but behind the Midshipmen’s third varsity.
The first freshman eight continued its undefeated streak this season, overcoming an early Navy lead to win by almost four seconds in a time of 5:59.2.
The second freshman eight first put together a four that defeated Penn by 23 seconds and then combined in an eight that fell to Navy’s second freshman eight—the top-seeded boat in the league.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The finish line is in sight, and the Harvard softball team is barreling towards it.
With six games to go in the Ivy season, the Crimson (20-20, 11-3 Ivy) took over sole possession of first place in the North Division on Saturday, sweeping Yale (9-24, 4-10) at Dewitt Family Field.
Harvard easily won the first game, 6-0, behind a 16-strikeout gem from sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown. And though the Bulldogs held a 3-0 lead through six innings in the nightcap, the Crimson refused to let its rival play the spoiler, breaking out for 10 runs in the top of the seventh in a 10-3 win.
“I think that’s exactly the team we want to be headed into the Dartmouth weekend and potentially the Ivy League Championship,” Brown said. “That was our best softball, and it was really great to see that.”
HARVARD 10, YALE 3
For six innings, Yale pitcher Kayla Kuretich had the Crimson’s number.
The senior scattered four hits and two walks through the game’s first six frames, and with a run in the third and two more in the fourth, the Bulldogs had her staked to a 3-0 lead heading into the final inning.
But that’s when Harvard’s bats—which had been launching balls right at Yale’s fielders all game—finally got lucky.
“We had confidence in ourselves,” sophomore Whitney Shaw said. “We had been hitting shots...but we hadn’t been able to catch a break. The seventh inning, we caught a break finally.”
With one out in the inning, sophomore pinch hitter Mari Zumbro reached base on an error to spark the Crimson rally. Consecutive singles from sophomore Jane Alexander and junior Ellen Macadam loaded the bases, and senior Stephanie Krysiak’s hit to second base was misplayed, letting pinch runner Emily Henderson score.
Singles from co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, and Shaw made the score 4-3, and rookie Jess Ferri ripped a 2-RBI double to right center to clear the bases.
“The last inning against Yale, I just had the feeling that it was never going to stop,” Brown said.
Ferri came home on a fielder’s choice off the bat of senior Jen Francis, and a pair of walks to Henderson and Alexander loaded the bases once more.
Macadam capped the inning with a bases-clearing double, extending Harvard’s lead to 10-3 before Krysiak struck out to finally end the inning.
Brown came on in the seventh to close out the game, striking out the side after allowing a leadoff single.
HARVARD 6, YALE 0
In the series opener, Brown sparkled again, taking a no-hit bid into the seventh but settling for a one-hit shutout that included 16 strikeouts.
“I felt really good,” she said. “It was definitely nice to have a few days off during this week...I think that really helped. I felt a lot stronger on the mound and kind of more mentally alert.”
But Brown’s supporting cast gave her an early lead with a four-run third inning.
Macadam drew a one-out walk and quickly stole second base. After moving to third on Krysiak’s single, the pair orchestrated a double steal, with Macadam swiping home to score the game’s first run.
Shaw reached on an error that let Krysiak score, and Ferri followed up with a bomb over the center-field fence to bring the score to 4-0.
After struggling to string hits together in last weekend’s series with Brown, the Crimson bats did not have the same problems on Saturday.
“I thought we came out great,” Shaw said. “We hit the ball very hard, and we came out and really showed our intensity in our bats.”
Shaw was the catalyst for the game’s final two runs, reaching base on a single in the fifth. Freshman pinch runner Ashley Heritage then came around to score on senior Jess Pledger’s sacrifice fly.
The sophomore slugger gave Harvard some insurance with one out in the seventh, drilling a solo homer to center.
And after letting the first two runners reach in the seventh, Brown pitched her way out of the jam to preserve the shutout.
The sweep also put the Crimson alone in first place heading into today’s doubleheader against Yale. Dartmouth split with Brown on Saturday to fall one game back.
“It feels great because it comes on a great day,” said Brown of taking sole possession of first, “but we also aren’t going to take it too lightly...We can’t hope for anybody else to [clinch the division] for us—we have to win out and take the games in our own hands.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first snap of the 2010 football season is still nearly five months away, but on Saturday, Harvard got its first taste of gridiron action.
The Crimson took the field at Harvard Stadium for the annual intrasquad spring game, a contest marked by defensive dominance and the second debut of junior quarterback Andrew Hatch.
“The energy was high—we kept it simple on both sides of the ball,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “If we had cut our defense loose, I’m not sure we would have scored. Our defense has been ahead of the offense all spring, which is usually pretty standard, but probably even more so this year.”
The defense put up one touchdown to the offense’s three, with its score coming on a fumble recovery in the endzone. Sophomore Dan Minamide ended the game with a goal-line interception, while freshman D.J. Monroe and junior Anthony Spadafino shared the team lead in tackles with six apiece.
For Murphy, sophomore Matt Hanson proved the highlight of the secondary.
“We really challenged him this spring, and he really responded in strength and conditioning and spring football,” Murphy said. “I think he’s set to be a dominant type of corner, a lockdown type of corner that you need to have on your defense.”
But much of the attention was focused on the awaited return of Hatch, a former Crimson JV player who transferred to LSU and earned the starting job for the Tigers in 2008—just a year after the team won the national championship.
Hatch’s 2008 season was cut short by injury, and he left LSU to return to Harvard last spring. He was ruled ineligible to play by the NCAA last season, but Murphy is optimistic that he will be eligible in 2010—though he noted that Hatch has not yet been cleared, and the team may not know until Sep. 1 about his availability.
Hatch completed four passes Saturday night for a total of 81 yards.
“We run a [much] more sophisticated, pro-style offense than LSU did,” Murphy said. “They were very simple, just kind of three-step stuff, bubble screens and get it to their fast guys. Here it’s a little bit more like a pro-style offense, at least from the pass-game standpoint. [Hatch has] shown flashes of brilliance, he’s just got to be more consistent.”
Hatch’s return puts pressure on the incumbent under center, junior Collier Winters. Winters earned a spot on the All-Ivy Second Team in his first year as a starter and recorded a game-high 211 all-purpose yards Saturday night.
The junior provided the highlight of the game in the second half, when his 67-yard bomb found the hands of a streaking junior Chris Lorditch for a touchdown.
Winters also reached the endzone on the ground, running the ball in from two yards out on an option fake.
But in Murphy’s eyes, Winters’s job is not safe.
“It is a legitimate competition,” Murphy said. “If [Hatch] hadn’t been here, I’m not sure that it would have been. I would have said that Collier’s pretty much a slam dunk, but now there’s a competition, so we probably won’t know who our starting quarterback’s going to be until conceivably a week before the Holy Cross game.”
But no matter which quarterback earns the starting nod, he will have the luxury of a talented and experienced group of returning wideouts and running backs.
Lorditch and junior Marco Iannuzzi—who had five catches for 18 yards to go with a pair of 30-plus yard kick returns—stood out among the pack on Saturday, while sophomore Adam Chrissis will also be called upon often.
On the ground, top tailbacks junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales are back, with Scales scoring the first offensive touchdown of the evening on a two-yard run.
“That’s a luxury,” Murphy said of his running backs. “They’re both very athletic, very smart, very competitive kids...Gino’s become an outstanding leader for the football team.”
But for the pair of running backs to have the same sort of production they enjoyed last season, the new-look offensive line will have to step up.
With only one athlete—junior Brent Osborne—returning from last year’s vaunted offensive line, the Crimson has some work to do up front.
“The biggest part of the issue is anytime you have to replace four guys at a very labor-intensive position, it really takes a long time to become a unit,” Murphy said. “That’s your big concern. We have the talent, we have to find out if we can develop the leadership and the cohesiveness.”
With a solid defensive core in place and a group of experienced offensive starters coming back, it seems likely that Harvard will once again find itself among the Ancient Eight’s elite.
And Murphy emphasized that the Crimson isn’t counting on any rookie faces to carry the team.
“We’ve got to get this thing done with the guys we have here,” he said. “If we can’t get it done with these guys, then we’re not going to be a championship-caliber team.”

Three turned out to be quite an unlucky number for the Harvard women’s golf team.
Faced with the chance to nab its third-consecutive Ivy League team championship, the Crimson fell short of its lofty goal this weekend, finishing in third place at the esteemed Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J. as Penn captured its first-ever league title yesterday by 22 strokes.
“It was our only poorly-performing week of the season so far,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We didn’t play great all three days. Usually when this happens with us, one person will struggle on a given day, but the other four will play pretty darn well. That just didn’t happen this week, unfortunately.”
Taking on Baltusrol’s par-72, 6,101-yard Upper Course, the Quakers excelled over the three-day competition, firing the lowest team score of each round. After an opening-round 314 put the squad five strokes ahead of the second-place Crimson, Penn improved by six shots Saturday, extending its advantage over Harvard to nine strokes after two rounds.
A final-round total of 307—the best team score of any round in the tournament—helped the Quakers pull away with the crown with a three-round total of 929—65 over par.
Twelve strokes behind Harvard heading into the last day, Yale used the efforts of junior Alyssa Roland (78-76-73)—the top individual scorer of the competition—to leapfrog into second place overall, three strokes ahead of the Crimson’s team score of 954. The Bulldogs finished second in the Ivy championship last year as well.
“Two teams played very well [Sunday], and we were not one of them,” Rhoads said.
But the story of the weekend was Penn’s historical finish at the 54-hole event. The Quaker squad featured three top-10 individual finishers—including freshman Isabel Han, individual runner-up to Roland by one stroke—and no golfer outside of the top 13.
Though Penn had finished fifth at Ivies for three-straight seasons, the squad’s breakthrough came as no real surprise, as the Quakers placed second to Harvard at the Roar-EE Invitational last weekend.
“Penn played particularly well this week, and I give them a lot of credit,” Rhoads said. “But certainly I believe that if we had played a normal week for us—or a good week for us—that we certainly would have either won or been right next to Penn, despite how well they played this week.”
Showing no signs of rust after not competing a week ago, freshman Katie Sylvan led the way for the Crimson, firing a three-day five-over-par total of 231 to tie for fourth.
“Katie played very well, but the rest of the team struggled,” Rhoads said.
After dominating the course her first day with an even-par 72—collecting five birdies to establish the tournament-low for all players in any round—the standout rookie fell back to earth in her next two attempts, ending up with 10-over-par and five-over-par tallies, respectively.
Sophomore teammate Christine Cho was just four strokes behind at 235. Cho’s best effort was a second-round 76, but her final-day round of 80 dropped her from a tie for fifth place into a final finish of eighth. The ever-steady sophomore and reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year had two birdies in each of her three rounds.
Harvard’s third-best finisher was captain Claire Sheldon, who placed 10th at 241. Sheldon’s top round also came on Saturday, when she had three birdies on the way to a three-over-par 75. But an opening-day 84 and a final-day 82 proved to be bogey-laden difference-makers.
The veteran shared her coach’s opinion that the squad simply had an off weekend.
“It’s definitely important not to let this take away from the success that we’ve had,” Sheldon said. “I still think we’re the best team in the league, even if this weekend that wasn’t the case.”
“We did everything we could to prepare for this weekend,” she added. “That’s the game, I guess…We got outplayed this weekend, and that happens.”
Junior Mia Kabasakalis turned in a 248 (85-78-85), good for a tie for 17th place, and senior Sarah Harvey (84-83-87) ended up 24th out of the 35-player field.
The league title gives Penn an automatic bid to an NCAA regional tournament. The Crimson has an outside chance at receiving an at-large bid to the postseason, but “the percentage is small, unfortunately,” Rhoads said.
Harvard’s third-place finish likely represents a disappointing conclusion to what Rhoads called “the best season we’ve ever had, up to this point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Radcliffe heavyweight crew, frustration is not a familiar feeling. But this season, it has been nothing but frustration for the Black and White (1-5), despite being ranked 20th in this week’s US Rowing Polls.
The heavyweights left the friendly waters of the Charles and headed to the Housatonic River last Saturday to take on Yale in the Case Cup. The struggles continued for Radcliffe, as the Bulldogs swept all five races.
Meanwhile, the lightweights (3-2) traveled to Princeton, N.J. for a showdown against No. 3 Princeton and No. 5 Bucknell in the Class of 1999 Cup. The Black and While had strong showings against its competition, beating Bucknell comfortably and coming up just short against the Tigers.
HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. YALE
The heavyweight squad entered the race against its Ivy rivals hoping for a chance to salvage what has been a disappointing season so far.
Unfortunately, the Black and White got more of the same this past weekend, as the fourth-ranked Bulldogs took advantage of perfect rowing conditions on the Housatonic to defeat Radcliffe in all five races.
“This weekend was not as successful as I hoped it would be,” said Black and White coach Liz O’Leary. “I thought that everybody raced hard, but we just came up a lot shorter than Yale.”
In the varsity eight race, the Bulldog crew established its rhythm early on and never looked back, rowing across the finish line a comfortable 18 seconds before Radcliffe. Yale finished in an astounding 6:01.6, while the Black and White finished in 6:19.9.
“For Yale to finish in 6:01, you need to have fast conditions and a fast boat,” O’Leary said. “[6:01]’s a time you’d see at the World Championships.”
The second varsity kept things close with its Bulldog counterparts the entire race, finishing just one-fifth of a second behind Yale at 6:20.4. The outcome of the race was ultimately decided in the last 500 meters, as the Bulldogs finished especially strong to take the win.
“It was a back-and-forth race, and really exciting to watch and to be in,” O’Leary said. “I was really proud of them [to come that close].”
In the varsity four A, varsity four B, and third varsity eight races, Yale defeated Radcliffe by 5.7 seconds, 5.2 seconds, and 14 seconds, respectively.
Though the season has been trying, the Black and White rowers have remained relentless in their efforts to improve with each coming week.
“They’re really working hard and staying really committed to the team,” O’Leary said. “I think what you have to look at is not just the results. You also have to look at improvements that you’ve made and goals that you’ve achieved that don’t always show up at the finish line. We have pretty lofty goals for ourselves; if we don’t set goals that are pretty challenging, then what’s the point [of rowing]?”
LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. NO. 3 PRINCETON/NO. 5 BUCKNELL
After facing a top boat in No. 2 Stanford last weekend, the Radcliffe Lightweights went up against stiff competition once again this weekend against Bucknell and conference opponent Princeton.
The varsity/second varsity eights race saw multiple lead changes throughout the course on Lake Carnegie. While the Black and White had the early lead, the Tigers eventually clawed back around the 1000-meter mark to take the lead for good, finishing at 7:14.6.
The Radcliffe varsity eight finished second at 7:16.9, while the second varsity eight finished fourth at 7:40.7. Bucknell—last year’s IRA National Championships runner-up—took third at 7:30.9.
“I think we met our expectations,” sophomore Kelly McCarthy said. “It was a solid race, and Princeton’s always very competitive. As for Bucknell, we normally don’t race them until IRAs, so it was exciting for us to meet them this early in the season and compete well against them. I’m sure they’ll pick up speed when we meet them again.”
In the varsity four, the Black and White finished third in 8:52.5.
The novice eight also had an impressive showing against the Tigers. The Black and White crossed the finish line in dominating fashion, 34.3 seconds ahead of Princeton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With top-three finishes in each tournament this spring, the Harvard men’s golf team was carrying high hopes into the Ivy League Championship this weekend. The Crimson got out to a good start on Friday, building a five-stroke lead after the first round, but it faded on Saturday and yesterday and finished in fifth place.
“We needed to play well this weekend if we wanted to win it, and in general we just played average,” sophomore Mark Pollak said.
Harvard managed to shoot a 903 over the course of 54 holes, but it was bested by Columbia, Yale, Penn, and Dartmouth—with scores of 890, 893, 898, and 902, respectively. Cornell, which posted a 915, Princeton, which carded a 921, and Brown, which shot a 938, rounded out the bottom three.
The Ivy League Championship was the Lions’ third-consecutive title.
“Some guys who played well throughout the season just didn’t have their best week,” sophomore Tony Grillo said. “It’s unfortunate, especially because we knew that we could win, seeing as the team that did win, [Columbia], we crushed a couple weeks ago [at the Princeton Invitational].”
The tournament took place in Springfield, N.J., at the prestigious Baltusrol Golf Club. Baltusrol, a par-70 course, has played host to a number of tournaments, including seven U.S. Opens and the 2005 PGA Championship.
“Baltusrol is one of the best courses in the country,” Pollak said. “It’s really long...The rough was pretty thick, the greens were rolling quick, and they gave us tough pin locations.”
“It’s obviously a very challenging course, and that was reflected in the scores,” he added.
With the toughest conditions on the first day of the tournament, Harvard played its best golf of the weekend. Grillo and senior Greg Shuman led the Crimson by shooting a 72 and 74, respectively, and Harvard’s collective effort earned the squad an early lead with a 297.
“Tony and Greg led us off well,” Pollak said. “I think we just managed our game a little bit better than everyone else [on the first day].”
Friday was the beginning of a successful weekend for Grillo. The sophomore followed up his opening round with a 71 on Saturday and a 75 yesterday to shoot a 218—good for sixth place overall in the tournament.
“The funny thing about golf is that when your short game is on—when you’re putting and chipping well—[is] usually when you find yourself on the leader board,” Grillo said.
Although the conditions eased up on Saturday and yesterday, the rest of golf team could not take advantage and emulate Grillo’s success. Captain Danny Mayer and Shuman each posted a 79, and Pollak, suffering from a food illness, was only two strokes better with a 77 on Saturday. Junior Louis Amira’s 76 gave the Crimson a 303 on the day and dropped Harvard four shots back from the leader.
The Crimson did not fare any better on the final day of the tournament, matching Saturday’s score of 303 to drop to fifth place, a slight improvement over last year’s sixth-place finish. The men’s golf team last claimed the Ivy League title in 1975.
The tournament was the final collegiate match for Shuman and Mayer, both of whom have etched their names into the Harvard record books. Over the course of his career, Shuman has played the most rounds, had the most rounds of par or better, and posted the lowest scoring average among qualifying players—74.65 or 3.89 over par. Mayer has played the third-most rounds, had the second-most rounds of par or better, and posted the fourth lowest scoring average with 76.48 strokes per round or 5.75 shots over par.
“They are the backbone of the team. They’re the reason many of us came as recruits,” Grillo said of the seniors. “We’re a little disappointed—the underclassmen—that we couldn’t help bring them the Ivy League Championship they deserved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting in a tie for sixth place with one conference game remaining was not where the Harvard women’s lacrosse team envisioned itself heading into the 2010 campaign.
But with Saturday afternoon’s 18-10 trouncing of Columbia (6-8, 0-7 Ivy) at Robert K. Kraft field in its Ivy League finale, the Crimson (7-7, 3-4) gave itself a chance to end up exactly where it originally planned—the playoffs.
Needing a win to keep alive its hope of securing one of the Ancient Eight’s four playoff berths, Harvard relied on a late second-half offensive outburst to put the game away and come up with the eight-goal victory—the squad’s second largest of the season.
Though the Crimson did its part, Princeton’s win over Dartmouth yesterday ended Harvard’s playoff hopes.
“I think we’re obviously happy with the win,” sophomore Melanie Baskind said. “It was a little scary in the first half. We were a little casual on defense, which allowed them to stick around a bit longer. It just took a little bit longer than we were expecting or would have liked.”
Baskind and freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen—who combined for six of Harvard’s 10 second-half scores—led the way, notching five goals apiece.
While the margin may have been large when the final buzzer sounded, it was not that way for the majority of the contest. The Crimson fell behind early to the last-place Lions and needed a late first-half run to take the lead heading into the locker room.
Trailing 4-3 with less than five minutes to play in the opening frame, Harvard went on a 4-1 run to close out the half up by two.
Freshman Danielle Tetreault tied the score at four with 4:24 remaining, going unassisted for the score. VanderMeulen gave her team the lead a minute later with an unassisted goal of her own for her third score of the contest.
But the Lions won the ensuing draw and, just 19 seconds later, tied the score back up at five courtesy of a goal from Olivia Mann.
Baskind—whose five goals were a career-high—gave her team the lead for good with an unassisted score and then found freshman Micaela Cyr with 1:55 left to put the Crimson up by two.
“Mel played a great game,” VanderMeulen said. “She was all over the field. She was playing at full speed on offense and defense. She was able to finish the ball for us, which we were having trouble with.”
But despite its late run, the Crimson was unhappy with its first-half play at the break.
“We weren’t shooting very well,” VanderMeulen said. “We just weren’t playing our hardest. Columbia was able to take advantage of it.”
Harvard attempted to create separation early in the second, but Columbia stuck around for the majority of the game, keeping the deficit at four or less until the final 10 minutes.
After Baskind drew first blood in the second half, the Lions’ Taylor Gattinella responded with a score of her own 40 seconds later.
The teams traded goals over the next six minutes until VanderMeulen and Tetreault notched back-to-back scores in under a minute to put their team ahead by four with 14:04 left to play.
Columbia answered with another score to cut the Crimson’s lead to three but Harvard then rattled off six-straight scores to put the match out of reach.
“[Early in the second half], we started taking control, but Columbia kept inching back,” VanderMeulen said. “We kept getting a lead but didn’t capitalize. In the last 10 minutes we were like, ‘This game can’t be close anymore.’ And then we kind of started going nuts.”
Baskind, Cyr, and co-captain Sara Flood each contributed two goals apiece down the stretch to help the Crimson total its second-highest offensive output of the season.
Following Saturday’s victory, the Crimson needed wins from Penn and Dartmouth—the top two teams in the conference—in order to secure the fourth spot in the Ivy League standings and earn a berth in the inaugural Ivy League Tournament. But the Big Green fell, 11-10, in overtime to Princeton yesterday, leaving Harvard just outside the tournament field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two games behind Rolfe Division leaders Brown and Dartmouth, the Harvard baseball team (14-22, 7-7 Ivy) didn’t do itself any favors in splitting its Saturday doubleheader against division bottom-dweller Yale (17-18-1, 4-10) in New Haven, Conn. After winning the opener, 7-4, the Crimson dropped a lopsided 15-1 nightcap. Now, the Crimson will have to win both of its remaining games against the Bulldogs today to keep itself in playoff contention before it takes on the surging Big Green next weekend.
“We’ve got our backs against the wall,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “And we’ve got to fight our way out.”
YALE 15, HARVARD 1
When the Bulldogs scored three runs in the bottom of the seventh of their early game loss, it seemed to be too little, too late—a small bright spot in a day dominated by the Crimson. In fact, it was just the opening of the floodgates.
“We felt good even though the end [of the first game] was scary,” Walsh said. “Yale carried that momentum into the second game.”
Its next inning at the plate, Yale picked up right where it left off, scoring as many runs in the first inning as Harvard had scored in the entire first game.
“Our pitching wasn’t there, our bats weren’t there,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “It was a bad game.”
The slaughter began when the Bulldogs’ first three batters all reached base. With the bases loaded and no outs, all it took was a single to second base from Yale senior Trygg Larson-Danforth to put the Bulldogs on the board. Junior Trey Rallis followed suit to give Yale a 2-0 lead, and sophomore Charlie Neil walked to put the Bulldogs up by three. The Crimson finally managed to get an out when senior Chris Rouches caught a fly ball from Bulldogs catcher Ryan Brenner, but even Brenner was able to pick up an RBI, with Larson-Danforth coming home on Brenner’s sacrifice fly.
“Uncharacteristically of [sophomore pitcher] Conner [Hulse], Yale was roughing him up,” Walsh said.
Yale would go on to score 13 runs before Harvard picked up one.
“We couldn’t get strikes,” Albright said. “Meanwhile, their starter [Vinny Lally] was getting strikes. He was getting ahead [on batters]. He had five innings with a no-hitter.”
The offensive drought was finally broken when Rouches sent Albright home with a left-field single in the seventh inning, but the Bulldogs answered back in the bottom half with two more runs, pushing the final margin to 14.
HARVARD 7, YALE 4
The expression “Good things come to those who wait” doesn’t usually apply to baseball. But with sophomore Brent Suter keeping the Bulldog batters in check, the Crimson had time to get its offense going and gradually build an imposing lead over the course of the game.
“Brent Suter was outstanding,” Walsh said. “He had a terrific fastball, curve ball. He was throwing strikes and mowing their running game down.”
The sophomore pitcher allowed nine hits and three runs in six innings before being replaced by classmate Will Keuper.
“We give him the ball, and he always comes through for us,” Albright said of Suter. “When he does that, it brings a lot of confidence to our hitters.”
And Harvard’s hitters helped Suter out too. Before the second-year hurler even hit the mound in the bottom of the first, the Crimson had mounted a one-run lead thanks to the bat and speed of junior Sam Franklin. Shortly after junior Dillon O’Neill had been picked off, Franklin hit a deep ball down the right field line for what looked to be a triple. But a throwing error by Yale’s rightfielder allowed Franklin to reach home plate for the first run of the game.
The Crimson bats wouldn’t strike again until the top of the third, by which time the Bulldogs had tied the game off a run by Charlie Neil. Once again, Franklin managed to score off a triple—this time from classmate Sean O’Hara—to put Harvard back up by one. O’Hara himself scored the next play on a sacrifice bunt attempt from Albright—though the junior catcher was safe at first thanks to a Yale error.
“We had some timely hitting,” Walsh said. “A good squeeze bunt by Ty Albright.”
With a sophomore holding court on the mound, the juniors continued to light it up at the plate. After freshman Kyle Larrow advanced to first base after being hit by a pitch and to second on a wild pitch, O’Neill sent the rookie home with a left-field single. Quieter was the impact the junior made by stealing second base two batters later. The stolen base allowed the outfielder to score when O’Hara hit a ground-rule double. The shortstop, who was 3-for-4 with two RBI and two runs, scored off an Albright single the next play.
“It kind of all came together in the first game,” Walsh said.
The Crimson kept on rolling until the seventh inning, when the Bulldogs were able to put together a late-game rally, scoring three runs in the bottom of the seventh to cut in half a six-run lead. But Harvard still managed finish off the game with a convincing three-run win, one that would prove a stark contrast from the next game.
“We’re going to try to emulate the first and learn from the second,” Albright said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No one ran faster than Usain Bolt, but the Harvard track and field team did not disappoint at the 116th annual Penn Relays.
The Crimson recorded some impressive finishes at the historic meet, which brings together the world’s best high school, collegiate, and national runners for a three-day competition that featured races including the world’s fastest man and his Jamaican teammates this year.
“The Penn Relays is a pretty impressive meet,” said men’s co-captain Jack Brady. “There were a lot of fans, it was a great atmosphere, and everyone thought it was a great event.”
On Thursday, it was the Harvard women’s distance medley relay team that stole the show, shattering a school record while winning a collegiate title.
The team of freshmen Melissa Bellin and Carlyle Davis, junior co-captain Thea Lee, and classmate Claire Richardson finished with a time of 11:21.31, topping second-place Texas by just one second. The team beat the former Crimson record, set last year, by 19 seconds.
“The Penn Relays isn’t the most ideal environment in terms of race preparation, warming up, that sort of thing,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “But I thought the ladies did a great job getting out there and competing.”
On Friday, Harvard continued to turn in strong performances.
Brady placed third out of 31 in the Eastern Collegiate shot put, with a 16.25-meter throw, and freshman teammate Edward Brucker finished fifth with a 16.05-meter toss.
“I was happy with my place, because I didn’t have a medal from the Penn Relays,” Brady said. “In terms of my distance, it was a fine throw, not particularly good or bad for me. I thought overall it was productive.”
Also on the men’s side, the 4x200-meter relay team—co-captain Justin Grinstead, sophomores Jonathan Meminger and John Dingus, and junior John Fahnestiel—finished 28th out of 69 teams.
On Saturday, another Harvard women’s team turned in a dominant performance, with the quartet of Davis, Lee, sophomore Meghan Looney, and junior Hilary May winning the 4x800-meter relay in 8:46.98. Their time topped 25 other teams, including second-place Dartmouth by nearly six seconds. The team fell just three seconds short of breaking the 13-year-old meet record in the event, held by Penn State.
“It was really fun to see them compete,” Saretsky said. “Lee did an outstanding job getting us into position, and then each athlete ran really strong legs.”
BROWN SPRINGTIME INVITATIONAL
At the Brown Springtime Invitational yesterday afternoon, both the men’s and women’s teams continued to record head-turning performances.
Sophomore Tyler Funk won the men’s high jump, with a leap of 1.96 meters, and freshman Jakob Lindaas finished first in the men’s 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of 9:41.60. It was only Lindaas’s second time participating in the event.
“I was able to kind of push it near the end a little bit more,” Lindaas said. “And fortunately I was able to take the lead and get the win.”
In the long jump, Crimson senior Graham Infinger and freshman teammate Kenneth Wang Kan finished 1-2 with leaps of 6.55 and 6.48 meters, respectively.
Brady and junior teammate Eric Clayman also turned in strong performances in the hammer throw, finishing third and fourth, respectively. Brady bested his performance at last year’s Brown Springtime Invitational by nearly seven meters and set a career record with his 59.60-meter throw.
The Harvard women dominated the high jump, with freshman Mary Hirst and junior Dina Emde finishing 1-2, with respective leaps of 1.70 and 1.65 meters. It was their second-consecutive 1-2 finish in the event, after doing so at Yale last Saturday.
“I just focused and talked myself into believing I could jump over, and it worked out,” Hirst said. “I was very excited...I knew I made it even before I hit the mat.”
Junior Jessica Fronk also took first place with her 43.48-meter javelin heave.
And in the 100-meter dash, freshman Jasmine Cho came in third overall with a time of 12.59 seconds.
Both Brady and Saretsky said they felt the Springtime Invitational—the team’s final regular-season meet—would serve as good preparation for the playoff competitions, beginning with the Heptagonal Championships on May 8, that lie ahead.
“It was a long weekend for us, but we accomplished a lot,” Brady said. “We got a lot of work in, and I feel like we’re definitely ready for Heps.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A day after a disappointing third-place finish in the Ivy League championship, the Harvard women's golf team received some consolation this morning in the form of the announcement of the league's individual awards.
The Crimson swept the two main honors, as sophomore Christine Cho was named Ivy League Player of the Year, while freshman Katie Sylvan was named the Rookie of the Year based on voting by the league’s seven head coaches.
Last year's Ivy Rookie of the Year, Cho led the team in scoring average her second time around, posting a 76.13 average and placing first on the team in three tournaments this season.
One-hundredth of a stroke behind Cho in scoring average, Sylvan was a highly-touted recruit who lived up to lofty expectations in her first collegiate season with consistently strong performances all year.
Based on their individual finishes in the league championship, Sylvan and Cho also earned spots on the All-Ivy teams. A placement in a tie for fourth yesterday garnered Sylvan a spot on the first team, while Cho's eighth place finish earned her second-team honors.
Joining Cho on the All-Ivy second team was captain Claire Sheldon, who finished among the league championship's top 10 for the third time in her career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Football got a head start on the 2010 season with Saturday’s annual intrasquad spring game. The scrimmage provided some answers, but raised even more questions, and it seems like a quarterback battle will once again be taking center stage this September.
The Back Page sat down with Harvard coach Tim Murphy after the game, and here’s what he had to say on the return of Andrew Hatch, the rebuilding of the offensive line, and more.
On the situation at quarterback:
“I don’t think any of the quarterbacks played extremely well in the spring for a variety of reasons, but I think with Collier [Winters], Andrew Hatch, and Colton Chapple, we’re going to have the ability and the depth to be good at that position. How good remains to be seen. We need to improve against the blitz, we need to improve our football IQ on some things, and we need to take care of the football better. It’s a good group, but we need one of those guys to really jump out and improve to be a championship-caliber offense. That’s what our expectation is, that one of those guys will do that.”
On the possible return of Andrew Hatch:
“Well first of all, he hasn’t been 100% officially cleared by the NCAA, and we won’t know that maybe until Sep. 1. So it’s obviously hard to put him in that hole when you don’t even know if he’s going to be eligible. I mean, the signs and the precedent is there that he should be, and he’s had a solid spring, but he still has a ways to go. We run a [much] more sophisticated, pro-style offense than LSU did. They were very simple, just kind of three-step stuff, bubble screens and get it to their fast guys. Here, it’s a little bit more like a pro-style offense, at least from the pass-game standpoint. He’s shown flashes of brilliance, he’s just got to be more consistent, he has to take care of the football more, but it is a legitimate competition. And if he hadn’t been here, I’m not sure that it would have been. I would have said that Collier’s pretty much a slam dunk, but now there’s a competition, so we probably won’t know who our starting quarterback’s going to be until conceivably a week before the Holy Cross game.”
On rebuilding the offensive line:
“I think it’s our biggest concern on the whole team, and part of it is anytime you lose four seniors, it’s a huge rebuilding project. Having said that, we’re to the point with our program where we’re still going to end up starting nothing but juniors and seniors next year. So if you look at, as an example, Kevin Murphy replacing a three-time first-team All-Ivy league lineman, which almost never happens at that position, in James Williams, a guy who will sign an NFL contract [Sunday], you say, ‘Wow, that’s a big dip.’ It won’t be. People are going to be saying, where did this guy come from? Kevin’s going to be a great football player. Not just because he’s 6’7”, but because he’s extremely competitive, extremely focused, he’s smart, he’s tough, he gets better every single week, and he’s a guy that I think will be a very legitimate NFL prospect in a year. So we’re happy to have a left tackle that when you lose someone of the quality of James Williams, you can step up and bring in a Kevin Murphy. Kevin’s got two years to go, he’s got a ways to go, but he’s too talented and especially too committed to not be very good. And our expectation is for him to be an All-Ivy level player next year…The biggest part of the issue is anytime you have to replace four guys at a very labor-intensive position, it really takes a long time to become a unit. That’s your big concern. We have the talent, we have to find out of we can develop the leadership and the cohesiveness, but it has a chance.”
On the defensive line:
“We have the potential to have one of the better defensive lines we’ve ever had here. You look at guys like Chucks Obi, you look at Josue Ortiz, you look at David Sklar, three seniors, those kids along with fourth-year senior Ben Graeff with another year to go, junior John Lyon. We expect that group to be dominant, that’s our expectation. We’re not there yet, but we definitely have the talent, and I think we definitely have the attitude with that group and the potential to be really outstanding. And that’s where you start on defense. If your front four can be an outstanding group, then you have a chance to be really good.”
On the returning depth at receiver and running back:
“If you go to receivers, it’s just the opposite, receivers and running backs. Depth and experience. At running back, you’ve got two guys that, you’ve got the Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and you’ve got a kid who was first-team all-Ivy. So that’s a luxury. They’re both very athletic, very smart, very competitive kids—obviously Gino Gordon and Treavor Scales. Gino’s become an outstanding leader for the football team. Receiver, it’s a very experienced group, I don’t know if we’re as good there, but it is very experienced. You’ve got guys like Michael Cook, who was banged up this spring. You obviously have got guys like Levi [Richards], who’s coming back into it, he was injured all of last year. You’ve certainly got guys like Adam Chrissis, who’s played since he was a freshman…Marco [Iannuzzi], of course, and we’ve got [Chris Lorditch], an All-Ivy kid returning at the x, caught a touchdown tonight. The combination of those guys means we’ve got a lot of depth. We need some of those guys to break out and be front-line, top-level Ivy League players. And we’ve only had one guy do that so far. The bottom line is that we’re experienced, but I’d like us to be a little more explosive. Adam Chrissis showed us a little bit of that today.”
On special teams:
“Special teams, we need to improve dramatically. In 2008, we finished last in the league and managed to win a championship, which is highly unusual. We got a little better last year, but we need to take the next step if we’re going to be a championship-caliber team. Right now we lose our top kicker, the incumbent is going to be Jake Dombrowski, but he’s been inconsistent in the spring. He’s got a strong leg, he’s got a lot of ability, but so much of that position is mental. Right now we’re counting on him at two positions, both punter and kicker—not an easy thing to do. But right now, unless we talk about freshmen, we don’t have anybody to really compete with him.
Kick return, I think we’ve got some reasonable depth. We’ll have guys like Treavor Scales, Marco Iannuzzi, Gino Gordon, Matt Hanson. All fast kids, all kids that were offensive players even if they aren’t playing offense now, before, and we feel like we’ve kind of got to rotate those guys, keep them fresh, but that should be much improved. Other guy I forgot to mention, was out all spring, Brian Owusu, and Brian’s another guy that if you look back at the secondary, he’s a guy that we’re counting on at the corner position to be a high-level corner even as a sophomore.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With one weekend left to determine who gets to play in the first Ivy League men’s lacrosse tournament, there are two things we know for certain. Princeton is in, and Penn is out. Everything else seems shrouded in mystery.
This is what we know for sure: with a win, Cornell, Brown, Harvard, and Yale guarantee themselves a spot in the tournament. The Big Red, Bears, and Bulldogs could lose and possibly still get in. Dartmouth needs a win and some help to clinch a spot.
Read on after the jump for a breakdown of the four possible situations in which Harvard can make the tournament:
1. CORNELL BEATS PRINCETON, HARVARD BEATS YALE, DARTMOUTH BEATS BROWN
The Big Red claims a share of the Ivy crown by beating the Tigers, and gets the privilege of hosting the tournament due to its head-to-head win over Princeton. Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown would be in a four-way tie for third place. The Crimson and Bulldogs would advance with their 2-1 head-to-head records (Harvard would have beaten Dartmouth and Yale, Yale would have beaten Brown and Dartmouth). The Bears and Big Green go home.
2. CORNELL BEATS PRINCETON, HARVARD BEATS YALE, BROWN BEATS DARTMOUTH
Cornell, Princeton, and Brown share the Ivy title three ways. The tournament goes to Providence, the Big Red becomes the No. 2 seed, and the Tigers are No. 3. The Crimson and Bulldogs would be tied for fourth, with Harvard getting the final spot due to its head-to-head win.
3. PRINCETON BEATS CORNELL, HARVARD BEATS YALE, BROWN BEATS DARTMOUTH
The Tigers win the title outright and the Bears grab the No. 2 seed at 4-2. Cornell, Yale, and Harvard would be in a three-way tie for third. The Big Red, with its 2-0 record over those opponents, gets the No. 3 seed. The Crimson becomes No. 4 with a head-to-head win over the Bulldogs.
4. PRINCETON BEATS CORNELL, HARVARD BEATS YALE, DARTMOUTH BEATS BROWN
All hell breaks loose. Princeton still wins its outright title, but there would be a five-way tie for second place, with the quintet of contenders all having 3-3 league records and 2-2 head-to-head records. In that scenario, the next tiebreaker is record against the top seed. Harvard’s the only team to have beaten the Tigers this season, and therefore it becomes the No. 2 seed. Among the remaining four teams, Dartmouth and Yale sneak in, leaving the Big Red and Bears at home.
In the end, for the Crimson it comes down to what the squad does on the field next Saturday. All of these scenarios predict a Harvard victory, while a loss to the No. 11 Bulldogs sends the Crimson packing. We’ll have to see what shakes out five days from now in New Haven.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior Owen Thomas, one of the University of  Pennsylvania’s recently-elected football captains, was found dead in his off-campus  apartment around 2 p.m. this afternoon.
The Allentown, Pa. native passed away from unknown  causes, but the Daily Pennsylvanian reports that no foul play is suspected. Thomas, a  second-team All Ivy selection at defensive end this past season, recorded a  team-high six sacks—good for second in the league—and helped lead the Quakers'  defensive unit to No. 1 in the nation in total defense and scoring defense, according  to the Penn Athletics website.
Thomas, whose older brother Matt played football  for the Quakers and graduated in 2002, was enrolled at Wharton.

While we recognize that it's been fairly easy to spot prefrosh around Cambridge this weekend, we also recognize that engaging with prospective students has been at times, well, awkward. For those of you who feel as if you haven't had the chance to get to know the Class of 2014 (and for those of you who can't get enough of them), we here at FlyBy would like to introduce the Class of 2014 in a short video. Enjoy!
Sections
Classes end Wednesday, and that means that finals are just ahead. But before you retreat into Lamont and start your shower-free reading period routine in earnest, be sure to make some time for House formals.
Wednesday, April 28
Currier: Harbor Cruise
Yes, Currier’s formal will again take place on a boat. But at the risk of making T-Pain cry, we refuse to include a link to that Lonely Island song from last year. It’s sure to be on the playlist anyway. Plus, even if you’re not a huge fan of “On a Boat,” you’ll love being on the Spirit of Boston. Currier's HoCo says it’s “arguably the nicest boat in Boston Harbor,” with two dance floors and four decks. All told, this sounds like a great way to finish off your last day of lecture—but unless you’re a strong swimmer, be sure to show up on time.
Thursday, April 29
Pfoho: Clue
This year’s (p)formal takes its inspiration from that classic family-friendly game of murder and deception, Clue. This theme is usually tricky—for one thing, how many Misses Peacock can there be before people start showing up in identical dresses? Awksies—but the House’s ongoing game of Assassins should keep things lively. A sprawling tent out on the Moors Terrace will keep this outdoor formal free of rain. Just watch out for falling candlesticks.
Friday, April 30
Leverett: Royale
The violent themes continue with “Royale,” a James Bond-inspired formal. In keeping with their strong reputation for sophistication and intimidation, Lev residents will turn the Old Library in McKinlock Hall into an elegant dance space with a hint of casino flair. International intrigue and/or your roommate’s awful attempt at a British accent guaranteed.
Cabot: Fly Me to the Moon
Taking a cue from some old vocalist dude (Frank Somebody-or-other), Cabot House invites you to “Fly [It] to the Moon.” Expect great music on this one, with a healthy mix of current hits and timeless standards. Another plus: this formal will take place outside on the gorgeous Moors Terrace (Think: “I can see my House from here!”).
Winthrop: Arbella Ball
In 1630, the ship Arbella carried John Winthrop to the New World, facilitating the establishment of what would become this glorious commonwealth. On Friday, the annual Arbella Ball will carry residents of John Winthrop House to levels of glorious revelry that only formals week can facilitate. The Ball will once again feature a live band in the Gore Courtyard as well as chocolate fountains and dancing in the LCR.
Saturday, May 1
Adams: Adventure with Indiana Jones
FlyBy will have to resist the temptation to record ourselves singing the Indiana Jones theme music long enough to tell you about this formal. Adams House residents will swathe themselves in protective formalwear and venture into the uncharted depths of, well, Adams House. Basically, Adams is using Harrison Ford to pretend that this is different from a standard Adams House Saturday night, but we'll let it slide, with special thanks to John Williams! doo dadoot-doooooooo, doo dadoooooo…
Quincy: Q-Ball
Quincy’s setup this year sounds pretty nice. The Penguins will take over the Harvard Club of Boston with catering and an open bar, and even provide return transportation. Definitely worth… racking up? Applying chalk to your hands? Shaving your head? Insert a witty billiards metaphor here.
Mather: Venice Carnival
In addition to the standard tuxes and gowns, Matherites will don elaborate masks for their spring formal in a nod to Venetian revelry. And really, is there any better setting for a recreation of the glamour of Venice’s famous festival than the charming and elegant Mather courtyard? Be sure to keep an eye out for in-House mask-making opportunities.
Sunday, May 2
Lowell: Bacchanalia
Lowell’s Roman festival-inspired spring formal is always a gem of the season. Lowell transforms its central courtyard into a glowing garden. It's a great example of a House using its resources to its advantage and creating something magical. Note that it’s not a toga party.
Kirkland: K-Soirée
Kirkland’s got a great multi-stage formal lined up. Start off at a BBQ in the courtyard, launch the evening at a cocktail reception in the JCR, and fly high at The Estate downtown. That club was a big hit last year during Quincy’s formal, so this should be entertaining—but with Kirkland’s notorious penchant for dormcest, well, prepare for trouble.
Monday, May 3
Eliot: Fête
One Eliot resident, when asked for information about his House’s formal, sent an e-mail that simply read "No. You're not privileged enough to know about The Fête." That pretty much sums up this event: internally celebrated but pretty much irrelevant to the rest of campus—though we have to admit, we're a little jealous. Have a great time, Eliot!
Dunster: Beltane
Named for an ancient Celtic celebration, Dunster’s Beltane may come closest to capturing the spirit of formal season by heralding the coming of summer. Dunster’s beautiful paneled dining hall and courtyard should set the mood perfectly, which may be why Beltane was “last year's highest attended formal” according to Dunster’s HoCo chairs. We hope the House will really go all out for this event; might we suggest a moose roast?

For his Washington Post blog, intrepid journalist and UCLA grad Ezra Klein spoke to a member of an endangered species: a Wall Street recruit from Harvard.
What is it like to be a member of an elite (albeit dying) breed? Ezra Klein gives us the scoop.
According to the “accidental banker,” an anonymous Harvard alum, the way to grow up fast is by heading to Wall Street. The mysterious banker “focused on history and government and political philosophy” at Harvard (does that mean Social Studies?), landed a summer internship at Goldman after junior year, and then promptly returned to Goldman after graduating (that’s a story we haven’t heard before).
The banker says that it is appealing to have a job lined up in September of senior year, a hefty salary, and the opportunity to build skills that can be used in other sectors.
Of course, Wall Street comes with its own fair share of sacrifices, the alum says. “These aren't the types of things you grow up dreaming of doing, but you wear a business suit, you meet clients. It's a way of growing up very quickly.”
So what makes these kids so obnoxious?
“People on Wall Street work very hard and they feel they chose this path because there was a reward promised to them. And now, when it's being taken away from them, they get very angry."
