After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Local businesses are struggling. The same stores that enrich our lives while on campus — offering everything from unnecessarily expensive lattes to take out Greek food — are now suffering the economic toll of our prolonged absence from campus. Deprived of a large chunk of their customer base and unsure about their near future, several decades-old, Harvard-reliant businesses like Café Pamplona and Dickson Bros. have been forced to shut down.
The dire economic trend is hardly limited to Harvard. Small businesses are struggling across the United States, closing by the tens of thousands and leaving former owners and employees reeling in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis. In the eyes of some, this crisis is a result of our response to the pandemic — of the excessive use of lockdowns and restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of a virus that has now infected over 14 million Americans.
But blaming the widespread economic hardship on the pandemic response alone is misguided. We agree that in some specific cases existing restrictions might be imperfect. Their purpose ought not to be about publicly proving a governing body's willingness to tackle the issue, but rather about actually doing so effectively while balancing other public interests. Some increasingly popular policies, like state-wide curfews, appear more arbitrary than effective; others prioritized the reopening of recreational facilities like bars over ensuring ready access to public education, reflecting poorly on our collective priorities. These approaches should be challenged and questioned, and businesses should be given as much ability to function as they can while being safe.
Yet the truth is that most businesses simply cannot operate safely under our current health climate, not while the country is setting daily records of new COVID-19 cases. Allowing them to reopen without restrictions, or expecting them to do so, is a disservice to both the health of their workers and patrons and that of the larger community. But that shouldn't mean they have to close down — not permanently, at least.
The economic challenges brought on by the pandemic have been frequently framed as a matter of cost-benefit analysis, a zero-sum game where we must choose between keeping people alive (generally considered a good thing) and ensuring they are not financially devastated (also important!). But we shouldn't have to choose between saving lives and saving businesses. In fact, we don't have to. Bold, effective government intervention — featuring both health-oriented restrictions and substantial economic support for affected businesses — could address our twin crises, keeping Americans safe and economically afloat.
Some regional actors, like the Cambridge City Council, are already trying to support small businesses, allocating $3.6 million to a business relief program including zero-interest loans and grants. The effort is commendable and worth continuing, but insufficient. Our current coronavirus catastrophe isn't confined to our city. The response shouldn't be either. We urgently need an effective national strategy, including another round of stimulus checks.
The federal government’s failure to pass the massive relief struggling businesses and workers need is enormously disappointing — disappointing not just on the usual abstract scale of realizing our much-revered institutions have become legislative graveyards, but also on a purely human level. Growing numbers of Americans are going hungry heading into the holidays; a housing crisis is slowly building up across the country. They've both been met by shameful inaction. The outgoing administration and the incoming administration of Joseph R. Biden Jr. must provide another round of stimulus checks and relief support for struggling small businesses, for the sake of economic forecasts and basic decency. The approach has been lauded by economists and is vehemently supported by majorities of both major parties — by voters who, unlike many of their representatives, seemingly understand the pressing nature of the issue. Continuing to ignore public and economic demands for relief is baffling and grossly irresponsible.
We don't want to see our favorite local businesses go — and we shouldn't have to. Stores like Pamplona Café, with its rich history and eclectic yellow walls, tend to prove more worthwhile than their big-chain, titanic counterparts like Starbucks. But they are also more vulnerable to big economic shocks. Forcing them to endanger the public to survive or close down is dystopic and, worse still, unnecessary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
International students at Harvard and around the country have been targeted by Donald J. Trump’s administration, especially amid the uncertainty of the pandemic but also earlier in the President’s tenure. This election meant so much to many international students because it could have delivered either an end to these policies or their indefinite continuation. Now that Joseph R. Biden Jr. has won, he must deliver a Department of Homeland Security that treats all students, and all people, with dignity. That requires moving fast to undo some of his predecessor’s most cruel initiatives.
At the end of September, the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security issued a draft proposal for a new rule that would limit the duration international students can stay in the United States without reapplying. Under the current system, international students granted a student visa are allowed to stay in the U.S. “for the duration of status” — until the end of their studies, as long as they don’t violate other provisions in the visa’s rules. Under the new system, students will only be granted fixed-term four-year visas, after which they will be forced to reapply.
And that’s not the worst of it. Four years will be the standard offering, according to the Department’s website, “unless DHS determines that the nonimmigrant is subject to a shorter period of authorized stay limited to two years.” One factor that directs such a determination is country of origin: countries with greater than 10 percent of visitors to the U.S. overstaying student and exchange visas will automatically see their students “limited to up to a two-year fixed period of stay to increase monitoring, deter immigration violations and incentivize timely departure.”
This regulation, and the administration that promulgated it, must go right out the door on Jan. 20. Students require security and continuity in their education, and none deserve to be set back temporarily or permanently, prevented from making living arrangements, enrollment decisions, and prioritizing school work because a government hostile to a global exchange of knowledge and ideas has decided they aren’t welcome in America.
So what are the prospects for fighting this noxious nugget of thinly-veiled regulatory nativism?
At first glance, they appear weak. After draft rule changes like this one, there is a mandatory public comment period of at least 30 but usually closer to 60 days, set at the discretion of the agency releasing the rule, after which a rule is final and has the full force of law.
The Congressional Review Act, a 1996 measure passed under the auspices of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich as part of the Contract With America Advancement Act, offers a way out for this and other 11th hour regulatory efforts. The act provides that if both houses of Congress pass a resolution disapproving of a regulation and the president signs that resolution, the regulation is voided. Under the CRA, rules submitted to Congress are eligible to be overturned by a resolution of disapproval for 60 Congressional working days. But if the 60-day limit runs into a new Congress, the timeline resets in both houses, and the new legislators have a full 60 congressional working days to pass resolutions of disapproval.
The upshot? If (and only if) Democrats win both seats in Georgia on Jan. 5, the Biden Administration will have a 60 Congressional-working-day countdown with which to undo the Trump Administration’s last regulatory acts, including reversing the new DHS visa limitations which would provide immediate relief to international students whose status in the U.S. may be at risk.
Further, the passage of a resolution of disapproval has longer-term implications: the agency in question is barred from making future regulations that are “substantially the same” without express legislative authorization to do so at a later date. Using the CRA offers not just a way to immediately rescind certain regulations, but a long-term bulwark against future abuse.
And that’s not the only issue CRA resolutions can address: Some of the most egregious regulatory efforts of the last 60 congressional working days, (likely since sometime this summer, depending on the number of days the current Congress remains in session) include an emissions-intensive relaxation of the EPA’s methane emissions standards for fossil fuel facilities, as well as deregulation of substances known as volatile organic compounds. Just on the environment, 20 more pernicious regulations are waiting in the wings for a final sprint to the end of the year.
This systematic effort would be the unfortunate but logical next tit-for-tat in the ongoing deep political conflict our country faces. The CRA had only been used once in this manner before 2017, when the then-incoming 115th Congress used it more than a dozen times to undo regulations issued under the Obama administration.
Cooperation between parties, sharing of ideas, and a genuine exchange of perspectives remain enormously valuable. But democracy has been studied as a multi-period game, in the economic sense. Each side responds strategically to the other, and the sides can either set norms of reciprocity or distrust. Living in 2020, there can be little doubt that distrust is the currency of the day. The past four years have already borne witness to legal efforts to disenfranchise minority voters, completely unfounded claims of election fraud, and three historically brazen episodes of Supreme Court hardball. Democrats must find measured but substantive ways to communicate that such violations will not be forgiven without reply, without forgetting that for such downward spirals to end, cooler heads more eager for cooperation and mutual toleration must eventually prevail.
One can long for the days of consistency of governing approach and a broad value consensus across the two parties, with large degrees of continuity in the regulatory state between administrations, and hope to return to them someday soon for the sake of democratic stability and a healthier society. But so long as we remain so intensely, bitterly divided, procedural mechanisms must be understood — within important limits: the impartiality of our elections must be sacred, among other things — as Republicans seem to understand them: Vital political tools to protect the values that we believe American institutions should embody.

Joan N. Kane ’00 and her family take pandemics very seriously.
Her grandmother, Barbara Kokuluk, survived the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic orphaned on a peninsula in remote, subarctic northwestern Alaska. In Jan. 1919, Barbara was only six years old. Still, she, along with her ten-year-old sister Ursula and one-year-old sister Theresa, managed to travel 20 miles to an orphanage.
The sickness that threatened the life of Kane’s grandmother devastated countless other Alaska Native families. Across the world, the 1918 pandemic had a 2.5 percent mortality rate. In Alaska, though, Alaska Natives accounted for approximately 82 percent of deaths, despite making up only 48 percent of the territory’s population. One estimate suggests that the mortality rate for Alaska Natives reached eight percent.
Kane, a poet and visiting lecturer and fellow at the Radcliffe Institute, often finds herself thinking about her family’s history as she worries about its future.
Both of Kane’s sons attend Cambridge Public Schools. Her eldest is in the seventh grade at Putnam Avenue Upper School, and her youngest is in the fifth grade at Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School. Conscious of the “disproportionate impact” of the pandemic on people of color, she considers how the COVID-19 pandemic may affect her sons in ways that she “can’t even imagine.”
“We’re at a high risk statistically because we’re Native American and disproportionately impacted by almost every health indicator in this country,” she says.
Like many parents across Cambridge, Kane has found herself in a precarious position. As the school year began, she weighed her hopes of reintroducing her children to some in-person socialization against the uncertainty of how to ensure their safety. Schools, meanwhile, were caught in a similar limbo, attempting to balance precaution against the wide-ranging, sometimes contradictory preferences of families and educators.
The Cambridge Public School District opted for a phased-in hybrid approach to reopening this fall, starting all students learning remotely on Chromebooks four days a week. Starting Oct. 13, eligible students — including preschool through first graders, some second and third graders, English language learners, and those in special education programs — could choose to come to school four days per week for in-person classes.
For students to continue learning in-person, two of three things must remain true at any given time: The average daily number of new confirmed cases in the last week in Cambridge must remain under 25 per 100,000 residents, the rate of positive tests in Cambridge over the previous two week period must stay below five percent, and the level of COVID-19 in Cambridge sewage water cannot stray above 100 copies viral genomes per milliliter.
On Dec. 6, the district’s “COVID-19 Data Dashboard” reported that both the level of COVID-19 in the sewage water and the daily number of new positive cases had surpassed the thresholds set by the district. Sewage numbers reached 658.5 copies viral genomes per milliliter and confirmed cases per 100,000 residents reached 26.9. Accordingly, Superintendent Kenneth N. Salim announced that schools would shift to a week of all-remote learning starting Dec. 10.
Though currently only temporary, the sudden shift reflects the general air of uncertainty that has surrounded the academic year since planning for reopening began this summer.
Asked about an ideal reopening plan for her children, Kane explains that she doesn’t “necessarily even need them to be back in the classroom or back in the physical school building.” What she’s really looking for, she says, is the sense of community that’s “an extension of the classroom, beyond the Chromebook.”
A sense of community alone isn’t a full solution, but it might provide some relief to Kane, a single parent. A poet with four part-time teaching jobs, Kane is the only adult in her house; she is solely responsible for her two young boys.
“Even the most inclusive public school environments tend to privilege the type of student who is in a dual-parent, single-child household, which I think is what the expectation is culturally for a lot of kids,” Kane says.
Before Oct. 13, Debbie J. Bonilla, a CPS parent, anticipated reopening to present a “horrible” choice for families: “Do I send my child in or do I quit work? And then what do I do for money?”
Bonilla is the district’s Title I Family Liaison, meaning she works to address the needs of families at schools serving a high percentage of low-income students. She’s also CPS’s outreach service worker for those experiencing homelessness. These combined roles put Bonilla in frequent contact with some of Cambridge’s most vulnerable families.
When she thinks about reopening, she often has these students and their families in mind. She recognizes that CPS has prioritized returning high-need students to the classroom but also points out that going back puts them at a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19.
Despite its reputation of wealth and privilege, the city of Cambridge boasts a fairly diverse population of public school students. In the 2018-19 school year, more than a quarter of students were from families considered “economically disadvantaged,” and 59.3 percent were non-white.
The challenge of reopening has surfaced tensions old and new — between public and private schools, between teachers and administrators, between vulnerable families and the representatives tasked with speaking on their behalf — testing the district’s ability to accommodate the needs of the diverse community it serves.
Because she is Puerto Rican and her children are Puerto Rican and Black, Bonilla explains, the pandemic “hits our people first, it hits our people the hardest.”
“There’s a real fear out there,” she says.
It’s the same fear Kane and countless other parents across the district feel: a creeping suspicion that those families most at risk may have the least say in the decision making process.
Just above his head in the Zoom frame, Dr. Bradley E. Bernstein raises one hand. As he ranks the importance of COVID-19 safety measures for a return to in-person schooling, he lowers his hand incrementally to indicate notches in a descending list of bullet points.
Being able to monitor local levels of COVID-19 through testing is the highest priority, he says, followed by securing personal protective equipment for students and teachers and the proper ventilation of school buildings. Social distancing, he adds, is “the fourth thing or fifth thing down.”
“From a scientific perspective, I’ve given you the ranking,” he says. “But probably we need to pay attention to the perception.” There’s a difference, Bernstein explains, between the measures that will limit the spread of the virus and those that will make students and educators comfortable in the classroom.
On July 14, the Cambridge School Committee convened a special meeting to discuss fall reopening plans. For over four hours, the committee heard public testimony, received a presentation from the superintendent, and posed questions to Bernstein and two other public health experts.
The Cambridge School Committee is a seven-member board of local elected officials chaired by Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui that oversees “overall School Department policy and budget.” This year, however, its duties included managing the district’s reopening.
When the committee decided to recruit a team of health experts to provide scientifically-grounded advice, it didn’t have to look far: All of the doctors and public health officials who serve on the task force are members of the Cambridge community. “When it comes to these issues around public health, the expertise was here,” explains Mannika L. Bowman, the committee’s vice-chair. Bernstein, for example, is a professor of pathology at Mass General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Broad Institute’s Epigenomics Program.
It’s rare for a relatively small municipality to have such highly credentialed medical advisors. Still, not everyone felt comfortable heeding the task force’s advice.
All three task force members who served on the July 14 Zoom panel were white. Amara E. Donovan — a CPS parent and leader of the Cambridge Families of Color Coalition, an advocacy group — says it was only after she and others complained about the task force’s lack of diversity that the committee added a doctor of color.
Listening to the panelists, Bonilla felt that the doctors advocated for a return to in-person classes, a message she says seems out of step with what parents of color wanted. “We already don’t trust you, and now you have white doctors telling us to come back?” she recalls thinking. “You’re just making things worse.”
Asked in October whether she had encountered this feedback, Bowman, who is Black, said it was her first time hearing of the issue.
For Bonilla and Donovan, the oversight highlights a disconnect between the district and families of color they say predates the pandemic. In recent years, students and families have criticized Cambridge schools for their handling of racist graffiti, perceived racism on the part of teachers, and an instance in which a white school committee member used the n-word in an academic discussion with high school students.
The Cambridge Families of Color Coalition, which Donovan helps lead, aims to support and advocate for families and students of color across the district. The official CFCC mission articulates a desire to “see Cambridge Public Schools be a place where Students of Color thrive academically, socially, emotionally, physically, and in spirit.”
During the pandemic, the group has worked to express families’ anxieties surrounding the possibility of returning to in-person schooling.
“They [the district] have only been addressing one aspect of the science data, and that is, ‘Well, if the metrics and the numbers are good, then there should be not a problem to go back,’” explains Bernette J. Dawson, another CFCC leader. “But science is also, too, about anxiety and fear, so that mental health aspect. And they’re not talking about that.”
On July 28, the CFCC published an official statement of demands addressed to the school committee, articulating its preference that school start completely remotely for the fall semester. The CFCC characterizes this plan as safety and equity driven, stressing the necessity of a phased-in approach that would allow families of color to participate in reopening decisions as they unfold.
“Returning to school has become a moment of unavoidable confrontation with an education system that has far too long disenfranchised Black and Brown youth, families, and educators,” the statement reads. “To create plans for an equitable return to school, Black and Brown students, families, and educators must have meaningful leadership in the planning, implementation, and decision-making processes.”
Families of color, Donovan suggests, had unique concerns that led them to err on the side of caution: Many of the families she represents live in multi-generational households, where elderly family members or those with pre-existing conditions face an elevated risk if exposed to COVID-19.
As a result, many families of color opted out of in-person classes, she says, leaving school buildings filled with disproportionately white and affluent students. According to data compiled by the Cambridge School Committee, only 47 percent of African American students in preschool through third grade chose to resume in-person schooling, while 62 percent of white students opted in.
Emie Michaud Weinstock, another CFCC leader, says the school district spent most of its attention on what sanitation and safety measures would be necessary for students to attend in-person classes. CFCC wanted to turn that attention toward “building a robust remote option for families.”
The CFCC aimed to keep families, including those who need to work outside the home, from feeling like they need to choose between their children’s safety and the highest quality education, she says.
“You need to do better by the families who are not in school, and generally those higher numbers are families of color,” Michaud Weinstock recalls.
But Rachel B. Weinstein, a member of the Cambridge School Committee, says that the committee is in fact hearing “a wide variety of experiences” — and not all of them align with the CFCC’s advocacy. While many families have characterized the committee’s limited, phased reopening plans as “reckless,” she says others have argued that the school should have accepted more students into the building “yesterday.”
Weinstein calls these two preferences “both truths.” On the one hand, she agrees that the committee needs to prioritize safety and public health. On the other, she sees that students are “isolated and they’re lonely and virtual learning is hard.”
In mid-October, Weinstein says she heard most often from families who wanted their children back in school. Though parents cannot enter school buildings and students have to wear masks and maintain social distance, Weinstein says kids currently in the classroom “are so happy to go to school and to go back the next day and that they far prefer it to virtual learning.”
Asked about the CFCC’s concerns, Bowman, the committee’s vice-chair, also expresses her commitment to equity in education — but she realizes that equity means different things to different people. In her role, she prioritizes her commitments to “traditionally underserved” families and “families that have the most need.”
“It’s just tough dismantling years of white supremacy and discrimination within these institutions,” she adds.
But throughout this summer’s often tense planning process, these expressed commitments were not always visible to everyone. “It really felt like there was already plans and deliverables, and it was just meetings to make it seem like they included families of color when really they already knew what was going to come out of these meetings in the end,” Donovan says.
Michaud Weinstock similarly expresses that “it felt like they were checking a box by our presence as opposed to true, authentic and transparent decision-making.” For families and educators of color who met with the superintendent or assistant superintendents, she says their inclusion was “aspirational” but ultimately “inauthentic.” She believes, in the end, the administrators tend to listen to “the nice white parents.”
Weinstein acknowledges that the committee has room to grow in the way that it incorporates the views of different stakeholders, including students, caregivers, educators, and administrators. She says that some decision-making happened in stages rather than collectively: “Do I have the stakeholder at the table? Check. Did I reach out to multiple groups? Check,” she recalls.
Bowman, aware of the concerns of the CFCC, suggests that one advocacy group’s preferences can’t represent all of the community’s people of color. In fact, she says that surveys show that diverse voices and preferences exist within communities of color in Cambridge.
“I listened to those voices. I respect those voices. I honor those voices, but those voices do not represent every person of color in the city,” Bowman explains. “I think that we do people of color a disservice when we lump everyone into one particular cohort.”
For Michaud Weinstock and other CFCC members, the Cambridge district’s efforts to create what she calls a “blanket policy” regarding reopening feels counterproductive given the very diversity that Bowman cites.
“CPSD seems to create solutions that are one-size-fits all,” Michaud Weinstock says. “Families of color are nuanced and they need to be listened to in their nuances.”
A teacher’s request to “go around the table” and share ideas may be familiar to anyone acquainted with the traditional classroom. But a “Jamboard Opening Circle?” Perhaps a lesser known tactic.
These days, little-known, recently developed teaching strategies are the new norm for educators like Xi Yu ’13, a math teacher at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. The Jamboard opening circle is just one of the latest additions to her teaching repertoire – it’s the image of her students’ names positioned around a “table,” aimed at facilitating taking turns in virtual discussions.
Yu has needed a way to encourage sharing between students, whether to start off Monday morning class or, earlier in the year, help them digest a series of Zoom bombings at her school.
“The school didn’t provide any immediate guidance for how to repair the harm done by the racially and sexually explicit words and images that broke into classrooms,” Yu writes of the Zoom bombings in her personal blog “Dismantling Mathematics.” “Although my classes were not affected, it was necessary to provide a space for students (and teachers I worked on a team with) to process.”
This summer, Yu joined a large team of teachers, guidance counselors, special educators, and administrators that gathered to envision what remote learning could look like come fall.
Among the group’s concerns, Yu recalls, was equity — often articulated with a similar vocabulary as the CFCC. “What is our vision for what education can look like?” she remembers asking herself. “What does it look like from an equity lens? What does it look like from an anti-racist lens?”
Some educators in Cambridge worried that the district would exclude them from the process of planning reopening by hiring outside consultants. At a school committee meeting on June 30, teachers testified publicly against contracting consulting services from the District Management Group, who one CRLS faculty member said would “not know our students or our community and who are not invested in racial equity.”
After their testimony, Superintendent Kenneth Salim decided to withdraw the recommendation for the contract and place it on file.
Still, many teachers say they struggled to assert themselves in the planning process on the individual school level. By mid-August, the district still had not published an official plan for fall reopening, but Yu says that many at the time expected Cambridge to submit a hybrid proposal.
A small team of teachers at her school had been devising possible schedules to accommodate different reopening scenarios: “How many classes will people be taking? How much time would each of us spend in front of the screen? If it were hybrid, which group of students is going to be in the building? When? What time?” Yu recalls.
But in the end, the administration didn’t accept any of the teachers’ designs. Instead, it distributed its own schedule a few weeks before the official start of classes.
“Despite us working on teams that were supposed to have the voice over the summer, we ended up with a bell schedule that we had very little input in, but was apparently administration taking in the voices of lots of stakeholders, and this is the best compromise they could make,” Yu says.
After the district decided to move forward with an all-remote start, teaching struggles became pedagogical as well as logistical. When the district set aside ten days before the start of school for teachers to engage in professional development, Yu led workshops for her colleagues on how to create community in a remote classroom.
Being entirely on Zoom makes it difficult to encourage students to engage with both her and each other, Yu says. She can’t ask students to discuss math problems with “a neighbor” or walk around the class to check in and survey their work.
“In the Zoom room, you’re just listening to silence,” she explains. “And a teacher without strategy to combat this might just be sitting in awkward silence for a very long time.”
Particularly when students don’t have their cameras turned on, it is challenging to encourage and engage students, say Yu and her colleague Rachel E. Otty, a history teacher at CRLS. Though many of Otty’s students keep their cameras on throughout class, she says a significant number don’t and may not participate aloud or through Zoom’s chat function.
Unlike the spring when she had spent some in-person time with her students, Otty worries about her ability to get to know them in a completely remote setting. She admits her first week was marked by “utter exhaustion” and “a little sadness.”
By the third week, though, she felt more optimistic. Still, she was teaching some students whose faces she had never seen. She explains that, as a school policy, teachers can encourage or request cameras to be on but never require it.
“I think in part it’s an equity issue and not wanting to make people feel uncomfortable, whether that’s uncomfortable because of what’s going on in the background, or if they’re feeling sort of emotionally uncomfortable with it,” Otty says.
Yu believes that forcing students to have their cameras on is a form of policing — a classroom dynamic she aims to avoid.
On her blog, Yu noted a pattern in the students who chose to turn their cameras on for class. “I notice that only White students in my honors classes voluntarily turned their webcams on in Spring 2020 emergency distance learning. I notice that in my non-honors classes, my summer school credit recovery class, and my summer program for students of color (SOCs) in honors classes, only one out of ~45 students voluntarily turned their webcam on during class,” she wrote. “I notice that a colleague who previously taught at a private school said that there were no problems with students turning webcams on at her school.”
“It was this huge rush of not feeling prepared, feeling like a first year teacher again,” Yu says of the transition to remote learning.
On Nov. 17, Kenneth Salim, the Cambridge superintendent, addressed the school committee to discuss possible reopening plans for the spring 2021 semester. Though cases of COVID-19 are currently on the rise, every option remains on the table for spring – from reverting to an all-remote format to continuing with hybrid learning or increasing the number of students enrolled in-person.
Thinking about the resources necessary to accommodate the district’s most vulnerable families, Kane says she’s unsure “how these things are going to resolve.”
But Bowman, the school committee vice-chair, suggests that money has never posed a barrier to reopening in Cambridge. “We had the resources to do it,” she recalls. “It wasn’t money; it was a will issue.”
While keeping all students at home this fall might have been the “safer” option, Bowman says, introducing in-person learning for the highest-need students “was a really bold thing to do.”
Elsewhere in Cambridge, the challenge of reopening has cultivated less controversy.
At Buckingham Browne & Nichols School, a Cambridge K-12 private school, in-person classes resumed at the start of its school year in September. Students in kindergarten through sixth grade attend four days of in-person classes during the week; those in seventh through twelfth grade attend two. The majority of students decided to take the school up on its offer, with 88 percent of students in the lower school, 94 percent in the middle school, and 95 percent in the high school opting for in-person learning.
For the 2020-21 academic year, BB&N charges $36,400 in annual tuition for “beginners” through grade three, $40,600 for grades four and five, $48,400 for grade six, $51,800 for grades seven and eight, and $52,300 for grades nine through 12.
Alison M. Hong, whose son is a senior at BB&N, says she was pleasantly surprised by the back-to-school experience, which unfolded “pretty seamlessly” in the first weeks back. “For my son, at least,” she adds.
The school converted its athletic center into classrooms and tore down walls in some existing class spaces to ensure six-feet of distance between students. Sophomores and juniors report to the athletic center for their class days while freshmen and seniors learn in a separate classroom building. New outdoor tents allow students to eat lunch through bad weather and take their classes outside if necessary. Inside, kids report to assigned bathrooms and can only walk in one direction down the hallway.
“I fully recognize my privilege of being a stay- at- home mom and being able to manage these things,” Hong says, referencing the days her son attends classes remotely. “I feel like BB&N is really thoughtful in the fact that its community is diverse.” In planning its reopening, Hong says the school thought deeply about how best to “address the needs of all the community members.”
To ease the challenges of hybrid learning, BB&N distributed iPads to teachers and provided lapel microphones, boom microphones, and speakers to enhance the experiences of those using Zoom. AV units and 55-inch flat-screen TVs project the faces of remote learners into the physical classroom.
But the makeup of BB&N’s “diverse community” is noticeably different from that of the Cambridge Public Schools: According to a November 2019 report on inclusivity commissioned by its “head of school,” only five percent of BB&N students self-identify as “Black/African American,” and just under six percent self-identify as “Hispanic/Latinx.”
Still, education in a pandemic isn’t easy — even for a well-resourced school like BB&N. Many teachers echo the sentiment voiced by Yu, the CRLS math teacher, that remote teaching feels like “being a first-year teacher again.” Susan D. Glazer ’98, head of the History and Social Sciences department at the BB&N Upper School, says “there’s a lot of fear about coming in” among staff, even with the school’s rigorous social distancing procedures.
“I think people maybe don't recognize just what is going on in order to make a school function, whether the school is in a hybrid form or if it's in remote,” Glazer says. “Absolutely every single aspect of school has been changed and has to be rethought and re-imagined and replanned.”
What makes the difference, parents say, is the extent to which the administration appears to take their preferences into account.
After her son’s first day attending in-person classes, Hong says he told her he couldn’t imagine a way of contracting COVID-19 at school given the safety measures BB&N observed.
“I know he could catch COVID by going to the parking lot after school and having four friends come in his car,” Hong says. “But the actual school part? I won’t say it’s impenetrable, but it, again, is a rule-abiding, Dr. Fauci-approved set up.”
“I felt like there was a lot of trust on my end that they would kind of try to figure it out without there being other intentions and kind of keep it in the interest of students foremost,” says Young Ju A. Rhee, whose son is in ninth grade at BB&N. “So whatever they announced, my husband and I thought we would just go with that,” she says.
Rhee feels as if she and other private school parents had more ownership over their schools’ reopening processes. She and her husband were willing to trust BB&N’s decisions, she says, because she felt satisfied with her involvement in shaping them.
“And I suppose parents in public schools would do this with the town, right?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A holiday video showcase, a mockumentary, and a launch party on Youtube. Those are just some of the ways Harvard’s performing arts groups have adapted to creating content during the coronavirus era.
When Harvard abruptly sent students home in March due to the novel coronavirus, many student activities were thrown to the wayside as undergraduates scrambled to adapt to online learning. As a result, performing arts groups were forced to make due with producing content over Zoom, with many canceling their concerts, performances, and recitals.
Harvard’s announcement that it would continue a virtual learning format for fall 2020 dealt another blow to those performing arts groups.
“I think the first reaction of any performing arts group to this scenario is — could a worse thing happen?” said Michael B. Baick ’22, publicity manager for the Harvard Glee Club.
Groups have met the challenge of another remote semester in various ways — and with varying success. Some have found innovative ways to continue to fulfill their missions, including compilations of recorded performances, virtual speaker series, and increasing alumni engagement. Others decided to take a hiatus for the year, planning to continue their activities once members can reconvene in Cambridge.
Online learning has come with its own set of difficulties; for the performing arts, the virtual format has proved especially challenging, according to group members.
Though Zoom has served a useful purpose for many activities at the College, Baick said it does not meet the needs of performing arts groups.
“That illusion works in a lot of scenarios, but it does not work when you have the latency of trying to do a rehearsal,” he said.
Certain aspects of Zoom that have proven challenging for performers to overcome include its latency — the small delay in information transmitted from one person to another — and its dissociative nature, which hinders collaboration.
“There’s a connection that happens when you’re in the same room as the other performers,” said Soren E. Nyhus ’22, music director for the Harvard Bach Society Orchestra. “And that’s just something that’s not physically possible here.”
Yosvany Terry, director of the Jazz Bands, described orchestras as incompatible with virtual audio platforms. Long sustained notes played over Zoom essentially become amorphous noise, Terry said.
“Imagine eighteen instruments playing at the same time,” he said. “It would be catastrophic.”
In large part due to those technological challenges, the Jazz Bands group has discontinued its play for the duration of remote learning.
Club members also said it is difficult to sustain connections over the virtual format.
“All the dynamics you have in a real social event are lost, it basically feels like every time you go to talk and you have to stand on a podium,” said Jennifer Y. Wang ’22, president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra.
To overcome the barriers of this year’s virtual format, some groups have turned to condensed performances while others are promoting Zoom events tailored toward socializing.
This semester, the Bach Society Orchestra has alternated weeks between hosting social events and events geared toward music, according to Nyhus.
In place of synchronous rehearsals, the orchestra asks students to record themselves playing music and also hosts virtual watch parties to study concerts. Nyhus said the orchestra will host one virtual concert this semester.
The Radcliffe Orchestra will also put on remote performances this semester. Wang said the group has worked hard to prepare for two remote concerts. Still, she said the experience cannot match an in-person event.
“It’s a lot of work for an outcome that is nice, but it cannot really hold up to a full Symphony Orchestra in Symphony Hall,” Wang said.
The pandemic has also disrupted another key facet to performing arts groups: the audition.
Adam Mombru ’21, the music director for the Harvard Krokodiloes, Harvard’s all-male and oldest a cappella group on campus, said it is difficult for auditioners to display their skills over the remote format and for proctors to accurately evaluate their abilities.
“It’s kind of an unfair process in both directions,” Mombru said.
As a result, the Krokodiloes axed auditions this semester and did not invite any freshmen to join the group. The group continues to create content this semester, though, at “virtual gigs.”
Meanwhile, other groups, including the Radcliffe Orchestra, the Bach Society Orchestra, and the Glee Club, solicited recorded performances from students interested in joining their organizations.
To the surprise of some groups, members said attrition has not changed significantly in spite of the virtual format.
Wang said the Radcliffe Orchestra experienced less attrition this year than in previous years, which she chalked up to the lighter time commitment expected of members during the virtual semester.
Baick, the Glee Club member, also said members have lighter work loads this semester, but that their roles are far from easy.
“Everything is so exhausting right now,” he said.
As a result, some groups decided to suspend their activities until the pandemic passes.
The Harvard Immediate Gratification Players, an improv comedy group, discontinued its activities for the remote semester due to sparse enrollment of club members at the College, according to its president, Ally Beard ’21.
“It was really just so few of us that would be enrolled,” she said. “This is just too far removed from the norm for us.”
Some groups have used the remote semester as an opportunity to expand their mission.
For the Harvard Ballet Company, Harvard’s shift to remote instruction in March necessitated the cancellation of its spring performances at the Loeb Drama Center.
Despite the show’s cancelation, the group committed to continuing weekly studio classes over Zoom, in which company members rotated teaching the class.
Company member Caroline E. Cooper ’23 said the virtual sessions have been worthwhile. She added that she believes the quality of the instruction has improved since it started in March.
“This semester we’re all used to it,” Cooper said. “We all have our own spaces where we can dance and it’s a good escape for us now.”
Another performing arts group, the Gilbert and Sullivan Players is engaging recent alums from the Class of 2020 to help produce a compilation of recorded numbers from the Arthur Sullivan opera “Ruddigore,” which they plan to unveil to the public on their YouTube channel through a “launching event.”
The organization’s president, Ross D. Simmons ’21, said he has tried to keep the group involved socially during the pandemic by meeting regularly on Zoom.
“The Gilbert and Sullivan players is a social organization as much as it is a theatrical one,” Simmons said. “We wanted the community to survive, above all.”
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals has also committed to a video format, working closely with film students on campus to create a “mockumentary” that details the group’s history.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals President Jessica M. Moore ’21 said the group considered not offering programming this semester; however, members decided a feature-length film on the group’s history offered a meaningful way for the group to move forward.
The group, which will shoot the documentary in the spring for a release date in fall 2021, plans to ship video equipment to Pudding actors who are located across the world to film.
Even after a return to the stage, Moore said she is hopeful the Pudding will continue to improve the film arm of the organization and diversify the skills of its membership.
“Instead of just being something where we adapt to the moment, it would be really wonderful if this year could actually be an evolution for the company and be something that pushes us to expand and move into different forms of media in the future,” Moore said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council called an emergency meeting Friday to pass legislation calling for the group to hold undergraduate-only town halls about the College’s spring semester plans.
The legislation — which passed unanimously — was sponsored by UC Treasurer and incoming President Noah A. Harris ’22, Mather House representative Yousuf Bakshi ’23, Leverett House representative and incoming Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22, and Lowell House representative Samyra C. Miller ’21. It called for the Council to hold “issue-specific” Zoom meetings to address student concerns about the spring semester.
Harvard announced its plans for the spring 2021 semester last week, inviting to campus seniors, enrolled juniors, and students with learning environment needs or who live more than four time zones away. The news elicited mixed reactions among the student body, ranging from excitement to caution.
“This decision has created significant uncertainty among students grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic,” the Council’s legislation read. “It is imperative for students to have a space to relay their concerns and advocate for changes before the spring semester.”
The town halls will cover four areas: health and wellbeing, academic life, freshman and sophomore issues, and campus life and student experience. The Council will select moderators from Council committees that cover those four areas, with the chair of each committee facilitating the relevant meeting over Zoom.
The legislation stated that the town halls would give students a “safe space to have a productive discussion with their peers.”
“We really wanted to [have] a space for students to be able to voice their opinion in the wake of the spring 2021 decision that just came out,” Harris said.
College administrators held their own town hall meeting over Zoom to discuss students’ questions about the spring 2021 plans. Administrators will not be invited to the Council’s town halls, however, Bakshi said.
The town halls would give attending students the opportunity to make policy recommendations, ask questions, and share concerns about the spring semester, per the legislation. Students can also pose questions to the rest of the audience both anonymously and non-anonymously through Zoom’s chat function or a Google form. The Council plans to hold the meetings at varying times in a bid to accommodate international students.
“We think it’s very important that people have a space where they’re able to talk about their issues or concerns,” Bakshi said. “This just gives them a space, a platform to discuss their ideas.”
The Council plans to “present conversation takeaways and recommendations to members of the Harvard administration,” following the meetings — echoing a similar report the Council prepared anticipating the College’s decision last month. That document, titled “Harvard At Risk,” grew out of a Council survey of undergraduates.
In an interview with The Crimson last week, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said the College tried to invite as many undergraduates back to campus as possible while prioritizing public health constraints.
The town halls are scheduled for Dec. 8 and Dec. 9.

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council inaugurated Noah A. Harris ’22 and Jenny Y. Gan ’22 as its incoming president and vice-president during a meeting Sunday.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair formally inducted Harris and Gan over Zoom. They won the UC presidential election in November, campaigning on a three-pronged platform focusing on diversity and inclusion, student life, and health and wellness.
Harris and Gan each swore to “diligently execute” their new roles and “uphold the ideas, activities, and Constitution” of the Council.
During the meeting, O’Dair invited outgoing UC President and Vice-President James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 to sign “The Harvard Book” when they return to campus for the spring semester. In 2019, then-outgoing president and vice-president Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Julia M. Huesa ’20 also signed the book, a collection of writings about the University.
Mathew and White-Thorpe also reflected on their time in office and on the Council during Sunday’s meeting, their last. Each said they were proud of the Council and its accomplishments and stressed that, despite facing the end of their tenure, they were still only a text message away.
After the ceremony, Mathew and White-Thorpe left the Zoom room. The Council then moved to elect new members to the executive positions of secretary and treasurer, re-electing Winthrop House representative Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 and electing Elm Yard representative Edwin “Eddie” B. Jin ’24 to the position of treasurer.
Brennan ran based on his accomplishments as secretary over the last year, including refining the Council’s attendance record and pledging to work to make the Council more efficient. Jin promised to keep a consistent budget for the Council, increase transparency about the Council’s finances, and be more efficient in the disbursement of UC funding.
The Council also considered legislation to create and fund an emergency subsidy for students facing financial struggles related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The legislation was sponsored by Adams House representative Esther J. Xiang ’23. It argued that “current university resources have proven insufficient in meeting many of the urgent needs of Harvard students and their families.”
“I wanted to create this fund because I think it’s so important, more than ever, that we are really advocating for first-generation, low-income students, especially because COVID has hit them more than ever,” Xiang said in an interview Sunday.
While the legislation acknowledged Harvard has a robust financial aid program, it also read “the university is unable to provide financial support for a student’s family members, despite the fact that the well-being and livelihood of one’s family is, of course, inextricably linked to the well-being and livelihood of students.”
The legislation cited that some undergraduates who do not qualify for financial aid are still struggling with lost personal or familial income.
The legislation would direct $25,000 from the Council’s budget toward subsidizing qualifying students’ financial needs. Students would apply for the subsidy through a Qualtrics form and, if accepted, would receive $250 apiece. Members of the Council would then work to accept students based on their demonstrated level of financial need and the specificity of their request.
The legislation — which passed and will run over winter break — will accommodate up to 100 qualifying students. Participating undergraduates will be able to give feedback after it concludes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 8, 2020, at 5:09 p.m. 
President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. nominated several Harvard affiliates to serve on his cabinet, including former assistant professor Janet L. Yellen, Harvard College alumni Antony J. Blinken ’84, Vivek H. Murthy ’98, and Medical School professor Rochelle P. Walensky.
Biden selected Janet L. Yellen to serve as U.S. treasury secretary. Yellen served as chair of the Federal Reserve Board from 2014 to 2018, as vice-chair of the Federal Reserve Board prior to that, and as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors during the Clinton administration. Yellen is Professor Emerita at the University of California, Berkeley and was an assistant professor of economics at Harvard from 1971 to 1976.
University Professor and former chair of the Economics department Benjamin M. Friedman ’66, who joined the Harvard faculty during Yellen’s time as professor, wrote in an email that Yellen was an “outstanding choice” for treasury secretary.
“She knows the relevant economics inside and out, she has enormous experience running public policy institutions, and she’s one of the most articulate people I’ve ever met in explaining economics to both economists and others,” Friedman wrote. “The first and third of these qualities were already evident when she was our colleague here at Harvard, and her experience in the years since amply shows the second.”
Current chair of the Department of Economics Jeremy C. Stein worked alongside Yellen at the Federal Reserve Board from 2012 to 2014.
“She is an extraordinarily talented and accomplished policymaker: she has a deep understanding of the full range of issues, is a clear and tough-minded thinker, and an excellent communicator," Stein wrote in an email. "She was an outstanding Fed chair, and I expect her to be similarly outstanding Treasury Secretary."
Similarly, University of California, Berkeley Business Dean Ann E. Harrison wrote in an emailed statement that UC Berkeley was “proud and excited” for Yellen’s appointment.
“As a brilliant economist with great personal humility and empathy for the people behind the statistics, Janet Yellen embodies the best of Berkeley,” Harrison wrote. “She also carries on a proud tradition of UC Berkeley women in economic leadership roles."
Another of Biden’s selections, Blinken, will serve as the U.S. Secretary of State. Blinken was a former resident of Kirkland House.
“Kirkland House is thrilled that Antony Blinken has been nominated as President-elect Biden’s next Secretary of State,” Kirkland House Faculty Dean David J. Deming wrote in an email. “We are very proud to claim him as one of our own, and to add him to the list of Kirkland alums who have had distinguished careers in public service.”
Blinken previously worked for the Obama administration as Principal Deputy National Security Advisor and then as Deputy Secretary of State from 2015 to 2017.
While at Harvard, Blinken concentrated in Social Studies, graduating magna cum laude. His thesis, entitled “The Formulation of East-West Policy in West: A Case Study of the Trans-Siberian Natural Gas Pipeline,” became his first book, published three years after his graduation.
Anya E. B. Bassett, director of undergraduate studies in Social Studies, wrote she was “excited” about Blinken’s nomination in an email.
“I did look up his thesis title when I was in the office last week, and it definitely suggests a future career in International Relations,” she wrote.
Biden is also expected to nominate Dr. Vivek H. Murthy ’98 as U.S. Surgeon General, according to the Washington Post. Murthy held the office under Obama and currently serves as a co-chair of the COVID-19 Advisory Board for the Biden-Harris Transition team.
Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 praised Murthy’s work and leadership in an email.
“The pandemic has laid bare the critical importance of leadership that is informed by evidence and guided by compassion and concern for equity in promoting public health,” Daley wrote. “Vivek Murthy embodies these ideals, and we look forward to his return as surgeon general with great enthusiasm and pride.”
Biden also appointed the chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital, Rochelle P. Walensky to serve as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Politico. The school did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night.
Daley wrote in an emailed statement that Walensky, a Harvard School of Public Health alum, a "superb choice."
“Dr. Rochelle Walensky is a superb choice to lead the CDC given her frontline clinical expertise and deep research background in infectious diseases," he wrote. "I am confident in Dr. Walensky’s ability to helm the agency, to steer the U.S. past the devastating COVID-19 contagion, and to forge our country’s preparedness for future pandemics.”

Reports of on-campus bias crimes jumped in 2019, while reported rapes on campus declined for the third consecutive year, Harvard’s annual security report published Friday by the University’s police force showed.
In total, Harvard University Police Department took 180 reports of criminal offenses on campus over the past year — a dozen more than in 2018. Forty-eight of those reports were associated with burglaries, making burglary the crime with the highest incidence on campus. More than 90 percent of reported crimes on campus are property-related.
HUPD prepares the report, entitled “Playing it Safe,” and emails it to University affiliates annually in compliance with the Clery Act, which requires universities to keep students and staff apprised of information related to security policies and the rate of reported crimes on campus.
Though the incidence of crime on campus in 2019 was broadly consistent with previous years, some categories of crimes surged while others waned.
Robberies on Harvard’s campuses more than doubled between 2018 and 2019. 2019 saw 20 robberies, rising from just nine in 2018.
On-campus disciplinary actions related to drug and alcohol violations more than halved in 2019 in comparison to the previous year.
In 2019, HUPD responded to 22 aggravated assaults on campus, compared with 15 aggravated assaults the previous year.
The report also includes sexual assault-related figures, citing a three year decline in reported rapes on campus. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, HUPD took 36, 32, and 26 reports of rape, respectively.
Reports of bias crimes increased in 2019, though. While the department only took two reports of bias crimes in 2018, in 2019 it took seven.
Crimes included in the report occurred on properties owned by Harvard, properties owned by Harvard student-organizations, or public property that is within Harvard’s campuses or in their immediate vicinity.
In addition to reports of crimes HUPD takes directly, Harvard solicits relevant criminal information from local police departments, including those in Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville, as it prepares the annual report.
Consistent with previous years, the majority of crimes — 93 percent — HUPD recorded took place on Harvard’s Cambridge campus, which is home to the College and graduate schools including the Business School and the Law School. The other seven percent occurred at the University’s Longwood campus, which comprises the Medical School, the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the School of Dental Medicine.
In tandem with HUPD’s report, on Friday the Harvard Environmental Health and Safety Department also released a report on fire safety. Per that report, the University took four reports of fires in on-campus dormitories or University housing in 2019, sparked variously by an unattended toaster oven, an unattended stovetop, and tension in an electrical vault. None caused injuries.
In a message the report attributed to HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley, the outgoing chief characterized crime at Harvard as “low.” Still, he urged University affiliates to stay vigilant.
“It is important for students, faculty, staff, and visitors to remember that we are located in an urban setting and must contend with many of the crime and safety issues that exist in any city,” he said. “Preserving the safety and security of the University is the combined responsibility of the entire community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their 30-year collegial relationship, what Professor Charles S. Maier ’60 remembers most about Guido G. Goldman ’59 is his “magic sense of connectivity” — a connectivity that stretched from personal relationships to trans-Atlantic partnerships.
Goldman, who co-founded the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies and served as director of the Program for the Study of Germany, died Nov. 30 at age 83.
Goldman was born in Zurich on Nov. 4, 1937, and his family fled Europe in 1940. His father, Nahum Goldman, would go on to co-found the World Jewish Congress and serve as president of the World Zionist Organization.
Goldman, a member of Winthrop House, concentrated in Government and graduated summa cum laude; around a decade later, he also received a PhD from Harvard’s Government department, under the tutelage of Henry A. Kissinger ’50.
The completion of his prize-winning dissertation, “Heavy Industry and Foreign Policy in the Weimar Republic,” only marked the beginning in Goldman’s prodigious exploration of German policy and transatlantic relations.
He went on to establish the German Research Center with Kissinger, and in 1972, he founded the German Marshall Fund, a non-partisan organization committed to strengthening relations between the US and Europe.
According to GMF President Karen E. Donfried, Goldman established the organization to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the historic Marshall Plan, through which the U.S. provided aid to Germany after World War II.
“He had these personal relationships, which he put to use for the greater good, for this goal of deepening the German-American relationship, deepening the transatlantic relationship,” she said.
Karl Kaiser, a close friend of Goldman, admired Goldman’s “profound commitment” to strengthening European studies at Harvard.
“He had the feeling that the importance of that relationship was not adequately reflected in the institutions and in the curricula and in the research that was going on, and so he devoted an enormous amount of his energies to that particular issue,” Kaiser said.
During Goldman’s four decades at Harvard, he raised over 75 million dollars for the University, including multiple endowments for European studies and for the McCloy Program at the Kennedy School.
In 1978, Germany awarded Goldman the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit for his initiatives in German-American relations, and in 2018, Harvard awarded Goldman the Centennial Medal for “lifelong commitment to promoting international peace and prosperity” and “decades of impeccable leadership of the Center for European Studies and service.”
But Goldman’s commitment to connectivity was not confined to diplomacy: he was also a patron of international arts, from his collection of ikats – Uzbek textiles that now hang in museums – to his avid support of the Alvin Ailey Dance Company.
Jackson Janes, a senior fellow at the GMF, added that Goldman’s interpersonal skills across disciplines were what made his contributions to his field so unique.
“He had an authentic sense of connecting people who otherwise may not have been connected. In other words, he was the one who would find common ground and groups and contexts and networks that he had at his disposal,” Janes said.
CES Executive Director Elaine M. Papoulias said she viewed Goldman — whose former role she now occupies — as an inspiration and a teacher.
“He lived quite a remarkable life, and just listening to stories of how he connected various people in the US and Europe to Harvard, and the kinds of very visionary things he did at Harvard, were a lesson in and of themselves,” she said.

As Americans anticipate the first doses of a coronavirus vaccine, administrators at Harvard have started to prepare for its implications on campus.
Both Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. have completed trials on vaccine candidates and are awaiting emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to send 300,000 doses of the vaccine to Massachusetts this month, beginning with a shipment of nearly 60,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
In a Thursday interview with The Crimson, University President Lawrence S. Bacow emphasized that Harvard will defer to the government on issues related to vaccine distribution.
“The government is going to determine who gets it and what the priority is for that,” he said. “It's not even clear that we're going to be administering the vaccine.”
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 — who leads the University Coronavirus Advisory Group — confirmed that the responsibility will fall to the state government.
“The Commonwealth of Massachusetts will determine which groups will receive the vaccine as a priority and is responsible for distribution of the vaccine in the state,” Garber wrote on Sunday.
Nonetheless, Garber wrote that Harvard University Health Services “is already preparing for aspects of vaccine distribution that Harvard might be responsible for.”
Garber also noted that the University Coronavirus Advisory Group — which includes experts on public health, public policy, and medicine — has “begun to consider a number of issues related to vaccines as they will pertain to the University.”
The University is mulling, for example, whether it will require a COVID-19 vaccination for future on-campus residents, according to Bacow.
“We are looking at that issue,” he said. “There's also a question of legally, what can we require or not. We're exploring that.”
Harvard has asked already students who will live on campus in the spring semester to receive the seasonal flu vaccine.
Another issue Bacow raised is whether campus “visitors” will be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine while they are in Massachusetts.
“We have all sorts of visitors to our campus at various times,” he said. “Are they only going to be able to receive vaccines in their place of residence, permanent residence, or will they be able to receive them here?”
Excluding those unable to receive vaccinations for medical reasons, Bacow said he hopes everyone on campus will receive the shots.
“We want everybody on our campus to be vaccinated,” he said.

Harvard’s “community compact” for students on campus will expand this spring to include a color-coded system that represents different phases of campus reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Dec. 4 update from the Dean of Students Office.
The strictest guidelines — at “Level 0: Purple” — take effect once undergraduates arrive on campus and undergo a quarantine period during which students must remain in their rooms for 24 hours. Students may then only leave their rooms to pick up meals, drop off tests, or go on brief walks until a third negative result — usually eight or nine days later.
After purple, each subsequent color — red, orange, yellow, lime, and green — represents the gradual opening of more on-campus spaces and the possibility for College-sponsored indoor or outdoor events.
At the sixth and highest level — “Level 5: Green” — undergraduates can expect all residential common spaces, dining halls, and house gyms to be open with limited capacity. In addition, this level allows the houses to hold small gatherings in residential common spaces and suites.
The guide to the color system also states that, beyond the initial quarantine period, no specific period of time is planned for any particular stage.
“Other than the purple/arrival quarantine level, there is no distinct timing attached to each,” it reads. “The ability to move between levels is directly tied to student behavior and public health conditions.”
The document states that moving between levels will occur based on conditions “including but not limited to” student compliance with the guidelines, local transmission rates, and government public health regulations.
The document does not describe which specific public health conditions correspond with each reopening level. It also does not mention which University officials are responsible for determining the College’s level or how frequently its “color” will be reviewed and updated.
The DSO’s update comes days after Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced the University’s decision to welcome back roughly 3,100 undergraduates and give seniors and currently enrolled juniors priority to available space. Later in the week, administrators including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair elaborated on spring residential plans, reiterating the fact that campus would be a different experience from last year.
In a November interview with The Crimson, O’Dair said many students criticized a lack of communication about a timeline for opening campus spaces. In the interview, she added that this feedback factored into spring planning.
“Students have said it would be nice if you would have told us what was next or what was coming,” she said. “We were kind of learning this along with everyone else, trying to figure it out. I think we again are going to apply whatever that learning is to any future on-campus population.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ongoing global pandemic has disrupted every aspect of higher education. Freshmen who lived on Harvard’s campus this fall adapted to daily coronavirus tests and virtual socialization but still said their unprecedented first semester was an overall positive experience.
“Despite the massive concerns over health and the shutdowns and economic crises that are happening, for a lot of students, one of the main concerns that they're having is their inability to truly connect with other people their age,” Fez S. Zafar ’24 said.
For some freshmen, the pandemic exacerbated the daunting experience of adjusting to college life.
“Especially at a school like Harvard, where I think people are concerned that they may not deserve to be there, or that they may not be good enough, there's definitely a lot of anxieties,” Zafar said.
As the number of coronavirus cases in the United States skyrocketed in the spring, Harvard, along with colleges and universities nationwide, made the unprecedented decision to send all of its students home in March and conduct classes online.
Over the summer, Harvard administrators determined that undergraduate classes would remain virtual for the upcoming academic year. Some students, including incoming freshmen and a select group of upperclassmen, were invited to return to campus for the fall semester.
The freshmen who chose to come to campus, however, did not attend Opening Days activities upon arrival, as in years past. Instead, they spent days quarantining in their dorm rooms. For the remainder of the semester, all students residing on campus lived under strict public health measures, including severely limited gatherings, packaged meals, closed buildings, and a high-frequency testing regimen.
Despite the myriad restrictions, students still found creative ways to work within safety guidelines and foster meaningful relationships during the new normal.
Like Harvard admits from previous years, many members of the Class of 2024 connected with peers online after receiving their acceptance letters. Many found it difficult, however, to translate these digital friendships to reality.
Abiba I. Dyuti ’24 said quarantine restrictions made her less inclined to reach out to deepen relationships with acquaintances. Instead, she interacted mostly with a group of admitted students she connected with through Discord.
“I do think that I limited myself to the friend group that I had already created virtually, just because it was really hard to make friends in person,” she said. “I think in a normal year — where classes would be in person — I would also make friends through my classes.”
Upperclassmen also struggled, at times, to connect with freshmen. Riley S. Hoffman ’23, a peer advising fellow, said bonding with and informing freshmen about campus life was difficult given that she, too, was dealing with the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
“At the beginning, a bunch of them were asking me what it’s like living in the Quad. And I told them I don’t know. I got Quadded over Zoom, and I’ve never been to [Pforzheimer House],” she said. “A lot of times it’s hard to give them advice because I’m living through this for the first time too, and a lot of the questions they have, I have as well.”
Still, others found that some students were eager to connect. Hannah A. Bottarel ’24 recalled the first time she and her suitemate explored campus after remaining in quarantine. Several fellow freshmen approached Bottarel and her suitemate as they sat on the steps of Widener Library, enjoying their first days of freedom in Cambridge.
“Five or six different people came up and started conversations with us, which is so nice because I feel like there’s this stereotype that Harvard students are kind of unapproachable and have their cliques and everything,” she said. “But that really wasn’t our experience at all.”
For Nelson Matthew P. “Matti” Tan ’24, a Crimson news writer who resides in the Philippines, differing time zones made balancing coursework and socialization particularly challenging.
“It’s a 12-hour time difference, and with daylight savings it’s over 13 hours now. And usually the afternoons that I would spend studying are instead for sleeping, and the nights I would spend sleeping, I would spend studying,” he said. “So my sleep schedule is messed up completely.”
Eric Yan ’24, a freshman who stayed on campus, said professors and teaching fellows were largely supportive of his academics, but also said he received little guidance at the beginning of the year regarding extracurriculars.
“Academically, I think I was very lucky,” he said. “There were a lot of office hours and ways to get help when you needed help.”
“Extracurricularly, I feel like I was a little bit more confused about what I could be doing and what was out there,” Yan added. “They had the clubs fair, but that was really difficult to navigate.”
Bottarel emphasized that administrators could have done a better job providing students on campus with opportunities to socialize. She said restrictions on entering other residential buildings and study spaces limited those opportunities.
“It would have been, in my opinion, more beneficial for the social atmosphere if they would have made us stay on Harvard’s campus but allowed us to go into each other’s dorms or go to indoor study spaces and socialize there,” she said.
Dyuti also said the dearth of socializing opportunities may have pushed some students to flout restrictions on indoor gatherings.
“I know a lot of people who went to those parties just to feel like they were socializing,” she said. “They just really wanted to make friends because they were really lonely.”
Some students who attended gatherings faced consequences; in one instance, three freshmen were sent home after hosting a party in Mather House.
“I think the school itself should have provided a lot more in-person socializing events, you know, in small groups, safely. But they should have done something, they should have taken the initiative themselves,” Dyuti added.
Peer advising fellows also mentioned the challenges that came with working to engage online “entryways.” Jake E. Schwencke ’21, who became a PAF during his sophomore year, explained how a popular way to “coax” freshmen into conversations — buying them food — fell through due to COVID-19.
“One of the coolest parts about being a PAF is having your little PAF card and being able to coax ‘PAFees’ into meeting with you by buying them Dunkin’ Donuts or lunch in the Square,” he said. “So I think the biggest transition for me has been fostering those relationships without that coaxing method.”
Abby A. Obeng-Marnu ’23, another PAF, also underscored how “Zoom fatigue,” at times, hindered fostering deep relations with freshmen in her entryway.
“Since everyone is super busy, and doing all sorts of things with an extra set of challenges now, it’s harder to even carve out more than 30 minutes to talk to my ‘PAFees’ these days,” she said. “And it really sucks because I know that they’re probably going through a lot.”
Even as Cambridge’s weather grew colder, Dyuti and her friends continued to socialize on the steps of Widener in accordance with social distancing restrictions.
“We would study there together. We would often watch movies there together. And even though it was really cold, everyone would bring extra blankets and jackets just so we don’t freeze to death,” she said.
“I think that was a different experience in and of itself. And it was so much fun,” she added.
Similarly, Aarya A. Kaushik ’24 said that, despite the suboptimal circumstances and strict regulations, she eventually settled into a familiar rhythm and became comfortable with reaching out to peers.
“I don't think I really was able to overcome all the social restrictions but still worked within them, still found friendships, built friendships, and formed meaningful relationships,” she said.
Bottarel also underscored the importance of taking the initiative when interacting with fellow students.
“You never know how you’re going to brighten someone’s day just by starting a conversation,” she said. “So I would say just to not be afraid of making the first move in a friendship, and just being open to anybody being your friend.”
Zafar said that, despite some freshmen living on campus and others living elsewhere, all were ultimately in the same boat this semester.
“We're all kind of worried that everyone else is more connected than we are,” he said. “But the important thing to remember is that all of us are facing this kind of experience. It's not like some people are being socially inhibited by this pandemic and others aren't.”
Despite the mandate that barred international freshmen from residing in Cambridge, Charlie J. Yang ’24, who hails from Australia, found a way to make it work. After being admitted, Yang and a couple of other Australian freshmen connected and ultimately decided to rent an apartment together.
“I’ve been lucky in the sense that I was able to move out with a couple of Harvard freshmen. That’s really helped in simulating that dorm experience,” he said.
Overall, Yang described his semester as “tumultuous but valuable.”
Despite the atypical semester, Zafar is hopeful that, once things return to normal, students will develop the connections they had longed to find during the first semester of their time at Harvard.
“I really think that five, six years from now, we're going to look back, and we'll all still feel like we were able to make those kinds of connections that all of us are looking for in college,” he said.

If you’re a freshman like me who came to campus for a few short weeks, you’re probably now at home, far away from the friends that you just made. With mingled anxiety and uncertainty about blocking groups and plans for next semester, you’re probably wondering how you can stay in touch with your now long-distance friends. I might not be able to tell you exactly how to do that, but I can definitely tell you one thing that you should absolutely not do. Whatever you do, do NOT download the Psych! app, schedule a time to Zoom or FaceTime with your friends, and play “The Truth Comes Out.” Please. If you want to keep your friends, just don’t do it.
How the Hellish Game Works
When you join the game with your friends (which I hope you don’t do), you have to put in your names, and can add a little profile picture if you so choose. Once the names are entered into the game, questions are made that use the names in them. For example, it might say something like, “If Grace was walking out on stage, what song would she want playing in the background?”
When the question pops up, you have a text box that you can type your answer to the question in, even if it is a question about yourself (which always gives an immense opportunity for self-deprecation). After everyone enters their answer, the answers pop up on your screen anonymously in an annoyingly cheerful manner, and you get to choose which answer you like the best.
It might be the answer that you think is the most creative, the most accurate, or the most funny, but, especially with frequently angsty Harvard students, most likely everyone will choose the answer that is the most ~tastefully~ insulting. After everyone chooses the answer they liked the best, the results pop up with who wrote which answer. If the question was about you, you’re in for a real treat in learning what each of your friends really thinks of you.
The Inevitable Rage Quit
Some of the questions seem pretty innocent, like: “What would Abby and Olivia’s band be called?” That seems pretty wholesome, right? But, as the questions progress towards things like “What’s the last thing Will googled?,” it gets into increasingly slippery territory. I mean, that question is practically begging you to say something controversial.
There’s always a little tinge of anxiety when you see your name pop up in a question, especially if it’s a provocative one, because you can probably already guess what people might say about you. Sometimes, though, people will surprise you, and go even further than you could have imagined, pushing the line between what’s funny and what’s just plain insulting. Insults can be funny for sure, but sometimes a particularly edgy insult might elicit removing yourself messily from the game in what is the pinnacle of Psych-induced agony: a rage quit.
Zooming While Playing: Adding Insult to Injury
Due to the emotional stress that playing Psych with your friends causes, I would not recommend operating heavy machinery while playing, Zoom included. At the start of quarantine, my friends from high school and I would schedule times when we would all Zoom and play Psych simultaneously. Let me tell you, this is the worst possible situation you could get yourself into.
When you get a particularly nasty answer about yourself, you’re bound to be looking around your screen to see who’s laughing while taking fervent mental notes. Then comes the inevitable “wow” when you figure out who it was and silently vow to get them back. Plus, rage quits are FAR more dramatic on Zoom. So, if you somehow do decide to play the game, and you decide to Zoom as well, make sure that you’re prepared to deal with the incredibly awkward silence that passes if someone can no longer take the heat, and must leave the kitchen.
Even to this day, I still reflect on some of the answers that I’ve endured during numerous Psych games in high school, and the ruthlessness that I’ve seen raging in the eyes of many Harvard students does not seem to bode well for more casual Psych games in the future. No matter how sensitive or stone cold you are, Psych will undoubtedly hit you with some hard truths that will make you question your general presence/vibes/past/general life choices. Nothing is off limits in Psych, so unless you are really in the mood to be absolutely butt hurt, I would suggest having a casual book club Zoom, chill group FaceTime, or some other non-confrontational activity to *healthily* keep in touch with your long-distance friends.
