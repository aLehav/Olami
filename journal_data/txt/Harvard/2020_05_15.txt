After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, United States Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos released new regulations for Title IX. According to a statement by DeVos, the changes made to Obama-era guidelines are meant to ensure that schools “act in meaningful ways to support survivors of sexual misconduct, without sacrificing important safeguards to ensure a fair and transparent process.”
But “fair” hardly describes the new rules. DeVos’s new regulations tip the process of filing a formal complaint in favor of the accused, making it unreasonably difficult for survivors of sexual violence to seek justice. Consider three of the changes — as described in the Department of Education’s Title IX Final Rule Overview — from the perspective of survivors attempting to file a complaint next school year.
First, the new rules define “sexual harassment” as “unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school’s education program or activity.”
You are a female student who has recently started doing research for a professor. While you and the professor are friends, they make sexual comments about your body that they do not make about the male students. You feel that these comments are inappropriate and that you have been singled out because of your gender. Many other women in the department report receiving similar comments from the professor.
You approach your university’s Title IX office to file a complaint, but they recommend that you don’t. Under the new regulations, the university could more easily ignore the professor’s behavior until it makes working for them intolerable — until you are forced off the research team. The professor continues to make sexual remarks about your body. You wonder whether their behavior, left unchecked, will eventually reach the severity required to qualify as sexual harassment — whether it will eventually derail your career.
Second, “a school’s grievance process must … Use either the preponderance of the evidence standard or the clear and convincing evidence standard (and use the same standard for formal complaints against students as for formal complaints against employees).”
You are an undergrad who has just woken up in a classmate’s bed. You do not know why your clothes are off; you do not know what you did last night; you do not know when or how you left the party. (You do not know how many drinks you had.) You are scared and confused and you leave as quickly as possible.
Your friends tell you to go to the Title IX office, but you hesitate. You know that your university has chosen to increase the evidence standard for cases of sexual assault and harassment from a “preponderance of” to “clear and convincing” evidence. You are afraid that if you file a complaint, there will not be enough proof and you will have gone through the entire process for nothing. You do not go to the Title IX office to file a complaint or otherwise. Years later, once you have graduated, you wish you had at least tried.
Third, “a school’s grievance process must … hold a live hearing and allow cross-examination by party advisors.”
You are an undergraduate student who has filed a complaint under Title IX concerning a case of sexual assault by one of your classmates. Under the new regulations, you are required to undergo cross-examination by whomever your assailant chooses. They choose their lawyer, who is trained to break down witnesses at the stand. The lawyer asks you question after question: Did you tell your assailant that you wanted to have sex with them? Did you do anything to make them think so? Did you do anything to resist? Why did you kiss them if you didn’t want to have sex? Why didn’t you scream? Is it possible that how you feel about the incident now is not how you felt about it then?
You begin to cry. Every time you try to answer a question, you relive your assault. You aren’t able to answer many because you have trouble remembering the incident. (Survivors often have fragmented or missing memories of sexual violence.) The lawyer uses the gaps in your story to argue that you’re lying. Afterward, you wonder if your assailant’s lawyer is right — are you misremembering what happened? You are even more confused and scared than before. A year later, you still have trouble telling your story because it reminds you of how you felt being questioned by your assailant’s lawyer. Your therapist attributes many of your PTSD symptoms at least partially to the cross-examination.
From just three of the many changes DeVos has made to Title IX protections, it is already clear that the new regulations are meant to shield perpetrators of sexual violence from consequences. Each of these changes creates a new burden on survivors, making the process of filing a formal complaint under Title IX less and less possible. Together they deter survivors from seeking justice. They ensure that sexual violence remains widespread on campuses.
The new regulations are appalling, but they aren’t law yet — not until August 14. We have three months to plan, to prepare, and to organize.
Universities must continue Title IX investigations over the summer and through school closures during the pandemic to ensure that as many cases as possible are concluded before the new regulations go into effect. Then they must commit to protecting survivors to the greatest extent possible under the new guidelines. That means maintaining “preponderance of the evidence” as the standard for cases of sexual misconduct. That means continuing to hold people accountable for sexual misconduct committed off-campus. And, if universities will not commit to these measures, then it is time for students, faculty, and all involved in campus life to fight back — to stand up for our right to a campus free of sexual violence.

Richard M. Hunt loved telling stories — especially stories about Harvard.
Hunt spent nearly 50 years serving in various formal roles at the University, including teacher, administrator, and University Marshal. But he also saw himself as a “keeper of Harvard’s traditions,” according to Margot N. Gill, administrative dean for international affairs in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and interim University Marshal.
Following his retirement from his University roles, Hunt co-wrote a book called “Harvard A to Z,” a collection of essays charting the University’s history.
“He was just a great storyteller, a really animated storyteller, and he loved telling Harvard stories,” Gill said.
Hunt, a former faculty member and associate dean, died peacefully at home on April 10 at the age of 93.
Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Hunt graduated from St. Paul’s School in Concord, N.H. in 1944 and Yale University in 1949.
During World War II, he served in India with the American Field Service. After receiving an M.A. from Columbia University in 1951, Hunt worked for Free Europe Press until 1955 and earned his Ph.D. in History from Harvard in 1960.
Hunt then joined the Harvard faculty, teaching as a senior lecturer in Social Studies for 42 years. During the 1960s and ’70s, he served as assistant and later associate dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
GSAS bestowed its highest honor, the Centennial Medal, upon Hunt in 2004, recognizing his “contributions to society as they have emerged from one’s graduate education at Harvard.”
From 1982 to 2002, Hunt served as the master of protocol in his role as University Marshal. He welcomed international visitors and heads of state to campus, while also presiding over Commencement and other special ceremonies and awarding honorary degrees to notable global figures.
Terry Aladjem, a Social Studies lecturer and former executive director of the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, said Hunt graced Harvard’s campus and its visitors with his presence and insights.
“He was marvelous with people from different backgrounds,” Aladjem said. “He was a great choice as Marshal because he had a kind of graciousness about him that you just recognize immediately.”
Gill made a similar assessment, adding that those qualities extended beyond Hunt’s role as Marshal.
“He was gracious and dignified as a host, but he was also a serious scholar,” Gill said. “He was someone who cared deeply about his academic work.”
Academically, Hunt was passionate about German history during the “dark years” and about the maintenance of German-American relations in the decades since then, according to History professor Charles S. Maier. Beyond Harvard, Hunt applied this expertise to his work for the American Council on Germany, a nonprofit aiming to strengthen American-German relations. He served as president of the organization for 40 years.
Hunt was also devoted to philanthropy and supported many nonprofit organizations. He was a founding board member and vice chair of the National Center for Family Philanthropy.
He was a founding trustee of the Roy A. Hunt Foundation, which he named after his father, the former president of the aluminum giant Alcoa. In 2015, he and his wife, Priscilla, established a fund at the Pittsburgh Foundation and made the largest donation the foundation has ever received from a living donor.
In his free time, Hunt cultivated a number of personal interests and passions, including magic, travel, and tennis, according to his son, William E. Hunt. A member of the Yale tennis team during his college years, Hunt continued to play the sport until his late 80s.
Many remember Hunt for his deep engagement with others and lifelong curiosity, William Hunt said.
“Growing up, I remember he always had a picnic on a Sunday afternoon for his undergraduate class and they would all show up at our house,” he said. “The students would all show up, and they’d drive or they’d come over by bike or walk, and it was always something that was really important to him to have that.”
“We’ve gotten so many letters from different people that we didn’t know he kept contact with over time who were in the Class of ’78 or a graduate fellow from 1994. Those types of things just occurred. He really made a lifelong commitment to students,” he added.
Aladjem said Hunt had a deep interest in understanding others’ perspectives.
“We would often talk politics, but what was so interesting is I always felt that he was teaching me by asking me questions about my point of view,” Aladjem said. “He would never simply say, ‘you’re right’ or ‘you’re wrong,’ but inquire as to your understanding, and I really liked that about him.”
“Not that I didn’t know his position, but he was more interested in learning,” Aladjem added. “He had a kind of curiosity that made him a great teacher and clearly showed his commitment to the mission of the University.”
William Hunt said those qualities persisted even after his father’s academic career concluded.
“He was very much a Renaissance person and interested in so many different things,” William Hunt said. “His intellectual curiosity never wavered. Really up until his final hours, he was learning, he was reading, and he was interested in talking to people on the phone. He was always wanting to learn.”
Hunt is survived by his wife, Priscilla; their three children, Helen, Susan, and William; and eight grandchildren.

In the first quarter of 2020, as the novel coronavirus pandemic began to roil the global economy, the overall value of public securities held by Harvard Management Company plummeted 32 percent, from $945 million to $639 million.
HMC reported the losses in its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which requires investment managers who oversee more than $100 million to disclose public securities holdings each quarter. The first quarter ran from Jan. 1 through March 31.
John M. Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School and the Chief Investment Officer for Beacon Trust, called the 32 percent drop “disappointing” compared to overall market performance.
“By comparison, the S&P 500 fell roughly 20 percent in Q1 and the MSCI World Index, a common global equity benchmark, fell about 22 percent,” Longo wrote in an email.
Still, HMC’s losses may not reflect the current state of its holdings. Since the filing period came to a close, markets have improved — for example, the S&P 500 has risen 31 percent since it bottomed out on March 23.
Longo said the drop HMC experienced in the first quarter could also stem from the reallocation of funds to a different part of the endowment.
Last valued at $40.9 billion as of June 2019, the University’s endowment is divided between a number of asset classes, including public and private equities, hedge funds, real estate, and natural resources.
In the first quarter, HMC also substantially increased its SPDR Gold Shares, by nearly 38 percent.
Longo wrote the decision to purchase gold shares “may be considered a defensive measure” against an unstable stock market.
“Gold often rises when stocks fall, since it is viewed as a ‘flight to quality’ asset,” he wrote. “In addition, the massive monetary and fiscal programs enacted by The Federal Reserve and Congress to blunt the economic fallout of COVID-19 may negatively impact the value of the U.S. Dollar going forward. Gold often rises when the U.S. Dollar weakens.”
In total, the University’s gold shares were valued at over $14 million.
HMC increased its shares in Uber for the second quarter in a row, this time by nearly 56 percent. By the end of the quarter, it held more than 2.8 million shares valued at $78 million.
HMC also increased its shares in Palo Alto Networks Inc., a cybersecurity company, by roughly 31 percent. Still, the value of its holdings decreased by 6.7 percent to $193 million.
At the same time, HMC significantly reduced its shares in Google, by almost 60 percent.
Though Longo wrote that portfolio managers “routinely change equity holding based on their views,” he said some of their decisions could be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It could be something as simple as the manager believing a decline in advertising revenue will negatively impact Google, while increased spending on software related security products may benefit Palo Alto,” Longo wrote. “Arguably, Uber may be a near-term beneficiary of COVID-19 as fewer people take mass transit and their package and food delivery segments increase.”
HMC also sold its shares in Booking Holdings Inc., the parent company of a number of travel-related businesses. Booking has previously been criticized for listing properties in the occupied Palestinian territories on Booking.com.
They also bought shares in two new companies: Ping Identity Holding Corp., a software company that went public in late 2019, and Revolution Medicines Inc., a biopharmaceutical company that develops drugs for cancer treatment.
Both purchases fall in line with the rest of HMC’s portfolio — five of the ten public companies that HMC invests in are tech firms, while the other five are pharmaceutical companies. The remainder of HMC’s public investments are in exchange traded funds and gold.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on the filings, citing HMC’s policy not to comment on specific investments.

Pedro Farias ’20 jumped up and down in his room Thursday afternoon when he found out he was one of 80 Harvard undergraduates who won the 2020 Thomas T. Hoopes Prize for outstanding undergraduate scholarly work or research.
“One of my friends got the email before me and he sent me a text to check the Hoopes website,” Farias, an Applied Mathematics concentrator, said. “And so I did, and I was incredibly happy, of course.”
Each year, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences awards Hoopes Prizes to honor College seniors by “recognizing, promoting, honoring, and rewarding excellence in the work of undergraduates and their capabilities and skills in any subject.”
The prize is funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes, who graduated from the College in 1919. Each student winner receives $5,000, and advisers who supervised winning work receive $2,000. Winning theses are displayed in a bound volume in Lamont Library for two years.
Farias, whose senior thesis was nominated for the Hoopes Prize by Economics professor Edward L. Glaeser, said his research quantitatively assessed “whether public transportation saves lives and helps local businesses.”
Applied Mathematics concentrator Laura M. Nicolae ’20 said she was in the middle of taking her last final of the semester when she received the good news.
“I was actually doing my last final, like a four-hour online exam, but I knew that the Hoopes emails were probably going out today or tomorrow, so I kept my sound on to make sure I would know if I got an email,” Nicolae said. “So I got the email and I clicked on it, and I saw I won, and then I finished my exam.”
Lisa Zheng ’20, a joint Statistics and History of Art and Architecture concentrator who wrote her thesis on female art production in 18th-century France, said one goal of her thesis was to “open the door to more research within the humanities that applies quantitative methodology.”
Zheng, who is currently separated from her family due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said she was doing yoga when a friend informed her the Hoopes Prize winners had been announced.
“This is probably the most work I have ever put into any work here at Harvard, not just academic, and so it feels amazing to have this work recognized,” Zheng said. “Obviously no one is expecting to get a Hoopes, so I am very honored.”
Several awardees expressed their gratitude for faculty nominators and academic advisors upon receiving the Hoopes Prize.
“I think one of the things I really like about this prize is that it is a prize not only for the student, but also for the adviser,” Farias said. “I was very lost at the beginning of the thesis process, so having a good advisor like Professor Glaeser was incredibly important to me.”
Farias also said Harvard librarians played a vital role in connecting students with research materials.
“I definitely want to emphasize a big shout-out to Harvard librarian Diane Sredl, along with all the Harvard librarians, because they are an incredible resource, especially for thesis writers, Farias said. “People often forget about the great help they receive from the librarians.”
Nicolae said the prize was a fitting end to her college career, albeit the unprecedented circumstances posed for the Class of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It feels like closure,” Nicolae said. “My thesis was one of the things I worked really hard on during my senior year, and today is officially my last day of college, so receiving this prize is like a marker that I have finished.”
A full list of Hoopes Prize awardees is available here.

When Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui ran for re-election to the Cambridge City Council last year, her platform focused on supporting small businesses, affordable housing initiatives, education reform, environmental sustainability, and improving civic engagement.
There was no way to expect that combatting the novel coronavirus pandemic would become her top priority as a first-term Cambridge mayor.
“I guess, maybe people are like, ‘Wow, you really didn't sign up for this, huh?’ And, you know, I didn’t, and I’m so lucky that I get to be doing this,” Siddiqui said. “Being a mayor of a city that I grew up in and a city that is trying to help as many people as possible.”
“It's just a very difficult time, but you know, as much as possible, we have to try to be in it together,” she added.
Siddiqui — a Pakistani immigrant raised in Cambridge — is serving her second term as a member of the Cambridge City Council. She was unanimously elected as mayor by her colleagues in January, making her Massachusetts’s first Muslim mayor.
While this may be an unprecedented first term as mayor, Siddiqui says the public health emergency has helped remind her why she chose to become a public servant.
“For me, this has been about bringing it back to why I did this, you know, why I ran for office in the first place, which was about public service and helping the most amount of people I can,” she said.
Prior to serving on city council, Siddiqui received a bachelor's degree in public policy from Brown University and a law degree from Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law.
At a virtual IOP forum in late April, Siddiqui shared how these experiences contributed to her interest in public service.
“One of the things I also really cared about was helping people, and so that's why I went to law school and became a legal aid attorney,” Siddiqui said at the forum. “I really wanted to merge my interest in policy and public service together, and for me, in elected office, I think I saw that opportunity.”
In addition to serving as Mayor, Siddiqui also chairs Cambridge’s school committee and hosts a podcast entitled “Women are Here” with Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon.
Mallon and Siddiqui first met on the campaign trail in 2017. The two instantly “hit it off” at an event for the Cambridge Community Foundation, according to Mallon.
“We hit it off, in terms of what it was like running for the first time, what it was like running as a woman, and we just started texting each other and supporting one another,” Mallon said in an interview Monday.
Mallon said she was “ecstatic” when they were both elected and that they have supported each other ever since.
“We were out there doing those tough campaign things like knocking on doors every night, having campaign events, fundraisers, debates,” Mallon said. “She was sort of always my thought partner in my first term and now again as mayor and vice mayor.”
When Siddiqui and Mallon began their second term, Mallon cast her vote for Siddiqui to become mayor because she said she believed Siddiqui — who grew up in Cambridge — was the perfect person to lead the city.
“As somebody who went to our Cambridge Public Schools, as an immigrant, as someone who lived in low-income housing, I thought she was the perfect person to really lead through example and with experience,” Mallon said.
While Cambridge has had to make difficult decisions in response to the coronavirus outbreak, such as closing schools and shuttering businesses, Siddiqui’s colleagues said her calm demeanor and collaborative nature have been essential during what has otherwise been an uncertain time.
“I think she does a tremendous job of being level-headed, being cool under pressure, and that has certainly shown during the COVID pandemic. She has been all of those things and she was the right person to lead us through an unprecedented time,” Mallon said.
Katrina F. Chu, a healthcare worker in Boston, a former college roommate, and close friend of Siddiqui’s, said she was also impressed by the mayor’s swift and measured reaction to the outbreak.
"That’s when a lot of the country was dealing with how we are going to make these policy changes on the city, state, and federal levels,” Chu said. “And she was very quick to read, to keep herself informed, and [...] also turn that around trying to make that into a policy and then inform her constituents.”
Throughout the past two months, Siddiqui has worked to support residents, workers, and businesses in Cambridge who have been adversely affected by the pandemic. She said much of her work relies upon various partnerships within the city.
“For me, it's been about, you know, remaining calm and collaborating with many people — because you can't do this alone — and really staying focused on the most vulnerable populations,” Siddiqui said in an interview on April 17.
Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale have collaborated on various coronavirus-related initiatives, such as creating an emergency shelter for Cambridge’s homeless population, forming a small business advisory committee to assist with reopening, and activating the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund.
Siddiqui said the disaster relief fund, which provides financial assistance to people and businesses experiencing financial hardship amid the pandemic, has been an important tool in helping her constituents.
“We want to make sure that people are being housed, are being fed, have their basic needs, and it’s not going to be perfect. We aren't reaching everyone,” Siddiqui said. “It's something that we have to constantly monitor.”
The fund has already raised more than $3.8 million and the city has distributed more than $1.3 million to assist with rent payments, mortgage payments, and other household needs of Cambridge residents during the pandemic, according to the city’s website.
As of May 14, the Cambridge Public Health Department has recorded 866 positive coronavirus cases and 73 deaths.
Siddiqui said that public health measures to combat the pandemic have become a priority as a result of the crisis.
“We are in a public health emergency and all of this takes precedence over any type of programming,” Siddiqui said. “It's really about relying on the experts. It's being very communicative with what's happening.”
Partnerships with Cambridge’s research centers, such as the Broad Institute, have been important in calibrating the city’s response to the pandemic, according to Siddiqui.
The Institute has facilitated coronavirus testing for all nursing home residents and workers in Cambridge. Moreover, it is also developing new diagnostic approaches that could increase the scale of testing.
“We have made progress. But, given the biggest thing is so many people are asymptomatic, so presumably there's a lot of people who have this and aren't getting tested,” Siddiqui said. “The numbers could drastically shift because of that.”
Siddiqui is also preparing for a potential second wave of the pandemic by engaging in phone conferences with health experts, managing social guidelines, and looking at projections to evaluate when the city can reopen, according to Chu.
“She's under no illusion, from what I can tell, that it's going to be over soon,” Chu said. “Even though we’re like, maybe even on the plateau or the down slope, it’s not under the illusion that it's going to go away.”
Despite the challenges the city still faces, Siddiqui said she has admired seeing her constituents work together in the face of this pandemic.
“Just seeing how people have come together to help one another is really something I really love about this community,” she said. “To see it so alive and in action is awesome.”
Mallon — who said Siddiqui’s collaborative and communicative nature have been “invaluable” during the outbreak – emphasized how Cambridge is fortunate to have Siddiqui lead the city during the coronavirus pandemic.
“I think that we're tremendously lucky to have somebody like Sumbul Siddiqui leading our city right now,” Mallon said. “She’s working 24 hours a day — I can attest to that. But we're really lucky, and I hope that the residents of Cambridge appreciate her thoughtful leadership during this time.”
