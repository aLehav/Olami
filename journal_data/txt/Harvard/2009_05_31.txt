After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Commencement Choose Your Own Adventure!Good afternoon, ______ (members of the Harvard Class of 2037, Mrs. Edison’s fifth grade class, members of the Parole Board). It is my honor to be here with you at ____ (Class Day, your anti-drug program graduation, my hearing).  Presumably your selection committee knew what they were getting themselves into when they selected _____ (a real American hero, an adult, a white-collar criminal). I’m here to share with you today some of the things I learned in ____ (my time at Harvard, my post-fifth grade life, prison). Many of those lessons came while I was _____ (at The Crimson, in sixth grade, in solitary confinement).  In the grand tradition of speakers before me, I’d like to send you out into the world with some totally original and not at all trite words of wisdom about what I’ve learned about ____ (how life imitates sport, algebra, remorse for my crimes).The first lesson is that the good guys don’t always win and the bad guys often do, especially when the bad guys are ______ (Cornell, binomials, Cornell alum Big Tony). Even if you are the good guys, you can’t—and won’t—win every battle, and this is not necessarily a bad thing.  The best moments often come as a triumph on a second try, like ____ (beating Cornell this year, figuring out that “x” is not just a letter, asking Big Tony his SAT score).  And if you ever get down on yourself, the good news is that there will be another day for success, unless _____ (you’re a JV sport at Harvard, you drop out at 14, you never get out of prison).The second lesson is that you should always try to reach out to those who are different from you.  You are among a small percentage of Americans who are _____ (college-educated, former students of Mrs. Edison, in charge of the prison system). Never forget that most people have had profoundly different life experiences from you, especially if _____ (they are Detroit Lions fans, they were in Mrs. Graham’s class, they were part of a prison gang).  But there are ways to cut across all differences of race, class, upbringing, politics, or anything else. We all have shared experiences ____ (as sports fans, as people who learned fractions, as people who don’t want to be in prison), and those experiences should enable you to interact with virtually anyone you come across on mutually agreeable terms. It is these shared experiences that allow cohesion and healing in moments of pain and crisis, as well as shared joys.The third lesson is that you will occasionally be called on to make sacrifices.  This generation, like mine, faces ____ (a deepening economic crisis, the scourge of boy bands, the temptation of white-collar crime), and confronting these issues will require tremendous strength. I dealt with this issue _____ (by going to grad school, by downloading illegally to undercut the music industry, by embezzling funds), but we all have to chart our own course through the perilous waters that mark our lives.  No doubt your _____ (grade inflation, public school education, prison job training) has equipped you as well as it did me to meet these challenges.Now I’d like to talk a little about your future. You’re all very successful individuals, and as we all know, success breeds success.  This is especially true if you’re ____ (Harvard football, on the honor roll, a repeat offender). But there are always places for improvement, like ____ (sports travel budgets and certain coaches, multiplication, the prison library).  Never lose the drive to improve yourself, and try to be a lifelong learner. That ____ (core you took, crazy “new math” you did, license plate manufacturing course) will help you throughout life, or at least make you the life of a cocktail party someday with your witty insights on _____ (Japanese anime, fun ways to do the same math cavemen did, proper license plate thickness).Thank you all for your time and your kind attention, and congratulations on _____ (graduating, graduating, listening to me the whole time). Please enjoy your _____ (commencement speakers, Kevin, Joe, and Nick Jonas; next speaker, Principal Weathers; next convict). All the best for the future!—Staff writer Brad Hinshelwood can be reached at bhinshel@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There exists an inexplicable force in sports, a mysterious element that can be sensed by players and fans alike. Every so often, an enigmatic situation or occurrence drastically changes a contest, and no one knows what exactly happened. The force was present when Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner was stricken by the “Curse of the Bambino,” botching a ground ball during Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. It was there when the New York Giants defeated the New England Patriots in the closing seconds of Super Bowl XLIII, ruining the Patriots’ undefeated season. In these situations, rational explanations rarely suffice.The force struck again on the night of Feb. 20 at Lavietes Pavilion. The Harvard women’s basketball team faced Princeton in a must-win game to keep the Crimson in the running for the Ivy League title. While Harvard’s 54-50 win might appear mildly interesting in the box score, attendants of the game know it to be one of the most remarkable comebacks that any Crimson team orchestrated throughout the year.It was around 8:00 pm that the Harvard players began walking sullenly into their locker room after some of their sloppiest play of the season. Princeton was up, 34-15, at halftime, cushioned not only by its convincing lead but by the disheartened faces of the home team and its fans. In the first eight minutes of play, the Crimson had put just two points on the board. Meanwhile, the Tigers were slashing to the basket and comfortable from beyond the arc.“It may have been the worst half of basketball in my 27 years,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said after the game. “Princeton was laughing at us.” One can give various technical reasons for the Crimson’s atrocious opening half—sluggish rotations and adjustments on defense, rushed shots on offense, or failing to make the extra pass. It is not as easy to explain, however, why Harvard re-emerged from its locker room with a confident swagger, or why every shot during its halftime warm-ups fell cleanly into the goal. Whatever Delaney-Smith said to her squad, it somehow conjured the force in them. “We fell apart in the first half, rallied at halftime,” sophomore forward Jackie Alemany said. “We made certain goals to reach at certain times, and through tough defense and with Princeton getting lazy and arrogant, we shut down their offense and made smart decisions on [our own] offense.”That said, something intangible was different from the minutes before. It was as if the first half was simply a distant memory. Harvard outscored Princeton, 39-16, in the final frame, receiving contributions from nine out of the 10 Crimson players on the roster. The reversal of fortune began immediately, as co-captain Emily Tay, sophomore Emma Markley, and freshman Brogan Berry attacked the basket and chipped away at Princeton’s lead. The Tigers fell out of sync, hitting only one field goal in the first eight minutes of the second half. “We actually ran our system,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were less frantic. We were balanced and we were stronger and we had team play versus everybody trying to go one-on-one.”  Harvard took a 40-39 lead with five minutes remaining in regulation, giving Princeton a much-needed wakeup call. Both teams rained down shots on each other, trading jumpers and lead changes in the final minutes. With just 54 seconds left, Princeton guard Addie Micir hit a trey to tie the game at 50. The next trip up the floor, Berry dished to Markley, who absorbed contact and finished with a strong layup. Lavietes erupted—hope had become reality, and victory was in the air. With under 30 seconds to go, Princeton squandered its last chance when guard Jessica Berry missed a crucial jumper. Markley grabbed the board and was fouled, then connected on two free throws with nine seconds remaining. The pair proved to be the dagger. A joyous, electrified home crowd was at its feet, basking in glory and blissfully unconcerned with explaining what it had just witnessed. “That was just…an awesome game, awesome win,” Markley said.The comeback win cannot be fully replicated by report. Like in many famous contests, some moments cannot be fully understood by those who weren’t there. Sports fans live for such games and such moments, experiences that elude capture by words.—Staff writer Justin W. White can be reached at jwwhite@fas.harvard.edu.

Returning from injury has a predictable path—you rehabilitate, take it easy in early contests to shake off rust, and in time hope to return to form. No one has high expectations coming out of the gate. That is, unless you are Louis Caputo.The junior co-captain of the Harvard wrestling team stormed back from a knee injury that robbed him of a 2007-08 season, refusing to miss a beat after an entire year on the sidelines.Rather than appear tentative in his return to the mat, Caputo simply dominated his opponents, winning five straight matches to claim the Binghamton Brute Open title at 184 lbs, earning a top-10 ranking that would remain all season.But the junior was just getting started. Caputo led the Crimson in wins with a 34-8 record—the fifth-most victories in Harvard history. The standout also notched his 103rd career victory, vaulting him to fourth all-time with his senior season still ahead.“Louis has worked so hard,” junior co-captain J.P. O’Connor said. “Taking a semester off is really tough, but for him to be able to come back and jump right in at the same level and an even higher level…it’s a testament to the type of kid Louis is.”And that type of competitor is a champion.In a sport that heavily emphasizes the year’s final tournaments, Caputo saved his best efforts for last, placing third at the EIWA Championships before excelling at NCAAs. The national championships took place in Caputo’s home state of Missouri, and the junior delivered in front of friends and family, shocking sixth-seeded Joshua Patterson of Binghamton with a 6-3 decision to reach the quarterfinals. Caputo eventually took an eighth-place finish to earn All-American honors for the second time.“I was very, very pleased with myself,” Caputo said. “Making it to nationals and competing well is not a given thing. No matter where you’re ranked, a lot of guys get upset, so to go and win All-American, I couldn’t have asked for a better ending to the season.”Although Caputo finished seventh as a sophomore, Harvard coach Jay Weiss saw Caputo’s return to All-American status—a feat that only four other Crimson grapplers have accomplished—as a tremendous step forward from his second-year campaign.“[Caputo] wrestled so well, just putting everything together,” Weiss said. “He has a lot more confidence in his ability, and he wrestled the best he ever has in a national tournament.”Beyond the overwhelming skill that led Caputo to his comeback, Weiss emphasized the grappler’s competitive desire.“I know [Caputo] is a better wrestler now, just from how he reacted in his last match,” Weiss said, referring to the co-captain’s loss in the seventh-place bout. “Most people think, ‘Win or lose, I’m an All-American,’ but when Louis lost, he was devastated. He’s a competitor…and just his reaction will propel him.”Motivated by a strong will to succeed, Caputo struggled with the decision to take a semester off for healing, but the all-star did not waste the time, working tirelessly to hit the ground running this past winter. Caputo credited work with the Crimson’s assistant coaches for getting him up to speed after the grappler was forced to sit for the summer.“I felt like I was working with a different body, a little less mobility,” Caputo said. “But this coach whipped me into shape. [When I competed again], it felt like it had been a while, but everything seemed to fall into place.”Indeed, after his run at the Brute Invitational, it would take two months for Caputo to lose a dual match. The co-captain opened the year 11-0 on the way to wins against No. 5 Missouri, No. 7 Minnesota, No. 2 Cornell, and a championship at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational.Although it appeared that Caputo could not compete better than he did from day one, an epiphany awaited the grappler at NCAAs. After a season of fairly conservative play, Caputo found his offensive game against Patterson, prompting an enthusiastic reaction from his coach.“It’s hard to wrestle Louis, because he’s stronger than five bulls,” Weiss praised. “It’s one thing to have a defensive style, but [Caputo] has so much offense in him…But not until the national championship did he really open up the offense.”With the evolution of an offensive style to accompany his imposing demeanor, Caputo will look for even more success in his final season. The standout trails Jesse Jantzen ’04—Harvard’s winningest wrestler—by only 29 career victories. With one more semester, Caputo could celebrate more than just a healthy return to the mat. He could leave as the one of the best Crimson grapplers to ever step on it.—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

After amassing a 2-17 record in 2008, the women’s tennis team had nowhere to go but up. And this season, the Crimson (13-8, 6-1 Ivy) surely flew high, soaring to a share of the Ivy League Championship.Harvard struggled throughout the preseason last year, going 0-12 before the start of the Ancient Eight fixture. Other than a weekend sweep of Columbia and Cornell, the Crimson was unable to find its rhythm against league foes. Led by then-first-year coach Traci Green, the team fell victim to injuries, inconsistency in doubles, and struggles at the bottom of the singles lineup.Just one season later, Harvard climbed to the top of the Ivy League, sharing the title with Princeton. The team also secured the No. 66 spot in the ITA national rankings.“Definitely a bunch of things [caused the comeback],” captain Laura Peterzan said. “Good incoming freshmen, good coaching, everyone stepping up and pulling their own weight...everything was better.”One reason the Crimson bolted to the top of the standings was Harvard’s development of a devastating doubles lineup. The Crimson picked up the doubles point of every match in Ivy League play and finished the season with an 18-3 league mark in doubles matches. “Coach Green has really put an emphasis on doubles for the team match,” senior Beier Ko said. “It’s only worth one point, but that point can be a deciding factor.”Ko and sophomore Agnes Sibilski went a perfect 6-0 at No. 1 and made the All-Ivy First Team. The duo took down two nationally-ranked pairs—No. 36 Hillary Bartlett and Taylor Marable from Princeton and No. 67 Bianca Aboubakare and Cassandra Herzberg from Brown. At No. 2, sophomore Samantha Rosekrans and freshman Holly Cao went 4-3 and earned All-Ivy honorable mention. In the No. 3 position, freshman Camille Jania and Peterzan were flawless, going 7-0.Another theme this season was the contribution of the freshman class. The freshmen occupied the No. 5 and No. 6 singles positions and provided the team with reliable depth.“I feel like we sort of just threw [the freshmen] to the wolves at the beginning, and it really paid off,” Green said. “It was all sort of clicking at the end.” Cao, who spent the majority of her time at No. 5 singles, went 5-2 in league play. Jania was 2-1 at No. 6 singles in addition to going undefeated in doubles. Harvard benefited greatly from the confidence that wins could come from anywhere in the lineup. “All the freshman coming in have been a breath of fresh air,” Rosekrans said on April 5. “That solidarity has really brought us closer together, and we’ve really improved a lot because of it.” The veterans on the team—Ko, Rosekrans, Sibilski, and Peterzan—picked up their play and became leaders for the freshmen, who made up five of the 10 players on the squad. “Our captain, Laura Peterzan, put a lot of work into keeping the team together,” Green said. “We had strong leadership on the court and teamwork. Our captain worked overtime keeping a very young squad on task.”The turnaround from 2008 to 2009 also featured a turnaround within the 2009 season. At the beginning of this year, the Crimson dropped some tight preseason matches, including one to Dartmouth, a team that finished in the middle of the Ivy League pack. Injuries in the winter also did not bode well for the squad. Ko missed the first two Ivy League matches in singles, and Cao only started playing in dual matches over spring break.But after spring break, Harvard came together and started playing its best tennis of the year. By the end of the Ivy League season, the Crimson had reached its peak and completed the rejuvenation.“We’re a totally different team than we were in February,” Green said on April 21, before facing the Big Green. “I feel like our squad is much more confident, more competent, and we are prepared to beat anybody that comes in our path.” The 6-1 win over Dartmouth in the final match of the season solidified Harvard’s comeback season, as the team claimed the Ivy title for the first time since 2006. “I’m extremely proud of all of our players,” Green said. “This year we really stuck together and found a way.” —Staff writer Jake I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During my time here at Harvard, I have entered the thunderdome with the best of them. When I went to Yale my junior year, for example, it was also the weekend of my 21st birthday. As soon as I stepped foot off the bus on Friday night until getting back on said bus Saturday eve, I was never a sober boy. In the process, I urinated (twice) on the statue of Eli, broke a bathroom stall door, stole a Yalie’s hat and rubbed it on my butt, and repeatedly yelled, “I am the destroyer of Yale! Bow down before me!”Why in the world did this happen?In my heart of hearts, I know Yale is not that much different from Harvard—it’s a good school with smart people who I’m sure will change the world just as much as we will. Well, they did let George W. in, so okay, that legitimately makes me hate their stinky Bulldog guts.But other than this glaring malady, what motivates me to hate them with such a passion that I literally get so riled up I break their faces big time every time I’m there?As I will prove in this, my last and final Harvard essay, it is because Yale takes dumps on their own chests.As a result, they smell really bad. As a result of this result, they don’t get chicks (or dudes) and no one hangs out with them.Let me tell you something about skills. Harvard has many skills to pay many bills, for example: motorcycle-flipping skills, ninja skills, dragon-loving skills, eating skills, playing-sports skills, farting skills, friendship skills, monkey skills, and chicken- parmesan skills.Here’s the list of Yale’s skills: pthhhhhhhhhhhhhh!I just farted on them with my farting skills, thereby, destroying all of their skills.A thousand and one Yalies walk into a bar, and they’re like, “Barkeep, give me a beer, pretty please.” And the barkeep is like, “Sorry, can’t give you one old Eli.” And the Bulldogs are like, “Oh why not, good sir?,” and the barkeep says, “Because you go to Yale.”Snappppppp!!!I’m sorry, I have a foggy memory sometimes about popular culture. ‘How High,’ one of the greatest movies of our time, was shot in New Haven, right? Oh, what’s that you say? It takes place at Harvard? Harvard is the most kickass thing ever as a result.So, you know how much our administration stinks and is totally unresponsive to the student voice—from the Corporation to all the bureaucratic bologna in between?Well, yeah, well that’s the same at Yale and any other elite university...so, yeah, that’s just a bummer for us all.Did you know that ‘Yale sucks’ is the most widely used English phrase in Thailand?Did you know that one time, Yale decided to do something cool and it failed?Did you know that I went to Yale once, farted, and I killed the one flower that was living there?Did you know that if you spell Yale backwards, it spells Elay, which is Turkish for butt nugget?I heard this story from a senior who graduated a couple of years back. He was talking to me about how it was before, in the time of no time. Everything was everything, as the elders once foretold it would no longer be. Chicken was egg, up was down, pizza was tree. That was a cool story he told me.Yale made it to the Olympic games and got disqualified. Why? Because they were robots and robots can’t play in the Olympics.Yale gave steroids to A-Rod and Manny Ramirez, and they said, ‘Take this, it will ruin the game of baseball for millions of Americans, wouldn’t that be awesome?’ Thanks, Yale, thanks a lot.Basically, Yale has taken a big dookie all over themselves with everything they do, and I’m sure glad that I never have to see them again. I mean, geez Louise, just do it in a bathroom and not on your chests. That’s disgusting. You should know better. The end. —Staff writer Walter E. Howell can be reached at wehowell@fas.harvard.edu.
