After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Jules Feiffer’s “Little Murders,” which ran from Oct. 17 to Oct. 25 on the Loeb Mainstage, was this year’s Visiting Director’s Project. Under director Shira Milikowsky, the play met the professional standard one has come to expect from the A.R.T.’s mainstage productions.
In an increasingly hostile and dystopian mid-century New York, trouble is brewing in the Newquist household. Strong-willed Patsy (Juliana N. Sass ’17) is bringing home her new boyfriend, Alfred (Matthew J. Bialo ’16), to meet her wildly dysfunctional family. Her mother Marjorie (Mark J. Mauriello ’15) is a shrill-voiced flirt, an aggressive and repressed priestess of the cult of domesticity. Her masculinity-obsessed father Carol (Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15) drinks heavily to cope with his feelings of weakness and inferiority. Her brother Kenny (Samuel B. Clark ’15) is immature, sexually confused, and worst of all, in graduate school. The introduction of Alfred, an avowed nihilist, into the menagerie can only result in chaos, especially when he and Patsy decide to marry. Against this backdrop of increasing family distress, the city falls apart around them as the murder rate spikes and it becomes more and more dangerous to walk the streets unarmed.
The cast delivered universally convincing performances, and to give properly the praises of each actor and actress would take more space than was possible, but three deserved particular attention.  David A. Sheynberg ’16, played Reverend Dupas, the hippie minister who ordains the marriage between Alfred and Patsy, had complete control of timing, intonation, and expression; he held the audience in the palm of his hand, evoking laughter almost, it seems, at will. Leimkuhler’s Carol was a subtle portrayal of a very unsubtle character: bombast and insecurity were the most prominent tones, but they were humanized by genuine unhappiness. Mauriello’s Marjorie was flawless—his delivery was exactly as strained as it needs to be, and not a bit more.
Casting a man as Marjorie and a woman as Carol was a clever decision on the part of Milikowsky, contributing to rather than distracting from the action of the play: rather than changing the characters’s genders to match the performers, she changed the performers’s genders so the characters could be more fully themselves. Marjorie was a mannish woman, Carol an effeminate man; there was no way to convey this more naturally than casting the former as a man and the latter as a woman.
The set, designed by Daniel J. Prosky ’16, was beautifully crafted: wood floors and hung wood ceiling panels conveyed the generic middle-class interiors in which the action took place. The clean and almost sterile atmosphere of the set emphasized the repression of the characters and highlighted by contrast their increasingly unhinged behavior. This relative simplicity of appearance also gave special significance to changes in the set: the introduction of a barricade to the back of the stage in the second act was prominent, while it would have been less noticeable and effective in a more crowded design.
The weakest part of “Little Murders” had nothing to do with the particulars of this production: it was the script itself. Full of violence and family-life satire, “Little Murders” may have been before its time when it flopped on Broadway in 1967, and immediately relevant in its 1969 revival, but in 2014, when the mores of the 1950s are already dead and buried, its viciousness felt hollow and was itself almost as antiquated as the reality it portrayed. While this production was nigh flawless, it was impossible to overcome a weakness inherent in the text.
The Loeb Mainstage has been host to many excellent performances through the years, and “Little Murders” deserves to be remembered with the best of them. Seldom does a student production, especially when founded on a potentially garish text, display such polish and thoughtfulness.

When Flynne Fisher—the protagonist of William Gibson’s new novel “The Peripheral”—agrees to cover for her brother Burton at his new job, she is under the impression that she is simply beta-testing a new video game. The reality is much more complicated. The plot of “The Peripheral” is elaborate and the cast of important characters is extensive. Moreover, the representation of virtual spaces in literature can often end up feeling awkward and unwieldy; Gibson, however, does not seem fazed by such challenges. In “The Peripheral,” he manages to deliver a riveting tale and a powerful message about the dangers of modernity and the value of human connection in an age of technology.
The game in question is actually something of a window into an alternate, future universe that diverged at some point from Flynne’s own. So when Flynne becomes the only witness to a brutal murder in the video game, her knowledge has tangible value to people in the future reality as well as dangerous repercussions in her own life. The future and past characters must work together by means of peripherals—humanoid devices that can be controlled remotely using a special headset—to solve the murder, to protect Flynne and her family from the bounty hunters who have been sent to kill them, and above all, to redirect the course of human history.
In many ways, the experience of reading “The Peripheral” resembles that of playing a video game. The brief chapters—most no more than four or five pages long—break the somewhat lengthy novel into shorter chunks, much like the checkpoints in a video game, and thus create many easy opportunities where the reader can “pause” the narrative and come back to it later.  But when Gibson combines the brevity of the chapters with the alternation of viewpoints between the chapters, he creates many cliffhangers and a sense of growing urgency, driving the narrative to its inevitable conclusion and the reader to the novel’s eventual end. Readers might find themselves marathoning the novel as they might a new video game: simply power through until you’ve beaten it.
Gibson connects this experience of reading the novel with the experience of the characters within the novel itself. Flynne, Burton, and their friends—all gamers themselves—exhibit a similar sort of perseverance and relentlessness, only exiting the alternate reality to eat and take bathroom breaks. The characters in the future reality also make a hobby of “gaming” the various alternate past realities—of which Flynne’s reality is only one—by attempting to place trackable individual into positions of power and thereby gain control over that reality’s future. These “stubs” are essentially Sims games using what are arguably actual people, a situation that addresses one of the novel’s central questions: where do we draw the line between what’s real and what’s virtual?
The technological advances in the novel extend beyond the realm of gaming, and Gibson offers a nuanced presentation of them as both helpful and dangerous. The novel’s future reality is more technologically advanced than Flynne’s reality, but even her world is more advanced than our own. 3D-printing of complex objects is ubiquitous, and the people eat lab-grown meat “nubbins,” even as their government and economy is falling to pieces around them. Having grown up in an impoverished America that subsists primarily on drug money, Flynne and her crew find the pristine cities and lavish and laid-back lifestyles of those in the future reality ideal, but as the novel progresses it becomes apparent that the alternate reality is as fraught with inequality and corruption as their own, if not more so. Flynne ultimately concludes that “evil wasn’t glamorous, but just the result of ordinary half-assed badness, high school badness, given enough room, however that might happen, to become its bigger self. Bigger, with more horrible results, but never more than the cumulative weight of ordinary human baseness.” For Flynne—and by extension for Gibson himself—technology may have the power to amplify or disguise one’s evil intentions and actions, but it is not in itself a source of evil.
Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Gibson’s portrayal of gamer culture in the novel is his decision to feature a female protagonist without laying any special importance on her gender. The gaming community has become infamous for its sexism and misogyny and its hostility towards women gamers and game developers. In “Peripheral,” Flynne is portrayed as a talented and experienced gamer. Her gender is never called into question by the narrator or the other characters in the novel, and she even adapts more readily and smoothly to her peripheral than do her brother and his friends. “The Peripheral” thus presents a rather progressive and optimistic portrayal of gamer culture.
All of this is not to say, of course, that “The Peripheral” is a novel without flaws, but the flaws it does have are few and largely insignificant. The initial chapters before the alternating narratives connect with each other, for example, are rather confusing, as the reader struggles to sort out the meaning of all the technological jargon as well as the relationship between the stories. The lack of explanation and contextualization in these early chapters might be intended to disorient the audience, but some of Gibson’s other stylistic choices feel similarly forced and uncomfortable at times. Flynne’s chapters are often narrated in a colloquial, pro-drop register (“He closed his mouth. Frowned slightly. Pursed his lips. Relaxed them”). On the whole, Gibson does this masterfully. Flynne’s chapters sound more casual and less refined than the future ones, but in certain contexts—particularly in conversations—Gibson chooses to omit words that leave the responses sounding unnatural. Nobody with a good command of English would say, “Where it gets complicated,” to mean “That’s where it gets complicated,” at least not without a hint of an s before where.
In general, however, “The Peripheral” is an extremely strong novel even at its weakest points, one that asks important questions about the evolving roles of technology and of human relationships in the modern world. Most importantly, Gibson manages to discuss these questions without ever coming across as heavy-handed or clichéd, a skill that many writers in the genre fail to master.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alex B. Young ’16 unlocks the door and lets me into the last functional darkroom on campus. A social studies concentrator in Lowell House, he is the president of the Harvard College Photography Club.
While almost all the Houses were built with a space intended for a darkroom, the Eliot darkroom is the last great sanctuary of film photography on campus. Young fondly describes it as "the last hold-out."
And it's a small hold-out at that. But what it lacks in size it makes up for in atmosphere. Beautiful, interesting prints, some undated and developed by anonymous Harvard students of old, line the walls of their space. The first room has old red sofas facing a whiteboard, creating a homey feel with an edge of insider ambience—a “Dead Poets Society”-esque hide out for a group of passionate photographers who keep the old art alive, as evidenced by their vivid work.
Fortunately, it's far from being an insider group. Smiling, Young explains, "We’re happy to have people who have done darkroom photography for years, and we’re also delighted to teach new people how to do it." There is no joy-sucking comp process, so anyone from newborn hipsters to highbrow film veterans can hop aboard. But, as with anything, you'll get out what you put in. It's an inclusive, educating, and encouraging environment for anyone with an enthusiasm for the classic SLR.
And patience. God forbid you're a restless case *raises hand* because everything about film is slower—albeit in a more beautiful, more intentional, and more pensive way—than digital photography.
What Young loves about film photography that the experience of using a DSLR cannot recreate is the thought process that goes into choosing a subject, deciding that its aesthetics are worth one of only, say, 35 exposures, and carefully planning how to frame it.
I feel out of place, clicking away 800 times per subject with my little Nikon D3200 and adjusting until I am happy with a shot. In everyday photography, a DSLR certainly leaves less up to chance. But the thrill of developing a photograph in a dark room and seeing it come alive on paper is golden—it’s a surprise to the photographer too in some ways.
Young leads me into the actual darkroom, talking me through the process in broad terms and sharing with me the film, test strip, and final product for a photograph he took of a statue in Croatia. He explains the method used before committing to developing a photograph: you can do test runs on a small strip by changing the settings for small sections of the strip that, in this case, create a pretty gray scale gradient.
Photography became a passion for him while he was a senior in high school back home in North Carolina. “I was fulfilling my fine arts requirement and happened to really enjoy it.” (Oh, but if only Gen Ed requirements could be so inspiring. SPU, we’re looking at you.) Back then, in the spring of his freshman year at the college when he discovered the club, there was a grand total of two members. He got involved and committed, assuming a board position quickly.
While Young typically veers toward shooting architecture, statues, and other static objects, he’s recently broadened his subject matter. “I’m really enjoying the first forays I’ve made into photographing people, especially those I’m close to. That’s been really fun,” he says.
But people are challenging “because they move and they do their own thing,” he adds. While the intentionality of film photography changes slightly when photographing people informally, they do have a more expressive spectrum of emotions that frame in a serendipitous way.
Apart from the immediate satisfaction of time spent teaching and developing in the dark room, Young and his board is looking to the future. Long-term plans for the club include the installation of a darkroom in the Quad, which, according to Young, “will take some time and effort, but it’s an exciting idea.”
In the short term, look out for exhibitions, or just creep down into Eliot basement, literally join the underground scene, and capture your very own exhibit-quality moments.
The Harvard College Photography Club meets every week on Monday and Thursday from 8pm until 10pm in the basement of Eliot’s F-entryway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine a Broadway theater mid-performance: while the lead actor delivers an enthralling monologue, he seems to stumble a little bit. Whispers spread behind the curtain until the crew realizes the actor is drinking real gin instead of the prop water. The exasperated director, who also plays another main character, walks onstage and improvises lines while secretly replacing the alcohol with a bottle of water. The main actor picks up the bottle again and, after a sip, suddenly throws it on the ground, shouting, “When did you take away the gin, you motherfucker!”
This is just one of the many scenes in “Birdman” with almost explosive dramatic tension. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu is famous for complex plots with multiple protagonists, and in “Birdman,” he places a multitude of distinct and equally fascinating characters on the same stage to achieve maximum conflicts. Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), who used to play the iconic superhero Birdman, is now as washed up as Michael Keaton 25 years after “Batman.” To save his career, he is directing a Broadway drama that stars himself and Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), a genius method actor who becomes increasingly uncontrollable as he steals the limelight from Riggan. At the same time, Riggan’s daughter Sam (Emma Stone) castigates her father every day over his absence from her life, and one of the actresses (Andrea Riseborough) may be carrying Riggan’s baby. One can sense drama just by a simple glimpse at these characters, and in fact, the dramatic conflicts in the film are as intense as the explosions in a Michael Bay movie. In almost every minute, new plot lines unfold between the actors and director, actors and producer, or director and producer, a staggering achievement only paralleled by the fact that Iñárritu miraculously manages to weave all these elements together and prevent information overload. It is safe to say that the script of “Birdman” will be a textbook for film students for the next 20 years.
As if the script is not enthralling enough, the whole film is ostensibly a titanic two-hour-long take that persists from beginning to end with no cuts. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, known for his cooperation with Alfonso Cuarón on “Children of Men” and “Gravity,” is the expert at long takes, and in “Birdman” he uses CGI to weave 10 long shots together and creates the illusion of one massive tracking shot. With imaginative camera work and complicated blocking, the long shot is beautiful to look at even just as a technical stunt. However, unlike in the case of many other films, the long take in “Birdman” actually serves important narrative purposes. Iñárritu is known for multi-line narratives, and his first single storyline attempt “Biutiful” was a mild disappointment due to its diluted dramatic tension. But in “Birdman,” he lets the camera drift away from the main plot to what’s going on with the supporting characters and then returns it to the hero and his interactions between different characters. This technique, first invented in the French New Wave but never used so systematically, enriches both the story and the characters while maintaining the frame of a single-line narrative. In this context, the long take becomes necessary because it makes the camera a silent observer who always keeps pace with whatever is happening with the crew, or rather, an audience watching the mercurial drama behind the curtain.
As Russian director Vsevolod Pudovkin wrote, "The foundation of film art is editing." Thus, by eliminating editing, “Birdman” renders itself a portrayal of theatrical drama (more precisely, a theatrical drama about a theatrical drama). And since editing signifies the passage of time, its absence gives an illusion of being live and uncut. The virtual “audience” is not only watching a theatrical performance but also watching it in real time. Riggan, Mike, Sam, and everyone else who takes part in the drama are as unprepared for the accidents onstage as we are, and this makes the dramatic conflicts even more exciting.
Good scripts and directing often inspire great acting, and this applies to “Birdman” as well. Keaton, tortured throughout the film by endless accidents and arguments, gives a convincing interpretation of a desperate director suffering from a mid-life crisis and need for relevance. The role itself has lots of dramatic potential, so the most outstanding aspect of Keaton’s performance is not how eye-catching it is but how natural it feels. A good comparison is Norton and Stone. While they have also done an impressive job, their delivery is a bit overwrought, suggesting a lack of total immersion in their roles. This may be the biggest imperfection of the film, but it is certainly acceptable.
Even the most casual film audience will notice the huge amount of work put into “Birdman.” It is an exquisite, well-crafted, and inventive masterpiece that is not only another piece of evidence for Iñárritu’s genius but also very likely to be the best film of the year.

Almost everyone can name a few films that he or she loves crazily despite their apparent imperfection. These films may have logical flaws, loose structure, or redundant characters, but they are so full of originality and raw energy that everything else really doesn’t matter. “Whiplash,” the second feature of Damien Chazelle ’07/’08, is very likely to be added to this list. The film is not short of signs of immaturity: oversimplified characters, excessive use of shaky camera, and obvious imitation of “The Social Network,” to name just a few. However, every minute of the film is soaked with great passion for its music, which, through the intense dramatic conflicts and stormy jazz drum beats, brings audiences to a frenzied ecstasy. This is much more difficult to achieve than exquisite craftsmanship, and coming across a film like this is a fortune for any audience.
The plot of “Whiplash” is simplistic: it is essentially a story of only two characters. A promising young drummer named Andrew (Miles Teller) enters the nation’s most prestigious music school and is thrilled to have his talent recognized by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), the legendary conductor of the school’s orchestra. However, he soon finds out that Fletcher is a psychopath obsessed with pushing his players beyond each and every artistic threshold. To achieve this, Fletcher uses the most primitive and (what he considers) most effective approach: a comprehensive methodology of shouting, swearing, and beating. The hero soon becomes depressed but also starts to practice harder and harder, partly because of his thirst for greatness and partly because of his desire to take revenge on his ruthless mentor. He gives up his family, his friends, and even his girlfriend to seek perfection in drums, and his secret competition with his conductor eventually becomes a full-blown battle.
Even just glancing at the storyline, one can tell that the two main characters are rather two-dimensional: one is designated with the stereotype of ambitious and devoted young artist, and the other should be added to the Oxford English Dictionary as the definition of the phrase “mad teacher.” There are definitely moments when Fletcher’s teaching becomes too extreme and one starts to wonder whether the director was actually fond of his college experience. However, the simplification of the characters helps the film save time on exploring character depth and leave more space for dramatic conflicts, which is absolutely a fair sacrifice. To get a clearer picture of this effect, one can think about The Joker in “The Dark Knight”: he is definitely one of the most two-dimensional characters in the last decade but is nevertheless one of the most impressive because he really reaches the pinnacle of evil. Teller and Simmons’s performances might not be as good as that of Heath Ledger, but like the latter, they explore their respective extremes in the most immersive and violent way. Teller, a rising prince of independent films, gives a memorable interpretation of a musician who sacrifices his entire life for his instrument. Simmons is best known as the foul-mouthed newspaper editor in Sam Raimi’s “Spiderman” trilogy, and in “Whiplash,” he seems to have completed a Ph.D. in swearing. His rampageous scoldings are no less striking than those of the officer in “Full Metal Jacket,” and in “Whiplash,” these scoldings serve one more purpose: keeping the fast pace and high energy level of the film.
While the story and acting may be enough to make “Whiplash” a good film, it’s really the music that sets up its greatness. Every drum performance in the film is powerful and mesmerizing, and even more so when one learns that they are all delivered by no one but Teller himself. The young star has been playing the drums since age 15, and to play this character, he took three drums lessons a week, each three hours long. The result is breathtaking. As the credits start to roll, drumbeats still lingering in ears, audiences can feel an almost physical exhaustion as if they had just been drumming for 106 minutes themselves. The power of the film’s music is further strengthened by the editing. Not only does Chazelle employ fast cutting to match the tempo of the drums, but he also does a lot of camera shaking and jump cuts between medium shots, close-ups, and extreme close-ups. These classical techniques to convey a sense of speed, while certainly not inventive, are very effective in visualizing the texture of drum performance.
“Whiplash” is far from flawless, and many of its details expose the director’s inexperience of using the camera as a narrative medium. However, even the pickiest and most insensitive critics would be enthralled by its emotions and would likely become immersed in the Dionysian revelry of jazz music.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Prado Museum in Madrid, there hangs a painting by Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes that is among his most well-known and admired, but perhaps not most well-liked. “Saturno devorando a su hijo,” rendered in English as “Saturn Devouring His Son,” is an image that stays in one’s mind. Wild-haired and wide-eyed, peering out of the near-total gloom that engulfs the canvas, the Titan hunches over his child, naked, mouth agape, body tensed. His pale knuckles dig into the white flesh of a child of indeterminate sex; the child’s head and right arm have already been consumed, and Saturn is in the midst of finishing the left arm.
Art history frequently allegorize Saturn as the nation of Spain during the civil war that wracked it from 1820 to 1823 or, less frequently, as Goya himself in his relationship with Leocadia Weiss, his alleged mistress. What is frequently left out of histories for general readers is the fact that Goya’s actual intended subject is unknown. It might be Saturn; it is equally likely that it is some dark fantasy of Goya’s own creation. The painting was a private piece never intended for exhibition, and indeed was originally attached to the wall of Goya’s home outside Madrid. What pleasure the deaf, ailing painter derived from looking on his work is wholly mysterious.
This strange circumstance leads to an interesting observation and an attendant question.  Historically, audiences have felt the need to come up with an explanation for Goya’s unsettling image, to insist on a point or a message or even a mere personal significance behind the unseeing eyes of the nameless, voracious madman. There is an instinctive discomfort that arises from the idea that Goya is showing us a man eating a baby, nothing more and nothing less. The question: what if he is?
In other words, is it permissible to show something that inspires horror for its own sake? How committed are we to art for art’s sake, to the abolition of artistic boundaries? There is a modern desire to be near-absolute about the freedom granted to artists, a sincere wish for intellectual consistency and an old-fashioned fairness: one might not always like good art, and condemning something merely because it violates our mores or preferences seems petty.
Yet life rarely cuts so cleanly. Can art for art’s sake be a true guiding principle—or, more specifically, horror for horror’s sake? Yes it can; but as horror shows us, it may demand things of us that we are not willing to concede.
DEFINITIONS AND DIFFICULTIES
Before looking into this ethical issue, it is worthwhile to take a moment to look at what is meant by “horror,” a word that is used in two ways in criticism. “Horror” in the first instance is used to indicate a particular emotional response to a stimulus. A borrowing from Latin, the literal meaning is the bristling of hair; by extension, it is used for the emotion that accompanies this physiological response. In the second instance, “horror” is the genre of art that is somehow connected with this emotion.
Defining the emotion by the bristling of hair on the back of the neck is not rigorous, and modern critics have striven to come up with more satisfactory formulations. “Horror often gets contrasted in the aesthetic theories of the late 18th century and 19th century…with terror; so there’s an idea that horror is when you see something, there’s something graphic about it,” Deidre S. Lynch, a Harvard English professor who studies early European horror, says. “Terror is when your fear is compounded by your uncertainty and your doubt.”
Such niceties of emotional distinction do not necessarily have much bearing on modern generic distinctions. According to Dr. Steven C. Schlozman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Medical School and author of the novel “The Zombie Autopsies,” “terror” is identical to the modern notion of “dread,” which is considered an important if not integral part of horror as a genre. “It’s a form of art…meant to create a feeling of unease and dread; dread is actually one of the common phrases you’ll see in the literature,” Schlozman says, discussing the definition he uses for his freshman seminar on horror. “[It] basically means you have a sense that something not good is going to happen, but you don’t know what it is.”
Schlozman even goes so far as to argue that, by this definition, the emotion of horror is subsidiary to the emotion of dread. On the subject of “Saturno devorando,” which Schlozman believes is unsettling but not necessarily suspenseful, he says, “It might inspire in you a sense of horror, but in terms of the way the genre has gone about telling stories, by this definition, it wouldn’t fit [into the horror genre.]”
While there are compelling reasons for such subtleties, foremost being the more accurate description of emotional phenomena, it seems to obscure the point to argue that the inspiration of horror is subsidiary to adhering to technical definition for “horror.” For the purposes of this article, we will consider any piece of art that inspires horror or dread as part of the horror genre.
GENESIS OF A GENRE
In his “Poetics,” Aristotle identifies two emotional effects within the genre of classical tragedy: the arousal of pity and the arousal of fear. “If we talk about fear, there are at least three different Greek words with three different nuances about what that would be,” professor of Classical Greek Literature and Comparative Literature Gregory Nagy says. The word that Aristotle uses, “phoberon,” is ultimately derived from a root that means “to run away,” a description that is perhaps very apt for the intended response to the modern horror genre. More specifically, tragedy’s content would be well-suited to October film releases—Halloween blockbusters that traffic in incest, mutilation, insanity, and the grotesque. The violent punishment visited on the protagonist of a classical tragedy is a response to a character’s witting or unwitting infraction of some cosmic code—a sanctuary has been disturbed, a supernatural being has been maligned, a taboo sexual union has been attempted. This too is not dissimilar to the general thrust of even secular, non-supernatural horror films. “Even if we don’t believe in hell, we want there to be some sort of accountability [for wrongdoing],” Lynch says.
Two features set classical tragedy apart from modern horror. The first is a problem of representation: since the theater was de facto a temple of Dionysus, representations of bloodshed were banned from the stage by religious regulation, and so all the violence of the story occurs through the mediation of speeches from eyewitnesses. The second is that, according to the Aristotelian model, the ultimate goal of tragedy is not the inspiration of fear, but rather catharsis: an emotional purification in viewers.
In contrast to this, modern horror tends to rely heavily on the direct presentation of disturbing images—“Saw” is not “Saw” without gore—and while the ultimate emotional or intellectual goal of a work may vary, most works emphasize the intermediate effect of unsettling the audience.
This emphasis coincides historically with the early modern desire to convey an emotional effect rather than a moral or a lesson and the concomitant notion that it is preferable to convey a single effect in a story. This was the position championed by Edgar Allan Poe in his essay “The Importance of the Single Effect in a Prose Tale.” Because catharsis is by definition the result of several different effects playing against each other, Poe and his intellectual descendants were sought to inspire in their audiences not catharsis, but a unified effect: the feeling of being unsettled—horrified.
According to Lynch, modern horror is also heavily molded by the Western tendency towards secularization since the late 18th century. Lynch says, “Horror comes about in its modern form when you have that residue of the sacred without actually having the confidence that God speaks to people through the monstrous.”
HORROR FOR HORROR’S SAKE
As noted earlier, it is frowned upon by modern critical lights to say that works of horror must bear a moral or a message to be counted as “good art.” Across most modern schools of thought, it is preferable to judge the quality of a work by its own standards: how well does it accomplish the effect desired by the maker, or how well does it accomplish what its audience feels it is trying to accomplish? This incipient attitude attended the rise of artists whose works eschewed moralizing for emotional strength: for example, Poe, one of the earliest exponents of what we would call modern horror, and later, the British Aesthetics and the Decadents of continental Europe, whose pursuit of raw beauty of experience led them down the dark, voluptuous labyrinths of Wilde and Baudelaire. We generally like to think that we are (for the most part) comfortable with art for art’s sake—an attitude that allows for the increasing alienation of modern art from conventionally accepted aesthetic principles.
Since simple emotional response is the defining feature of horror as a genre, it seems that horror should be most amenable to this standard of judgment—indeed, according to Lynch, the genre largely developed under the influence of this standard. “When the Gothic novel emerges at the end of the 18th century, there is this essay by [literary critic] Anna Barbauld called ‘On the Pleasure Derived from Objects of Terror,’” Lynch says. “[Barbauld] says that that’s a paradox. ‘Why would we associate pleasure with terror?’ she says. And in some ways where she goes makes her essay almost a really, really early entry in the notion of aestheticism and art for art’s sake. There’s no moral takeaway, but the imagination is stretched.”
In other words, it seems that most critics, regardless of personal taste, would agree that the piece that inspires the greatest emotional response would be the ideal exemplar of the genre.  The problem is that the actual results of this line of thinking produce an enduring moral discomfort.
“A Serbian Film” is a 2010 movie directed by Srđan Spasojević. It follows the last days of a Serbian porn star, Miloš, who becomes involved in a snuff film project. “A Serbian Film” is infamous for its graphic representations of necrophilia, of the rape of men, women, and infants, of murder by several novel, gory, and sexual methods. It does not even benefit from a redemptive ending—the movie ends with the antagonists preparing to use the corpses of Miloš and his family in a pornographic film.
If nothing else, “A Serbian Film” is very, very effective at inspiring horror and dread, which is evidently one of its primary artistic goals.  If we are to subscribe to “horror for horror’s sake,” “A Serbian Film” has to be rated among one of the most artistically successful works ever made.
This is the intellectually consistent position. Yet it seems to permit much that should not be permitted so easily. If we would like our artistic vocabulary to stop somewhere short of the simulated rape of newborns, we must turn away from holding a work’s intended effect as the highest standard of art.
SATURN REPRISED
So we return to the monster and the baby, and the implicit challenge they put to us. That Goya is a great artist is virtually uncontested; but if, in this instance, he is showing us nothing but graphic cannibalism, can we accept this piece as great art? If we do, we are in the uncomfortable position of defending the vivid representation of distasteful acts as art, which puts us a mere step away from defending pornography as art—for example, as critics have defended Jeff Koons’s “Made in Heaven” series, a sequence of enormous photographs of the artist engaged in sexual acts with his then-wife, the pornstar Ilona Staller, AKA Cicciolina.
If we do not, we must reevaluate a critical trend of several centuries, and face the daunting prospect of privileging certain emotions or certain forms of expression—essentially, a return in some way to the assumed objectivity of Aristotle or to the taboos of the Greek theater. Some middle ground must be negotiated, a happy medium that allows us both to appreciate the artistry of Goya’s painting and without appending the name art to “A Serbian Film.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the recent release of his newest action thriller, “A Walk Among the Tombstones,” Liam Neeson has starred in his fifth one-man-army movie in five years. Next year, the trend will continue with “Taken 3.” Clearly, Hollywood has been more than convinced by Neeson’s menacingly calm threat of “I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.” The new Liam is a bit of a departure from the character actor who was best-known for award-show darling performances in “Schindler’s List” and “Michael Collins” during the 1990s. The newest twist in the now 62-year old actor’s career brings an age-old actors’ grievance to the forefront.
The unfortunate phenomenon of typecasting is ironically a result of acclaim. If you do something well, someone is inevitably going to ask you to do it again. And again. And a few more times after that. Here are some of the most memorable pigeonholed actors of our time (other than Liam Neeson). We’ll take a look at the archetypes that have brought them iconic and redundant recognition.
Samuel L. Jackson as The One Who Won’t Take Anyone’s Sh*t
Most people trace Samuel L. Jackson’s exclusively badass characters to his iconic recitation of Ezekiel 25:17 in Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction.” Being typecast as the hardest man in the room predates the Quarantino classic, however, (see Jurassic Park) and has certainly pervaded since. We’ve seen Samuel L. Jackson as Sith-slicing Jedi Master Mace Windu, the house-slave who has more influence than his master, and the FBI agent who simply “had it with these motherf*cking snakes on this motherf*cking plane.” Needless to say, Samuel L. Jackson will never play a beta male.
Adam Sandler as The Man Child
In 1995’s “Billy Madison”, Adam Sandler plays a man who goes back to school. In the “Grown-Ups” franchise, he plays a character who attempts to relive his childhood as he enters middle age. While his other characters do not take the term “man-child” as literally, you will be hard pressed to find a film where Adam Sandler is not immature and irresponsible. Even in the movies where Sandler ventures into drama (ie: “Punch-Drunk Love,” “Funny People”), his characters are still grossly lacking in maturity and adult common sense.
Bruce Greenwood as the American President
You’ll be hard pressed to think of a movie where Bruce Greenwood didn’t play the U.S. president and the next time you recognize Bruce Greenwood on the screen, chances are he’ll be giving that Oval Office gig another try. Bruce Greenwood is not even American.
The Entire Cast of the Expendables
Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger… The cast of “The Expendables” epitomize the exhaustingly retreaded and invincible action hero. They all play this muscular and stoic caricature in “The Expendables” series and have all starred in their own deluge of similarly-themed action movies (see “First Blood,” “Rambo: First Blood Part II,” “Rambo III,” “The Transporter,” “The Transporter 2,” “The Transporter 3,”  “Die Hard,” “Die Hard 2,” “Die Hard with a Vengeance,” “Live Free or Die Hard,” “ A Good Day to Die Hard”... you get the point.)
Leo DiCaprio as Always the Nominee, Never the Winner
Not trying to knock DiCaprio’s skillset as an actor—it’s a powerful skillset…we just haven’t seen its breadth. Before and since his turn as Jack Dawson in “Titanic,” Leonardo DiCaprio has succeeded in being typecast as the severely tortured soul, whether he is literally crazy in “Shutter Island,” or just a sociopath (“The Wolf of Wall Street,” “Inception,” “J. Edgar,” etc.). There is even a characteristic “tortured Leo” look, which involves a tight-lipped frown and the concerned eyebrow furrow we see on the poster of “The Aviator,” “The Departed,” and about 30 other movies. Perhaps DiCaprio doesn’t mind being sad—troubled characters get Oscars, right?

Wallace Stevens holds a celebrated place in the English poetry canon. Inventive, witty, philosophical, and abstract, his poems successfully experiment with language and redefine the boundaries of the genre. As Helen Vendler, Harvard professor and renowned poetry critic, puts it, “[He] is as good with language as Rembrandt was with paint, or as Balanchine was with dance…the medium is used much more imaginatively.”
The general public got to experience Stevens’s genius in a new light on Tuesday, Oct. 21, when the Barker Center played a series of recordings of Stevens reading his own work. The recordings had been made in 1954 at Harvard, Stevens’s alma mater, and then subsequently forgotten; set on gramophone records and stored in the Woodberry Poetry Room, they remained inaccessible for 60 years. The recent digitization of the collection, though, allowed for the rediscovery of the discs. A new technology, called IRENE, de-laminated the records and converted them to a more contemporary format. The Barker Center reception was the first time that they had been played for the public.
The tapes consist of Stevens reading “It Must Change” and “The Auroras of Autumn.” The first poem is part of the “Notes on a Supreme Fiction” sequence, a highly philosophical work that examines the capabilities of art in the context of human life. According to Stevens, art culminates in “supreme fiction,” or a fictive substitute for a formally religious god. The title of “It Must Change” refers to one of Stevens’s criteria for such successful fiction; the other titles in the sequence are “It Must be Abstract” and “It Must Give Pleasure.”
According to Vendler, who offered commentary on the poems prior to their being played, “It Must Change” specifically comments on the relationship between European and American art. By her interpretation, Stevens argues throughout the poem that American art must reject the tropes and traditions of Europe: it must change and thereby assume its own identity. Characteristically of Stevens, this thesis is very far from explicit. Still, parts of the poem support Vendler’s theory. For example, one section of the multi-section poem inspects and ultimately rejects the classically European symbol of the military equestrian statue. “the General, / the very Place Du Puy, in fact, belonged / Among our more vestigial states of mind. / Nothing had happened because nothing had changed. / Yet the General was rubbish in the end,” writes Stevens.
By contrast, other sections involve distinctly New World language, featuring a planter working in a world of unforeseen, exotic lushness and a captain and his men who are named as one. It is also possible to identify statements that could very well be sweeping assertions of belief, such as the statement, “It is a sound like any other. It will end,” which might refer to the transience of ideology and culture.
The second poem, “The Auroras of Autumn,” is far more accessible. Though largely opaque in its language, it handles more common, emotional subjects, such as family and the relative powers of time, humans, and art. In the first section, Stevens sets a benevolent mother against a brutally coarse, strong father, probably speaking from personal experience: Stevens endured a lifelong estrangement from his troubled family’s patriarch, and none of his family members showed up to his wedding. After this move into the autobiographical, the poem shifts into the apocalyptic and visually spectacular. The speaker steps outside his house to witness the aurora borealis, a natural phenomenon in which colored lights appear in the sky, and contemplates the fragility of life and art in the face of time. The poem closes as Stevens explores the idea of innocence relative to the earth. He concludes that we are “an unhappy people in a happy world,” but art provides “a blaze of summer straw in winter’s nick.”
The “blaze of summer straw” line exemplifies the process of reading Stevens for the first time. The purpose of the image is not immediately apparent, but the image itself is strong and beautiful: even without full comprehension, the lyricism of the poems make them gorgeous experiences. Hearing Stevens read the poems on tape adds another dimension of accessible pleasure. As Vendler pointed out, the author lingers on some words and slides over others in a slow, caressing voice. This deliberate and individual reading reveals the poem’s intended rhythm and shape.
And the recordings offer something even to non-connoisseurs. The tapes, originally considered outtakes, feature Stevens occasionally coughing or accidentally replacing one word with another. These little mistakes provide humanity and even humor, making a giant of a poet seem like a familiar presence.
Ultimately, the tapes are part of an ongoing journey towards understanding Stevens; nearly half a century after his death, the poetry community is still in the process of unearthing new truths about his life and work. According to Vendler, Stevens’s poems never fail in their offerings.“I’ve been reading him now for 50 years,” she says. “He’s a good one to read when you’re young, because he’ll last you all your life.”

Taylor Swift’s transition into a bona fide pop artist has been years in the making, and her metamorphosis is finally complete. “1989” is the result, and it’s arguably Swift’s best record to date. Her collaboration with big-name producers Max Martin and Shellback on most of the songs on “1989” has given the album a formula for success, but at the same time Swift’s own unique style—playfully self-deprecating, wistful but not sappy—pokes through. Swift’s personality still oozes from every song, preventing the album from becoming vapid, pop fodder.
Although Swift has stated most prominently that her greatest influence while recording “1989” was music of the late ’80s, her inspirations on this album seem to come from everywhere. In fact, “1989” isn’t as much influenced by the music of the ’80s as much as it is by—as Swift herself put it in an interview—“the idea you could do what you want, be what you want.” And Swift indeed shows that she’s comfortable portraying the many different facets of herself on “1989.” “Wildest Dreams” evokes Lana Del Rey’s dreamy yet sad voice, and on “New Romantics” (from the deluxe edition), Swift channels her friend Lorde’s vocal production, most notably by layering her voice in octaves. “Style” opens with disco music, and “Blank Space,” a distinctive earworm, is lighthearted and catchy without becoming generic. “Bad Blood” has a hip-hop beat, while that of “I Know Places” was influenced by drum ’n’ bass. Swift’s versatility on this album is impressive and attests to her talent, which is only augmented by the power duo of Martin and Shellback.
Swift hasn’t just changed her sound on “1989”—she has matured as a person as well. Admittedly, she does still have a few of her hallmark love songs and post-breakup songs, and her jabs at ex-boyfriends can be just as direct: “Dear John,” a song from 2010’s “Speak Now,” calls out John Mayer, while “Style” on this album is a direct reference to Harry Styles. But after a couple of years of notoriety as a bad girlfriend, Swift has learned to recognize and make fun of her “long list of ex-lovers / [who will] tell you I'm insane,” as she sings on “Blank Space.” Her newfound maturity and lighthearted approach to criticism is best exemplified by the now-ubiquitous “Shake It Off”: she doesn’t mind that “the haters gonna hate, hate, hate.” Not that she can’t retaliate—“Bad Blood” is a thinly veiled diss track addressed to Katy Perry.
Swift’s new attitude isn’t just present when she’s cheerful—it washes over the darker songs on the album as well, changing pure lament to something more similar to nostalgia. The inner conflict in “This Love” is hopeful rather than hopeless; on the post-breakup song “Clean,” Swift sets aside self-pity in favor of a more optimistic response. Swift’s transformation stems from having two more years of wisdom under her belt, giving her more experience in producing music, writing songs, and living life. But Swift’s new style does add a bit more heft to most of her songs. Although her sound has gained a dimension of maturity, this could only come at the cost of upbeat tracks that are just plain fun. Besides “Shake It Off,” there just aren’t any songs like the hits from “Red”—“I Knew You Were Trouble,” “22,” “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.”
When most pop music has become about big-name collaborations and overprocessing, Taylor Swift has taken an alternate route. “1989”—right from the title—is all about her. Whereas “22” implied youth and carefree innocence, “1989” references a time in the past. This album is all about Taylor’s maturation both as a musician and a person. It’s a celebration of fearlessness, exploration, and, most importantly, growth. Swift seems comfortable where she is now, and the result is an effortlessly genuine album that shines unlike any other she’s released.

Killer Mike and El-P, the emcees of rap duo Run the Jewels, are back at it again and more energized than ever. “Run the Jewels 2” is the follow-up to Killer Mike and El-P’s first album, “Run the Jewels” (RTJ isn’t known for its originality in naming). The album’s premature leak immediately began an internet frenzy. Twitter users joked that the high-powered album was causing the spontaneous combustion of their phones and computers. The album lives up to its hype: its frantic beats and powerful production are immersive and addicting.
“Run the Jewels 2” holds nothing back, combining a fiery tone with strikingly political themes. Every single track launches a new attack of high-energy beats and RTJ’s characteristically angry lyrics. RTJ’s second album takes the frustrated, heavy-hitting sounds of its predecessor and intensifies them, carrying them through 11 unrelenting songs.
It makes sense that the album is positioned as a sequel to “Run the Jewels”—if you’re in the market for a rap album that’s experimental or groundbreaking, look elsewhere. Rather, “Run the Jewels 2” builds upon Killer Mike and El-P’s already-established sounds, taming and mixing the house beats of albums like “Yeezus” with the crazed aggression of artists like Death Grips. It’s the more outgoing and daring younger brother of “Run the Jewels” but immensely thrilling and catchy in its own right.
“Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck),” the album’s fourth track, is the ultimate angry rap anthem and the energetic crux of “Run the Jewels 2.” Rage Against the Machine’s Zack de la Rocha defines the track with a frenetically catchy verse of “run them jewels fast” punctuated with heavy bass, the kind of pounding beat that will likely make this track a huge commercial success. Killer Mike’s verses in “Close Your Eyes” are worth noting: marked by frustration with the prison system, Mike’s verses don’t hesitate to embrace a few political lines. “Conditions create a villain, the villain is givin’ vision / The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious / Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons,” he raps.
A timely anger with America’s justice system is found throughout the album, weaponizing the work’s already-impassioned tone. Killer Mike makes no attempt to hold back his disillusionment in “Early (feat. Boots)”: “’Cause I respect the badge and the gun / And I pray today ain’t the day that you drag me away / Right in front of my beautiful son.” In a voice that’s unusually resigned, rapped over dark synths and rough electro, Killer Mike voices his powerlessness to the cops that patrol his neighborhood. El-P chimes in with a more troubling grievance, adding, “They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording / But it didn’t record cop when he shot no warning.” Although the verses were written prior to Ferguson, RTJ has long been outspoken on issues of police brutality and racism, so it’s little surprise these lyrics make an appearance in “Run the Jewels 2.”
That being said, much of the album’s content is standard, bombastic rap fare. The first track, “Jeopardy,” immediately confronts the listener with lines like “You might wanna record the way you feelin’ like history bein’ made,” or “Prevail through Hell, so Satan get thee behind me.” But in a world of self-styled gods like Kanye West, what is a rap album without a healthy dose of boasting?
Bragging, angry, or political, “Run the Jewels 2” is an immensely enjoyable listen. RTJ has managed to craft an animated work that’s both catchy and conducive to political commentary. It’ll leave you bobbing your head, vaguely angry at the world, certainly waiting to hear more from rap’s furious power duo.

Ariel Pink is no stranger to weird music, but “Black Ballerina” is a brazen alternative to the more traditional, radio-ready single. In the past, his more esoteric songs have been buried lower down on his tracklists. Although the leading single off of Pink’s previous album was a cover of the poppy ’70s love song “Baby,” “Black Ballerina” is a much darker track, discussing the stripping industry with a sinister approach. Ariel Pink’s latest single is a bizarre yet catchy song that becomes inaccessible and offensive at times.
Its vocal melody and instrumentation are strong. The beat is pounding and interesting, with an ’80s feel to it. The singing is not particularly difficult or impressive in range, but it has a unique and compelling rhythm. The song is very effective at establishing a certain mood—a bouncy yet seedy feeling that makes it almost kitsch.
But the track is marred by speaking interludes that attempt humor but come off as tasteless and misogynistic. During one such section, a man who sounds like a pirate takes naive and worried teenager Billy to “the number one strip club in L.A.,” where he tells a dancer, “I like your areolas, baby” and is promptly kicked out. Lyrics like “juicy Belladonna” and “c’mon, don your doggie collar” directed at the dancers are objectifying and crude. The subject of the song is especially inappropriate considering Pink is currently taking heat for several comments that many consider sexist, a controversy that was reignited when Grimes accused him of “delusional misogyny” for his rude comments about Madonna.
“Black Ballerina” has musical potential when it comes to production, but extraneous elements like hazy verses and creepy spoken interludes alienate the listener.
“pom pom” is out Nov. 18 via 4AD.

I’m sitting in the Hip-Hop Archive on Mount Auburn Street, in a room of 30 people—all of whom are humming as loudly as they possibly can. I’ve got my fingers jammed up against Adrian From Pennsylvania’s carotid, trying to feel the vibrations in of his jawbone as he hums assiduously. For his part, he’s got his hand clamped around the base of my neck, right up against my c5 vertebra. We can’t decide whether or not to make eye contact—the etiquette of scanning someone else’s body for vibrations isn’t exactly covered in most cotillion courses.
Chesney Snow, beatboxing virtuoso, is big on vibrations. At the start of his Harvard Office for the Arts-sponsored beatboxing workshop, he has us stand in a circle, hold hands with our neighbors (“But really feel their hands—be aware of them, don’t just hold them”), and take massive “cleansing breaths” designed to focus our minds and prepare our lungs. “To me, beatboxing becomes a very spiritual thing because it is about vibration,” Snow says. “We are connected to vibration—vibration is sound. Our vibration goes from here”—he points to his head—“all the way to our ankles. You can actually hum and feel the bones vibrating in your ankles.”
Snow speaks like a guru. He has a gentle, slightly lisping voice, so it’s surprising when he puts mic to mouth and emits powerful, pounding drumbeats: loud, commanding kicks; high, bracing snares; delicate cymbals. And when he layers melodic elements over the percussive backbeat, threading them through the gaps in the beats, I have to look around to verify that, yes, this is all coming from one person.
But you wouldn’t expect any less from one of the world’s preeminent beatboxers. Chesney Snow is a huge name in the beatboxing community—he co-founded the World Beatbox Association, which coordinates beatboxing competitions all over the globe, and he produced the 2013 documentary “American Beatboxer,” which follows eight beatboxers on their journeys to the World Beatbox Championships. Snow is also an award-winning poet, actor, and musician. But he credits beatboxing as a central element in his success.
“I was classically trained as an actor. And I found out, when I got to New York, that—so were a lot of other people,” Snow says. “And so to have something that kind of separated me, I would use beatboxing with my poetry…and that started to take me all around the world.”
Snow’s also brought in an all-star cast of seven premier beatboxers, who break the attendees into small groups and teach them the bare essentials of beatboxing, in preparation for a quick beatboxing battle at the end of the workshop. I’m sorted into HeaveN Beatbox’s group. HeaveN, a tall Georgia native with dreadlocks, then valiantly undertakes the task of trying to teach our group the basics of beatboxing in just under 15 minutes.
He starts with bass drum kicks, pulling the microphone up to his mouth and emitting a series of sharp, low thuds that seem far too resonant to have come out of his frame. The sound’s production is tricky to explain, but HeaveN pulls it off. He tells us the kick’s essentially the letter ‘P’ with the trailing long ‘ee’ sounds cut off and the core ‘p’ sound amplified by allowing that little puff of air to build. He does it a few more times, as we, fishlike, open and close our mouths in imitation. Confident that I understand the theory, I try to emit a bass kick, only to have a few wheezy ‘paaah’s slink out of my mouth.
HeaveN coaches me on my embouchure, and my bass kicks lose a bit of their anemic trail. But they’re still not great. He then quickly runs through a few more sounds, but the only one I’m actually able to do is the hi-hat, a short hiss of air directed through the front teeth. So, for our beatbox battle, I’m told to make hi-hat sounds at constant intervals—a steady stream of “tsssss” noises. Heaven calls me the “metronome” for our little routine, but I’m pretty sure that’s just a way of making me feel important while I’m belligerently hissing at the opposing team.
The battles were phenomenally entertaining—standout performances included a middle-aged attendee singing “Sexy Back” over an R&B-laced backbeat and a beatboxed rendition of the  “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” theme. Finally, it was my group’s turn—and we were up against Snow himself. I was ready with my hi-hat, but I wasn’t able to do much else. And I did lose the beat about halfway through—so much for being a metronome. Snow destroyed us, of course. But the experience of beatboxing in front of a crowd, with real microphones, was exhilarating. And even with my complete lack of rhythm, I could feel a certain thrum in the air, an undercurrent. Perhaps these were Snow’s real vibrations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
World-renowned pianist Jonathan Biss, a teacher at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music, will deliver a master class at Harvard on Oct. 30. Biss is a pioneer of online music—he established an unprecedented course on Coursera entitled “Exploring Beethoven’s Piano Sonatas.” Biss’s masterclass will take place in the Kirkland Junior Common Room.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: Both of your parents are violinists teaching at the New England Conservatory. What’s it like coming from such a musically talented family?
JONATHAN BISS: Music seemed like language from the very beginning of my life. It wasn’t just something people did—it was something people used to express themselves to one another. To this day, that’s still how I think of it, and I’m sure this is rooted in having musician parents and a musical environment for literally as long as I can remember. Being comfortable with classical music results from exposure, and my exposure was constant from the very beginning. It was a wonderful way to grow up…. By the time I was very, very young, I was going to operas, orchestra concerts, chamber music, solo recitals—I can’t really imagine a better environment in which to grow up. THC: How did you end up being attached to piano instead of the violin?
JB: [Acclaimed pianist Artur] Schnabel said about the piano that it probably had the least interesting sound of all the instruments, but it can imitate all of the rest of them. The piano, in a way, is the most limited instrument of all, when you consider what you can do with one note, but it has the most unbelievable breadth of possibilities—range, dynamics, color, how many different things you can do at once.
THC: In the past, you’ve devoted yourself entirely to just one composer for long periods of time, including Beethoven and Schumann. What have your experiences with those journeys been, and what do you see for the future?
JB: What I found in common between the two of them—Beethoven and Schumann—is that they were very intense personalities, but in very different ways. Living with them would be very overwhelming. In the case of Beethoven, it’s because of the force of his personality. Every artist has the need to self-express, but Beethoven’s was just that much stronger. When you’re playing his music, you feel the sense of responsibility so palpably. The music is so all-encompassing that you have to access every ounce of yourself. It’s amazing to live in that world, but it’s also overwhelming.
With Schumann, the part of it that’s intense is how unflinchingly he explores darkness. Schumann was more open than any other composer in his music in what pained him and isolated him. It’s an unbelievable gift, but it makes his music very raw. You’re exposing yourself in a way that does not in any way feel comfortable. The year when I played mostly Schumann, I felt like I was living more intensely. It was wonderful, but it was not easy either.
THC: It’s well-established that Beethoven’s 32 piano sonatas are a cornerstone of classical music repertoire. But what makes them so special to you?
JB: First of all—I know this is an uninteresting answer—but the quality is so extraordinary. 32 pieces is a lot, and there is no dip in quality from beginning to end. The variety is also so extreme. If you look at the first three sonatas, in Op. 2, they’re so different in nature and in the way they work psychologically. You hear those remarkable early pieces—they show a personality that’s already fully formed—and then you see Beethoven transform himself time and time again over the course of a few decades. That’s perhaps the most unfathomable thing of all: how he could continue to find new and all the more radical ways of exploring. With most composers, you sense that there is a limit to their means. Beethoven’s means are infinite.
THC: As a musician and a teacher, you’ve set some technological firsts—most impressively with your online course on the Beethoven sonatas. What was creating that course like? And what do you see in the future of the integration of music and technology?
JB: If we’re talking about teaching in the sense of the teacher-student relationship, I’m very skeptical; the relationship between student and teacher is so delicate and requires a trust and understanding that can only be built in person. I don’t ever see distance learning replacing the conservatory. But in terms of bringing close examination of music to a wide audience, I think that the Coursera course is an unbelievable tool.
Making the class was terrific. It was challenging, certainly, because of the diversity of the student body. I had to find a way to address people with vastly different spheres of experience with Beethoven, as not to bore or exclude anyone. That was hard work. But it was an amazing experience because it was, like the rest of my teaching, incredibly clarifying for me. When you’re forced to teach, you really have to define for yourself what’s most important because you can’t say everything—there’s far too much to be said. I really learned what aspects of music were the credible things. So I think all of us learned something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I recall a conversation last year among a group of friends in which we discussed a topic that I suspect is far from the minds of most Harvard students: our future spouses. This group shared their dreams of marrying doctors, lawyers, and various people pursuing other occupations that carry with them Western society’s stamp of sure financial success. When the conversation meandered around to me and it became obvious that I was expected to share my hopes for my future wife, I shrugged. “I don’t know, I don’t particularly care what she does.” The oxygen left the room in a sudden collective intake of air. “What a considerate husband you’ll be,” one girl said with a roll of her eyes. I attempted to explain what I considered a reasonable position. “I’m not saying that I would be apathetic about my wife’s career, I’m saying that I would lend her my support regardless of what she chooses to do with her life.” “You don’t mean to say that you would marry a housewife, right?” one boy asked in horror, poised to brand me with the worst form of moral opprobrium. Though grateful for the escape hatch he was offering, I declined to take it. “If that’s what my wife prefers, then I would have no problem with that,” I answered truthfully. He shook his head sadly and responded, “I would never allow my wife to just stay home and raise the kids.” And all of the good feminists said, “Amen.”
A disclaimer is in order: I do not believe women should feel compelled to be homemakers, caregivers, or anything of the sort. I do not believe that they should feel required to have children, or even to marry. I believe that all occupations should be open to accepting women who meet the standards necessary to excel in their chosen field. In fact, considering that I intend to pursue a career in public service (a path that promises many worthy rewards that happen not to include the financial variety), it would actually be ideal if my wife were the primary breadwinner in our future household. I have no problem with strong women, strong men, or strong people–but many Harvard students do. They are not frightened of raw ambition, the relentless pursuit of worldly success that carried a large number of us here to Harvard and still sends 31 percent of Harvard graduates into career fields like finance and consulting. That kind of “strength” is familiar to everyone at Harvard; they’re much more uncomfortable with the self-sacrificial kind that comes with supporting a family and raising children.
If Harvard students do think about marrying and having children one day, it’s likely a distant concern; something to worry about in the hazy alternate universe of your thirties, or perhaps even later. I would say that this is the wrong attitude to take. From a practical stance, there are of course biological concerns to take into account: women have a limited window of optimum fertility no matter how much political freedom they enjoy (though Facebook is trying to change that), and personally it would be nice to look more like my child’s father than her grandfather at her high school graduation. However, even when ignoring the physical limitations imposed upon us by nature, I would urge Harvard students to give greater consideration to beginning a family at a younger age. Harvard can teach us many things, but humility is not usually one of them. Marrying someone and raising children with them is hard. It is a drain of time, resources, and energy, all of which you would most likely prefer to spend on some other pursuit. As a parent, you will make mistakes, you will have regrets, and you will know humility more intimately than you ever thought possible. It will be worth it.
This is not to say that beginning a family in your twenties is for everyone. It is simply to say that you should not denigrate your friends who do make that choice. This does not only apply to friends who marry early, but to those who enter what one might consider an “untraditional” career field for a Harvard graduate: teaching, counseling, social work, or other low-paying but entirely honorable job choices. The irony is that Harvard students are actually quite acquainted with the idea of sacrifice. We sacrifice all other concerns to our research, our internships, and our other résumé-building activities; no cost is too much to ask in order to land that summer job. What we’re not too familiar with is the idea of self-sacrifice on behalf of others. Remember that the next time that you see a woman wrangling her kids in the grocery store aisle or a man tending to his daughter’s bloodied knee at the park. Their choices are not due to any deficit of ability, but an excess of humility–and there’s no job more important than theirs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, the number of club sports applying for Undergraduate Council funding rose by 60 percent. The UC has raised its funding of these groups to record levels, to nearly $50,000 a year, but the clubs are still underfunded by the Athletics Department. While the UC’s generosity seems to bode well for club sports, the news hides a disappointing revelation—that the Athletics Department has slashed the maximum amount of funding allotted to each club sport, leaving the UC holding the bag.
Club sports are an important part of university life for many undergraduates. Varsity sports teams by design can accommodate only a small fraction of the student body. Hundreds of other students participate in the 65 club teams recognized by the Athletics department, from Aikikai to Xfit. These groups are essential not only to the physical health of the student body, but also to mental health. The Athletics Department seems to agree and its handbook claims: “Club sports foster the development of sound leisure values and a feeling of belonging and understanding between individuals and groups.”
The Athletics Department cuts reveal an essential hypocrisy: that the university lowers funding for the same student groups that it highlights in its promotional materials to prospective students. The College’s Admissions website prominently highlights the range of club sports in two separate pages: “Choosing Harvard” and “Student residential life.” “Harvard Athletics offers 42 Division I intercollegiate varsity teams…as well as numerous club/intramural sports,” it reads. The university cannot have things both ways. If the Athletics Department views club sports as one of its main selling points, it should not ask others to fund them.
This year more than ever, the cash-strapped UC has to make painful and unnecessary budgetary trade-offs. In addition to the $50,000 spent on club sports, the UC funds and supervises most student activities on campus. Its budget of less than $500,000 per year is funded entirely by a term bill fee, unchanged since 2006. Over the past year UC President Gus Mayopolous has loudly pushed for an additional $250,000 of funding from the administration, meeting with President Faust last February, but was flat-out denied.
As long as the UC is operating under a budget constraint, its first priority should be to fund mandates that are not under the purview of other parts of the university. If the Athletics Department refuses to maintain funding levels for club sports, the UC should not feel pressure to make up the difference. The Athletics Department is failing to do its fair share.

UPDATED: November 6, 2014 10:20AM
Last week, many Harvard students collectively went on a diet—whether they wanted to or not. The food in some dining halls was suddenly coded according to unclear nutritional guidelines. Three categories—red, yellow, and green—let students know the moral value of their food before they put it on their trays.
At its core, the system—deemed an “intervention” for our dining halls—affects an individual’s thoughts, feelings, and experiences with food. The dot system—which is currently in place in Dunster and Mather House—explicitly discourages individuals from choosing and enjoying red and yellow foods and might embarrass them if they do. Certain foods that may once have been comforting and relished for their taste might now provoke feelings of guilt or shame for students paying attention to the new code. At the extreme, those who may already be struggling to maintain healthy eating habits could be swayed to abandon their acumen altogether as a result of the inescapable dots.
The dot system imposes a standard and value on every food, which can feel like constant judgment to those for whom diet, weight, or shape has ever been tied up with a sense of achievement. If green is considered “good,” then competitive students—found by the multitude at Harvard—might begin to believe that there is more value in working towards the “best” diet, or the green ideal.
The “Be Bright, Eat Right” system also appears to consider each food individually instead of as part of a meal. No one food fills all our nutritional requirements. Instead, it takes a lot of different foods—some providing proteins, others carbs, vitamins, fats—to create balance. When we sit down in the dining hall, the foods we choose are in conversation with each other. A plate filled solely with green fruits and veggies would be just as imbalanced as one stacked with ranger cookies and froyo. A meal is not a stoplight intersection. It’s a painting. Given three globs of paint on a palate, most people would smear them around to create a mixture of hues and expression. Red foods mix with yellow foods to create a lovely orange meal.
And these meals are not “good” or “bad.” They’re normal. After all, normal eating is flexible. It varies in response to your emotions, your hunger, and whether or not you’ve been up all night working on CS50. Normal eating is giving oneself permission to eat for any number of reasons. Normal eating doesn’t exist within the rigid labeling system that has been prescribed in our dining halls.
It is difficult to fathom the magnitude of shame and isolation that seriously discourages an individual from sharing their legitimate and omnipresent eating concerns. This deficit in open-ended, non-judgmental conversation often fuels an inability to evoke sympathy, validation, and tangible support that certain individuals may need. The stoplight-system exacerbates the ubiquitous misunderstanding and subsequent lack of compassion for struggling individuals. It only increases the pre-existing hyper-awareness of body image and physique in society today. For that reason, it is an inconsiderate, arbitrary system of food-shaming that is unnecessarily infiltrating our Harvard community.
Expressing empathy may be difficult without having experienced eating concerns yourself. But by initiating a conversation, we can build a sympathetic and supportive environment in our Harvard community. Our competitiveness need not necessitate a lack of compassion for others, or for ourselves.
The dot system study’s explicit aim is to explore whether labeling foods in this way changes our eating habits. We are worried it will do just that. Perhaps this change will be helpful—maybe some of us will begin understanding nutrition a bit better as the system proposes. But change flows in both directions, and this one might do more harm than good. We worry how this change will look for us, and we worry how it will look for our peers. Once you have started, it is hard to stop counting, stop restricting. It is hard to remember what normal eating looks like. For those just barely starting to figure it out again, the last thing we want—the last thing we need—is a new system of judgment, a fresh set of restrictions, someone else telling us what we can and cannot eat.
We are worried because we should have agency over our own bodies. And agency means choosing food on our own terms—not someone else’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was looking at colleges, the one thing I knew was that I wanted a school with a campus.
The idea of a city school just didn’t make much sense to me. My older sister went to a large, urban college for one year, and I couldn’t wrap my head around the concept that one couldn’t tell where the school ends and the city begins.
Harvard, of course, isn’t like that. While we don’t have a sprawling campus and Harvard Square is surely a busy urban center of a larger city, when you’re in the immediate area, it never feels like you’ve left school. A trip to CVS or Panera Bread doesn’t truly take you off-campus; Harvard dominates this part of town.
And that can make all the difference. My initial instinct for and interest in a campus school came from a desire to be absorbed by a college community. In a non-campus, big-city school, it would be easy to feel like the college experience consists primarily of going to class, while most other aspects of life are pushed into the surrounding city. A campus has the power to create a sense of community.
Sometimes, however, things aren’t all they’re chalked up to be. That very community can very quickly turn into a bubble that is hard to escape and all too easy to be consumed by. The irony is that because Harvard so overwhelms us, self-awareness is often the first casualty.
Taking a step back becomes a healthy and vital thing to do. As a freshman, I rarely left the Harvard Square area except to catch a train home for holiday breaks. In theory, everything you need is right here—both academics and social life can usually be found somewhere between the Charles River and the Yard.
But in practice, we need more than this small area can provide. A separation is sometimes necessary. Even the commute to the where I live in the Quad, which promised a barrier between work and home, doesn’t really remove you from campus. You walk through residential parts of Cambridge to return to an area that is very much part of Harvard.
This past weekend, some friends and I biked to a diner in Allston for breakfast. It wasn’t far away geographically—you could still see the Business School from the window next to our booth—but mentally it was a different world. Most of us enjoy being surrounded by Harvard students and taking part in House life, but too often that becomes the default. Removing yourself from campus once in a while not only gives you a break from that routine, but is also makes you appreciate it more. The things that unintentionally become habits are more meaningful when you realize that there are alternatives to them.
Breaking the routine is hard. There are so many reasons why staying on campus makes sense: It’s familiar and it saves us time when our schedules become packed with school and work and club commitments. It is very easy to comp groups and join circles of friends during freshman year, establishing the spaces and people that will define our social experiences.
Some of us are comfortable with that. Over time, I found that interrupting the routine is one of the most important things to do. This starts with small things: Study in a different space, join groups after freshman year if they interest you, and quit them if they bore you. And, when you get the chance, pop the Harvard bubble every now and then.
After breakfast in Allston, some of us doubled back to Alewife and got on the Minuteman Bikeway, taking it a couple miles out and ending up outside a coffee shop somewhere in Arlington. We sat for hours and for one of the first times since I’ve been here, I had an afternoon uninfluenced by school and unworried by work or commitments.
Leaving campus does not mean abandoning Harvard. To be sure, school is perhaps the most defining aspect of our lives as students. Harvard will always be there in one way or another. But that doesn’t mean it has to stop you from hopping on a bike or a train and taking it until you hit a coffee shop you never knew existed.

Experts compared education policy in the European Union and the U.S. at a panel event Monday, highlighting the decision-making processes and power distributions that result in distinct approaches to education.
José Manuel Martínez Sierra, professor of European Union law and government, argued that the E.U.’s lack of political power and complicated executive structure contribute to its contemporary difficulties in implementing educational policies.
“The problem in European Union education has to do with the complexity of the decision-making process and the lack of competency of the European Union,” Martínez Sierra said.
Martínez Sierra noted that the lack of a centralized political system in the E.U. results in the relative autonomy of each member state, which makes it difficult to implement policies across member states. Since national interests often supersede international ones, it is challenging for the E.U. to implement widespread educational reform, he said.
S. Paul Reville, former Massachusetts Secretary of Education and a professor at the Graduate School of Education, discussed the history of education reform in the U.S.
According to Reville, the U.S. constitution does not delegate education policy as a power of the federal government, which in turn gives states the ability to shape their educational systems.
“There is no mention whatsoever of education [in the Constitution],” Reville said. “Anything not written in the federal Constitution was automatically the responsibility of the individual states.”
Reville later added that since education policy can not be mandated at the national level, the federal government has to create incentives, particularly access to funds, to motivate states to adopt certain policies.
Through these federal incentives, Reville said that “federal policy gets implemented, without it being mandated.”
The business community has also prompted states to implement reforms because leaders believed education was critical to economic prosperity, he said.
Reville discussed how, due to federal incentives and encouragement from business leaders, states have voluntarily developed a set of standards known as the common core, which allow local governments to develop curricula to achieve a set of common standards about what students should know at the end of each grade.
He noted that although the reform process in the U.S. can be difficult and time-consuming like in the E.U., the American approach offers incentives for individual states to implement education policies.

UPDATED: Oct. 28, 2014, at 2:17 a.m.
American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts Executive Director Carol Rose discussed women’s rights on Monday, arguing that court case rulings have been unfavorable for women in recent years.
During the event at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Rose said that recent legal decisions have been “devastating for women and poor people in our country.”
One of the cases that Rose discussed concerned “buffer zones,” spaces in which protests are not legally allowed around abortion clinics in Massachusetts. In the past, it was illegal to protest within a 35-foot area around an abortion clinic in Massachusetts, which protected women who wanted to get abortions, Rose said. This law is similar to one that prevents panhandlers from approaching individuals near restaurants, banks, and other areas where money is exchanged, she noted.
According to Rose, however, the Massachusetts buffer zone law for abortion clinics was recently struck down by a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which declared that the law was not useful since crowding around these clinics was “only a problem on Saturdays.”
Rose argued that working women only have time to go to the clinic on Saturdays, and that the failure of the Supreme Court to recognize this is indicative of how “out of touch” the Court is with the public. She added that she believed that some remarks made by the justices were “paternalistic and misogynistic.”
Rose also discussed a Supreme Court case concerning a female UPS driver. The driver, who was pregnant, told her boss that she was unable to lift more than 20 pounds because of her pregnancy, Rose said. The woman was subsequently fired, and the boss allegedly refused to allow her to take on a lighter job, saying that giving the woman a lighter job would be “discrimination,” according to Rose.
“The boss used pregnancy [to discriminate] against the woman,” Rose said.
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for the case on Dec. 3.
According to Rose, several recent court case rulings have involved violations in women’s rights, though this pattern may not initially be apparent.
“This is an alarming trend,” Rose said. “We need to see the inner relationship between [these cases].”

Two prominent journalists predicted a close gubernatorial election in Massachusetts and discussed next week’s midterm elections at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Monday afternoon.
Gabrielle Gurley, a senior associate editor at think tank MassINC, and Jim O’Sullivan, a Boston Globe reporter, spoke about November’s races in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine, as well as the Massachusetts ballot questions.
Steve Poftak, director of the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston, began the event by asking the two journalists to discuss the Massachusetts gubernatorial election.
Gurley answered immediately, saying she thought that the election for governor between Republican Charlie D. Baker ’79 and Democrat Martha M. Coakley would be closely contested.
“It is going to be a close race, and will go down to election day, if not late election evening,” Gurley said.
The two journalists then discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate’s campaign strategy.
O’Sullivan commended Baker for his effort to reach out to traditionally liberal voters.
“Baker is finally starting to make the sale,” O’Sullivan said. “He is convincing people who are traditionally Democratic voters that he is a safe Republican.”
Gurley agreed with O’Sullivan. “Baker is not taking the cities for granted as Democratic, and this time around he has an urban agenda,” she said.
The speakers then turned to the race for attorney general in Massachusetts. Gurley and O’Sullivan agreed that Maura T. Healey ’92 seemed poised to win the election.
“Healey has charisma that Martha Coakley doesn’t have,” O’Sullivan said. “People are susceptible to personality and charisma as a reason to vote for one person over another.”
The two speakers then discussed the U.S. Senate election in New Hampshire between Scott Brown and Jeanne Shaheen.
“I have learned my lesson about underestimating Scott Brown,” O’Sullivan said. “Every time ads show that most of Shaheen’s votes are with Barack Obama, that helps Brown.”
Finally, the two discussed ballot questions and the significance they could have in the upcoming elections.
“Ballot questions with very high stakes prompt high turnout,” Gurley said. “In Springfield, voters may come out because of the casino repeal issue on the ballot,” he added, referencing a ballot initiative that could overturn a law which allows for the construction of up to three casinos in Massachusetts.
Gurley, with a laugh, said that Republican Paul R. LePage, running for governor of Maine, might see high voter turnout next week because of a ballot question about bear bait, which might bring conservative, pro-hunting voters to the polls.
Although O’Sullivan predicted small Republican gains in the Massachusetts State Senate, Poftak reminded audience members of the staunchly liberal political landscape within the Commonwealth.
“By doubling the Republicans in the State Senate,” Poftak said, “[O’Sullivan] means going from four to eight in a group of 40.”
The event, which was co-sponsored by the Institute of Politics, the Rappaport Institute, and the Taubman Center for State and Local Government, was attended by several dozen people.

Two administrative fellows and one graduate assistant are spending the academic year in the Office of Student Life to implement College diversity initiatives.
The fellows, Kimberly A. Truong and Alicia Williams, were each hired through the Office of the Assistant to the President for Institutional Diversity and Equity, which offers a one-year fellowship program for professionals in higher education leadership. Brittany Vine, a graduate student at Merrimack College, is serving a joint fellowship with the OSL and Merrimack.
According to Emelyn A. dela Peña, assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion, Truong and Williams will help build the OSL’s diversity infrastructure in their year here through projects such as planning a spring conference on student research on diversity and researching support services for first-generation college students at peer institutions. The fellows will coordinate with other offices at the College, including the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Harvard College Women’s Center.
Last spring, administrators convened a working group to discuss issues of race and inclusion at the College, and that group, chaired by Pusey Minister Jonathan L. Walton, plans to present recommendations on College resource allocation to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sometime this academic year. Dela Peña, who staffs the committee, said she “would imagine that the fellows would be instrumental” in implementing any OSL projects that come out of the group’s recommendations this year.

Currier House Dean Laura K. Johnson will leave her position at the end of the semester to assume the role of associate dean of student affairs at Boston University's School of Education, Currier House Masters Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross wrote to the House community Monday evening.
According to the email sent to the House list, Wrangham and Ross are working with the College to secure an interim dean for next semester, and the search for Johnson’s official replacement will begin in the spring. Johnson has also served as senior resident dean, a position given to the highest-ranking House or freshman Yard dean, since longtime Adams House Dean Sharon L. Howell vacated the position.
Johnson, who received her doctorate in American Studies from Boston University, also serves as a lecturer on Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and a faculty member at the Graduate School of Education. She was scheduled to teach a cross-listed course on gender and education in the spring.
Wrangham and Ross wrote in the email that Johnson “joined us at a time when we needed a strong and competent Dean and in Laura we got just that.”
Wrangham elaborated in an email to The Crimson that Johnson “has had a brilliant three years in every way.”
“We wish she could stay but we are thrilled that she has won such a suitable new position,” he wrote. “Laura and her family will be hugely missed by everyone in the house.”
Johnson will work under the school's dean of student life, Hardin Coleman; at press time, Boston University had not released an official statement about the appointment.
Johnson’s departure is the latest in a series of shuffles among House deans. Ari R. Hoffman ’10, a resident tutor in Lowell House, was appointed acting Dean in Kirkland House this semester, and Adam Muri-Rosenthal, a resident tutor in Mather House, was named Dean of Adams House in June after Howell’s departure. Former Cabot House Dean Emily W. Stokes-Rees left the College at the end of the last academic year as well.
September also saw two changes in the position’s formal title and a set of clarifications regarding the role of the dean based on the recommendations of an FAS committee.

American colleges and universities will have to tighten their belts in coming years to survive shortfalls in government funding, according to Mark G. Yudof, a law professor and veteran university administrator who spoke at the Graduate School of Education Monday.
Yudof, who has served as the chancellor of the University of Texas System and the president of both the University of Minnesota and the University of California, focused his talk on the economic phenomenon of “cost disease” in higher education due to decreasing government subsidies.
“If you want a deeper understanding of the cost disease, think about a symphony orchestra that wants to reduce the cost of putting on a concert,” Yudof said. Comparing a decreased government subsidy for the arts to a cutback in a state budget for higher education, Yudof likened universities’ fear of raising tuition to an orchestra manager’s reluctance to increase ticket prices. Not only would there be public outcry, he said, but also the steeper prices might disadvantage middle- or low-income earners.
State governments are spending less on higher education in order to meet the needs of an aging population and spending more on medical care and social security, according to Yudof. In addition, increasing diversity in America’s population has cultivated a tendency to “eschew responsibility to educate other people’s children," he said.
Yudof added that declining support for public goods and booming privatization in industries contribute to the reduced interest in financing higher education. “We now spend more in America on potato chips than on research,” he said.
Still, Yudof said that universities can take concrete steps to make higher education efficient and affordable. Reducing faculty size and replacing tenured professors with teaching staff who are less expensive to employ could help lower costs without necessarily reducing teaching quality, he said. In particular, he added, the shift from a traditional classroom to an online learning environment for certain courses would dramatically aid with reducing expenditures on faculty salaries.
Noting that such adjustments would require “immense collaboration and cooperation and [that the] internal politics of a university can be gruesome,” Yudof said in an interview after the event that current college students must recognize the value of tuition and embrace the idea of online learning for necessary reform to occur.

A senior thesis project introducing new color-coded labeling in some dining halls has raised concerns among some undergraduates who said that the system may cause additional eating-related stress.
Michael W. Seward ’15 is currently conducting a study to investigate whether students in undergraduate dining halls would make more nutrient-rich choices through the use of interventions such as labels, which are meant to “highlight evidence-based nutrition information in a condensed format.”
His study, which is based in part on a similar program at Massachusetts General Hospital, labels foods as red for less nutritional value, yellow for moderate nutritional value, or green for healthier options.
At Massachusetts General Hospital, the “stoplight” program caused sales of red-labeled items to decrease by 20 percent over two years, while sales of green-labeled items increased by 12 percent.
According to Megan O. Corrigan ’16, co-director of UHS-funded Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach program, she and several other student staff members of the hotline recently met and discussed their concerns with the program.
“I don’t think any information should be suppressed, but I think that the way information is presented is important,” Corrigan said. “I find the stoplight program to be reductive because it defines foods according to moral categories and it defines foods individually…. If you were going to have a healthy meal, it would probably look like a mix of green, yellow, and red foods.”
The signs might adversely affect some students more than others, according to Corrigan.
“Even among students with normal eating habits, they might feel guilt about taking ‘red’ foods,” Corrigan said.  “For students who have eating concerns or who have recovered from eating concerns, seeing foods labeled as red could be potentially very triggering.”
She also emphasized that ECHO was not taking a position as an organization, but rather she and other staff members were.
Seward said that he tried to ensure his program would not adversely affect students with eating concerns.
“I worked extensively with [ECHO] to learn how to sharpen the message of the study, which I believe is crucial,” he said, noting that the labels encourage students to make “more educated choices” and “do not ask students to never eat red-labeled food.”
Members of ECHO confirmed that correspondence had taken place.
“We know that the creators have good intentions and intend for this project to help not hurt students, but we are still concerned that it is having unintended effects,” ECHO co-director Hannah M. Borowsky ’15 said.
According to Corrigan, Lowell House Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03 asked that HUDS remove the program from the Lowell dining hall “because it might be triggering.” Casey did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Seward gave an alternative reason for why the signs were taken down in some of the Houses.
“Due to an administrative error outside of my control, the traffic light labels were put on a few items in Lowell and Winthrop for one to two days,” said Seward.
Currently, only Dunster and Mather dining halls feature the traffic light system.
This interaction between student projects, healthy labeling, and HUDS is not new, according to Crista Martin, Harvard University Dining Services director for marketing and communications.
“We had students do labeling projects related to nutrition concepts and sustainability concepts,” said Martin, pointing to a chart that appears in the dining halls providing information about the sugar content of various beverages, designed by the Harvard School of Public Health.
Seward’s program was incorporated at the Greenhouse Cafe throughout the 2013-2014 academic year, and was featured in Dunster’s dining hall during the spring semester.
Frank B. Hu, a professor of nutrition at the School of Public Health, said that he was not aware of any existing studies measuring the impact of a traffic light system on individuals with eating issues.
“The psychology of this system and whether this can cause any type of social stress and subsequently lead to eating problems, I am not aware of any data on this issue,” he said.
Corrigan said that, as individuals, ECHO staff members in Dunster and Mather intend to move forward by discussing the issue with their dining hall managers and resident deans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some players win the job through competition, others through attrition.
Such was the case for Jeremy Lin ’10, who nabbed the starting point guard job for the Los Angeles Lakers Monday after three competitors went down with injury. Lin will start on opening night Tuesday against his old team, the Houston Rockets. The Rockets traded the former Harvard star in the offseason for cap relief in its failed run at Chris Bosh.
Lin will benefit from a series of injuries that have ravaged the Lakers’ core. Two-time MVP Steve Nash was declared out for the season last week, with guard Nick “Swaggy P” Young already out until December. Journeyman Ronnie Price, who started the team’s last preseason game ahead of Lin, suffered a bone bruise in the final game and is only probable for Tuesday’s action. Wayne Ellington, Xavier Henry, and Ryan Kelly are also out. Overall, Lakers beat reporter Mike Trudell reported that the team will only have 10 bodies to start the opener, two short of the maximum.
Last year, Lin was the first man off the bench for Kevin McHale’s Rockets team. He averaged 12.5 points a game in limited minutes, flashing an improved three-point stroke (35.8 percent) and better court vision overall. His statistics fell short of those he put up for the Linsanity-era New York Knicks, but represented his best efforts over the course of a full season.
In 2014-2015, Lin will be expected to defer more to Kobe Bryant, the alpha dog in the Lakers backcourt. Overall, the Lakers profile as a lower-tier lottery team after being decimated by injuries. Los Angeles has a couple nice pieces in the frontcourt with Ed Davis and Jordan Hill but boasts very little wing and guard depth behind Lin and Bryant.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­After suffering its first loss in 10 games Saturday, the Harvard men’s soccer team (8-4-1, 2-1-1 Ivy) will look to bounce back in its return to non-conference action Tuesday night against the Stony Brook Seawolves (4-10-1, 2-3-0 America East). The Crimson has won its last five non-conference games by a combined 11-goal margin.
“Their record is not phenomenal at the moment but they are a very good playing team,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “They play and get the ball moving, and it’ll be a good opportunity for us to work on all the stuff we need to do on attacking set pieces. It’s great to have this game.”
The Crimson had its nine-game unbeaten streak snapped by rival Princeton on Saturday night, falling behind by three goals before mounting a late comeback in the 3-2 loss. Two penalties in its defensive third doomed Harvard, as Princeton converted both a penalty kick and free kick into first-half goals. It was the first time all season that the Crimson allowed three goals.
Stony Brook is seemingly an ideal opponent to cure the team’s recent defensive ills. Before scoring three times in a Friday win against Albany, Stony Brook had scored just one goal in its four previous games. It was shut out five times in nine games during one mid-season stretch, and has scored three goals or more just three times all season.
After a game in which his team fell behind by three goals for the first time all season, Lehrer stood by his defense. The coach noted that the team’s mistakes against Princeton were atypical for a squad that posted three consecutive clean sheets earlier this month and said that the team is close to a turnaround.
“I think that we can get a couple things a little bit better on the energy part and on the defensive side of the game,” Lehrer said. “[However], the level of the group in practice in all these areas is exceptional. It’s not fully translating into the games but we are very close… We are not far off.”
The Seawolves last visited Cambridge in 2009 to face the best men’s soccer team in recent Harvard history. A 4-1 defeat of Stony Brook catapulted that year’s Crimson to a 14-4-1 record and the third round of the NCAA tournament, where it fell to Maryland, 2-0. The two squads drew, 1-1, four years ago in the only meeting since.
Even given its recent advantage over the Seawolves, Harvard is not taking Stony Brook lightly. Heading into a crucial Saturday matchup with Dartmouth, the current Ivy League leader, junior co-captain Kyle Henderson said that the team will not focus on either its last or its next Ivy League game—only its next opponent.
“We are not going to dwell on [Princeton] too much—we don’t get too excited about wins, we don’t get too down about losses,” Ashby said. “We take it one game at a time.”
On defense, the Crimson will have to contain Stony Brook midfielders Martin Giodano and Thibault Duval. Together, the pair have accounted for 40 percent of the team’s goals this year. Each has a shot on goal percentage more than 10 percent higher than the team average. Duval especially has made the most of his few chances, knocking in four goals on just nine attempts.
Overall, co-captain Kyle Henderson said that the team is eager to return to the field after a close lost that he argued “could have gone either way.” Henderson noted that the end of the team’s nine-game unbeaten streak, which spanned five weeks and assuaging any residual concerns from a 0-3 start, has had little effect on the team.
“A lot of people talk about the streak but being in it, I don’t really notice that you are doing something different necessarily,” Henderson said. “We have continuously been getting better … [The key] is continuing to fine tune things and prepare game by game to come out on top Tuesday and after that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its fall action nearing completion, the Harvard’s coed sailing team split up across New England to compete the Hoyt Trophy, the Oberg Trophy, and the Central Series 6, finishing within the top ten spots for two of the three regattas.
SHERMAN HOYT TROPY
The Crimson used Z420 boats at the only inter-conference regatta of the weekend, which was hosted by Brown. The previous week’s weather affected the regatta, leaving the waves choppy. Regatta officials found a hole in boat 10 that caused a recess in some of the competing teams’ races on Saturday. “Sunday was very windy, so most of our mistakes were the result of sailing in parts of the course that had a lot of breeze,” freshman Kevin Coakley said.
Harvard came in 14th of 18 teams, dropping a place from last year’s showing at the regatta. The Crimson racked up a combined total of 203 points, 100 points behind the winner of the Trophy, Fordham.
Senior Brian Drumm and juniors Jake Bradt and Marek Zaleski, scored 104 and earned 11th place in the A division. Races one and five, in which they placed second and third respectively, were highlights.Joining Coakley in the B division, junior co-captains Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky also finished just outside the top-10 in 11th place, with their best performance earning them second place in their second race.
“In our first set together, Andrew and I made some mistakes that cost us a few boats,” Coakley said. “But we had much stronger finishes in the final two races of the regatta.”  OBERG TROPHY
It was a breezy yet beautiful day for sailing in Boston at the regatta hosted by MIT and Northeastern. Harvard improved its placement from last year, moving up five places to sixth from the contributions of the A, B, and C division teams. The Crimson scored 385 points, 84 points short of URI, who won.
Sophomores Matthew Mollerus and Olivia Kjorlien came in eighth place in division A. They finished in first place in two races, and placed in the top 10 in 11 starts.
Freshman Nick Sertl and sophomore Julia Lord had the best performance of the weekend for the Crimson, finishing fourth in the B division with a score of 110 points. In multiple races the duo placed within the top five, and in only two of the 17 races were they not a part of the top 10.
In the C division, sophomores Bennett Capozzi and Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj earned eighth place with 124 points.  CENTRAL SERIES 6
In previous Central Series regattas earlier in the season, the Crimson earned first, eighth, and second place finishes. Harvard maintained its top-10 finish following a fifth place showing in this regatta hosted by Boston College. The team scored a combined 149 points, 54 behind Dartmouth.
Freshman Taylor Ladd and junior Kristina Jakobson won fifth place in division A, adding 70 points to the total. They placed in the top-10 in all of their races.
Junior Sophie Bermudez and senior Ashleigh Inglis finished with 79 points, also winning fifth place in the B division. They scored in the top-10 in all of their races except for one, in which they were disqualified post-race for an error that occurred on the course.
“I think overall the regatta was a success,” Ladd said. “We sent the women’s team to a coed regatta and showed that we can hang with the boys. I was happy with our result as there were many good teams there and we held our own.”
Next up for the Crimson will be the Schnell Trophy, Victorian Urn Trophy, and the Nickerson Trophy this coming weekend.
“For the future, I think we need to continue being consistent, while also working on fleet management.” Ladd said. “It’s easy when you’re in the front of the pack to make stupid moves, when getting in the top three or five every race is solid and can win regattas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Time off has been proven to improve job performance. If you don’t believe that, you weren’t at Powers Field Saturday.
After missing a month with an injured back, senior quarterback Conner Hempel returned to put together a career performance while guiding the Harvard football team to a 49-7 thumping of Princeton. He finished with a career-high 382 yards and three touchdowns.
Hempel’s first pass failed to find the hands of wideout Andrew Fischer, but 20 of his next 22 passes moved Harvard down the field. One of those came after Hempel evaded two free rushers to find Joseph Foster for a 39-yard score—the first of the game. Another put Harvard up 14-0 after hitting Seitu Smith in stride down the sideline on a 49-yard touchdown pass.
Hempel also scored twice with his legs in the first half, showing no signs of injury-related limitations, before entering halftime with a 28-0 lead.
Of course, Harvard boasted a big lead the last time the Crimson faced the Tigers in New Jersey, too. Then-quarterback Colton Chapple ’13 broke the Harvard passing record in that game after helping Harvard build a 24-point fourth-quarter lead. He was garnering Athlete-of-the-Week talk in the press box before that lead began to corrode.
Princeton went on to score 29 unanswered points to stun the previously-undefeated Crimson, 39-34.Harvard coach Tim Murphy said he will remember that collapse to his grave. Hopefully he remembers Hempel’s performance Saturday too. The senior made sure there would be no sequel to 2012’s tragedy, putting Harvard up 42-0 in the fourth quarter before being pulled from the game.
Afterwards, Tigers coach Bob Surace said he expected Hempel to return Saturday, and even still could not stop him. He could only think of one other player who had impacted a game as much as Hempel did Saturday.
“We have free rushers on him, he escapes us and throws a touchdown pass. There’s two or three times he scrambles for first downs. A couple times, I thought he was going to throw into an area where I thought we had him covered, and he held it and pumped the ball and threw it the other way,” Surace said. “Credit him, that was probably one of the two finest performances against us.”
Surace added that he saw a fresh Hempel on the field. His Tigers defense tallied seven sacks of Hempel in last year’s 51-48 triple-overtime win in Cambridge, but brought him down just once Saturday.
That had a lot to do with a Harvard offensive line which boasts two future NFLers in the eyes of Surace, who spent five years as a Bengals line coach, but Hempel also displayed some tendencies the Princeton coach had only seen in another pro player.
“I played with Jason Garrett, and unfortunately we didn’t block as well as we could have at times, and he had that same unique ability to spin out, like he’d sense a guy coming free and would have the same unique ability to do that,” Surace said. “Not every quarterback can do that."
Murphy said his coaches were excited to reinsert Hempel’s improvisational ability back into their offense. They needed it, too. In the team’s four games without Hempel, it scored fewer than 26 points three times. You would have to go back to 2009 to find a season in which Harvard scored fewer than 26 points three times in an entire season.
Despite the lack of production in his absence, Hempel said he was not surprised by how much success his offense had Saturday.
His performance earned him Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week honors, though he has to share the award with Yale quarterback Morgan Roberts. Roberts is second in the FCS with 334 yards passing per game. After topping last year’s offensive player of the year, Princeton signal-caller Quinn Epperly, Hempel will have an opportunity to indirectly prove his superiority to Roberts when Harvard travels to Dartmouth.
The still-undefeated Big Green beat Yale, 38-31, two weeks ago, intercepting Roberts three times in the process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard lightweight men’s crew team headed down to Princeton this Sunday to compete in the annual Princeton Chase Regatta. With boats representing the Crimson in the 8+, 4+, and freshman races, Harvard managed to snag several top finishes on Lake Carnegie this weekend.
“The Chase is always a great opportunity to meet the competition from Head of the Charles in a different setting and get some racing experience in small boats,” sophomore Ian Meyer said.
This was the Crimson’s first race since its second place finish at Head of the Charles two weeks ago.
“I thought that our team put in a very strong showing this weekend,” captain Alexander Bonorris said. “For the team as a whole, this was the first opportunity for some of the guys to race this fall, as there are not enough boats in the Head of the Charles to boat everyone on the team.”
In the Varsity 8+ division, Harvard was outraced by Ivy League foes Cornell and Yale, clinching a third place finish at 13:27. Harvard had to put up a strong fight to keep Princeton off its heels and stay in third, as the Tigers finished less than two seconds behind the Crimson.
The Crimson’s strongest performance of the day came from the first string lightweight four, who managed to win the race to claim Harvard’s sole first place finish of the day. Led by Bonorris, who was joined by sophomores Tom Marshal, Jack Kelly and Michael Wales, the quad coasted into a leading position, finishing with a time of 14:51. The four were a solid seven seconds ahead of their closest competitor, giving them a comfortable margin on the victory.
This lightweight 4+ race was dominated by the Crimson, as the second Harvard boat took third place in the heat with a time of 15:15.
“Our top varsity eight broke down into two fours, and the top four was able to win the event for the 5th year in a row,” Bonorris said. “Having our two boats beat every other crew except for the Yale A boat was a truly spectacular result, and it shows that our program has a great deal of depth and strength.”
Harvard’s freshman eight showed a strong effort on the day as well with a fourth place finish. The crew finished behind two Princeton boats and Penn’s eight.
“The hope this weekend was to try to put a piece together in every boat that would be an improvement over our results from last weekend,” Bonorris said.  “And I think our results show that we did that.. We are definitely in the pack, and we know what we have to do to continue improving.”
Harvard lightweights will return to competition November 22, as they compete at the Foot of the Charles regatta.

Yesterday, Taylor Swift’s album dropped like a baby in the hands of an uncle who just can’t stop palm-sweating. It’s fair to say everyone in the world is excited, especially YouTube video-makers trying to piggy-back off of the profits. This post is dedicated to the multitude of internetters’ poor quality and variable length videos.
The first video I stumbled upon when searching for “1989”-related content was everything I wanted. No, everything I needed. Welcome to the two and a half hour long review of “1989” by a man lying down on a couch with a knack for calling her “T-Swizzle.” They must be long-time friends given the ludicrous amount of insight he brings to the table.
Then, there’s also the three minutes of techno pretending to be “Blank Space,” a track on the album, thanks to Taylor Swift’ (spot how the channel name is different from Taylor Swift for five points).
Lastly, help a guy out and get this man more than 800 views.
Happy listening to “1989” and please, please, please support these highly creative Taylor-related videos. She doesn’t need all the attention today.

Located on the second floor of Harvard’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, the Hiphop Archive and Research Institute is a relatively new addition to Harvard, a pioneering center for research into hip hop, and a downright cool place if you’re into any aspect of the culture.
Established in 2002, Harvard’s the Archive is the first institution of its kind according program director Gerald Trotman. Founded and currently directed by professor Marcyliena Morgan, HARI focused on five areas of research, ranging from the role of Girls and Women in Hip Hop, to Hip Hop Civics, and the Classic Crates project, which is meant to build awareness for how vinyl albums are analyzed. All of these topics are being researched by undergraduate students, according to Trotman.
“It’s an area for research, it’s a place where projects are done...that’s the focus of the archives as it stands now,” Trotman said. “We still find that there’s a lot of undergrads that don’t realize this place exists.”
With an extensive collection of artifacts, from books and posters to toys and cereal boxes, the Archive also has a music and record collection stretching back to the 1970s that is bound to make any fan smile. The Archive are notable for their breadth and a wide range of obscurity according to Trotman.
One display in particular highlights the work of rapper Nas, who established an eponymous fellowship at HARI in 2013. Current Nasir Jones Fellow Damon Burchell-Sajnani is both the leader of Canadian independent hip hop act “The Dope Poet Society” and a Ph.D. candidate in African American Studies at Northwestern University. Previous recipients of HARI fellowships include artist 9th Wonder. Although HARI only offers at most two fellowships per year, they are an extremely important part of the institute according to Trotman.
Although the archives are focused on research, tours are offered on Fridays at 1 p.m. as part of the Hutchins Center’s weekly tours, led by Senior Curatorial Associate Dr. Sheldon Cheek. Stop by to enter the world of hip hop, and keep your eyes peeled for the Biz Markie Cereal box!

In case you missed it (and you probably did because The Daily Pennsylvanian has only 4,800 likes on Facebook), Penn’s student paper uploaded this video to their Youtube channel in an attempt to #beatharvard on social media. If you’re too lazy to click or simply don’t feel like its worth 30 seconds of your life, here’s a straightforward breakdown of essentially the entire video:
The Daily Pennsylvanian posed the question “Why is Penn better than Harvard?” to several Penn students, and this is what they came up with:
“Because our mascot is better than a color.”And I guess nothing initiates a real social media battle quite like a pacifist. Fight On Quakers!!!
“Because John Legend was in my A Cappella group.”Notable Alumni? Challenge Accepted. Let’s see… John Adams, John Quincy Adams, John F. Kennedy, John Roberts… you know what, this is getting awkward. Let’s just stop at the Johns.
“Fling is better than Yard Fest.”Yep, might have to concede this one.
“We have awesome performing arts groups.”Ok.
“We go green at Penn.”I’m not sure if these blanket statements were meant as challenges to Harvard or should have ended up in the Penn admissions video instead? Honestly. Idk.
“WE GO TO PENN!”Yes. Yes you do. But how that’s an answer to “Why is Penn Better than Harvard?” I will never know.
The DP’s #beatharvard campaign video closes with the outright claim that Penn already “beats [Harvard] in the classroom” and “on the field,” and now they’re going to beat us “on Social Media…”
Are they? The Crimson is up by around 14k likes and 12k twitter followers. Sorry DP, but do you see that scoreboard? Well, look at your points.
