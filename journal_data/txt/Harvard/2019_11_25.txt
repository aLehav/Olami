After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Charming, introspective, and as ambitious as its two spiritual leaders, Fernando Meirelles’ “The Two Popes” takes a look behind the charismatic papacy of Pope Francis (born Jorge Mario Bergoglio) and his humble rise from Argentine priest to sovereign of the Holy See. Meirelles buoys his enlightened film with witty dialogue and magnetic performances from Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins in their titular roles, even though the impact of such thoughtful conversations are sometimes undermined by overbearing editing.
The film follows the historic transition between the two popes — from the erudite Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), who embodies the stiff conservatism that enveloped the Catholic faith in the wake of Pope John Paul II, to the energetic Bergoglio, who recognized the exigency for religious reform. “The Two Popes” soars when it focuses on this central relationship: At times, it’s largely strenuous (as one would expect from two men with such diametrically opposed ideals), but their exchanges gradually change from blatant disagreements to thoughtful meditations on forgiveness, guilt, sin, and friendship.
Jonathan Pryce disappears into the role as Pope Francis, slipping between foreign tongues from Spanish to Latin with apparent ease. Hopkins doesn’t fare as well in that regard; the legendary thespian sounds predictably English, which is unnervingly obvious considering Ratzinger's thick German accent. However, both Pryce and Hopkins play their respective roles with an uncanny physicality; Pryce with an earnest charisma and Hopkins teetering with old age (despite having a drastically different body build from the diminutive Ratzinger).
Meirelles cleverly allows audiences to understand the context of the acutely religious drama. All viewers, regardless of religious leaning, will be able to understand the film’s central conflicts: the old versus the new; immovable tradition versus inevitable change; the silence of prayer versus the potency of faith. These conflicts are shown, not told. We see Ratzinger enjoying his grandiose summer home on the Italian countryside as Bergoglio rejects the bishop’s palace in Argentina. Ratzinger is committed to following papal traditions, down to wearing the red papal shoes, while Bergoglio rejects these norms. And Ratzinger locks himself in his study to contemplate theology while Bergoglio spends time with the people in his parish.
One way Meirelles signifies the inevitability of change, one of the major themes of his film, is the dissonance between the steeped tradition of religion and the threat of modern technology. Riding in a helicopter makes it difficult for the two popes to converse. Ratzinger has a medical device that inconveniently beeps and interrupts his conversation with Bergoglio. There’s a clear disconnect between the intricate oil paintings in the Vatican, which drip with romanticized melodrama, with the blocky, depersonalized television that inhabits the same room. However, these technological advances mean that the popes can travel with urgency. It means that Ratzinger can care for his health. And it means that Bergoglio can watch his dear football games. Meirelles' takeaway seems to be that change is welcome, even if it can be uncomfortable.
Much of “The Two Popes” is also impeccably shot by cinematographer César Charlone. Whenever Meirelles presents a wide shot, it’s a breathtaking gift: From the pristine paintings of the Sistine Chapel to the imposing marble columns of St. Peter’s Basilica, the immersive tracking shots imbue the interiors with a dizzying grandeur. The production design of “The Two Popes” in these scenes is undeniably incredible — enough to convince audiences that the film was shot on location ("The Two Popes" was filmed at Cinecittà Studios in Rome and received no assistance from the Catholic Church).
Unfortunately, “The Two Popes” is not without its missteps. Just as he did in his earlier directorial efforts “City of God” and “The Constant Gardener,” Meirelles incorporates elements of crime and thriller in “The Two Popes.” There’s a backstory of corruption, oppression, and political turmoil in Bergoglio’s home-country, and while that adds an unexpected layer of thriller elements to the film, “The Two Popes” would have done better without its extended detour into Argentinian politics: It's a jarring interruption of the film's otherwise careful introspection. In these flashback sequences, the cinematography also takes a turn towards dull shades of sepia and grey, complete with bland lighting and uninspired production design. It's clear that Meirelles aimed to visualize the contrast between the uncertainty of Bergoglio's past and his shining future, but these flashback scenes look unforgivably amateurish for a film of this magnitude; it feels like a made-for-TV docudrama doomed with a pitiful budget.
The best film editing should be inconspicuous; it dissolves behind the screen but guides mood and story. That is the antithesis of some sequences in “The Two Popes.” The editing is invasive, and particularly evident when Meirelles uses a handheld camera when he tries to create a more intimate atmosphere between Bergogli and Ratzinger. The uncomfortable zooms and off-centered camera angles interrupt the crackling chemistry between Hopkins and Pryce, ultimately keeping audiences from fully realizing the profound spiritual experience that "The Two Popes" offers.
“The Two Popes” is a stunning thematic achievement in building bridges; it’s unabashedly politically charged (and unmistakably pro-Francis), but Meirelles’ film does what it sets out to do well. Even though it has a clear agenda, there is an abundance of thoughtful, constructive conversations in "The Two Popes" that more than overcome the inconsistencies in the plot and the over-editing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard case was widely seen as a testing ground for the American concept of equal opportunity, and the American principles of justice and fairness therein. By ruling in favor of Harvard and its race-conscious admissions policies, Judge Allison D. Burroughs and our legal system seem to have emphatically affirmed these principles.
But if the meritocracy is working, why does it still feel as if the system is not? The tensions surfacing in the SFFA lawsuit are merely part of a larger frustration with the role of college admissions in our society. To many people, the justice proclaimed in the verdict feels illusory.
The disconnect lies in a cultural confusion of the notions of fairness and merit.
In a meritocracy, power and privilege are awarded on the basis of performance and ability. But performance and ability are always qualified by a predetermined set of goals. A doctor merits a role as a doctor because she can effectively advance the goal of health, and a quarterback earns a starting position because he can effectively advance the football down the field.
In college admissions, Harvard’s predetermined goals can be read off its mission statement: to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society...through our commitment to the transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education.” An applicant merits admission based on their ability to advance these goals — for instance, through their race as it pertains to Harvard’s interest in developing a diverse learning environment.
Harvard’s admissions process asks whether an applicant will further its educational goals. It does not ask, at a more basic level, if students deserve admission in the sense of whether or not, given their inherited circumstances, they have made the most of the hand they were dealt. The justice promoted by a meritocracy is only in service of the ends for which the meritocracy works.
Colleges in one sense work towards their own educational aims. Yet as hall passes to the upper echelons of the job market, colleges, including Harvard, also work for the implicit aims of our society. A Harvard acceptance signals merit for the role of a Harvard student, but will also be the first thing on the resume of every student here for the rest of their life.
Thus colleges are unwilling mediators in the translation of natal luck into future well-being. Through the admissions process, differences caused by social and natural luck are solidified into significant social stratifications. Your parents’ income and education, along with your race and your legacy status, will play major causal roles in determining whether or not you get into Harvard. So will your genetic aptitude, athletic ability, and inherited personality traits.
If we are to take the concerns manifested in the SFFA lawsuit seriously (distancing these concerns, for a moment, from institutional concerns with SFFA itself), we need to take another look at college admissions not under the limiting gaze of meritocracy, but under the more comprehensive focus of fairness. Something is wrong with a system, meritocratic or otherwise, where we funnel 18 year old kids into different walks of life largely on the basis of innumerable factors out of their control.
How do we approach this broken system? For a start, we can dramatically reduce the differences in social luck over the first 18 years of children’s lives. We can prioritize closing the gap between public and private education so that less privileged upbringings do not render applicants less deserving of higher education. We can listen to the mounting body of research suggesting the importance of early child care and make it more accessible and effective. We can support higher education institutions moving away from legacy admissions. We can continue to identify and remedy racial injustices throughout society.
We also need to remove colleges from their current role as gatekeepers of economic mobility. For one, this isn’t even efficient. Many jobs don’t require a liberal arts education. Bolstering the prevalence of vocational schools and other career-preparatory programs would direct traffic to the job market in a way that more efficiently selects and prepares people for their future roles. Alongside better policies on income inequality, it would also go a long way towards restoring fairness in our system. People would feel like they could find some career calling that both highlights their personal strengths and provides them with a decent standard of living — so that, no matter their natural born abilities, they would have ample opportunities to make the most, or least, of those circumstances as they could. The mania of college admissions and all the pressure on students therein would also dissolve.
The word “meritocracy” was originally used to describe a dystopian society based on the ideals of rewarding intelligence and ability, where power and privilege end up concentrated in the hands of a meritorious elite. It’s time we stop limiting ourselves to thinking about how we can purify such a system and start working to create a just and fair one instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am an Asian American by virtue of being Asian and being born and raised in America. I make this clarification because in certain circles, this identity is not as neutral as it may sound. No, some would have you believe that existing as an Asian American is inherently political — and only a certain type of ultra-progressive political at that.
In today’s climate, that rhetoric probably doesn’t sound too unrealistic, but here’s the latest evidence: “An Open Letter to the Asian American Community,” written by members of some Asian affinity groups at Harvard to condemn other Asian affinity groups for not co-sponsoring a walkout in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
This letter expressed more general grievances than just the DACA walkout, though. It is the latest attempt by supposedly enlightened Asian Americans to dictate to other Asian Americans what they should think, say, and do.
At the very least these writers are acknowledging the fact, not acknowledged enough, that cultural groups are not monoliths. But if you expect them to bring this up to celebrate the diversity in Asian America, you’d be wrong. No, they’re lamenting the actual diversity. They wish that Asian Americans could form a monolith in their image of an inherently political community with an extremely left-wing agenda.
Forgive me for wanting a way out.
The movement’s big gotcha argument is that the political origins of the term “Asian American” necessitate an extremely left-wing advocacy and ideology. But I think you can acknowledge the term’s history and agree with many of the causes originally championed without jumping to the same conclusion. I, for example, am just using “Asian American” because it literally describes me. If there were a logical alternative, I would almost happily use it to shut down this line of argument — but, of course, I would find being pushed out of using “Asian American” completely ridiculous. Nevertheless, the underlying problem here isn’t the label; it’s the broader argument about the intersection of politics and culture.
The letter declares, “An apolitical cultural community is a pernicious lie.” I’m not even a member of any cultural community at Harvard, but I will stand up for the right of hypothetical cultural communities to exist without needing to wade into other matters. One could call it naïve to try to create such a social community. But that’s the problem with too many tribes today, on all sides of the spectrum. They don’t even try.
Sure, I can see why such a community might not be appealing to everyone. But at least let other people make that choice for themselves. I still believe — and in a time as divided as this, I feel I must believe, to have hope about a way out — that trying to create a social community that can overcome political differences is not a futile or unworthy ideal.
The letter also tries to assure other Asian Americans, “We are not asking you to become the ‘wokest’ in the room or for you to unconditionally defend every leftist agenda.” Yet without accepting the ideology of “the woke,” you will not be able to comprehend the letter. Consider this sentence: “It is literally impossible to live as a person of color on the stolen land that is the United States without either being political or being politically instrumentalized by oppressive structures.”
Phrases like “politically instrumentalized by oppressive structures” make no sense to people outside the wokest circles. By the way, don’t let the claims fool you — they’re not facts, they’re ideologies.
It’s one thing to try to make people more politically aware. That’s the admirable and necessary work that the student-run Harvard Votes Challenge is doing, for example, by registering people to vote no matter their political affiliation. But from their language, these Asian American proselytizers who claim to want to bring about my political awakening wouldn’t be happy if I were awakened to a different ideology. There’s only one correct epiphany — that of these enlightened Asian Americans who learned to cast off the chains of the oppressors and overcome the brainwashing to which our white-loving forebears so easily succumbed.
The wokest groups claim to make the safest spaces. I don’t doubt it, but I wonder at what price that safety comes. These groups become “safe” by artificially excluding other viewpoints, and sometimes whole topics of debate, from “acceptable” discourse — viewpoints and topics that are certainly discussed and embraced elsewhere. And these groups can talk a big game about being inclusive, but get on their bad side and then talk is cheap.
Here’s the fundamental disconnect. You’d think in this new world, with more attention rightfully given to diversity and inclusivity, we’d all be emphasizing our individuality and celebrating our differences. So why are groupthink and the desire for a monolithic community so desirable? College is the time to figure ourselves out, but why are so many people convinced they’ve already got it all figured out?
They might say the answers are obvious and that the mere fact of one’s existence as something ostensibly neutral as an “Asian American” is so political it necessitates that one thinks, says, and does certain things.
Don’t believe it. The answers aren’t obvious. There isn’t just one way to be anything. To use the language of the woke nowadays, reclaim your identity. It is, after all, yours.

At this year’s edition of The Game, hundreds of protesters flooded the field during halftime to demand both universities divest from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt. The protests began with a small number of demonstrators walking onto the field, but soon hundreds of spectators joined them, causing a game delay of nearly an hour.
We commend our peers that both participated in and helped organize the protest. At its best, protest challenges the status quo, drawing increased attention to injustice. Protest, in that sense, is meant to be disruptive. By that metric, this protest was highly effective.
We appreciate the planning and investment that Divest Harvard and Fossil Fuel Yale have put into the fossil fuel divestment movement at large and here specifically. To students who participated in divestment activism for the first time, we encourage you to follow up on this protest with further efforts towards important change on your respective campuses.
We’ve expressed our support in the past for divesting from fossil fuels, and we are supportive of these protests as part of an effort to achieve that goal. We also want to recognize the risk, passion, and labor of those protesting for divestment of Puerto Rican debt. We have previously made it clear that the standard for divestment from a particular set of funds should be extremely high. That said, these activists have done enormous work toward raising awareness around the issue of Puerto Rican debt investment. As we have opined in the past, divestment as a symbolic statement of principles matters, and these protesters have made a powerful claim for public attention.
Some in the stadium booed the protesters for holding up the game, and officials called for protesters to leave the field out of respect for the athletes. We emphatically disagree with claims that the protests constituted an act of disrespect for the players. We recognize that this protest impacted The Game, and we recognize and respect the impressive effort student athletes put into preparing for it. However, we do not think a recognition of their effort is inconsistent with supporting broader calls for climate justice and divestment. Statements of support from members of both teams emphasize that this protest was not out of place but well-fit for the context and moment.
In fact, the timing and nature of this event exemplify the kind of disruptive protest that will hopefully lead to meaningful institutional change. Noting Harvard’s seeming indifference to forms of protest it could easily ignore, we called for further discussion as to what sorts of protest might be be more impactful without risking the silencing of other groups or events. A demonstration of admirable strategic thinking, the protest at the Game appears to have accomplished just that. We are hopeful that Divest’s important work will continue, and, ultimately, win out.

The Harvard Divinity School announced earlier this fall that, in an effort to improve financial support for low-income students, all donations to the Divinity School Fund in fiscal year 2020 will go toward strengthening the school’s financial aid program.
Additionally, the Divinity School restructured its financial aid program beginning this academic year to cover more of students’ tuition overall, said Timothy Whelsky, the Divinity School associate dean for Student Enrollment and Services. The minimum amount of need-based financial aid provided to students was increased from 50 to 75 percent of tuition.
To increase the amount of need-based aid available, the Divinity School has decided to decrease the amount of merit-based scholarships it offers annually.
“We’re offering more need-based packages, proportionally to merit packages, than there were previously,” Whelsky said.
Whereas merit-based aid used to make up approximately 20 percent of scholarships, it now makes up closer to 10 percent.
The revamped financial aid program has also allowed the Divinity School to provide living stipends to students on need-based financial aid; previously stipends were only provided in the merit-based program, Whelsky said.
The decision to restructure financial aid packages and to use all donations to improve the Divinity School’s financial aid program comes after more than two years of research and discussions.
“We had a town hall with students two years ago, where we discussed financial need amongst students,” Whelsky explained. “I think we got affirmation that we needed to take a new look at our programs and modernize them.”
At the town hall, Divinity School students — roughly 90 percent of whom receive some sort of scholarship — shared concerns about living costs and tuition. Living expenses are especially high in and near Cambridge, and the Divinity School estimates total living costs for the 2019-2020 academic year to be $24,146.
The Divinity School’s own analysis, Whelsky said, found that costs of living and attendance were increasing, and as a result the school decided to place more emphasis on need-based financial aid.
Whelsky added that he believes the Divinity School is distinct in offering both merit- and need-based scholarships, but has had to grapple with how to distribute the available funds between the two.
“We have a merit-based program because other schools have merit-based programs,” Whelsky said. “And we have a need-based program because we need to [in order] to meet the needs of our students.”
Whelsky said he hopes the restructuring will help decrease students’ reliance on federal loans.
“One of the hopes was that we would reduce the debt burden of some of our most vulnerable students,” he said.

Harvard and its graduate students union could not reach agreements on compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedures during a bargaining session Friday, with just over a week remaining before the union plans to strike if no agreement is reached.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers brought a new compensation proposal to the table, while Harvard presented revised versions of its compensation and health benefits proposals. Neither side offered changes to their sexual harassment and discrimination grievance procedure proposal. The two committees did agree on one provision — job postings.
Under the agreement, the University would create a central website for open positions included in the bargaining unit. The postings would include the pay rate, expected work schedule, and disclose that the position is covered by HGSU’s contract.
The next bargaining session is scheduled for Tuesday and is the last scheduled bargaining session before the union’s Dec. 3 strike deadline. HGSU has vowed to initiate a strike if a contract is not reached by then. The union indicated it would strike indefinitely in a tweet last Wednesday.
In the meantime, the union has called for scheduling additional bargaining dates.
“We’re ready to bargain any time between now and December 3. It’s up to them to join us,” wrote union bargaining committee member Justin Bloesch in an email update to HGSU members.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on whether University negotiators would schedule additional bargaining sessions.
On Friday, HGSU also offered counterproposals on union security and tuition and fees, according to Bloesch. The union had not updated their proposals on their website as of Sunday evening.
Harvard’s updated compensation proposal — posted to a website devoted to union negotiations — clarified pay rates for student teaching fellows, but did not commit to increased pay compared to previous versions. The University also raised its pool funds supporting health insurance premiums, dental health plan, and child care by $25,000 each.
Ahead of the meeting, bargaining committee member Cole M. Meisenhelder wrote that others planned to attend to “pressure the administration to agree to a fair contract” in an email update to members last Wednesday.
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that roughly 30 union members attended the session Friday. The bargaining committee has 10 members.
“The University and HGSU continue to engage on the key issues that are the focus of these negotiations and we look forward to continued progress,” Swain wrote.
HGSU did not respond to a request for comment.
Before heading to Friday’s bargaining session, HGSU members also delivered letters from politicians supporting their cause to University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s office.
Among the letters was one from all 11 members of Massachusetts’ Democratic congressional delegation including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), as well as United States Representatives Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.), Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), and Seth W. Moulton ’01 (D-Mass.).
“We believe this strike would be detrimental to students, workers, and community members and we therefore urge you to engage in good faith effort to reach a fair agreement before the strike deadline,” they wrote. “Your decision to bargain has set Harvard apart from many other institutions of higher education, and we ask that you continue to set the bar by negotiating a first contract that will ensure fair treatment and strong workplace protections for workers, as well as uninterrupted education for your students.”
Bacow plans to respond to the letter, according to Swain.

The Undergraduate Council voted to launch pilot programs to provide free laundry detergent and postage stamps to students in the spring semester.
The UC will place 115 bottles of laundry detergent in the Stoughton Hall laundry room — which services five freshman dorms — over the course of the spring semester, according to the Council’s legislation. Representatives said they plan to track usage of the free laundry detergent and will use the data to gauge the potential for future expansion of the program.
Adams House Representative Alexa C. Jordan ’22; Quincy House Representative Phiroze K. Parasnis ’21; Crimson Yard Representative Janna E. Ramadan ’23; and Ivy Yard Representatives David Y. Zhang ’23, Pallas Chou ’23, and Chloe E. V. Koulefianou ’23 co-sponsored the legislation.
The UC received the bottles of ECOS laundry detergent from their manufacturer — Earth Friendly Products — for free, according to Ramadan.
Parasnis said the Council decided to launch the program in the Stoughton laundry room because of its central location on campus.
The UC also voted to allocate $400 to provide postage stamps to students starting in the spring. Undergraduates will be able to receive free stamps at the Harvard Yard Mail Center in the Science Center and some of the upperclassman House mail centers. Dunster House Representative Noah Harris ’22, who sponsored the legislation, said he estimates the funding will cover the costs of roughly 700 stamps and last several semesters.
Harris said he sponsored the legislation because sending mail is important for many activities, and stamps are not currently available at Harvard mail centers.
“Our country relies on stamps and the mailing of paper mail for the electoral as well as a lot of financial processes,” Harris said.
The UC also voted in favor of another bill sponsored by Harris, which prohibits students groups from spending UC funding on plastic foodware, including single-use plastic cutlery, cups, and plates.
Harris, who serves as chair of the UC’s finance committee, said the committee noticed that many student groups use funding to purchase plastic foodware, even though there are biodegradable alternatives available at a comparable price.
“We are doing this to be environmentally friendly and be the best possible stewards of this money that the University gives us,” Harris said.
The UC receives its money from the student activities fee that undergraduates pay annually. During the 2018-2019 academic year, the fee increased from $75 to $200, prompting more students to opt out.
Eliot House Representative Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 said that though she originally wrote the legislation, she now opposes it because she does not think the Council should tell students how to spend the funding.
“I don’t think that telling people not to buy plastic because we don’t trust them to dispose of it properly is our job,” Ganesh said. “They can make that choice on their own.”
Other representatives, including UC Treasurer Jack M. Swanson ’22, said the council’s finance committee is expressly charged with the task of deciding how to allocate student funding. Swanson noted that the committee’s guidelines prohibit the funding of alcohol, among other items.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Division of Continuing Education Huntington D. Lambert said in an interview Friday that he agrees with student complaints that degrees awarded by the Harvard Extension School should be rephrased to more accurately reflect students’ programs of study.
Currently, all degrees conferred at the school are said to be in “Extension Studies” rather than a student’s specific concentration. The Extension School grants Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies and Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies degrees.
Lambert said that these degree names are inaccurate and that he has previously spoken to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, about the issue. He said, however, that his efforts have thus far been unsuccessful. Lambert, who announced earlier this semester his plans to retire at the end of the calendar year, called on his successor to continue calling for this change.
“I told the Corporation that I believe our degree names are academically wrong, and that's the metric I look at. A different name might market better, but that's not really a factor for Harvard. The issue is, are the degree names academically right?” Lambert said.
“I would like to — and have supported all our efforts unsuccessfully — to make the degree names academically correct. And I hope whoever follows me succeeds in getting that done,” he added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on calls for the degree name change.
Extension School students have shared dissatisfaction with the degree names for years, protesting for a change outside University Hall in 2016. Many have claimed that “Extension Studies” does not reflect their academic work.
“It doesn’t sound like anything that makes sense,” said Michael A. Rosero, a former board member of the Harvard Extension Student Association. “What are you ‘extending’?”
Lambert echoed Rosero’s issue with the degree name.
“There is no such thing as ‘in Extension Studies’ in an academic definition, unless you’re a land grant school training people for the agricultural extension service,” he said. “We don’t do that.”
Sam D. Carroll, who has taken Extension School courses and is considering pursuing a degree, said the names diminished the work that students put into completing them. He said that while the degree programs are described as being in specific subjects, those distinctions are not reflected on degrees.
“When you get your diploma after two years of really hard work, including oftentimes being a full time employee somewhere while pursuing your studies, you get a degree that does not say, you know, ‘Master of Arts in Software Engineering, Harvard University’, or even Harvard Extension School,” Carroll said. “It says Master of Arts or ALM in Extension Studies.”
Carroll added, however, that “most people don't see the actual diploma on your wall,” so he believes there is more freedom in how it’s described to others.
According to the Extension School website, students may list degrees on their resumes as either “Bachelor [or Master] of Liberal Arts, Harvard University Extension School” or “Bachelor [or Master] of Liberal Arts, Extension Studies, Harvard University”.
But including the term “Extension” at all can negatively affect students’ professional pursuits, Rosero said.
“I do think it leads to more questions than needed on a person's resume, and it can be harmful,” he said.
Rosero said he knows peers who earned “a side eye” or were otherwise affected by having to pause job interviews and explain what “Extension” means. Beyond getting the Extension School degree names changed, he said he hopes there will eventually be an overall program name change to help distinguish admitted Extension School degree candidates from students “just taking classes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of academic, biotech, biopharma, and healthcare leaders at Harvard and across Massachusetts plan to create a new center for innovation and manufacturing next-generation medicines, according to a Monday press release.
The center, which is estimated to cost $50 million dollars, will be an independent non-profit located in the Greater Boston area. The board of directors of the new center includes leaders from Harvard, MIT, Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
Multiple area medical institutes — including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital — will also contribute, as will biotech company MilliporeSigma and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the press release that the collaboration embodies world-class expertise in multiple disciplines.
“We are privileged to be part of this collaborative initiative,” he said. “It will advance scientific discovery, reaffirm the region’s global leadership in the life sciences, and bring forward life-saving and life-changing therapies that will make a difference for people around the world.”
The center’s work will focus on cell manipulation, gene editing, and other therapies that use living cells as treatment, including CAR-T cell therapy — wherein a patient’s own T cells are modified to identify and attack cancer cells — and stem cell therapy. These technologies have applications in treating a variety of health issues, including type 1 diabetes and neurodegeneration.
The space will include an Innovation Center and a Manufacturing Center, designed to allow research that needs refinement and research ready to be scaled up to be  discussed in the same space.
Because biomanufacturing services tend to become backlogged, research and clinical trials requiring custom cells or viral vectors can face delays of up to 18 months. By housing both research and the production of raw materials in one facility, the center aims to ameliorate the biomanufacturing bottleneck and accelerate the development and introduction of new medications, according to the release.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 conceived the idea for the project more than two years ago and has helped guide it along since then, the release states.
“The broad question that we were trying to address was, ‘How can we best position our region to be preeminent in the life sciences in the decades to come?’” Garber said in the press release. “We have a vibrant life sciences community, with some of the world's greatest hospitals, universities, and life sciences companies of all kinds. We also have a strong financial sector that helps to spawn and support new companies.”
The Boston area has all of the elements needed to improve production, according to Garber.
“So the elements for rapid progress in the life sciences — particularly in the application of the life sciences to human health — are all here,” he said in the release. “But with such a rapid pace of innovation, it's easy to fall behind. We wanted to make sure that would not happen here.”
The center will be named in 2020. The team is hoping to complete the next phase of work — finding a location, designing the space, and hiring staff — in 2021 or 2022,  according to Harvard spokesperson Kevin Casey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just over a week until Harvard’s graduate student union is set to strike if no contract is agreed upon, both the University and the union bargaining committees have publicly released their contract proposals.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the University are set to hold their last scheduled bargaining session Tuesday before the union’s Dec. 3 strike deadline. Union voters overwhelmingly voted last month to authorize a strike and declared their deadline in early November.
While negotiations last Friday yielded a tentative agreement on job postings — adding to the 11 other tentative agreements reached so far — the two sides remain at an impasse over several key proposals.
After more than a year of negotiations, the two parties have yet to come to agreements on compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
In its most recently available compensation proposal, the union included greater salary and stipend increases for student workers than Harvard’s proposal. It also included an annual salary increase at a rate higher than what the University has proposed. At the most recent bargaining session, the union offered a new proposal that has not yet been released publicly.
A University website dedicated to student unionization states that the union has asked for an annual raise of four percent or the inflation rate, whichever is higher.
HGSU did not respond to a request for comment.
In the proposal currently available on the union’s website, its negotiators asked for a 4.25 percent annual wage increase for salaried research assistants and hourly workers, and a five percent increase for salaried teaching staff.
For all salaried research assistants, HGSU has proposed a minimum yearly salary that is eight percent higher than the current annual salary. Harvard’s proposal did not include business and other research assistants as categories.
Compensations for salaried or stipended teaching fellows are determined under different schemes in HGSU’s and Harvard’s proposals. HGSU has proposed that teaching fellow salaries per semester start from $8,143 to $9,819, depending on academic disciplines.
Hourly student workers, a category that includes undergraduate course assistants, would have a substantially higher minimum wage under HGSU’s proposal. Minimum wages in the union’s version would be raised to $28 to $34 per hour, depending on their academic discipline.
HGSU has proposed the opportunity for a third party grievance procedure in instances of sexual harassment and discrimimation. Sexual misconduct complaints are currently adjudicated through the University's Office for Dispute Resolution, which is guided by federal Title IX policy.
The union’s proposal would establish contractual protections against discrimination in a series of categories. In addition to the discriminatory behaviors defined in the University's proposal, the union included protections against discriminations based on HIV status or other medical status, prior conviction of a crime, and physical and mental disabilities. The proposal also demanded the University to “uphold its affirmative action policy.”
HGSU and Harvard, however, are at loggerheads over permitting student workers to resolve complaints regarding sexual harassment and discrimination using a grievance procedure, a dispute-resolution mechanism that can lead to a third-party arbitration common in many labor contracts.
If agreed upon, student workers would have another option aside from Harvard’s internal Title IX processes. The University, meanwhile, has maintained student workers use processes offered by Harvard’s internal offices, arguing possible legal barriers to adopting the union’s proposals.
HGSU’s proposal would not only permit complaints regarding sexual harassment and discrimination to be filed through the union’s grievance procedure, it created chances for “expedited processing” that would allow complainants to directly pursue a third-party arbitration.
At stake in the healthcare debate is the extent of coverage HGSU members would automatically receive under the contract. Negotiators have asked that eligible members would get full health, mental health, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage. Currently, the dental health insurance plan is optional, requiring students to opt-in and pay an extra fee.
Instead of including dental health in its plan, the University has offered a pool fund of $100,000 to support dental health plan premium payments.
The union has also asked that all coverage available to its members be extended to their dependents.
HGSU has proposed deeming all students who work more than 90 hours per semester — roughly seven hours per week — qualified for health benefits.
Some graduate students have said that limits on specialist visits and mental health care visits under the current Student Health Insurance Plan have forced them to make difficult decisions about their care and pay significant fees out of pocket.
Under the union’s proposed system, all such visits would be covered, as would gender affirmation treatments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven members of Harvard’s Class of 2020 have won the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship, the American and Canadian secretaries of the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
The seven Harvard students — five Americans and two Canadians — will join 100 Rhodes scholars from across the world to begin their studies at Oxford in October 2020.
Harvard College boasted the most American Rhodes recipients of any university, and tied with University of Calgary for the most Canadian recipients. 369 Harvard students have now been named American Rhodes Scholars since the award was established in 1902. This year, College students made up five of the 32 American winners and two of the 11 Canadian winners.
Though the Canadian Rhodes Trust has yet to publicly report this year’s winners, Canadian Rhodes Trust Secretary Richard Pan confirmed that Sai Shanthanand S. Rajagopal ’20 and Constance M. Bourguignon ’20 are among those selected.
American Secretary Elliot F. Gerson '74 called the scholarship “arguably the most famous academic award available to American college graduates” in a press release.
Lauren D. Spohn ’20 — one of the American recipients — said Oxford has long captured her imagination because of its history.
“I grew up an intense fan of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien and so Oxford is always sort of like existed in my imagination as like a magical home of the inklings,” Spohn said. “Oxford just seems like an amazing place to kind of take the next step.”
Spohn, an English concentrator with a secondary in History, said she plans to pursue a master’s in 19th century literature and another master’s in intellectual history at Oxford.
“These two years I'm really seeing as a chance to explore, and to just kind of dive in and see if academia is something that I can see myself going into,” she said.
American Rhodes Scholar Kristine E. Guillaume ’20 — who currently serves as President of The Crimson — said she also hopes studying in England will help her “refine” her research interests for an eventual career in academia.
“Studying at Oxford will allow me both a personal and professional space to sort of grow as an academic and grow as a writer, and as a storyteller,” Guillaume said.
Several of the recipients said they hope to expand upon the research they have pursued at Harvard across the Atlantic.
Rajagopal — a Biomedical Engineering and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies joint concentrator — said he was conducting interviews with transgender people in South India for this thesis when he realized he wanted to explore the topic further.
“I realized it was kind of outside the scope of my thesis to do an archival research project, where I would look more at the history of trans medicine and trans folks in South India and other parts of the Commonwealth,” Rajagopal said.
He said access to archives in London and instruction at Oxford will allow him to explore the topic further as he pursues a D.Phil. there, the Oxford equivalent of a Ph.D.
American recipient Luke G. Melas-Kyriazi ’20, a Mathematics and Computer Science joint concentrator, said he plans to continue his machine learning research at Oxford.
“Going to Oxford and doing machine learning research, they have an incredibly strong group that I'm, you know, I feel really lucky to be joining,” Melas-Kyriazi said.
Neil B. Band ’20 — another American Rhodes scholar — said he hopes his education at Oxford will help him solve the “problem of drug discovery.” A Computer Science concentrator with a secondary in Economics, Band hopes to develop algorithms and virtual representations of molecules that will speed up the process of developing medicines.
Several of the recipients said they appreciate the support of friends, family, and fellowships tutors in their Houses.
“I really want to stress that like this takes a sea of people and that I am so, so fortunate to have been so well-supported,” recipient Olivia J. McGinnis ’20 said. “Being in my house and the dining hall workers and everybody who's in there, the staff that like, keep our dorms, like clean and safe and warm and like give me the time to focus on my academics, like everybody is a part of this.”
A complete list of the Canadian and American recipients is below:
Neil B. Band ’20
Constance M. Bourguignon ’20
Kristine E. Guillaume ’20
Olivia J. McGinnis ’20
Luke G. Melas-Kyriazi ’20
Sai Shanthanand S. Rajagopal ’20
Lauren D. Spohn ’20
Correction: Nov. 30, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the "D.Phil." as the British abbreviation for a Ph.D. In fact, it is the Oxford abbreviation for a Ph.D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of an impending strike and more than a year into contract negotiations with its graduate students union, Harvard and its graduate student union released the proposals they have put forward in bargaining sessions.
The publication of the University’s proposals — including items relating to compensation, health insurance, and grievance procedure — came ahead of the union’s Dec. 3 strike deadline. Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers overwhelmingly approved its strike authorization vote in October, with more than 90 percent of voters in favor of authorizing a strike. A strike would mean possible stoppage in student workers’ teaching, grading, discussion sections, and office hours. In the event of a strike, student research assistants may also withhold some work hours.
After 27 bargaining sessions between the University and the union, the two sides have successfully reached 12 tentative agreements on issues including international student worker rights, intellectual property, and workplace and materials.
Despite the agreements, the University and the union remain at loggerheads over economic proposals like child care, health insurance premiums, and student salaries. They are also at an impasse over the union’s proposal to give student workers an option to raise sexual harassment and discrimination complaints through a grievance procedure separate from current University processes, which could ultimately lead to third-party arbitration.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the proposals were posted alongside other information the University is releasing “in preparation” for a potential strike.
“The University views an HGSU-UAW strike as unwarranted, and believes that it is important that the community has the opportunity to see the substantive proposals the University has put forward in these ongoing negotiations,” Swain wrote.
HGSU released some of its own proposed articles Wednesday. The union did not respond to a request for comment.
The two sides most recently came to a tentative agreement on job postings during a bargaining session Friday. Under the provision, Harvard would create a central website to publish open positions represented by HGSU.
The University and the union have one more scheduled negotiating session Tuesday before the strike deadline.
Under the University’s compensation proposal, salaried student research assistants in the Sciences would receive a three percent salary increase this year, and two 2.5 percent salary increases over the next two years, while salaried teaching fellows would receive a two percent salary increase this year, and two 2.5 percent salary increases in the next two years.
Hourly student research assistants and teaching staff are promised an hourly minimum wage of 15 dollars and 17 dollars, respectively, upon ratification of the contract. The minimum wage levels will be raised 2.5 percent each for the next two years.
Swain has claimed that Harvard’s compensation proposal is in line with contracts negotiated at other universities.
The union described the University’s proposals as inadequate. In a bargaining update posted after an August bargaining session, where compensation proposals were discussed, HGSU’s bargaining committee wrote that the proposed increases were “meager,” and lag behind peer institutions.
Whether complaints regarding sexual harassment and discrimination can be addressed through an original grievance procedure outlined in the contract remains a central issue of negotiations between HGSU and the University. The union has demanded that student workers be given an option to raise such complaints through their suggested grievance procedure — a dispute resolution mechanism outside of current internal Harvard channels, and one that could eventually lead to third-party arbitration in some cases.
The University, on the other hand, has insisted that these complaints be handled through Title IX complaints and its Office for Dispute Resolution, and through internal discirmination procedures.
In an interview earlier this month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow argued that that issues could result from a process that operates outside of Harvard’s formal processes.
“We cannot have two different procedures on campus, I think, for dealing with Title IX complaints, depending upon a student's status in a particular moment in time,” Bacow said. “What they proposed is problematic in a number of different dimensions, and so we're trying to explain why we think that doesn't work, given our legal obligations under Title IX.”
The University has instead offered the union seats on its Title IX Policy Review Advisory Committee within the first three months of the contract’s ratification. It has also offered to create two additional working groups to recommend policies for non-sex-based discirmination and misconduct that is serious but does not rise to the level of a formal policy violation.
The University has offered pool funds to support union members’ health insurance and dental health plan premium payments. According to the University's proposal, the union would be in charge of designing the mechanism to distribute these funds.
After increasing the amount of money in the health insurance premium fund and dental health plan support funds by $25,000 and $10,000 respectively in a Nov. 15 proposal, the University added another $25,000 to each fund in an updated proposal Friday.
The University also increased its offer for a child care fund for student workers twice, raising the size of the child care fund it proposed by $25,000 two times to a current total of $300,000. In previous bargaining updates, union bargaining committee members had called the additional funds “marginal.”
“They made marginal changes with token dollar amount increases to their child care benefits, health and dental benefits, and emergency grants proposals—but the administration’s counter-proposals barely offset the costs that student workers face,” HGSU bargaining committee member Lee Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in a November update.
The University has proposed that student workers be allowed to choose whether they join the union or not — a system known as an “open shop” arrangement that has been fiercely criticized by members of HGSU's bargaining committee.
HGSU, on the other hand, has proposed an “agency shop” arrangement by including a provision typically known as “union security clause.” Such a clause would require student workers to pay dues to cover bargaining costs if they chose not to pay union membership dues.
The University does not have open shop arrangements with any of its other unions. Carrie E. Barbash — who serves as president of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, Harvard’s largest union — said in a February interview that she is strongly opposed to an open shop arrangement.

While Boston may be a short T ride away, the omnipresent Harvard bubble is rarely popped. For those few times throughout the school year when you have the opportunity to go home, you definitely need to make the most of it. So if you’re heading home for Thanksgiving, what should you bring back with you?
Winter Clothes
While many students will only be on campus for a few more weeks after Thanksgiving before leaving again for winter break, there’s no underestimating what damage the Boston winter can do in that short period of time (and in the “spring” semester!). Be sure to swap out that summer wardrobe with more fitting winter attire like scarves, sweaters, parkas, hats, and gloves. Though Remy and the Harvard turkeys are seemingly immune to the cold, you most certainly are not. Layer up!
Gifts for Friends
Don’t let your post-Thanksgiving blues distract you from the fact that it’s finally the holiday season! While you’re home, consider taking the time to prepare something thoughtful for the people that have made this past semester that much better. You likely won’t have the time once your gcal becomes packed with detailed study schedules, so jump on those Black Friday deals to check this off your to-do list now.
Thanksgiving Leftovers
Sure, HUDS has made efforts to step up its game in terms of menu variety and creativity, but nothing beats home-cooked meals or Thanksgiving leftovers. Be sure to invest in some sturdy tupperware — and maybe a bigger suitcase — to maximize your food packing abilities. If you’re going to be suffering during finals season, you might as well have some of your mom’s homemade dumplings to keep you company.
Your Sanity
Those few days of Thanksgiving break are sure to fly by, and when you come back you’ll be diving headfirst into the reading period. Make sure you really take that time to relax with your loved ones and recharge while you can. If not, Primal Scream is always an option to release that pent-up tension from the semester before you take up permanent residence in Lamont.
Regardless of whether or not you’re going home during Thanksgiving break, treat yourself to some well-deserved down time and an abundance of good food. Just a few more weeks, and then you’ll be on your way home for winter break faster than you can say “pass the stuffing”.

The 136th edition of The Game, the annual football game between Harvard and Yale, was interrupted and delayed after a protest began on the field during the last three minutes of half-time. Hundreds of protestors flooded onto the field to call on Harvard and Yale to divest their endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt. The protest lasted about half-an-hour, and game play was delayed by 48 minutes. Some protesters who refused to leave were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.


The protest began when a group of students from Harvard and Yale’s divestment organizations ran onto the field holding signs with three minutes left of half-time. They sat down in the middle of the field and began chanting, calling on Harvard and Yale to divest. Some activists stood up in the stands holding banners as well.


Protesters on the field held banners reading “This is an Emergency,” “Yale and Harvard Students United in Climate Justice,” and “Nobody Wins:Yale & Harvard Are Complicit in Climate Injustice.” The protesters called directly on Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Yale University President Peter Salovey with a “Presidents Bacow and Salovey:Our Future Demands Action Now” banner. Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the University does not believe divestment is the best way to confront the "global challenge" of climate change. Yale spokesperson Karen N. Pert wrote in an emailed statement that though Yale supports the right to free expression, they do not allow disruption of university events.


As the protest continued, spectators from the stands began running onto the field to join the demonstration.


Hundreds of students joined the protest on the field of the Yale Bowl. Officials made announcements over the loud speakers throughout the protest calling on the activists to return to the stands out of respect for players.


About 10 minutes after spectators began leaving the stands en-masse, a large number of police approached the crowd, leading most people to leave the center of the field.
Some activists refused to leave the field despite calls from University officials, the Yale Police Department, and the New Haven Police Department. Ronnell Higgins, Yale University’s Chief of Police and Director of Public Safety told protesters “Help us help you. I can only do that if you exit the field right now. You’ve made your point.” Harvard College Dean Khurana told protesters “You're not alone on this. We have to, though, create a courtesy for other students — your peers who are playing today.”


Connecticut Governor Edward Miner Lamont Jr. ’76 was among the officials who went down to the field.


Police confronted Harvard protester Andrés de Loera-Brust '20. Police officers began physically moving protesters who refused to leave the field.


Police then escorted protesters off the field and took them outside the stadium. According to Yale spokesperson Karen Peart, 42 protesters were issued misdemeanor summons for disorderly conduct.


The Harvard and Yale Football teams returned to the field to warm up as the last protesters were escorted away. Yale went on to win the game 50-43 in overtime as the sun went down.
