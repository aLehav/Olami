After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beyond Harvard senior Abdullah Bannan’s lightweight crew career exists an awe-inspiring story: one that demonstrates his resilience and strong desire to help others.
Growing up in Aleppo, Syria, Bannan’s childhood was altered by his country’s Civil War. Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, was the center of a major military conflict between the government and numerous Sunni opposition rebel groups. The conflict began when Bannan was entering seventh grade, and he recalled hearing about “people protesting and children being kidnapped by the government.” Citizens were drafted by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime to join the Syrian Armed Forces and its numerous allies, but many soon defected and joined the Free Syrian Army, a breakaway branch of the army that was formed in 2011 with the intention of overthrowing Assad.
The seventh grader’s world changed when fighting broke out in Aleppo on July 19, 2012. Bannan’s father, in hopes of preventing the government from completely taking over, was determined to remain in the city. But, the bombings destroyed Bannan’s home, and he was forced to evacuate.
“I think it’s ridiculous for me to talk about it in the past like it’s over,” Bannan wrote in an email. “I don’t know if it’s the age by which I experienced it, or the duration of that experience, but it remains a huge part of who I am and it is something that comes up in my mind at least 5 times a day.”
Despite the difficulties he and his family faced, Bannan found inspiration in a Class Day address delivered by Sarah Abushaar ’14, titled “The Harvard Spring.”
“I knew nothing at that point, but I just knew that I wanted to do my absolute best to change whatever was in my power to change,” Bannan wrote. “However, as the years passed, it was obvious that anything I would want to do would be limited under the political climate, so I wanted an education that would allow me the chance to make real change.”
Bannan pursued biology, which he first became interested in while attending the Al-Bassel High School for Outstanding Students, a government-run institution for gifted students, founded by the Syrian Ministry of Education in 1998.
“I first got into biology and chemistry when I participated in the National Biology Olympiad in high school and got to experience concepts on a deeper level through classes at the local university,” he wrote. “[I] then ended up competing and winning in the International Biology Olympiad which really showed me how passion can go a long way even under difficult circumstances.”
Following in Abushaar’s footsteps, Bannan went on to study Chemical and Physical Biology at Harvard. However, the journey to get to Cambridge was difficult.
“We couldn’t pay for the standardized tests ourselves from within Syria due to economic sanctions,” he explained. “There were basically no resources, and we all do high school in Arabic.”
During his application process, Bannan heard about the Syrian Youth Empowerment Initiative through one of his friends. Founded in 2015 by George Batah and Majed Abdulsamad, SYE is a program that pays for standardized test fees, provides resources for preparation, and pairs Syrian high school students with mentors that guide them through the college application process. Today, Bannan serves as an active mentor for the organization.
It wasn’t until he arrived at Harvard that Bannan pursued his lifelong interest in rowing, which he had never tried in Syria.
“I grew up watching the Olympics with my family, and we would always watch gymnastics, swimming, and rowing,” Bannan wrote. “I was always fascinated by the sport being the right combination of strength and cardio.”
Halfway through his sophomore year, Bannan reached out to Harvard’s rowing coaches to ask if he could walk onto the team. However, owing to his relative inexperience in the sport, he had multiple intensive one-on-one sessions with the lightweight coaches to keep him up to speed with the rest of the squad.
“Abdullah’s story is unlike any other,” said his teammate, sophomore Brahm Erdmann. “He’s certainly taken the path less traveled to become a Harvard rower — which, ironically, makes him a typical member of our team: he took an opportunity and ran. That’s what Harvard varsity lightweight crew is all about.”
Despite his late start, Bannan has had many impressive accomplishments in his rowing career, one of which came during a race against Navy in the Haines Cup, which took place on the Severn River in Annapolis, Md. on Apr. 23, 2021.
In this race, Bannan was “stroking” the boat, which meant he had to sit closest to the stern of the boat and set the stroke rate and rhythm for the crew to follow. The stroker plays a critical role during the race, as this rate can determine whether a boat wins or loses a race.
Bannan recalled that, during the race, he was nervous.
“I was in a very disparate state as we stopped seeing the other two Navy boat[s],” he wrote. “But then one of my teammates called out my name from the back, which kind of snapped me back to reality and reminded me of the seven other rowers behind me, all having my back, all putting in their best work to move the boat.”
The team ended up finishing second by 11.3 seconds, tying with Navy’s fifth varsity squad in 6:41.3.
“It was the support of being surrounded by 30 other teammates cheering for you, while everyone was pushing themselves to the absolute limits of their heart rates and lung capacity,” Bannan noted of the race.
Another challenge Bannan overcame in his rowing career was his 2K test. Similar to the mile running test, the 2K rowing test assesses rowers’ endurance, output, and resilience. However, a week before his scheduled 2K, Bannan contracted Covid-19, so he could not train with the rest of the team.
“This really stressed me out, because we had been building up fitness over the weeks leading to the test and the coaches had put together very precise plans for each of us to perform well on this test,” he wrote.
However, determined to stay on track, he cycled in the basement of Dunster House with his mask on, managing to achieve a personal record.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, Harvard women’s volleyball returned from a successful New York road trip with two more wins under its belt against Cornell and Columbia, starting off the final three weeks of its 2022 season strong. While the Crimson had a slow start to this year’s season, with this weekend marking its first back-to-back wins, senior captain Bella Almanza is hopeful for the team’s future in the upcoming conference matches.
Saturday’s match against Columbia (4-12, 1-6 Ivy League)  started off shaky, leaving the Crimson (4-11, 3-4)  playing a strategic game of catch up to overcome Columbia’s six point lead. Almanza set the tone for the rest of the game within the first rally, earning the first point for the Crimson with an ace (one of two for the rising senior). Harvard soon clawed its way to a comeback, tying the score at 22 before ultimately crossing the 25-point finish line first with Columbia hot on their heels, just two points behind. Almanza’s ace was the first of many for the Crimson.
“Coming into these Cornell and Columbia games, we emphasized having a really strong week of practice, working on being a consistent team, making sure we’re doing our jobs, holding each other accountable, and keeping our energy level consistent rather than being up and down, and I think that helped us during these games to keep our composure,” Almanza said.
Almanza’s teammates soon followed her lead, with junior hitter Olivia Cooper and sophomore libero Lindsay Zhang scoring an ace each while rising sophomore libero Teia Piette scored a career-high of four aces in the first set, simultaneously breaking her past record and scoring half of Harvard’s aces throughout the entire match.
“Going into Cornell and Columbia, we knew these were must win matches for us to keep us in contention for the tournament,” said Cooper, another standout from both games this weekend who recorded 11 kills against the Lions. “We came in with a new intensity and worked really hard all week to come out as our best. We’ve had a bunch of injuries, so our lineup was shifting around even coming into Friday, and I’m really proud of the grit and determination we showed this weekend to pull out these two wins against formidable teams.”
The Crimson and Lions were neck-and-neck throughout the second set, which featured six lead changes before Harvard pulled ahead and finalized a 25-22 scoreline.
“Brown, Yale, and Princeton — we all faced early on in the season, and those are three big teams in the Ivy League, so we knew those were going to be tough matches,” said Almanza when asked what the team did differently between the last three games and the ones against the Big Red and the Lions. “After them, going into the Cornell-Columbia weekend, we had a fire lit under us and knew we had to hunker down and focus in to get business done and to make the tournament. So I’m really proud of us for having a good week of practice and getting the job done this past weekend.”
Columbia, in an attempt to defend its home turf, managed a seven point lead to wrap up the third set, 25-18, before Harvard ultimately emerged victorious, taking both the fourth set, 29-27,  and the match. Harvard’s kill streak was spread across multiple players, with four women notching ten or more kills. First-year hitter Brynne Faltinsky matched her record from Friday’s game against Cornell with thirteen before promptly being named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week that following Monday.
“[Faltinsky] stepped up in a big way, both on serve receive and offense," Cooper said. "Our passing and serving this weekend is what allowed us to have this success, and I’m just so proud of this team!”
Faltinsky’s kill points were followed by Almanza and Cooper, who each scored 11, and junior hitter Katie Vorhies added ten.
“I think we’ve also been very motivated by the saying, play for each other,” Cooper said following the win. “Even when we were tired, we made it a goal to push through and play for each other, which I really think lends to our team culture.”
Both Almanza and Cooper mentioned the importance of team chemistry in the success of this past weekend.
“We all genuinely love each other, I think other people see it, the coaches have seen it, the chemistry on this particular team, both last year and this year is really strong,” Almanza said. “We really care about each other as friends and family. We have a really good connection on and off the court. You can see it on the court because we have a lot of trust and faith in each other as teammates and as friends.”
Harvard will get a second chance against every Ivy over the next three weeks, starting with the Big Green this Friday.
“I love this team so much, and our chemistry is so special,” Cooper said. “There’s nothing quite like getting to play everyday with your very best friends. I’m really proud of how we’ve adapted and overcome the obstacles we’ve faced this season, and am super excited to face Dartmouth again this weekend.”
With just seven games left in the season to qualify for the Ivy League Championship Tournament, Harvard will be taking its chemistry to New Hampshire to kick off the second half of the regular season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard football, Friday night’s clash against No. 23 Princeton (6-0, 3-0) marked an opportunity to exact revenge after a heartbreaking, controversial defeat to the Tigers 363 days prior. The Crimson (4-2, 2-1), armed with a largely different roster and donning fresh, black jerseys for the first time, hoped for a new result. But Princeton’s star wide receiver, Andrei Iosivas, proved to be too much for Harvard’s porous pass defense to handle, as the senior took his nine catches for 176 yards and a touchdown, while his co-star, Dylan Classi, added three catches for 59 yards and another score. In last week’s victory over Howard, the Crimson used a 24-0 run after halftime to pull away for a 41-25 win. However, Princeton flipped the script completely on Friday, scoring 23 unanswered points after halftime as the Tigers claimed pole position in the Ivy League title chase with a 37-10 victory. The 27-point margin of defeat was Harvard’s largest since a 52-17 loss to Princeton on Oct. 20, 2017.
“To state the obvious, we got our butts kicked,” head coach Tim Murphy said. “[I] can’t remember us being in that situation … in forever. Give tremendous credit to Princeton. They’re an outstanding football team.”
Although the Crimson entered the contest with the seventh-best rushing defense in the FCS, Princeton established the run early on, as each of its first five plays from scrimmage were on the ground. Then, on its sixth snap, head coach Bob Surace called for a trick play, suspecting that Harvard was expecting another run. After receiving a handoff, Tigers running back Ryan Butler pitched it back to quarterback Blake Stenstrom, who found Iosivas open deep down the middle of the field with no black jerseys within ten yards. The signal-caller delivered a strike, and Iosivas waltzed easily into the end zone for a 61-yard score, just over three minutes into the game. It gave Princeton a 7-0 lead that it would never relinquish, and set the tone for a dominating performance by Iosivas.
“They just kept getting shots,” Murphy explained. “Their receivers were just tremendous, starting with Iosivas.”
Throughout the game, Stenstrom was in control, both on the ground and through the air. Although he had rushed for negative-four yards in the first five games of the season, Stenstrom was a dual threat from the very start of the game, scrambling 14 times for 60 yards. He diced the struggling Crimson pass defense all game, repeatedly completing well-placed deep passes over the top of the Harvard secondary. All in all, the former Colorado quarterback completed five passes of more than 20 yards, including two that went for scores. Stenstrom, who Murphy described as “probably the best quarterback in the league”, played with poise throughout the game, completing 18 of his 27 passes for 278 yards and three touchdowns despite occasional pressure from the Crimson’s talented front seven. Although the Princeton offensive line had allowed 3.4 sacks per game entering the contest, Harvard managed to bring down Stenstrom in the backfield just twice, owing to the quarterback’s scrambling ability.
“There were so many contested balls,” Murphy said. “It just seemed like the quarterback just dropped it in there perfectly, quite honestly, a lot more than we had seen on film over the past three or four games.”
Stenstrom’s counterpart, senior quarterback Charlie Dean, was never able to get much going against a suffocating Tigers defense that forced him to attempt a lot of short passes. Early in the game, Dean relied almost solely on his top target, senior wide receiver Kym Wimberly, to earn small chunks of yardage. Even on third-and-long situations, Harvard was often forced to settle for screen passes to Wimberly. Although the Slidell, La. native set a new career high with 11 receptions, his exploits were not nearly enough to overcome Princeton’s defensive front. Outside of Wimberly’s 70 yards, only junior tight end Tyler Neville was able to produce any real offense through the air, taking his five catches for 78 yards and a score. As a result of its stagnant offense, the Crimson went just three for 11 on third down conversion opportunities. The Tigers dominated possession, controlling the ball for 36 minutes, 55 seconds.
“We just didn’t sustain drives. We didn’t convert enough on third down. And their offense was on the field a long time,” Murphy said.
Even the vaunted Harvard rushing defense struggled on Friday night. Prior to the contest, its previous worst performance against an opposing ground attack came in the 30-21 loss to Holy Cross on Oct. 1, when it allowed the Crusaders to rack up 147 yards on the ground. Despite the Tigers’ averaging just 85.2 rushing yards per game through their first five matchups, the Crimson failed to stop either Stenstrom or Butler. The freshman has started his college career on an absolute tear, scoring eight rushing touchdowns in his first five games and earning the Ivy League’s Rookie of the Week award three times. He made a strong case for a fourth trophy on Friday, taking his 20 handoffs for 80 yards and adding a score each on the ground and through the air. All in all, Princeton racked up 191 rushing yards, the most that defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99’s unit has conceded since a 24-17 loss to Dartmouth on Oct. 27, 2018, when the Big Green raced its way to 320 rushing yards.
There were a few positive takeaways from the game despite the loss. Princeton entered the game as the second-best rushing defense in the FCS, behind only Columbia, who Harvard will face on Nov. 5 at home. Prior to Friday’s contest, the Tigers had conceded just 46.0 yards per game on the ground, but the Crimson managed to rack up 112. As always, the unit was led by its driving force, senior running back Aidan Borguet, who was quietly productive on his 15 carries, earning 96 yards. Friday’s game was the first time this season that the senior has failed to find the end zone. Fellow senior Sone Ntoh, who had missed the previous two games, achieved moderate success as well, turning his six carries into 36 yards. Additionally, after being one of the most penalized teams in college football through the first four weeks of the season, Harvard was flagged just four times for 15 yards.
Although the Tigers currently hold the inside track to a conference title, the Crimson still has a solid chance at achieving what it has not been able to do since 2015. Last season, Princeton and Dartmouth, each with 6-1 conference records, earned a share of the Ivy League championship, with Harvard sitting just behind at 5-2. With just one conference loss through its first three games, the Crimson is not out of contention, but its remaining four games are most likely must-win situations. The road will start next week, when it travels to Hanover, N.H., to take on Dartmouth on Oct. 29. Senior defensive lineman and captain Truman Jones expressed confidence that his team would be able to bounce back from the defeat.
“This result won’t have any effect on our next game,” he said. “[We] really want to see what we can learn from this, know what plays we can make, know what we can do as a defense better, and use it as a launching pad for our next game.”
Although the road will be tough from here on out, resilience is a cultural pillar that Murphy has instilled throughout his 28-year career as Harvard’s head coach. The Crimson will need to lean on that value next Saturday if it hopes to redeem itself for not only Friday’s loss, but also last year’s nail-biting, 20-17 defeat at the hands of the Big Green in poor weather conditions at Harvard Stadium.
