After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I talk about my mental health, I still feel uncomfortable. I feel heat wash through my cheeks. “I think I definitely overcommitted this semester but I really enjoy my classes.” I feel my heart pumping faster and I choke before I say more.
I want to talk about what it’s like to walk into class an hour late because I’ve been crying on the phone with my parents. I want to tell them that for me, college includes the shame of asking for extensions since I’ve been staying up till sunrise obsessing over my mistakes. But I catch myself. It’s easier, for them and for me, to not make a scene.
I always feel like I’m talking out of turn.
To me, the pressure is two-fold. First, I worry the people around me will see me as less stable, my perspective too emotional and my voice less valid. But even if some people do think this way, I know they’re wrong — no one is less human because of their mental health, and depression doesn’t make someone’s opinion less legitimate.
I don’t know how to answer my second worry though — that I don’t have a right to talk about my experiences. Maybe I’m just being overdramatic or self-pitying. Were my experiences really that bad? When the people around me give me so much love and joy, how can I complain? I worry that I don’t have the right to think and speak about my mental health issues as real pain because I know how privileged I am.
By listening to the stories of my peers at Harvard, I’ve learned that I’m lucky to have a loving, welcoming family to go back to during school breaks. By working in the Chinatown community, I’ve realized that I’m privileged to never worry about being forced out of my home. By taking seriously the atrocities that occur around the world every day, I know that I did nothing to deserve the resources and happiness I’ve been born into. Therefore I just don’t feel like whatever pain I have is worth caring about.
But I want to care about my pain. I want to be able to say that the sadness I struggled with was real, and no matter what resources or legs-up I’ve been given, I still deserve to let myself just feel bad instead of writing off my pain as mere entitlement.
It doesn’t feel that easy to me, though. If I impulse buy a new shirt to cheer myself up after a bad exam instead of buying a meal for someone in need, I feel like I’m deciding that my stress comes before someone else’s hunger. I feel like I’m saying that my own pain is more important to address, and I just don’t think it is. I don’t know if it’s good or even acceptable for me to put my own emotions first because of the privileges I have in life.
How should I reconcile my privilege and my pain?
People tell me that self-care is practical, that neglecting my physical or mental health too much hurts my productivity, so even if I feel obliged by my privilege to work for the good of others, self-care may be a necessary step to fulfilling that responsibility. Even if that’s true sometimes, part of me can’t help thinking that there’s a point at which it becomes self-centered to worry too much about myself. I don’t know what is or isn’t a big deal for others, but reflecting on my own experiences, I don’t think there was any need to fixate on my sadness about not getting into an a cappella group, for instance.
If there’s the chance that my struggles just aren’t that serious, then I don’t want to focus on myself at the expense of caring for others. So what should I do?
Listening to the people around me has made me realize that not believing that I deserve to feel sad is just another way of devaluing myself. According to the American Psychiatric Association, “excessive and inappropriate guilt” is a symptom of depression. There’s no reason to feel guilty for feeling sad, to blame myself for my privilege and my pain, parts of my life that are outside of my control. I earnestly want to help others, but the painful things in my life are a part of me, just like suffering is a part of so many other people. That shared experience of pain is exactly why I don’t have to put myself down to lift others up.
“I had a tough sophomore fall. I struggled with my mental health a lot, and I wanted to give up on myself so many times. I don’t know exactly what you’re going through, but I think I know what you mean.”
Caring about my pain doesn’t have to be selfish. It’s a way that I can connect with others, and I’m starting to feel more comfortable saying that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stoked Wood Fired Pizza Company will turn up the heat in the Harvard Square food scene in early 2020.
The new Cambridge location at 1611 Massachusetts Ave. will be Stoked’s second restaurant; it originally launched as a food truck in 2014 before opening a permanent location in Brookline two years later. Stoked will take up residence in a new building on Harvard Law School’s campus, according to company co-founder Toirm M. Miller.
Miller said Thursday that Stoked’s food truck has been serving its pies in the Science Center Plaza — alongside several other food trucks — since 2016.
Miller said Harvard Square was on the top of his “priority list” when it came to scouting out a second permanent restaurant. He said he and co-founder Scott Riebling spent three years searching for a suitable location.
“We knew that we had built an audience on the other side of the river,” Miller said. “I've been looking in that area for a while. Of course, the student population was a big attraction.”
Denise A. Jillson — the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association — said she thinks Stoked will enjoy its own niche in a “quiet” area abutting the Cambridge Common.
“We're excited to have them,” Jillson said. “You might even say we're stoked.”
Miller said he believes Stoked will make a name for itself in Harvard Square with its unique cross-over pizza dish. He said the pizzas are distinguished by their “hybrid” quality between a classic Neapolitan and New Haven style pizza.
As Stoked moves to expand across the river, Miller has decided to drop “wood fired” from the company’s name since the pizzas in Cambridge will be prepared in electric rather than wood-fired ovens.
Jillson said wood-fired ovens have previously created “issues” in Cambridge, citing a 2016 controversy over the now-closed Shepard Restaurant and Bar. Residents in the area charged that the wood smoke emitted from the restaurant — which was previously located at 1 Shepard St. — was causing health issues.
Miller said there have previously been issues in Cambridge and other places concerning smoke from wood fire ovens, though he said Stoked ultimately decided to forgo its original cooking method when it was not able to find a venue that could accommodate the necessary equipment and ventilation.
He added that today’s electric ovens can turn out pizzas of the same texture and taste as their wood fired counterparts can.
“It's really impressive,” Miller said. “Honestly, it’s really, really difficult to tell the difference.
Stoked’s Cambridge location will diverge from its Brookline restaurant not only in oven style, but also in size. Miller said he hopes the new restaurant will accommodate up to 100 people — double the capacity in Brookline — and attract a new crowd of students and young professionals.
Jillson said that she thinks the restaurant will prove especially popular with tourists.
“To go in and get a delicious slice of pizza, having just taken your picture in front of Harvard Law — what could be better?” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four Harvard Law School students contend that the school did not take meaningful action to address a series of racist and sexist messages sent anonymously to the students after an investigation failed to determine the messages’ origins.
The text and email messages — which included racist taunts and insults about female students’ physical appearances — began in December 2018 and were sent to a small group of first-year law students, some of whom are black. After reaching out to faculty members and filing police reports, the students took their case to administrators who they say did not adequately investigate and address the messages.
Law School student Mohamed “Mo” T. Light received the first message in early December, which included statements contending he had only been accepted to the Law School “because of affirmative action.”
“My first initial reaction was this is like a gut punch,” Light said.
Christina E. Volcy, another Law School student, received an anonymous message in February and shortly after reached out to faculty members who she said quickly responded to her concerns. In March, however, Volcy reached out to the Law School’s Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells, who did not respond to her initial message.
“We've been left aghast at how just unfeeling and just inappropriate their response to our concern has been,” Volcy said.
Volcy later emailed Sells again with a fellow classmate who received one of the messages and was able to set up a meeting with the dean, but they say the school’s subsequent investigation did not sufficiently address the incident.
Sells wrote in an emailed statement Thursday night that the Law School worked with Harvard University Police Department and an outside law firm to investigate the messages, but were unable to determine who sent them.
“We have repeatedly expressed to our students how deeply we regret the hurt these messages caused, and we condemned and continue to condemn in the strongest terms any communication or action that is intended to demean people,” Sells wrote. “Members of the HLS community are committed to fostering an environment of mutual respect and support; these messages transgress our values and Community Principles.”
“We will continue to work to reinforce these values and to promote a community in which all are supported and respected,” she added.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the department’s involvement and declined to provide the students’ police reports.
Following the students’ first meeting with Sells in March, she followed up in April with an email to the students informing them that the school had employed Shaun Donnelly from the law firm Hogan Lovells to independently investigate the messages.
Light, Volcy, and Rooney said they and the fourth student all met with Donnelly in April, but did not hear back from him or Sells until after the final exam period.
On June 6, Rooney and Volcy emailed Sells to follow-up on the investigation.
“As you know, this has been a difficult time for everyone who received messages, and we all have spent many hours mulling over these messages, fully aware that we deserved to use that time to devote to our studies,” they wrote. “That is to say again that this has greatly impacted our first year at HLS, and we would like to be apprised of the resolution as soon as possible, so as to enter into our internships and 2L year unburdened by this harassment.”
Sells did not respond until June 26, after all four students emailed Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 and asked him for an update on the investigation. In her email, Sells apologized for her delayed response and said the investigation had been completed.
On June 29, Sells followed up with an email to the students’ section and informed them that the investigation was inconclusive.
“We condemn in the strongest terms these messages and all communications that are intended to demean people. Such messages transgress our Community Principles, which commit every student, faculty and staff member to, among other things, mutual respect,” Sells wrote. “Harvard Law School engaged HUPD and an outside law firm to thoroughly investigate these anonymous messages. Unfortunately, we were not able to establish the sender(s).”
The students said they believed they knew who had sent the messages, but did not provide the name of the suspected sender.
In her statement, Sells said the Law School will continue to “reinforce” values of “mutual respect and support” that are part of the school’s Community Principles.
“We have repeatedly expressed to our students how deeply we regret the hurt these messages caused, and we condemned and continue to condemn in the strongest terms any communication or action that is intended to demean people,” Sells said.
The Harvard Black Law Students Association also posted a statement to its website Friday criticizing the Law School’s response to the messages.
“Harvard University, and specifically, Harvard Law School, asserts itself as a committed leader to diversity, inclusion, and justice; however, Harvard woefully failed to act and protect the students of Section 7,” they wrote.
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement Friday that Law School administrators “condemn” the anonymous messages and reiterated that the school worked “extensively” to investigate them.
“We care deeply about the four students who each received these demeaning messages,” Neal wrote. “Sadly, the realities of technology sometimes permit those who commit such acts to evade detection, and we are disappointed that we were unable to identify who is responsible despite our efforts along multiple fronts.”
“We understand why the four students who each received a message wish to see the fruits of our efforts, and we wish that we could do more to answer their questions,” he added.
