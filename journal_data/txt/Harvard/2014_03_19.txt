After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Richard L. Hall ’90 has been named the new managing director of private equity for the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s $33 billion endowment.
 
He will replace Lane MacDonald ’88-’89, who stepped down in February less than three months after being promoted to the position, previously held by Peter Dolan ’83. Dolan left the post in April 2013 after nearly 20 years at Harvard Management Company.
 
“Hall brings significant and deep expertise across private equity investments, other private assets and global M&A, and we are delighted to welcome him to our team,” HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo wrote in a statement. 
    
Hall was previously the managing director and head of private equity at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, a fund that manages the retirement benefits for public school and university employees in state and boasts a $14 billion private equity portfolio. Prior to that, he worked at various financial firms, most recently Bank of America Securities, and served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy. He earned his MBA at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.
Hall will begin work at the Boston-based HMC in April.
 
Hall will lead an area of the endowment that seen mixed results in the past few years. According to HMC’s annual report from fiscal year 2013, private equity is the endowment’s second-largest asset class. While its returns beat the internal benchmark by a margin of .4 percent in 2013, it was the only asset class to not meet its benchmark in 2012, falling short by 2.05 percent. Mendillo characterized private equity’s returns as “fair” in the 2013 report.
 
Private equity is an illiquid asset class, which means that it locks up money for relatively long periods of time. In exchange, Mendillo wrote that HMC expects an illiquidity premium, or returns greater than those of public, more liquid markets. Yet she noted that returns for private and public equity have been similar in the past decade.
 
“While this asset class still presents unique opportunities for attractive returns, it has gotten much more crowded and there is less of an illiquidity premium,” she wrote in the 2013 annual report. “As a result, we are actively focused on honing our private equity strategy to maintain the highest concentration in the very best managers with the greatest potential to add value.” 
  
MacDonald was only the most recent HMC employee to leave the fund for a lucrative position in the private sector. He is now president of Crosby Advisors, a company that manages the personal wealth of Fidelity Investments chief Edward C. Johnson III ’54 and his family. The most prominent loss was Chief Investment Officer Jack R. Meyer, who, over the course of 14 years, oversaw the endowment’s growth from $4.7 to $22.6 billion. He left in 2005 to found Convexity Capital Management and brought with him more than 30 HMC employees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taking a break from conference play, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (11-6, 7-2 EIVA) traveled to Ohio to take on two ranked opponents in No.13 Ball State (15-5, 5-2 MIVA) and No. 15 Ohio State (8-12, 4-5 MIVA).
In search of its first win on the season against a ranked opponent, the Crimson fell in five sets to the Cardinals on Sunday. But Harvard accomplished the feat just two days later, as the team emerged victorious against the Buckeyes in a five-set thriller.
HARVARD 3, OHIO STATE 2
Playing its second straight non-conference game on the road, the Crimson picked up a hard fought victory over the Buckeyes, defeating Ohio State in a 3-2 decision to earn Harvard's third win over a top-15 opponent in team history.
After falling in five sets to Ball State two nights earlier, the Crimson bounced back with a balanced offensive effort against the Buckeyes to earn the 25-15, 25-19, 20-25, 21-25, and 17-15 victory at St. John’s Arena in Columbus, Ohio.
“We were as good as we’ve been all season those first two games,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “Then [Ohio State] started picking up its game and put pressure on us [to make it] a battle. The difference in the fifth set was we made the points [we needed to].”
The Crimson had four different players record double-digit kills on the night, spearheaded by junior outside hitter DJ White’s 13 to go along with 10 digs. Senior Kyle Rehkemper recorded 12 kills while co-captain Nick Madden and freshman Casey White each added 11.
The first set saw the Crimson take control with an 8-1 run sparked by a DJ White kill to take a 10-3 lead, an advantage which would never drop below six points. Harvard held the Buckeyes to a mere -.091 hitting percentage compared to a .429 clip for the Crimson.
The second set followed a similar storyline, as Harvard transformed a tight 9-8 set into a 21-12 lead behind a balanced distribution of kills. An ace by Casey White would seal the set for the visitors.
But the script flipped in the third set, with the Buckeyes coming out strong early on. A 7-2 run by the home team to start off the game put the Crimson in an early hole.
Harvard would manage to trim the gap to two through a 4-0 run later on in the set, but Ohio State would ultimately pull away to win the game.
The fourth stanza saw Harvard take an early advantage, which it held for the majority of the set, before the Buckeyes ultimately took control with a kill by Alex Judkins to go up 19-18. Ohio State would use a 3-0 run to go up 22-19, a lead which it would never relinquish on its way to tying the match at two sets apiece.
According to Madden, the sudden change of momentum was a result of a shift in gameplay, as the Buckeyes used a new strategy to claw back into the match.
“They started getting their offense closer to the net,” Madden said. “They stepped up their passing; we pulled off [slightly] on our serving and we couldn’t stop their offense. Overall, they picked it up and we stepped a little bit off of the gas.”
As both teams looked to claim victory, a pivotal fifth set saw both teams go back-and-forth until a Buckeye service error initiated a 3-0 run for Harvard to take an 11-8 lead.
Ohio State battled back to 15-15 but was never able to take the lead away from the Crimson. A kill by Madden followed by a block by junior Caleb Zimmick off OSU kill leader Driss Guessous sealed the victory for Harvard.
“The way we ended it was good,” Madden said. “We had Rehkemper [come up with] a huge block on the outside and Caleb had a huge block on [Guessous], who we had been unable to stop the entire game. Two big blocks on two key players down the stretch really got us the W.”
Despite the Crimson’s success against a ranked opponent, Baise believes that there is still room for improvement as the squad heads into a key stretch of the season.
“One of our weak spots is playing a complete defensive game,” Baise said. “To beat teams in the EIVA playoffs, we have to figure out a way to slow them down because when [those teams] are hitting a high percentage it puts pressure on our offense.”
BALL STATE 3, HARVARD 2
The Crimson’s weekend in Ohio began with a loss to the ranked Cardinals, as Harvard dropped a tight 3-2 match to a squad that has won eight straight contests.
Despite leading two sets to one after three stanzas, the Crimson was unable to maintain its lead, ultimately losing, 25-18, 24-26, 25-20, 19-25, and 14-16.
DJ White spearheaded the Harvard offense, as the junior posted his first double-double of the season with a career-high 26 kills and 10 digs.
The Crimson seized a commanding lead in the first set thanks to an early 4-0 run, after which the team would never relinquish the lead.
While Harvard would also take an early advantage in the second set, Ball State came back and took the set after an attack error by the Crimson.
Harvard continued the trend by once again taking an early lead in the third set with a 7-2 run to seize a 9-4 lead. Like the first game, the Crimson preserved this lead as the Cardinals failed to recover from the early hole.
The fourth set saw the Cardinals contain Harvard’s early onslaught and take a commanding 10-6 lead early on to pace the set. The Crimson could never recover as Ball State forced a final stanza.
The decisive set saw Harvard fall behind early after a 4-0 run by Ball State put the Cardinals up, 4-1. While the Crimson came back multiple times to tie the set, the team was unable to ever take the lead, eventually falling, 16-14, after an attack error.
Despite the loss, there were various bright spots for the team as several members posted career-high numbers. Along with the performance of DJ White, Madden contributed 17 kills and 16 digs to claim his seventh career double-double and third on the season.
Zimmick posted a career-best 16 kills while freshman Nick Bendell added a career-high 65 assists on the night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The third time taking on a ranked opponent was not the charm for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team, as the squad dropped its latest decision to No. 3 Syracuse.
The Crimson (3-3, 1-1 Ivy) fell back down to .500 with a 17-4 loss to the Orange (8-1, 2-1 ACC) Tuesday night at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, N.Y.
Despite a strong game from freshman attacker Megan Hennessey, who had two goals and four draw controls, Harvard could not keep up with Syracuse’s fast paced offense.
Tuesday marked the fifth game out of six for the Crimson when a freshman has been among the leading scorers in the contest. Freshman attacker Marisa Romeo currently leads Harvard with 17 goals on the season, while Hennessey and sophomore attacker Alexis Nicolia are tied for second with nine.
The scoring started early for the Orange, as the team notched five unanswered goals before the Crimson finally broke through with a goal by Nicolia on an assist from sophomore attacker Meghan Bauer.
The only other goal in the opening half for Harvard came from the stick of junior midfielder Sophia Capone with the aid of Romeo.
On the defensive side of the ball, sophomore keeper Kelly Weis stopped 12 of Syracuse’s 29 shots on goal, her second-highest total of the season. Weis also led the team in ground balls with three on the night.
Overall, the Orange had the advantage in almost every category, tallying more ground balls and draw controls and committing fewer turnovers than the Crimson while taking 24 more shots.
On free position shots, Syracuse converted four of 11 tries while Harvard did not have an opportunity to go one-on-one with the keeper.
In the first half, the Crimson surrendered ten goals but came back after halftime and kept the number below double-digits while notching another two goals of its own.
The Orange offense had scoring come from throughout its lineup. Junior attacker Devon Collins led Syracuse with three goals, and three other Orange players tallied multiple scores during the match. Overall, 12 different players scored on the night.
Goal keeping for Syracuse was split between senior Alyssa Costantino, who was awarded the win, and junior Kelsey Richardson. The two each spent a half in net, and each surrendered two goals. Combined, the two goalies were able to stop 11 of Harvard’s 13 shots.
The loss makes the Crimson now 0-3 against top-20 teams, with defeats earlier in the year having come against No. 10 Stanford and No. 15 Penn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—Twenty-four hours before the biggest game of his season, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker dismissed any discussion of his name in connection with the recently vacated Boston College head coaching job.
The Eagles announced on Tuesday that they would fire Steve Donahue after four uninspiring seasons (and zero NCAA Tournament appearances) under the former Cornell coach. Immediately, the Boston Globe reported that Amaker was the leading candidate for the position. As a former ACC player and assistant coach, Amaker has ties to the conference dating back three decades.
With his team’s NCAA Tournament opener against Cincinnati just a day away, Amaker refused to take questions on the issue during Wednesday’s media availability session in Spokane.
“There’s nothing for me to address, to comment on,” Amaker said. “I certainly feel like what we have in front of us is the most important [thing]…. We’re focused on Cincinnati, we’re focused on our workouts today, and that’s how we should leave it.”
This is not the first time that Amaker has been connected with a job opening. In 2011, Miami officials flew to Boston to try to convince Amaker to fill their university’s vacant head coaching position. The Harvard coach declined to take his talents to South Beach, however, and promptly led the Crimson to three straight NCAA Tournament appearances.
“Obviously this has happened before with the job across the river [but] I think Coach feels at home at Harvard,” senior Kyle Casey said. “Hopefully we just take care of business in the tournament, and we’ll let that handle itself.”
Many players, including sophomore Siyani Chambers and co-captain Brandyn Curry, said that they were unaware of the rumors. Amaker said that he had not addressed the rumors with the team because of the focus on Cincinnati and not anything external.
“He’s a terrific coach, so of course people are going to want him,” Curry said. “It comes as no shock, but we don’t pay attention to any of that.”
