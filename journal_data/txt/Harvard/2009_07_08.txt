SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – Sometime in the next few weeks, Facebook is going to unveil a new privacy policy aimed at getting users to share information with everyone on the Internet. It is the next move in Facebook’s campaign to unseat Twitter as the web’s preferred venue for microblogging. But in its effort to out-tweet Twitter, Facebook is asking its users to make far more of their personal information accessible to many more people. The new privacy rules thus present us with an opportunity to ask a question that has been posed many times before: With how many people are you comfortable sharing your photos, updates, and inside jokes? 
The company that Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06-’07 started in his Harvard dorm room prevailed against lesser social networking sites like MySpace and Friendster because only on Facebook could you be reasonably assured that pictures of you masterfully performing a keg stand were viewable exclusively by your college friends. It was an added plus that your inbox wasn’t also bombarded by spam from voyeuristic websites. 
Facebook has maintained the pretense, as was noted in a Techcrunch blog post on the new privacy policies, that they want users to publicize more information in order to help differentiate between people with similar names, thereby making it easier to connect with friends.
But it’s no secret that Facebook’s real motive, and for many months its overriding concern, is keeping up with Twitter. Although Facebook has 200 million users to Twitter’s 25 million (that doesn’t include all the new registrations that undoubtedly resulted in June following the Iranian elections), the consensus is that the future of social networking lies in microblogging: short up-to-the-second messages broadcast to your friends and followers. The key part of this equation—and what equipped Twitter to be such a powerful means of spreading information in the fallout of the Iranian elections—is that “tweets” are both searchable and occur in real time. Real time searches are impeded by the sorts of filters on Facebook that allow you to choose who can and cannot view photos tagged of you or whether your relationship status has changed. These filters allow you to micromanage who gets to see what, and are what make people comfortable being Facebook friends with their bosses as well as their frat brothers.
Facebook has a history of adding features that face large initial resistance, but come to be regarded by users as indispensable. College students were uneasy about professional networks—and adults—gaining access to Facebook after its early users began graduating from college, and were mildly indignant when the network was opened up to high school students. But users have long since come to terms with Facebook’s openness. The introduction of the news feed—the stream of information that updates you on recent changes and additions to your friends’ profiles—provoked a massive backlash from college students because, at first, it felt like an invasion of privacy. Yet, before long, we recognized that the news feed made it possible to stay appraised of all the weird and interesting things the kids you never thought you would hear from again after high school were up to. Even the latest redesign of the home page and profiles was initially unpopular, but whatever opposition may have existed soon subsided. The lesson to draw from these changes is that, as a general proposition, Facebook can make fairly significant changes modifying how users interact with the site .
The most important exception to this dynamic occurred when Facebook rewrote its terms of service in February, effectively laying claim to all the information users publish to their profiles on the premise that, “We publish it, ergo we can do what we want with it.” Users rebelled and Facebook backtracked, reinstituting its abandoned terms of service in which control over content resided with users. 
So, back to the question: How will users respond to the new privacy rules? Will they grow comfortable with sharing photos and posts with the whole of the World Wide Web? Or will Facebook become a two-tiered site, with one set of information available only to your friends and a Twitter-like feature, visible to everybody, tacked on? 
The proposed privacy rules will bring to the fore the abiding online tensions between the need for privacy and the mania for rapid dissemination of information. And how Facebook and its users choose to resolve these issues today will have important implications for a generation whose every move has been catalogued on a social networking site since middle school graduation.

GALAPAGOS, Ecuador— “Indigenous” is a word in vogue today—a way to describe local peoples manipulated, depopulated, or even replaced as the main inhabitants of a region In many places, the struggle for indigenous rights is a hot-button issue. Conservation and development both imply restraints on local economies and growth, forcing governments to work to balance interests. Yet, travel a thousand miles west from the South American mainland to Ecuador’s Galapagos Islands, and indigenous becomes an even more difficult word.
When the famous Galapagos first emerged through volcanic activity, it had no living inhabitants. Eventually, more intrepid animals made the journey there by riding on one of several currents that approach the islands from the mainland, from the northeast and southeast. These travelers included the now-famous finches favored by Darwin, as well as tortoises and many other species now unique to the islands. Their protection and preservation is an enormous task and responsibility handled by both Ecuador and the Charles Darwin Foundation.
Their work is serious, even dangerous. As I venture from island to island on one of the motor yachts which are the preferred method of exploration (with the province’s government providing itineraries and carefully monitoring tourists), Fausto, our confident, loquacious guide tells us stories of local fishermen kidnapping CDF staff. The inhabitants of the Galapagos, a few thousand, relay on tourism and fishing for their welfare. The paradox here: The presence of these “indigenous” people jeopardizes the pristine ecosystems on which tourism—and therefore the inhabitants themselves—depends. 
These residents’ status as indigenous, even, seems dubious. Although the Galapagos were discovered in the sixteenth century, the islands were left abandoned and uninhabited until 1832, when Ecuador, the nearest mainland nation, claimed possession. Settlement before some 30 years ago was on a piecemeal scale. Several plantations cropped up, but they were fueled mostly by forced and temporary convict labor. 
The Galapagos Islands have provided a perfect setting for the evolution of specialized seabirds, finches, and lizards. They are not, however, a naturally forgiving environment for human settlement. Only the relatively recent rise of tourism  has brought fishermen and others to live here. Thus, one does not see the traditions and specific culture so critical to indigenous cultures on islands settled less recently, such as Hawaii.
Currently, several islands of the Galapagos have significant communities, while others are off-limits to human activity—at least for now. Yet, as Galapagos-born children grow up and have children of their own, the communities will inevitably expand. While many inhabitants recognize the importance of their surroundings, continued development and economic expansion— including fishing the islands’ protected, rich waters—will cause deepening challenges for the true indigenous residents of the islands: the native wildlife species.
Ecuador must respect those currently living in the Galapagos, but these people cannot claim the kind of rights and legacy of other truly indigenous groups. True, one cannot simply tell the current settlers that their new homes are a mistake. But future human occupation of the islands must be regulated as closely as the tours that allow for its presence. All tour guides are also trained park rangers. It is time that the people of the islands take on a second identity as well, as more active conservators of their adopted home.

HARTFORD, Conn. — On July 4th, one thousand rebels rushed the state capitol, shouting the battle cry: “Throw the bum out!” The bum was Senator Chris Dodd, the occasion, a tea party. For three hours, Dan Reale, a 27-year-old Libertarian from Plainfield, Conn., passed a microphone to speakers who denounced Dodd and other politicians for shackling their constituents to an ever-growing national debt. Critics call these people fire-eaters, but I call them conservatives—conservatives who are looking for a leader.
By “conservative” I don’t mean “Republican.” The event’s planners were Libertarians, who lambasted both parties. “Republicans are really desperate right now; they didn’t do what they said they were going to do. Now, they’re trying to hijack what Ron Paul’s supporters started,” Reale told me. Still, the crowd was rather conventional. One speaker, John Mertens, won cheers when he espoused term limits, but earned jeers when he endorsed legalizing marijuana. Another, Vincent Arguimbau, was shouted off the stage after he rebuked George W. Bush.
Culture warriors and security hawks squabbled, but they united on one man: President Barack H. Obama. Posters slammed him on every issue. Cap and trade? “Crap and trade.” Auto bailouts? “Bail yourself out.”  Universal healthcare? “Don’t kill grandma!” A few signs were brutal: “Somewhere in Kenya, a village is missing their idiot.” But most people were more measured—or at least less partisan. For instance, Joe Markley, a former State Senator who spoke, dubbed former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson “a Klingon.”
These protests strain the ear, but they vent conservatives’ frustration with liberals—now in almost complete control—who want to extend government’s reach over larger swaths of our lives. Unfortunately, middle-class conservatives assume that if you’re a member of the “elite,” you’re liberal. When I revealed that I wrote for The Harvard Crimson, one man asked me, “Are you going to write about how dumb we are?” A second warned that the crowd might run me out of town.
But conservatives need a leader, someone who can fortify common ground—fiscal prudence—and navigate disputed territory—foreign policy and social issues. “There’s no counterweight to these socialists,” said David Aron, a 25-year-old from Hamden, Conn. But who will that counterweight be? “I’m excited about Palin, Romney…” Melissa Welsh, an onlooker, told me, her voice trailing off as she hit the bottom of a short list. Conservatives shouldn’t write off their elite; they need them. After all, the Founding Fathers weren’t populists. 
And a Libertarian won’t be that leader. Reale wisely stressed commonalities: “We’re not going to agree on everything, but we do agree that spending is out of control.” His colleagues, however, were politically clumsy. Peter Schiff, an economist who Libertarians hope will be the Republican candidate against Dodd, spoke to the crowd—for an agonizing half hour. In his speech, he dissected the history of the Federal Reserve—the most boring topic he could choose—and the crowd’s attention melted away.
The problem with Libertarians is that they don’t politick. They lecture. Discourses on monetary policy attract audiences, but those audiences consist of other Libertarians. To recruit more troops, conservatives of all stripes must retool their rhetoric. They have a right to be angry—spending is out of control—but in politics you don’t get angry, you get even. You get elected. And to get elected you use humor, to show you’re even-keeled.
So the search continues. But potential leaders could learn some jokes from the rank-and-file. For example, when one speaker asked the crowd, “What would happen if we refused to pay our taxes?” a spectator quipped, “We’d get a Cabinet job!”

AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands—At the age of 16, Mariska Majoor started what would turn out to be a five-year career in prostitution. Before she made the decision to sell her body, Majoor’s teenage life was defined by ultimate indigence: She was living on the streets of Amsterdam, dabbling in hard drugs when she could afford them, suffering from a lack of healthy food and adequate clothing, and really desiring one thing. A pet dog.
A couple weeks ago, during an interview with Majoor—the founder of the Prostitution Information Center in Amsterdam’s Red Light District—the former sex worker told me that the one reason she decided to become a full-time prostitute was simply because she wanted a dog, a constant source of companionship on the streets, and could not otherwise afford one. But that reason seemed to belie her insistence that the decision to begin a career in prostitution was one she made “as an adult.” 
“I considered myself old enough to choose to do things. I saw that it was my decision, and mine only,” she said, when I asked her whether or not she retrospectively resented the fact that she was able to easily enter the sex trade as a minor. 
“If someone were to have told me I was too young, I would’ve been angry—really, really angry,” she continued. “And I would’ve said to them, ‘Fuck you. I’m old enough to make my own decisions.’”
Even in the regulated Dutch sex industry—prostitution was legalized nearly nine years ago in this country, in October 2000—sex workers have to be at least 18 years of age in order to legally work in brothels and behind windows. Through the course of my research on the situation over the past two weeks, I discovered intense opposition among a slew of Dutch academics, women’s rights advocates, and former prostitutes to a recent proposal to increase the age standard for sex workers from 18 to 21. 
“If you’re a child, 15 or 16 or 17 years old, and you’re helping your family to survive—well, what is a child in this context?” said Marie Louise Janssen, a lecturer on cultural anthropology at the University of Amsterdam who teaches a course called “The Commodification of the Human Body.  “If it’s the difference between surviving and not surviving, who am I to say that you should not be allowed to help yourself?”

Among the people opposing an age increase, most voice reasons echoing those of Janssen, who added that she actually supports lowering the minimum age standard to work in prostitution. These advocates say that young girls in dire economic circumstances, like Majoor was years ago, should be allowed to enter the get-rich-quick industry—as long as the minors are not forced to do so.
But how are these girls not forced into prostitution, I wondered, sometimes aloud, oftentimes visibly frustrated, during the course of my interviews. I couldn’t understand the logic of people like Majoor and Janssen, who argue that minors can make the informed decision to enter the sex industry—even when their choice is, quite literally, between indigence and significant wealth. Isn’t the fact that Majoor decided to become a prostitute principally because she wanted a pet dog reason enough to conclude that minors, particularly those living in extreme poverty, can’t make a rational, informed decision? 

After asking myself that question, I had to take into account my own cultural biases. In America, the teen abstinence movement—at the helm of which currently sits Bristol Palin, the unwed teen mother and daughter of soon-to-be ex-Governor Sarah Palin—is alive and strong. And I think it’s safe to say that the potential for legalizing “the world’s oldest profession” is virtually nonexistent in our country. So maybe the issue of minors working in prostitution is a purely Dutch problem, I thought, one that Dutch society would have to confront itself. 
I once again had to deconstruct the implications of such reasoning. Are legal minors in The Netherlands somehow less worthy than American children? Is there some cultural norm about sex in Dutch society that makes children mature enough to rationally decide to sell their bodies to men double, triple, even quadruple their age?
Obviously not. 
The rights of children transcend culture. And even if the Dutch are progressive enough to have fostered the legalization of prostitution and to have promised to regulate it, then Dutch society should also be responsible enough to ensure that minors are not working in the brothels and behind the windows that police are (evidently inadequately) monitoring.
According to the Dutch Institute for Social Sexual Research, 1,500 girls under 18 are working in these places. I don’t want to state the obvious or oversimplify the situation, but something is seriously wrong in The Netherlands—a welfare state—if impoverished minors are incentivized to become sex workers.
And the fact that pet dogs aren’t distributed for free is no excuse.

As an American and a Latina (a woman of Spanish-speaking, Latin American ancestry), I am outraged at the hurtful, opportunistic, and abusive insults recently leveled at Judge Sonia Sotomayor. Innocent remarks made by Judge Sotomayor about her wisdom and ability as a judge of Latino ancestry have been twisted into excuses for unwarranted name-calling, including labeling her a racist. Endless variations of Judge Sotomayor’s statements have been disseminated, but her critics have not been careful to include complete, verbatim quotes of her comments in their proper contexts so as to allow audiences the opportunity to appreciate the merit and full meaning of her words. A fair consideration of her remarks clearly demonstrates that she simply acknowledges what most people know to be true: Every individual’s knowledge and wisdom are influenced by his or her personal experiences as members of our communities, society, and country.
Much attention continues to focus on Judge Sotomayor’s “wise Latina” comments, but her additional observations are not reported. She also stated (in the same, often distorted lecture): “I . . . believe that we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group. Many are so capable. . . . However, to understand takes time and effort, something that not all people are willing to give. For others, their experiences limit their ability to understand the experiences of others. Other[s] simply do not care. . . . I can and do aspire to be greater than the sum total of my experiences but I accept my limitations. I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting from experience and heritage but attempt, as the Supreme Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies and prejudices are appropriate.”  
Judge Sotomayor’s forthright statements unmistakably demonstrate her willingness to serve as a truthful and self-disciplined jurist. She should not be punished for stating explicitly what appears implicitly in the rulings of Supreme Court jurists—106 white males out of a total of 110—since the beginning of our legal system: Human wisdom is individual and undefined; it develops, in sum or in part, from our experiences. This concept is not new: As early as 1837 the Supreme Court recognized in Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge that the most profound wisdom was exercised by “[t]he wise men who framed [the] [C]onstitution” and is guided by human experience. Judge Sotomayor’s appointment would add another layer of human experience to the Court.
Judge Sotomayor is not the first female judge to disagree with the adage that “a wise old man and a wise old woman will come to the same conclusion.” As documented by Justice Paul H. Anderson in A Tribute to Justice Esther M. Tomljanovich, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Esther M. Tomljanovich also took issue with this maxim. According to fellow Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Anderson, “[a]s a person who had felt the sting of gender discrimination, Esther brought a fresh perspective to the bench. She knew what it was like to be on the outside looking in--to be ignored or, even worse, treated as invisible. . . . Esther’s view was that a wise woman on the bench can influence and may even change the opinion of a wise man--and vice versa.” Another distinguished female jurist, the Honorable Patricia M. Wald, the first woman to sit on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (later serving as Chief Judge), also recognized in Six Not-So-Easy Pieces: One Woman Judge’s Journey to the Bench and Beyond that “[a] judge is the sum of her experiences and if she has suffered disadvantages or discrimination as a woman, she is apt to be sensitive to its subtle expressions or to paternalism.” 
Why do we continue to promote the fallacy that judges, who are, after all, human beings, are not influenced by their personal experiences in the development of their own particular wisdom? Indeed, Justice Samuel Alito acknowledged that, when presented with certain cases, he takes into account the experiences of his immigrant ancestors and the ethnic, religious, and gender discrimination suffered by his Italian family members. Why do we find it so difficult to accept that a judge, who is also a Latina, when she exercises her own particular wisdom, may reach a more informed conclusion than another judge without the benefit of her experiences when those experiences are relevant and helpful to understanding the facts of a particular case? This factual assessment does not mean that she will fail to uphold the rule of law or has a race-driven agenda or believes in ethnic superiority. In the end (and, perhaps, thankfully), a Supreme Court Justice does not rule alone; nine justices participate in the decision-making process. As evidenced in the Court’s June 29 narrowly decided (5 to 4) case in Ricci v. DeStefano, we can glance at the particular wisdom of the justices from their participation in majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions. 
Rather than perpetuate a myth that judges do not, consciously or unconsciously, rely on their life experiences, including membership in particular gender and race/ethnic groups, we should welcome Judge Sotomayor and her experiences as a much-needed addition to the collective wisdom of the Court. Our country’s past and present demonstrate that the Court benefits from distinct perspectives. Our country’s future requires that we move forward toward a more inclusive and diverse Court. We should welcome the special dose of wisdom and outstanding professional qualifications and experiences that Judge Sotomayor’s appointment may bring to the cumulative wisdom of the highest court of our land. Judge Sotomayor’s record and credentials should be scrutinized, as already was done in her two prior confirmation hearings, without the need to resort to disingenuous, personal attacks. I wish Judge Sotomayor and our country a fair, respectful, and dignified confirmation hearing.

RIDGEWOOD, N.J.—My grandfather built things. In a backyard somewhere in a low California valley, his treehouse subsumes a wimpy oak. The trunk seems to buckle underneath the weight of a wide staircase leading up to the habitable structure. But I imagine that this immemorial fixture of my childhood is now littered with alien toys, the once fresh carpet dank with spilled juice and the glass-paned windows smeared by the hands of gum-smacking children.
I’m left to imagine because I haven’t seen this treehouse for 16 years. Every time my family revisits the neighborhood, I’m forced to subsist on a teasing peek into the backyard. The sense of voyeurism hardens the feeling of having been cheated of what was once mine. That treehouse stands as a testament to a past built and lost by my grandfather.
For as long as I’ve been alive, he tried to fix my grandmother. Wihyun Yi: a name best sighed—and a woman who did just that for the 20 years I knew her. She died this past April, and it was the first time I saw brokenness in my carpenter grandfather. The morning before the day she was due to pass, I awoke to the sound of grief: the slow shuffling of feet across the splotched carpet of a home for two, the heaving of cushions as a body sinks into them, and the breaking of noise at the throat, low and awful. Perhaps he thought I was asleep.
Witnessing this weakness was jarring for someone who adored her grandfather in a way overawed children often do, that sort of spell-bound attachment to things that seem rare and superhuman. My annual summer visits to my grandparents’ California home had always promised new examples of his ingenuity: An apple tree he had recently planted with that plump fruit down there growing just for me, a nifty contraption for picking oranges that would later leave my lips raw and stinging from the acid, and ramps and pulleys of all kinds to ease my late grandmother’s mobility about the house.
He always wore a beret; he was never wrong. I was immensely proud of him—this man who created, who endowed agency, and who, above all, fixed people.
But when he arrived at my New Jersey home last month, I was appalled at how he seemed to cling onto me when we hugged, seeking out my shoulders and back like a blind man. He was thinner, the lines around the edges of his mouth tightly drawn and determined southwards. Offering my consolations months after we had all attended the funeral seemed void of sincerity, and I wanted, so badly, to give him more than my sympathy. I wanted him to feel, despite the death of a woman he had served with patience and grace for more than half a century, that he possessed significance for me, that he was responsible for the person I was today. I wanted to give him the agency he had lost.
But witnessing the grief of another is immobilizing—frustrating and trying if it’s the grief of someone you care about. My Korean was awful, and I couldn’t seem to do anything for him except insist that I sleep on the floor and he in my bed (the crusade failed). It seemed as though all I could do was watch him break.
But once my bedroom floor was swept clean of his presence, I began to wonder if I had thought it out all wrong. Perhaps people can be strong in the broken places, as Hemingway once intimated. Most importantly, perhaps we are only broken because we care for others—and maybe that makes the grief worth it. His was a life of sacrifice, one where you break because there is someone worth hurting for. And maybe this brokenness is exactly what makes my grandfather one of the few people I wholly admire.
On my dresser, my grandfather left behind a piece of paper folded four times over with the edges tucked underneath each other to form a miniature plait. It looks like a house. I think of it when I also think about what he told me a few days ago on the phone: “Inhae, live kindly.” 
It’s not a mandate I presume to have fulfilled—in fact, it’s one I have flouted on more occasions than I like to admit. But he has entrusted me with this task, and I delight in the weight of its importance. That’s when I know that the past is not so lost. That’s when I know that he has fixed me—that we can only be whole because we break for each other.
