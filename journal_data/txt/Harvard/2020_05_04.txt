To the Editor:
Thank you for the opportunity to share a few comments regarding your recent article, “The End of the Harvard Century.”
I have worked extremely hard for decades to engage with China in a principled manner. Over the years, I have hosted innumerable scholars, lawyers, activists, and programs concerned with all manner of sensitive issues related to China, including Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, dissidents, the South China Sea, censorship, trade, IP infringement, corruption, and more. These included Teng Biao, who I readily invited to spend a year at Harvard when he first arrived in the United States after fleeing China and for whom I tried hard to open opportunities into the intellectual life of Harvard Law School throughout the year. My writing, both academic and general, has consistently argued for the importance of human rights and the rule of law in China for more than 30 years. And I have been heavily involved in pro bono work regarding rights and legal development in the People’s Republic of China from 1982 onward.
My hope is for students to be exposed to a broad range of ideas (which is why I invited Mr. Teng, among others, to speak in my class in the spring of 2015) and to form their own judgments about China's past and present. I have always encouraged open dialogue and debate at the Law School — as my colleagues, students and hundreds of others can attest (and as many have underscored since the article's publication). Endeavoring to take full account of both China's successes and its failures (including, most importantly, with respect to human rights) is constantly challenging, but critical and energizing.
I did ask that the event Mr. Teng was planning to hold timed to coincide with former University President Drew G. Faust meeting the Chinese President be postponed until after she had concluded her short Beijing visit because I thought that timing might harm Harvard activity there (including regarding academic, scientific, humanitarian and rights matters). As the person who had first invited Mr. Teng to Harvard, I felt some responsibility for whatever impact his undertakings might have for others at the university. Contrary to the article's speculation, there were no secret or other requests from anyone in China or at Harvard about it. Prior to that point, Mr. Teng had freely and frequently used the year to speak publicly on human rights, politics, and any other issues he wished, and it was my expectation that this particular event could and would be held later in the spring of 2015. I did not ask that my conversation with him on that or any other topic be kept secret.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Protect yourself and don’t wear masks,” said my mom, who had been staying at home for two months in Beijing due to coronavirus, in March. When I asked her why, since the virus was starting to hit the United States hard, she explained, “You are Chinese. People will beat you up. Wait until the white people wear masks first.”
Yes, I am a Chinese student in America. But I am not the virus — nor are millions of other Asians in the country.
I hate the coronavirus. I hate the fact that the coronavirus is weakening and killing people all around the world. I have friends and family members of friends here in the U.S. who have gotten sick or even died. And I feel so useless that I can’t do much to stop it.
Recently, some people, including top leaders in this country, magically transformed the coronavirus into the “Chinese virus.” Asian people are getting yelled at, coughed at, and even attacked in the streets. In the past month, the Stop AAPI Hate center has received almost 1,500 reports of coronavirus discrimination from Asian Americans across the nation. I’ve never heard that not eating Chinese noodles or fried rice could make the virus go away. But it seems that blaming and hurting people from other racial groups can make some people feel better.
I still remember, two years ago, after a flight of almost twenty hours, I arrived here in America from China. Many of the amazing professors, classmates, and friends at the Kennedy School who have made me feel like I have a second home here, told me: “This is America. This is the land of equality, of democracy, of freedom of speech, of the great values and opportunities that many other countries cannot compete with. And here, we learn to work together with others and help people around the world to achieve such great values and opportunities.”
Unfortunately, I have seen that this is not always the case. I have seen cases where equality depends on race and gender. I have seen cases where international cooperation is just a nice way to say international competition. And increasingly, as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, I have seen cases where freedom of speech has led to irresponsible, hateful, xenophobic comments.
But I still believe in those ideals. I know we can be much nicer to each other and we can do much better together.
It is true that the first case of coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. Early denials there of the truth about the virus cost lives. But we learned that responsibility to the truth and to the public are keys to alleviating the problem. Many healthcare workers, such as Dr. Li Wenliang from Wuhan, sacrificed their lives to such responsibility. It is their hard work, as well as people’s caring and support, that got the virus under control. It is not racism or scandal that made people feel better.
Blaming and hurting each other can never lead us to the real solutions to the health crisis, which are science and cooperation. While some people use their freedom of speech to vent, to say hateful things, and to blame others, we, my colleagues and friends, have the responsibility not to abuse freedom of speech. We have the responsibility to use our freedom of speech to counter the hateful words and to show support for fellow human beings, especially those who are in trouble and in pain.
We are frustrated, we are tired, we are depressed, we are lonely. I am not saying that Asians are more hurt than many others, who may be more physically, financially, or mentally vulnerable. But while the coronavirus is causing people to be physically separated, we should not let it cut our emotional ties. It is not the U.S. against China. It is human against coronavirus.
So please stop calling it the Chinese virus. Use your words, use your actions, and use your influence to stop conducting and tolerating xenophobic languages and racist behaviors. Please show support and empathy for your fellow human beings. I am convinced that with our caring, our support, our responsibility for each other, we, all the people around the world, will win the war against the coronavirus and win the war against racism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 20, 2020, a group of philosophers officially began accepting article submissions for the Journal of Controversial Ideas, an open-access and peer-reviewed journal designed to promote academic freedom. It offers “a forum for careful, rigorous, unpolemical [sic] discussion of issues that are widely considered controversial, in the sense that certain views about them might be regarded by many people as morally, socially, or ideologically objectionable or offensive.”
One of its co-founders, Francesca Minerva, reportedly received death threats and struggled to secure employment due to an article she published on the permissibility of newborn infanticide. Minerva noted that many of her colleagues conducting climate change research also received death threats, insults, and hostility from the public. If academic freedom “has an instrumental value in order to get closer to the truth,” Minerva said, “we should offer this opportunity of a platform for ideas that are very good, or very important, but also controversial.”
Historically, philosophy has generated countless unpopular views, from the idea that we’re all brains-in-a-vat, to radical skepticism about moral truths, and misanthropic antinatalism (roughly, the belief that it’s ‘better never to have been born’). In juggling these difficult and varied problems, however, philosophical explorations have never remained mere dogmas. Controversial ideas have been either ruthlessly challenged, or largely accepted by the mainstream, but hardly silenced.
Free and open discussion by individuals committed to the pursuit of truth has been essential to this explanation-seeking discipline. The constant flux of ideas and the lack of convergence on singular, uncontested truths has, arguably, generated seemingly irresolvable disagreements and stymied philosophical progress. But this pointed unpointedness is what makes philosophy intrinsically valuable. Unlike many other concentrations, philosophy both begins and ends with wonder. Does life have meaning? Are there objective moral truths? What is the mind and self-identity? It’s about the systematic process of refining big questions frequently and fearlessly, albeit to no answer.
The practice of putting forth inflammatory, bad-faith ideas in the wrong forums, dispositively, and without the prospect that they could be criticized is diametrically opposed to this free and open process of questioning. The use of national briefing platforms for insensitive pandemic brainstorming, the exploitation of powerful academic platforms to breed toxic culture and senseless speculations, and the intentional spread of fake news and cyber propaganda, we think, are rightfully met with condemnation and censure.
Heedless thought and talk must be guided by standards of rigorous academic scrutiny and ethical discretion. Ideators must find the right time and place for discussing vexatious and thwarting ideas. The Journal of Controversial Ideas might be one of them. But the White House is not.
If used in the right platforms with the right intentions, controversial conversations can become necessary guards of truth. Even when mainstream ideas are true or justified, closing conversation incurs the risk of fashioning dead dogmas instead of living truths. Commonly accepted ideas risk being shelved on the archives of unchallenged assumption rather than hammered into robust positions, vivified through iterative re-interrogation.
When confronting differences, however, all members of the conversation committed to truth must be willing to listen attentively to one another, consider each viewpoint charitably, and represent each other’s perspectives with the benefit of the doubt. The pursuit of knowledge should be undertaken against the backdrop of a respectful and mindful community, one that is willing to embrace the virtues of humility, open-mindedness, and cooperation. Philosophical discourse must be met with philosophical discourse, not violence and physical intimidation.
Especially in today’s culture where we prefer quick and conclusive answers over complex and perplexing questions — where black box algorithmic outputs overshadow careful ethical inquiry — philosophical conversation remains all-the-more important. Not all puzzles are solvable through the scientific method. The justification of principles, for instance, requires more than the instant facts available at our fingertips. Errors arise when we try to reduce debates on normativity to one-sided datasets, observations, and certainty.
Groundbreaking neuroscience does not put an end to the normative intuitions that ground neuroscientific results. Even in classrooms, educators face challenging questions of equity and justice. Policy-makers and corporate authorities struggle to account for what we owe, morally, to future generations, non-citizens, oppressed groups, and most importantly, to humanity.
As the world becomes more quantifiable, the realm of normativity must not be forgotten. Above and beyond its arguments and objections, philosophy should strive to facilitate an enterprising, unflagging marketplace of ideas — reinvestigating the old, unearthing the new, in search of lost truths — even if the very process of acquiring those truths is an unending task.
To do so, we must start by creating conversation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School will offer incoming MBA students the option to defer their enrollment for one to two years in light of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Business School Managing Director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid, Chad I. Losee announced last week.
Losee wrote in a blog post published on the Business School’s website that the school decided to offer the deferrals because, for some students who applied before the pandemic escalated in the United States, the “timing may no longer be workable.”
Under the new system, students will not choose whether to defer their enrollment for one year or two; instead, they will request a deferral, and Business School administrators will track the total number of requests and spread the students out over the classes of 2023 and 2024.
Losee wrote that the school will draw from its waitlist to “balance” the class of 2022 — though he clarified it will not add more admission rounds or re-evaluate denied candidates from prior rounds.
“Our learning model depends on bringing together exceptional leaders with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We are steadfast in our commitment to that model, so to sustain it, if we need to enroll a smaller class in August than our typical 930, we may do so,” he wrote.
The Business School’s April 27 announcement came shortly after University Provost Alan M. Garber wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates that the University will hold classes in the fall, dispelling the possibility of a delayed start to the semester due to the pandemic. Decisions over whether those classes will be held in person or online, however, remain to be made.
Losee added that despite the educational disruptions the coronavirus has wrought, the Business School still believes that there are “compelling reasons” for some admits to avoid the deferral and choose to enroll this fall.
“In any scenario, at HBS we are committed to providing an outstanding experience and have engaged teams of faculty, staff, students, and alumni to develop an extraordinary fall semester inside and outside the classroom,” he wrote.
Moreover, despite the financial impact of the pandemic, the Business School’s “commitment to a robust need-based scholarship program will not change,” Losee wrote. He added that the school expanded its financial aid portfolio and need-based scholarship offerings in recent years.
“HBS is an investment that pays dividends over a lifetime, and we are as committed as ever to making HBS affordable for all,” Losee wrote.
Members of the Business School’s Class of 2022 will be able to request deferrals between May 15 and June 1, according to Poets&Quants, a business blog.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first monthly meeting since faculty and students cleared Harvard’s campus due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote over Zoom on course lists for the fall semester Tuesday, as well as a motion to simplify procedures for simultaneous enrollment.
Though Harvard has committed to holding courses in the fall, FAS has still not decided whether its classes will take place online or in person. It will reach a final decision on the format of the fall semester no later than July, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced April 28.
Faculty will vote Tuesday on whether to approve a preliminary list of courses for both the Extension School and the FAS. The FAS course list will be made public on my.harvard in June.
Extension School courses will likely take place exclusively online in the fall, Interim Dean of the Division of Continuing Education Henry H. Leitner wrote in a letter to the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest governing body.
“These are not normal times, and it is hard to plan when we don’t know if we will be able to conduct courses on campus or if we will continue to work remotely,” he wrote. “It is likely that we will offer only online (web conference) courses in the fall, with the hope that we will be able to offer some on campus courses in January and spring.”
More than 70 percent of the courses the Extension School offered during the 2019-2020 academic year took place online, though some of these courses also featured on-campus components, according to Leitner.
He added the Extension School will likely offer no courses with required on-campus components in the fall, citing potential risks such courses might pose for students flying in from other locations.
Faculty previously discussed the simultaneous enrollment legislation during its meeting in March. Because the motion is considered substantive, voting was scheduled to take place during the meeting after it was first introduced; April’s meeting was canceled over insufficient business.
Currently, FAS allows simultaneous enrollment under one of three circumstances: when one of the course heads agrees to provide “hour-for-hour direct and personal compensatory instruction” for missed class time; when lectures are available on videotape, and a student will miss no more than one-third of them; or when a senior needs to take both courses to fulfill graduation requirements. Under all three circumstances, students must submit a petition to the Administrative Board to enroll.
Under the proposed revision, the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy will grant three-year blanket waivers to courses that meet certain criteria, allowing students to simultaneously enroll in them without petitioning. In other cases, students still must petition as usual.
The new policy would be reflected in the College’s updated student handbook for the 2020-21 school year. Separately, the faculty will also vote Tuesday on a package of handbook changes submitted by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
Khurana’s proposed changes would extend the final deadline by which students can withdraw from courses from the 7th Monday to the 11th Monday of the term.
When students withdraw from a course, the course still appears on their transcript, but they do not receive credit for it — instead of a letter grade, the course is marked with the notation “WD.” Currently, students only have two weeks between the 5th Monday — the College’s deadline to drop a course and have it removed from a student’s transcript — and the 7th Monday withdrawal deadline.
“This change will bring Harvard College’s practice in line of those with peer institutions,” Khurana wrote in his proposal. “The withdrawal deadline of Ivy peers ranges from the ninth week of the term to the last day of classes.”
Within the handbook changes, Khurana also proposed prorating course requirements for students who conduct term-time study abroad in the same manner the College prorates grades for transfer and Advanced Standing students. Students who study abroad for two semesters would only need 96 credits to graduate and 72 to qualify for honors, rather than the standard 128 credits to graduate and 96 to qualify for honors.
Prorating requirements for students who study abroad is normal practice for the Registrar, but Tuesday’s vote would formalize the policy, Khurana wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As undergraduates await news of whether the fall semester will continue remotely, many students say they are entertaining taking leaves of absence.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in an email to affiliates last month that Harvard’s courses would resume in September, whether online or in-person. Administrators will make their decision no later than July about course formats, they added.
In the case that the College conducts the semester online, several undergraduates said they would consider petitioning to take a leave. Some said they are weighing a multitude of factors such as educational quality and social life against potential disincentives, such as possibly losing their financial aid or housing upon their return.
Several students leaning towards taking leaves questioned whether remote classes are adequate substitutes for their on-campus equivalents.
David A. Paffenholz ’22 said the quality of online classes was foremost in his considerations over whether to take a leave of absence next fall.
“The academic experience is really quite different on Zoom versus in the classroom, particularly being able to see the rest of the class face to face, interact with others while walking into the classroom and chatting about the class, and then also the interaction with professors,” Paffenholz said.
Elijah McGill ’23 also said he would rather take time off than lose out on a semester in Cambridge should Harvard resume remotely this fall.
“Harvard is expensive. And I don't think that online education is worth that much money,” he said.
Beyond doubts over the quality of remote learning, students also expressed concerns about losing a semester of opportunities to socialize.
“The Harvard experience is so much more than just the academics,” Paffenholz said. “Being able to be with friends, be on campus, enjoy extracurricular activities, and kind of the other social interactions that happen outside of class are very, very difficult to replicate in an online format.”
Duke Moon ’23 — who anticipated taking two years off to complete his mandatory military service in South Korea — also said he would miss the social parts of undergraduate life. He wrote in an email that if courses resume online next fall, he would consider taking a leave to maximize the amount of time he could spend with his friends on campus.
“The time I get to spend with my friends on campus is more valuable than anything else Harvard can possibly offer me, so I’m leaning towards the option of enlisting this fall — that way I can come back in Fall 2022 and have another full year with my friends (they’ll be seniors and I’ll be a sophomore, but that’s fine),” he wrote.
Still, uncertainty over the College’s leave policy for the fall has tempered some students’ desire to petition for a leave.
Anticipating a higher-than-normal number of leave requests, some questioned how the College will be able to accommodate undergraduates upon their return. McGill said he thinks there is a “strong sense of uncertainty” among undergraduates surrounding whether students who choose to take this coming fall off will face any repercussions or disincentives from the College.
“If we're online, and there was a no-consequence policy of leave, I’d say right now that I would definitely take that,” he said.
McGill said, however, that the potential imposition of consequences would make him reconsider — the prospect of losing his financial aid upon his return in particular.
“Harvard isn't realistic for me without financial aid,” he said. “So far I've just been waiting until there's something official about that just because there's been so many things flying back and forth on either side of that debate.”
Aarushi H. Shah ’21 said she would take a leave of absence to care for her family members, including her father who is recovering from COVID-19, her sister who is due in August, and her elderly grandmother.
“I'm more than just a student,” she said. “I’m the healthiest in the family and so I feel the responsibility to give my parents, my sister, my grandma as much attention and dedication that I can.”
Shah said she worries taking a leave of absence may further financially burden her family by forcing her to delay applying to graduate school. Like McGill, she said she wondered if the decision would affect her ability to receive financial aid and participate in federal work study.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences fall planning committee is currently reviewing all options for the fall term. She added that the committee believes addressing student policies like those related to leaves of absence is “critical.”
“These policies need to be addressed holistically so that students can make informed decisions,” Dane wrote. “The College’s office of institutional research is in the process of collecting information and feedback from our students to help inform the College’s important planning work.”
“The current policies listed in the Handbook remain unchanged,” she added.
The Harvard College handbook states that student recipients of scholarships or financial aid should consult the Griffin Financial Aid Office concerning the “financial implications” of going on leave. The handbook also counts students returning from a leave of absence who have filed a Returning Student Housing Application among “those who will ordinarily be housed.”
Students who return from a leave that has extended beyond two years — as well as students who fail to file their housing application by its due date — can expect to be placed on a wait list and receive housing on a “space-available basis.”
Ultimately, Moon wrote that he hopes administrators consider student input as they make their decisions about fall semester leave policy.
“These are uncertain times for everybody, and no matter what happens, I just hope that Harvard allows its students the utmost flexibility and generosity,” Moon wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 joined deans from 20 law schools across the country in a letter to the New York Court of Appeals advocating for measures to allow more students to take the New York bar exam while respecting public health concerns.
The letter, sent May 1, followed an announcement from the New York Board of Law Examiners stating it would limit the seating available for its September 9-10 administration of the exam and give priority to students who graduated from one of the fifteen law schools within New York State.
“The Board likely will not be able to seat all applicants who wish to take the exam,” the Board’s statement reads.
The deans who collectively penned the letter wrote that they represent the non-New York based law schools with the largest number of students who sit for the New York exam, noting that more than 2,000 J.D. and LL.M. graduates took the exam in 2019. Those schools include Yale, Stanford, and the University of Pennsylvania, among others.
The letter acknowledges the safety concerns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic that prompted the examination restrictions and commends the work done by the Court and the Board of Examiners throughout the crisis.
“We recognize that the Court’s decision is framed against the need to protect public health in the midst of a pandemic that has brought devastating loss of life, with New York hit especially hard,” it reads.
The letter argues the Court’s approach will negatively impact the many students who planned to take the New York exam in the summer or fall, especially those who already moved back to the state or do not have the financial resources to wait longer for their license to practice law.
“We worry that the resulting delay in the exam’s administration and admission to practice will fall hardest on the most economically vulnerable of our graduates and on those whose continued presence in the United States will be compromised by the delay,” the letter reads.
It asks for the Court of Appeals to consider a variety of measures that would allow out-of-state graduates to still take the bar exam, such as offering a second exam date on September 30-October 1 or developing an online bar exam. It also suggests the Court could increase the number of seats available for the exam by adding new locations either within New York or at the signatory schools.
Manning previously joined the deans from all nine Massachusetts law schools in writing an April 15 letter to the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court following the postponement of the Massachusetts bar exam.
This earlier letter explained that the Court’s proposed implementation of a new online exam that tests Massachusetts law would not provide a feasible alternative to the bar exam for many students, especially since the pandemic has already limited the ability of some students to study.
The letter asked the Court to grant graduates the temporary authority to practice law in Massachusetts provided they work under a supervising lawyer and have scored at least 85 on the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam.
“We encourage the Court to consider this measured, limited, and temporary practice authority for law school graduates,” it reads. “The adoption of such an approach would mitigate the professional and personal impact on these future lawyers while ensuring necessary and appropriate protections for the public.”
Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells addressed the limitations on the New York bar exam in an email to the Class of 2020 on Saturday and assured students of the school’s continued efforts to advocate for its students.
“We are surprised and disappointed by this decision and share the concerns many of you have expressed about the disruption this may cause as you embark on new careers,” she wrote. “We at HLS are working on potential next steps to support graduating students.”

A member of the Cambridge Police Department inadvertently tweeted from the official CPD account on Sunday afternoon criticizing United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).
In response to Kennedy’s statement regarding PPE distribution, the tweet labeled Kennedy as a “liberal fucking jerk who just happens to be better than the clown he’s running against” — a reference to Kennedy’s bid to unseat Markey.
Shortly after the tweet went live, Cambridge Police Department issued an apology addressing the accidental “political commentary,” which has since been deleted, according to an email sent by CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick on Sunday evening.
In its apology, the department characterized the tweet as “inappropriate, unprofessional and disrespectful.”
“While the post was quickly removed, the concerning statements cannot be erased,” CPD tweeted. “These actions do not reflect the professionalism that we as a department take great pride in & we want to sincerely apologize to the Congressman and those individuals the statement was directed at.”
CPD Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. has reached out to Markey and Kennedy’s offices to apologize on CPD’s behalf, Warnick wrote.
Warnick added that the contents of the tweet were, as the department wrote, “inappropriate, unprofessional and disrespectful” even if it was sent from the employee’s personal account.
The department will review the incident before dealing any punishment, Warnick wrote. Kennedy’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday evening.
