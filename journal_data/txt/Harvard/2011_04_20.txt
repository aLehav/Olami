After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been unusually sunny for a few months now, past the spring solstice, but just before the trees are shocked with leaves. You’ve probably felt much happier (you don’t know why), even as the hours at Lamont mount, and projects and papers loom in the just-in-the-distance reading period.
It’s spring. And because our lives have been spent almost exclusively as students, spring spells a strange mix of its primordial rebirth and, because of the academic calendar, of ending.
So, in this confusing state of looking forward and of looking back I, your faithful art-and-science columnist, offer you, dear readers, some general thoughts on art and science as my farewell.
Art and science seem to span two disparate facets of experience. ‘Art’ and its relative, ‘artifice,’ imply a sense of production, of creation. The etymon of ‘poetry’ is ‘poeien,’ the Greek for ‘to create.’ ‘Science,’ on the other hand, comes from the Latin ‘scire,’ for ‘to know.’ Art tends to cling to areas of paradox and mystery, uncertain places from which it can build. Science seeks to render the world intelligible by mathematical formalism. There is a way, then, in which the two naturally tend towards opposite poles.
What I’d like to think about in this column is the value of bringing artistic attention to the areas explored by science. Because art tends toward mystery, and the role of science is to dispel mystery, it is easy for the artist to turn his eye away from science’s domain.
But this is a terrible mistake. True, science is daily dispelling mysteries. Yet for each mystery that science dispels, a new mystery is left in its wake.
The story that modern science tells us about ourselves is a strange one. The advancement of medicine and neuroscience has resulted in longer, healthier lives. But our obsession with life (a well-warranted obsession) has shifted our attention almost exclusively to the body. We find ourselves in a neo-dualism, concentrating our efforts on preserving the vessel encasing the invisible ‘I.’ Books like Jonah Lehrer’s “Proust was a Neuroscientist” or Daniel Levitin’s “This is Your Brain on Music” circumvent that irreducible subjectivity by explaining art merely in terms of the brain. We have become so proficient at investigating and maintaining the body, so thorough, that we find fewer and fewer places to understand the possibility of the transcendental self we cannot but believe we are.
But who is the implied possessor of this ‘your brain?’ This is the central paradox of our collective belief: that the body is indifferent to the life that so desperately clings to it, yet this thoroughly mechanized body is nevertheless our only means of living.
The will to create exists at the edges of the will to know. Art breathes easiest in these places of genuine mystery: where the system of our beliefs creates contradictions and paradoxes that must give us pause. We exist in a strange world, where the admirable successes of medicine and neuroscience have distorted our sense of self. We should not lament that science has altered the way we see ourselves as members of this world. It is hard to do anything but believe in what contemporary science holds. It is the artist’s duty not to resist science, but to imaginatively represent those areas toward which science desperately yearns, but cannot reach.
Every new truth that science leaves us necessarily begets another mystery. If we do not constantly bring our artistic sensibilities to these mysteries, we are doing both science and humanity a terrible disservice. Already we have begun to lose faith in the arts. The president looked into the television camera during the State of the Union and told the children of our country to study math and science. In Stephen Hawking’s new book, “The Grand Design,” he carelessly dismisses the questions of philosophy, demeaning them to a dependent clause: “Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have becomes the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.”
Science is unimaginably valuable. We should certainly do more than we are currently doing to promote the study of math and science in our public schools. But it is also of the utmost importance that we think critically and artistically about science. Because ultimately science, that Latin ‘scire,’ is that part of the soul that pulses with the will to know. Science and art are two human ways of facing the Mystery: dispelling it in the first case, imaginatively rendering it in the second. The Mystery, fueling our minds and our hearts, must be continually confronted. It’s what makes us human, recognizing it and facing it. Science is only inhuman when we fail to bring our artistic senses to it: there is no reason why our confidence in the power of science should not be commensurate with our confidence in the power of art.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This time next year I will almost certainly be in New York. As with most seniors going into the arts, my future holds little certainty—I have no set plans for post-graduation, no job, no apartment—yet when people ask me what I’m doing next year, I invariably reply with a matter-of-fact “I’m moving to New York.”
Though I routinely deliver these responses with a confident air, I’ve recently found my conviction colored by shades of self-doubt. There’s something inherently unsettling about the absolute certainty of my decision to move to New York. To be blunt, I scarcely even considered other cities—it just seemed like the only natural, logical destination. I never even questioned New York’s status as the unrivalled center of the American theater scene.
Granted, New York is a hotbed for the performing arts—no other city in America can compete with the multitude of opportunities for young actors, designers, and directors that New York offers. What disturbs me, however, is my subconscious compulsion to move there. It’s not that I simply see New York as the opportune place for pursuing theater—I’ve somehow been conditioned to believe that it’s the only city for theater.
This prejudice is by no means unique to me. It is, in fact, symptomatic of a situation that affects the entire theatrical community. I often wonder if it is sensible for American theater to revolve so exclusively around a single hegemonic center; and I’m not the first to feel uncomfortable with New York’s singular preeminence. This exact sentiment, in fact, is what led to the development of what we now know as regional theater.
In the 1960s, a small vanguard of directors began founding regional theater companies in cities across America—among them was Robert Brustein, the prominent director and theater critic who founded Yale Repertory Theater in 1966 and Harvard’s American Repertory Theater in 1980. In his 1988 essay “Reimagining the Process” Brustein discusses the proliferation of regional theaters as a movement “to decentralize American theatre in the belief that it was unhealthy to originate so much stage activity in one cultural capital (New York).”
These regional theaters were established in reaction to the prevailing practice of mounting Broadway “try-outs” in cities across America. Essentially, producers would put up shows intended for Broadway in smaller towns, refine them there, and then move the show to the Great White Way with the cast and staff in tow. Decrying this culture, Brustein deemed it “a McTheatre network resembling the franchising of McDonald’s.”
Beyond its drive toward geographical diversity, this burgeoning regionalist doctrine was grounded in the idea of theater as community. Often called “resident” theaters, these companies were conceived to be, according to Brustein, “permanent ensembles of actors, directors, designers, and administrative staff … [creating] a potentially more enduring theatrical art than pickup casts assembled for a single throw.”
Regional theater was intended to be a system of theater that fostered relationships between artists and local communities. Unfortunately, American theater has only become more entrenched in New York since the rise of the regional theater. In 2010, the Broadway League reported that 63% of Broadway audiences were tourists. For those who can’t make the pilgrimage to New York, Broadway Across America replicates those productions in over 40 cities across America and Canada. Instead of turning to their local communities for productions, theatergoers across the continent are consuming mass-produced spectacles like “Wicked” or “The Lion King”. These productions have both been mounted in various cities with countless casts and crews. Contrary to the goal of regional theater, they are divorced from any semblance of local or interpersonal connection.
Admittedly, New York always has been and probably always will be the capital of American theater. However, New York’s theatrical monopoly deeply concerns me. The consolidation of theatrical production in New York creates a stratified system of theater in which other cities are dominated by commodified spectacles dispatched from the Big Apple.
To that end, I have some reservations about admitting I’ll still most likely move there in August. Granted, I have no intention of working on Broadway, and the city is brimming with non-commercial theater much more suited to my tastes. However, I can’t help but equivocate about my choice to move there. I could argue that I’m simply pursuing my best career prospects, but I feel like I’m turning a blind eye to what my relocation implies in a broader sense. By going to New York, I might be unintentionally reinforcing New York’s dominance over theater in America. Perhaps I’m overestimating the impact of my own career choices. But deep down, I can’t help but wonder if I’d be better off as a resident of New York or working in a resident theater, cultivating a more diverse American theater.

Many aspiring doctors probably think the undergraduate pre-med track is demanding enough as is. In a recent report, however, a committee of the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended significant changes to the much-dreaded Medical College Admission Test. Aside from adding an extra 90 minutes to the already five-and-a-half-hour MCAT, the AAMC plans on dividing the test into four sections—two of which will consist of “behavioral and social sciences” and “critical analysis and reasoning.”
The AAMC’s report explained that the changes are designed to draw greater attention to certain concepts in medicine, including a greater focus on “cultural and social sensitivity.” Although the report does not volunteer a precise meaning of this last phrase, it seems safe to guess that people skills—anything ranging from bedside manner to multicultural awareness—will soon feature on the revised MCAT, which will come into place in 2015. The decision to test the cultural and social skills of aspiring undergraduate doctors is intriguing. Of course, effective doctors should exhibit first-rate people skills, and, for patients, there are few parts of a hospital experience as dispiriting as an abrasive doctor.
In that sense, this aspect of the MCAT’s new requirements can only be a positive addition. If the ultimate AAMC’s ultimate goal, however, is to produce a generation of culturally sensitive doctors, its decision to test this quality as a prerequisite for medical school admission makes less sense. The MCAT, grueling enough as it is, has worked in the past by examining whether students are academically prepared to study to be a doctor.  The point of this exam should be to gauge aptitude and potential, not whether students are already fully trained doctors before starting medical school.
Like any other exam, the MCAT’s ability to test people skills can ultimately only be as effective as trying to decide whether an applicant is a nice person without ever meeting them. To examine a student’s knowledge of biochemistry is one thing, but to test out someone’s ability to relate to a patient is another. In all likelihood, students—in a twist of irony—will be forced to prepare for this aspect of the new test just as they study for the rest of the MCAT: by memorizing material and practicing cultural sensitivity questions, whatever those may be.
Undergraduates may learn something in the process, but it is doubtful whether this kind of method can accurately test real personal and social skills. To give a flavor of what’s likely to come, Amjed Saffarini, executive director of pre-health programs at Kaplan Test Prep, said that the new requirements would result in possibly the biggest changes ever to the MCAT’s curriculum. It is not hard to imagine a new “cultural and social skills” chapter in Kaplan’s revised guide to the exam. Like the standardized test for College entry, the AAMC will extend the MCAT into a test of the supposedly un-learnable, and, in doing so, transform medical social skills into the latest discipline of exam studying. But in that this kind of learning may force students to memorize details, it may not necessarily produce the desired effect. In fact, if different cultural attitudes to medicine are to be quickly regurgitated on the exam, one has to wonder about the potential for cultural stereotyping.
This particular addition will also contribute to the increased time of an already very long exam. With this in mind, the benefit of examining personal skills seems even more unlikely to outweigh the cost to a student’s performance and the ability to assess this accurately.
It seems ironic that with the host of requirements many pre-med students must already fulfill to apply for medical school, the AAMC has decided that cultural sensitivity must be tested earlier on. Focused on taking the courses, doing medical work over the summer, and meeting an exacting GPA cut-off, many students never have the time to pursue divergent extra-curricular interests, let alone go abroad for a semester.  If anything, allowing more flexibility in pre-med requirements will do more to promote cultural awareness and people skills than a mere alteration to an exam.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s that time again. Every four years, a plethora of presidential hopefuls creep out of the political woodwork.  Often, the general public has never heard of many of them and pays them no attention until the primaries heat up and it is time to decide which candidate to support. However, this presidential season brings a new twist to the 2012 elections, with a rather well-known figure debating his interest in the United States presidency. A world-renowned business mogul and a famous television personality, could he possibly be the next president of the United States? One would hope not.
Meet Donald Trump.
The man everyone knows from his television show “The Apprentice” and for his very public personal life is becoming more and more active in the American political scene. Alarmingly, a significant portion of the American public seems to approve. A recent poll conducted by CNN that asked Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents who they would support for the presidential nomination showed Donald Trump tied with Mike Huckabee for the lead with 19 percent. For a man who has done nothing to prove himself capable of successfully running the world’s most powerful nation and who is mostly known for his catchphrase “you’re fired,” Trump does not deserve the kind of immense support and recognition the American public is bestowing on him.
In the past, American voters have received a lot of criticism for being apathetic and uninformed. Critics argue that many Americans do not take the time to learn about political issues and candidates before making important decisions at the polls every November. Although there are Americans who watch the news, read articles, and do their research before making well-informed decisions, many in support of Trump are simply playing into the stereotype by trusting a man with limited credentials to lead the nation, and by basing their support on his hyped-up media personality.
Trump’s early lead and the support so far for his 2012 election run is alarming in its illustration of the power that pop culture holds in society today. Not enough Americans are aware of the fact that Trump filed for corporate bankruptcy in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009, and instead voters are letting Trump’s television fame gain him credibility in the polls. It is worrisome that American society looks past the substance to be fooled by Trump’s media personality. His support, based on the public’s fascination and obsession with the media, is reminiscent of Rutgers University’s decision to pay “Jersey Shore” reality star Snooki $32,000 for coming to speak to its students, a sum that was larger than the university paid keynote commencement speaker, Nobel and Pulitzer prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison.
The American public needs to reevaluate its standards and recognize that it is important to consider pertinent information when making important decisions such as who will lead the nation next. An elaborate comb-over and the ability to enthusiastically say, “You’re fired!” is not nearly enough to influence a decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a much-vaunted recent radio broadcast by Britain’s BBC, the author Zadie Smith, in an effort to save her local library, denounced government spending cuts and the closure of public libraries. The trouble, though, was that Smith did not just attack library cuts  but rather what she saw to be the power forcing the hand of the local councils making these cuts—Britain’s privately educated leaders. Last week, her effort ended in failure when the library she had grown up visiting was closed along with five others.
As many commentators have since pointed out, the decision to axe libraries is ultimately made not by wealthy British conservatives, but instead by local politicians who decide that library money is the least controversial thing to do away with. Smith’s case wasn’t helped by her suggestion that her mother stole books from their library, an allegation denied by her mother. Others are far more skeptical about the remaining value of libraries. In an op-ed last week titled “It is the fate of libraries to die,” The Financial Times’ Christopher Caldwell went so far as to argue that libraries’ lending practices go against the Internet’s spirit of open exchange of information.
Both Smith and Caldwell are wrong, in their own ways. Smith’s criticism of closing libraries confused individual decisions with a broad mentality in society. Caldwell (inadvertently perhaps) articulated this mentality, that the Internet is replacing the need for libraries. Yet Smith is also right: We close libraries at our own risk, now more than ever in the digital age.
The digital revolution, so goes the thinking, has turned books and libraries into dinosaurs, and the preserve of retired people. Past studies in Britain have suggested that all public libraries could be shut by 2020. Everywhere, library funding is under pressure. It’s not hard to see how this attitude originates: Last month, electronic book sales outsold all single format print in the United   States. Every day more and more books are digitized and made available online. A New   York district judge recently thwarted Google’s ambition of digitizing every book ever printed, deeming its proposal in violation of anti-trust law. Even so, the scale of Google’s plan alone speaks volumes about how far digital material has come in the last five years. If someone could read any book ever published from any location, then surely digital material makes going to the library obsolete.
Yet here we encounter a great misconception.  Aside from Google’s own potential to establish a commercial monopoly on information, it is exactly in the unknown expanse of what Google offers that the Internet presents its great limitations. When I spoke to Robert C. Darnton ’60, the director of the Harvard University Library, he argued that “people get lost in cyberspace.” This perspective is not a unique one; the author Neil Gaiman said last year that the Internet has created an age of “too much information.” Both argue that far from being replaced, libraries must continue to play an important role in public life to help us sort through the Internet.
Darnton points to the fundamental role of the “library as space,” where librarians and other resources play a “service role” in helping people to access information. Traditionally, this information has been confined within the walls of an institution; in the future it will increasingly be accessed digitally. Because the Internet is harder to sort through than a library catalog, there’s a strong case that a library’s core services are actually becoming much more important.
At the same time, the future of digital books is unclear. While GoogleBooks’ scheme has been thwarted—maybe terminally—other vast digitization projects are moving forward, not least of all Harvard’s own Digital Public Library of America, which was launched in December of last year with the aim of digitizing out-of-print work from Harvard’ s collection and others across the U.S. The non-profit DPLA then aims to make its material available for free online.
Unlike Google’s plan to purchase copyright from publishers, authors and libraries, DPLA, as an online extension from existing an library, seems much closer to an evolution of traditional modes of access to libraries and their material. Darnton, one of the directors of the project, sees it coming in at a “critical moment where the future of digital books is being determined.” A prominent critic of Google’s own proposal, he sees the “astonishing” early support for the DPLA as cause for optimism. Accompanied by the misconception that the Internet can replace the physical space of a library, he would argue the issue is “one of the really big questions facing this country.”
Whether we end up with Google having its way, Harvard and others offering up the stuff for free, or both, the role of libraries should be the same. If we can synthesize the mobility and (hopefully continuing) accessibility of the Web with traditional ways of learning, the potential benefits of the Internet to education seem limitless. But if we allow digital material to replace imperfectly what has worked well before, we run a serious risk of creating a system that retards learning, by pulling away the foundations of what the Internet can offer. Zadie Smith may be wrong about the underlying factor in closing libraries, but in the end it’s a shame there aren’t more people fighting with her.

Attention Harvard Students! Periodically we publish actions the University has taken to help us move efficiently and safely around campus. Here is our latest bulletin.
Given that John Harvard invented the combustion engine, to honor his memory, and in anticipation of great rejoicing among faculty and administrators, we have recently elevated fuel-burning vehicles to our primary supported mode of transport. All Harvard employees and contractors are henceforth encouraged to move around our campus in whatever manner consumes the most fuel and makes the most noise.
This has led to some changes you may have noticed. All paths wide enough to accommodate vehicles, such as the ones ringing the Old Yard, are now open to traffic. Pedestrians are reminded to yield to all moving vehicles, especially those idling menacingly behind you while you are strolling and enjoying a conversation. These vehicles are probably on a super-important mission, like reloading the Weld vending machines with Diet Coke. If you do happen to walk through Harvard Yard without noticing at least half-a-dozen vehicles, please cherish this anachronistic moment. And then immediately call 5-1212 since it is possible that a zombie invasion is taking place and you are in danger.
To further facilitate vehicular traffic we are revisiting campus traffic signage. As part of our new "Green is the new Red" initiative we are eliminating most stop signs, stop lights and pedestrian crosswalks. Stop signs and lights were generally ignored and crosswalks seemed to generate confusion, so this seems like an overdue simplification. Additionally, at intersections where stop signs have been missing, like the corner of Mill and Plympton Streets, drivers have been trying to hit students for years with limited success. Apparently students have developed excellent car-dodging reflexes and we trust that our new policies will allow you to use them pretty much everywhere. (For those of you new to campus we suggest crossing in groups large enough to sway the moral calculus of rapidly oncoming drivers. Twenty is a good starting point.) Finally, the walk light at the corner of JFK and Memorial drive will be shortened in duration from six seconds to two, and will only appear twice an hour. We trust that this will not inconvenience the agile, quick-moving athletes braving that intersection daily.
Finally, you can't have cars without parking. We know most students don't drive. Driving is a pleasure that's really only appreciated with time, and once you appreciate it you'll understand the importance of parking. PARKING! Now, we know that Yards and Commons and other empty spaces are sometimes considered important for gathering or lounging or whatever it is you non-drivers do when you're not spending hours enjoying Boston gridlock. But you have plenty of places to do those things! Look, we promise not to park in the dining hall, OK? But we're going to park everywhere else. Forget Frisbee, colorful chairs and those quaint white plastic barriers. Just imagine how gleeful the Yard will look shining with chrome! We're going to replace the guard at the Harvard gate with a guy waiving a checkered flag: Just $20 to park in historic Harvard Yard!
We're a bit out of breath from all this car talk, so let's briefly address that unimportant minority of you who get around some other way. We are stepping up our efforts to discourage bike usage on campus since we all know that bikes—unlike cars—are dangerous. Unable to learn the simplest rules of the road, and undeterred by the maze of one-way streets and missing bike lanes we have carefully constructed, bikers seem wedded to the strange idea that pedaling should actually be a faster way of getting around campus. Wrong. Only cars can do that!
So we'll make this real simple: Show proper respect to vehicles powered by polluting fossil fuels, or else. We don't mind if you jump lights, ride bikes without brakes, ride bikes you cannot stop at breakneck speeds, or blast through crowded crosswalks—just don't ever make us slow down. And helmets? Completely optional! The fewer of you clogging our streets with your slow, sustainable pedaling, the better.
Even though we've failed to address one or two esoteric forms of transport used by like, a few weirdoes living in the Co-op, we're running out of time so let's recap.
We all live and work together in a dense urban environment where there is never enough parking. Also polar icecaps are melting. What that all means is that cars are increasingly important, since we will need them to drive inland once the water starts rising. Of almost equal importance is parking, or places to put our cars in the increasingly rare moments we are not using them. But a dedicated task force is responding to this issue, and we can guarantee that Harvard's campus will be completely car-friendly by 2017.

The student committee advocating for the creation of an Innovation for Social Change secondary field will submit the first draft of the proposed curriculum this Friday to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noel Bisson.
The secondary concentration, according to the students spearheading the proposal, aims to “provide students with an interdisciplinary approach to thinking critically about solving societal problems using focused learning, action, and reflection.”
Following the draft submission, the Dean and the student committee will work together to achieve a final curriculum, which they hope to complete by the end of the school year.
A team of students, former School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, and Physics Professor David A. Weitz are currently working together to draft the proposal by the end of the week.
On Monday, four leaders of the student group met with University President Drew G. Faust to pitch their idea, gain Faust’s support, and ask for advice. According to the head of the student committee, Emily K. Harburg ’11, Faust encouraged the students to continue their efforts, and the president said she plans to help them connect with faculty members relevant to the field.
Since their introductory meeting on April 7, the students have assembled a standing committee of 11 faculty members to present their plan to Bisson, exceeding their original goal of 10 members. The committee includes faculty from the psychology, anthropology, and sociology departments as well as several departments across the humanities.
“We are honored to have the support of these faculty members, who are devoted to working with us and getting this proposed secondary passed,” said Kara M. Kubarych ’13, the chair of the faculty outreach sub-committee for the group.
Kubarych added that the group is “confident that the faculty will champion this ground-breaking new program for Harvard undergrads.”
Three faculty members on the standing committee who have formally announced their support are Anthropology Professor Mary M. Steedly, Psychology Professor Ellen J. Langer, and Calestous Juma, professor of the practice of international development at Harvard Kennedy School.
“They’re defining their future and the least faculty can do is give them the benefit of the doubt by lending their support,” said Juma, who has previously worked with students from other universities on similar initiatives.
SEAS has also been a key supporter of the students’ efforts and will likely be the administrative house of the secondary concentration, Kubarych said.
On April 10, the Undergraduate Council passed legislation in support of the secondary concentration.
After the group finalizes the curriculum, the students will submit their program to the Faculty for a final vote. Harburg said she hopes the final vote will take place as soon as next semester.

Following an extensive search process, Pulitzer Prize winner Ann Marie Lipinski has been selected as the next curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, Harvard announced Tuesday.
Lipinski, who served as a Nieman Fellow in 1990, will return to the University in a time of significant uncertainty for the field of journalism.
From 2001 to 2008, Lipinski was the editor of the Chicago Tribune, a publication she served for 30 years.
During her tenure at the helm of Tribune, Lipinski oversaw a slew of changes to the paper, including the creation of a daily commuter edition and a monthly magazine—expertise that the members of the Nieman search committee considered during their process.
“We thought that it was important that whoever would take over this role was not just thinking about newspapers or just thinking about television,” said search committee member and PBS anchor Gwen Ifill.
The committee wanted to “cast a net as widely as possible towards different platforms, and [Lipinski] demonstrated that she not only was interested in this, but that she’d done this—and that she had a special affection on top of everything else for the Nieman program itself,” Ifill added.
Lipinski is currently the Vice President for Civic Engagement at the University of Chicago, where she oversees the University’s relations with the surrounding community. She is also a senior lecturer at the University.
Lipinski said that her work at U. Chicago has allowed her to see first hand how research universities function, and has allowed her to interact with students and faculty.
She will start at the Nieman Foundation this summer, after the current curator, Bob Giles, retires in June.
University Provost Steven E. Hyman told the Harvard Gazette that he was “thrilled” with the outcome of the search.
“Ann Marie recognizes the urgency surrounding the field of journalism and its future, and I am excited for the vision and innovation she will bring to one of Harvard’s most treasured institutions,” he said.
Although the landscape of journalism is changing, Lipinski said she has not given up on traditional forms.
“In my mind there’s not a war between these forms and there’s plenty of room for a variety of storytelling methods,” Lipinski said, noting that when she recently served as a Pulitzer Prize judge, the process was entirely different from that of a generation ago.
Despite the changes journalism is undergoing, Lipinski said that the one constant is the need for it.
“We’ve seen in the last couple of months the role that journalism, practiced in lots of different formats, has played in the seismic shifts across the globe—entire nations and societies transformed in part through the power of journalism,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the recent Japanese earthquake and tsunami, policy makers in Japan have struggled to find a solution to the structural, and economic problems caused by the disaster, Japanese economist Hiroshi Nakaso said yesterday at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Nakaso, who is the Assistant Governor of the Bank of Japan, discussed the problems with Japanese infrastructure that exacerbated the crisis after last month’s catastrophic earthquake, as well as elaborating on what financial experts were doing to prevent a sharp contraction of the economy.
“What is ironic is that just before the earthquake, economists were saying that the Japanese economy was performing better than expected,” said Nakaso.
While the Cabinet Office of Japan believed that the damage to industry totalled roughly 16 to 25 trillion yen—an amount which would paralyze production in coastal Japan for some time—Nakaso said he remains optimistic.
He went on to say that three challenges that would slow the Japanese recovery were the electrical power supply shortage, the supply chain disruption, and the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Plant disaster.
Nakaso noted that the largest Japanese power plant lost 40 percent of its capacity due to the earthquake—requiring large industrial users to cut down 25 percent of their electrical use in peak hours during the summer, when electricity consumption is at its highest.
Additionally—in one of the more puzzling and little known infrastructure problems—plants in western Japan generate electricity at different frequencies from those in eastern Japan, which has prevented western plants from transferring some of their excess capacity to disaster-stricken eastern areas, Nakaso said.
Nakaso also discussed some of the measures taken to keep Japan’s economy afloat, mentioning that during the first business day after the earthquake, the Bank of Japan injected a record high 21.8 trillion yen into the economy, increasing both liquidity and investors’ confidence.
He said he believes that the economy could be boosted by reconstruction demand, a view he said was shared by the International Monetary Fund.
“We have a precedent to believe that GDP will not go negative, because after [the] Hanshin Earthquake in 1995, GDP remained positive for most of the period after the earthquake”, Nakaso said.
During a question-and-answer session, audience members highlighted their own perceptions of Japan’s problems.
School of Public Health graduate Christine Huttin brought up concerns about nuclear safety and regulation. Nakaso responded that Japan would develop stronger regulations in the wake of the disaster.
Nakaso said he was especially moved by how the Japanese youth was taking an active role in the wake of the earthquake.
“They are voluntarily helping people in the disaster region. It’s reviving the activity and vigor of Japanese youngsters,” he said. “I am hopeful that this tragedy could change the course of Japan in the future.”

Scholars and students gathered to discuss the problems associated with women’s education and economic involvement in the Middle East at a panel discussion last night, noting that female education rates in Iraq are the lowest they have been in a decade.
While macro-economic stability and food security have improved in Iraq during recent years, civil unrest is high, according to panelist Shoubo R. Jalal, who is a fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard Kennedy School.
“We are talking about a country in conflict, she said. “We still have violence, political instability, and mass demonstrations,” Jalal said.
Tensions have proven to be devastating for the state of women’s education. Between 1990 and 2002, there was a radical decline in the number of women enrolled in Iraqi schools, according to Jalal. At the same time, increasing costs and a lower value of education severely handicapped efforts to expand female education, she said.
While rising tuition costs have made it more difficult for all children to have access to education, families tend to prioritize the education of males over females, leading to a large gender gap in enrollment. In 2006, roughly 800,000 children were not attending primary school—and 74 percent of them were girls, according to Jalal.
In Afghanistan a country plagued by the world’s second highest maternal mortality rate and where over half of all young women are married by the age of 18, “education is the key to [female] empowerment,” said panelist Catherine A. Rielly. Rielly is president of Rubia, Inc., an organization dedicated to empowering women in Afghanistan by allowing them the opportunity to embroider clothing and trade their goods to the West for profit.
“Especially as they get older, there is a great social stigma for girls attending school due to the importance of early marriage,” Rielly said. Furthermore, women’s confinement to the domestic sphere can make attending school and finishing required housework altogether impossible, she added.
Rielly noted that women are not only excluded from education, but also often isolated from the nation’s economy.
But Rielly said that organizations like her own, which supports cottage industry, can help women become more economically independent.
“The activities are based at home and they are not required to change their lifestyles,” Rielly explained.
“Their husbands don’t feel threatened,” she added.
By allowing men to play an active role in the production and distribution of the embroidery, Rubia is gradually making the economic inclusion of Afghani women more readily accepted within these predominately patriarchal communities, Rielly said.
“We’ve helped them have access to markets in the West for the first time,” she said. “Many women have money in their pocket and are respected by their communities.”

Though it remains a field that is predominantly male, computer science at Harvard has made important strides towards addressing the gender divide.
According to statistics from the concentration, 41 percent of sophomore concentrators are female, marking a new record for the discipline.
Of the 51 sophomores who declared computer science as their concentration this fall, 21 students were female.
This represents a 15 percent increase from the Class of 2012, in which 26 percent of concentrators are female, and a 34 percent increase from the class of 2011, in which, of 46 concentrators, just three are female.
Last year, The Crimson reported that computer science was the most gender-skewed concentration at the College, with women comprising only 13 percent of undergraduate CS majors. Since the Class of 2013 declared, that proportion has risen to 25 percent.
The rise in female concentrators corresponds with an increase in female enrollment in the computer science introductory course, Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
The class, which also attracts a large number of non-CS students, was 37 percent female this fall, up from 23 percent in 2004.
“CS50’s own gender ratio has been inching closer and closer to 50/50 over the past several years, so I do think the course and the concentration will get there before long,” said Computer Science Lecturer David J. Malan ’99, the instructor for CS50, in an emailed statement.
CS concentrator Jenny Ye ’13 said she was initially planning to pursue a degree in mathematics or government until she took CS50.
“I didn’t take CS50 until last semester and I felt like it was great,” said Ye, who will be interning at Google this summer. “I’m excited that the CS department is reaching out not just to women but to everyone on campus ... and it’s awesome that more women are concentrating.”
“Last year, CS50 as a class proved to a lot of the freshmen that CS ... was really accessible to everyone across the board,” said applied mathematics concentrator A. Cansu Aydede ’11, who has been the head teaching fellow for CS50 for the past three years.
Some female concentrators said that the male-dominated gender distribution in CS can be attributed in part to what they described as a social stigma associated with women who pursue subjects like computer science.
“I think part of it is the way that computer science is portrayed, as sort of a video game culture,” said Fiona W. Wood ’13. “That’s really starting to change—in terms of how CS is seen.”
Wood added that bringing women into the field requires exposing them to its possibilities.
“Growing up, I wasn’t expected to be into math or sciences or into computers,” said CS concentrator Tiffany J. Au ’12. But Au said she thinks the environment at Harvard is different.
“There’s nothing about Harvard that discouraged me as a female to pursue computer science,” she said.
Current female concentrators also said that they think the increase in female concentrators represents a trend that extends beyond Harvard.
“Once women start majoring in computer science, then other women see other female concentrators and start to see it as a viable concentration,” said Wood.
But she acknowledged that, even at Harvard, there is still room for improvement.
“There are fewer role models in terms of the history of CS for women. That’s obviously not something that you can fix,” Wood said. “It’s just a question of improving in the future.”

Harvard Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser, who was found “solely responsible” for eight instances of scientific misconduct by an internal University investigation last August, is slated to return to Harvard this fall after a one-year leave of absence.
Psychology Department Chair Susan E. Carey ’64 declined to elaborate on the capacity in which he will be serving in the department when he returns.
Hauser—whose research focuses on cognitive function in primates—took a leave of absence this academic year after a three-year long University investigation found that three of his published articles needed to be corrected or retracted.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in a letter to the Faculty on Aug. 20 that the “appropriate sanctions” Hauser could face include “involuntary leave, the imposition of additional oversight on a faculty member’s research lab, and appropriately severe restrictions on a faculty member’s ability to apply for research grants, to admit graduate students, and to supervise undergraduate research.”
In September, Hauser said he would continue to maintain control of his William James Hall laboratory during his year of absence.
The lab runs experiments on the psychology of dogs, moral judgments in adults, and economic decision making in children.
At the time, FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal said that Smith had established additional oversight on the lab.
Hauser has also been working on his book “Evilicious: Explaining Our Evolved Taste for Being Bad,” which traces the origins of the human desire to do evil.
Hauser was unavailable for comment for this story.
Last year, Hauser, who has won several awards for his teaching, received a Q score of 4.93 out of 5 from the students in his 15-person Psychology 2381 course.
One student said in the Q report that the class was the best at Harvard.

CORRECTION: APRIL 20, 2011
The April 20 story "Hauser Slated to Return to Harvard in the Fall" incorrectly stated that Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser will be teaching during the 2011-2012 academic year. While an earlier version of the course catalogue stated that Hauser would teach two courses next spring, the Psychology Department voted to deny Hauser permission to teach, according to the Boston Globe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WOBURN, Mass.—A chemical expert and a DNA analyst were called to the stand yesterday as the final witnesses in the trial of Jabrai Jordan Copney—the alleged shooter in the May 2009 slaying of Cambridge resident Justin Cosby that took place in Kirkland House.
The prosecution concluded its case after presenting evidence that showed gunshot residue on Copney’s jacket as well as DNA analysis from artifacts of the crime scene.
Some of the DNA evidence taken from three parts of the gun partially matched Copney’s DNA, according to the witness.
Per protocol, the forensic DNA analyst testified that she had mixed the three swabs from the gun’s slide, grip, and trigger before performing tests to compile a sufficiently large DNA sample.
As a result, the analyst had not tested the DNA from only the trigger for this investigation—a point the defense raised during cross-examination.
After Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85 announced the conclusion of evidence from the prosecution’s side, defense attorney John A. Amabile said that the defense had no evidence to present.
In his opening statement on April 6, Bennett said that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was prosecuting Copney for first degree murder on the grounds that he helped plan the armed robbery of Cosby’s marijuana and fired the shot that killed him.
Amabile countered that the killing was a product of a failed drug deal, and that co-defendant Blayn Jiggetts was in fact the shooter.
During the past two weeks of presentation of evidence, several examiners, analysts, and police officers were called to the stand to verify physical evidence and police proceedings related to the crime.
Key testimonies from former Harvard senior and Kirkland resident Chanequa N. Campbell, Yale graduate and former drug dealer Jules E. Bolton, and Jiggetts painted a narrative surrounding Copney’s case.
Associate Justice John T. Lu dismissed the jury for the day in order to converse with the attorneys on the wording of the instructions Lu would deliver to the jury on Wednesday.
During court proceedings outside the jury’s hearing in the afternoon, the three parties finalized the instructions that Lu would deliver before the jury is released to deliberate on the case.
The attorneys considered, for instance, whether a photo of Cosby would be admitted into evidence for the jury to examine—though Lu did not come to a conclusion during the session.
Less than a month from the two-year anniversary of the shooting, today marks the presentation of closing statements from both sides.

WOBURN, Mass.—The closing arguments in the Kirkland murder trial yesterday were characterized by sharply different versions of the same story as the defense blamed the shooting on another man, calling him a “homicidal maniac,” and the state responded by likening that claim to “fantasy.”
During statements in court yesterday, the state contended that Jabrai Jordan Copney should be found guilty of first-degree murder for planning and executing an armed robbery that ended in a killing in the basement of a Harvard dormitory. Meanwhile, the defense continued its strategy of deflecting blame away from the defendant, arguing that the encounter was not a robbery and that another man fired the fatal shot.
In his closing argument, Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85 outlined the state’s allegations about the events surrounding the fatal shooting of 21-year-old Cambridge resident Justin Cosby in May 2009.
Bennett said that Copney had expressed a belief that drug dealers make good targets for robberies because they will not report the theft of their wares to police.
According to the series of events presented by the prosecution, Copney collaborated with Jason Aquino and Blayn Jiggets to rob Cosby of a large quantity of marijuana. By posing as a Harvard student looking to buy drugs for a party, Bennett said that Copney lured Cosby into an art room in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway.
There, the prosecutor said, Copney fired three shots with the intent of killing Cosby when he refused to hand over the marijuana that Cosby thought he had come to sell.
Jiggets and Aquino were both charged with first-degree murder but have pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.
“Jabrai Copney made a decision,”
Bennett said. “His decision was that Justin Cosby’s life was not worth as much as that marijuana. He made that decision when he planned to rob him, something that was inherently dangerous. He made that decision when he shot him—the result of that decision was that Justin Cosby bled to death on the corner of Dunster Street.”
In one phase of his argument, Bennett sought to prove that Copney intended to rob the victim by asking over a dozen questions, each one beginning with “If it’s a drug purchase rather than a robbery...”
“Why do they have a gun with them?” Bennett asked. “Why do they pick a place where there’s only one way in and one way out, like that art room?”
Defense attorney John A. Amabile, who chose to call no witnesses during the trial, spoke for more than twice as long as Bennett during his closing argument. He urged the jury to accept a very different story—at times gesticulating with the alleged murder weapon and shouting “Boom! Boom!” and “Bang! Bang! Bang!” to dramatically reenact his version of events.
Amabile drew on the testimony of one of the prosecution’s witnesses—ballistics expert Stephen Walsh, who examined the scene of the crime on the day of the shooting and the following day—as a basis for his theory that Jiggetts was the shooter rather than Copney.
Interpreting evidence that Walsh presented about the three bullets that were fired—one into the wall of the entryway stairwell, one into the entryway’s wooden door, and one into Cosby’s abdomen—Amabile said that the shooter was standing on the staircase rather than at its base, where Jiggetts testified Copney stood to fire at Cosby.
“The physical evidence tells the story in this case, ladies and gentlemen, not the garbage testimony of Blayn Seven-Years-for-Killing-Somebody-and-I’m-Walking-Free Jiggetts,” Amabile said, repeatedly referring to the fact that Jiggetts has been promised a 9 to 12 year sentence, two years of which he has already served, in exchange for testifying against Copney.
Amabile said that the state has wrongly focused on convicting Copney when the blame actually rests on Jiggetts, whom he called “the homicidal bully from Harlem.”
“You know these things happen,” Amabile said about the frequent incidence of violence during drug transactions. “It is sad, sad, sad. These happen every day of the week in Roxbury—it’s not even a story; nobody cares. But it’s not supposed to happen in a Harvard dorm.”
“This investigation has been clouded in a thick fog, a crimson fog,” continued Amabile, who has referenced the Harvard education of both prosecutors in the case on numerous occasions. “When you get caught in a thick fog, you get disoriented all of a sudden. You start losing your way, and you lose sight of which way is left and which way is right, what’s up and what’s down, what’s frontward and backward, what’s right and what’s wrong. And that’s what happened.”
Acknowledging that Cosby’s death was “a tragedy of enormous magnitude,” Amabile said that the jury may “run the risk of committing an almost equal tragedy, and that’s convicting an innocent person.”
He opened and closed his remarks, which lasted just over an hour, with a description of Lady Justice, whom he said had been “wrested from her pedestal” during this case.
“She’s blindfolded, which means she’s not caring about race or status or social order. She’s immune from bias or prejudice,” he told the jurors as they prepared to render a verdict. The jurors were asked before their selection whether the fact that the defendant and victim in the case are African-American would impact their judgement.
After hearing instructions from presiding judge John T. Lu, the jury began its deliberations yesterday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the night before the varsity eight race that would determine the 2003 women’s rowing national championship. Teammates Caryn Davies ’04-’05 and Anna Brock ’03 came up to Radcliffe heavyweights coach Liz O’Leary to give their final words in preparation for the race.
“Liz, we’re going to win it tomorrow,” the teammates said. “We’re going to do it. We’re going to win it.”
And the next day they were champions. For the 25-year veteran coach, it cemented a long life of dedication to the sport she came to love in college.
“I started rowing for the first time in college,” O’Leary says. “I had done other sports in high school but rowing was something different from the norm, so I thought I would try something new.”
Little did she know, just four years later, after graduating from the University of New Hampshire, she would be competing for the U.S. National Team in the 1976 Summer Olympics.
“The 1976 games was my first international competition,” O’Leary says. “And to be honest, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. But it was truly inspiring to see all the athletes in the Olympic village, coming from all across the world with different languages and different colored uniforms. And I was one of them.”
O’Leary returned to the U.S. team for the 1980 Olympics but did not compete due to the U.S. boycott of the games. Her next international competition would be out of the water as a coach instead.
“After I was done competing, I started coaching at the University of New Hampshire,” O’Leary says. “I also began coaching on the national level [at the 1988 Olympics and for seven World Championships].”
In 1986, O’Leary came to Radcliffe after hearing a fellow member of the athletic department speak at a coaching seminar.
“One of the real moments that made me realize that this was the place I wanted to coach was when I went to a seminar for coaching development,” O’Leary says. “[Women’s basketball coach] Kathy Delaney-Smith was the featured speaker, and she was so inspiring and so motivating. [She] just made me feel like ‘I want to go where she is’, and that was a real strong calling card to me to come here.”
“With everything she has been through,” O’Leary says. “She is my hero.”
Since coming to Harvard, O’Leary has proven her coaching abilities; she has led the Radcliffe squad to 12 appearances in the NCAA Championships in the 14-year history of the event. In addition to winning the national championship in 2003, O’Leary was also awarded the Collegiate Rowing Coaches Associations Division I Coach of the Year.
“The entire experience has been great,” O’Leary says. “The thing that I have enjoyed the most is the people that I have interacted with over the years, whether it be teammates or the athletes that I have been able to coach.”
“It has been especially rewarding to coach the women here at Harvard who are truly committed to being a true student-athlete,” O’Leary continues. “Learning the balance of academics and athletics, what they can accomplish, testing their limits, developing their talent. It’s amazing to work with the athletes here and see all they can achieve.”
Even with no shortage of accomplishments on her own resume, O’Leary has been described by many close to her as one of the most humble people you will meet.
“You would never know everything she has done,” says son Matt O’Leary, a sophomore on the men’s lightweight team. “She doesn’t hang up her medals or brag about it; she is incredibly humble.”
For co-captain Olivia Coffey, O’Leary played a key role in her decision to come to Harvard.
“She has this energy about her that is so warm and loving but yet at the same time very competitive,” Coffey says. “She cares just as much about how we develop as people as how we develop on the water. And everyone around her just wants to compete to the best of their abilities.”
“She’s the best of the best,” fellow co-captain Rachel Rauh concurs. “Everyone from day one completely believes in her and her coaching style.”
And to O’Leary, everyone has the capability of being the best they can be, no matter what path one takes.
“Winning is not an easy thing to do, but that’s our goal every year,” O’Leary says. “More than that though, it is to be as successful as we can be. That’s what life is all about: making the boat in your lane go as fast as it can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Weather forced Harvard and Bryant to reschedule their double-header earlier in the season, and on a rainy Tuesday afternoon it threatened to do so again. But despite the light drizzle and low temperatures, the Crimson (6-29, 3-9 Ivy) and Bulldogs (19-16, 9-7 Northeast) took to the field for a doubleheader, with Bryant taking both the early and late games, 3-2 and 12-2, respectively.
“It was a makeup date of a game, and we wanted to get some playing time,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “Looking back now, if we could have had a chance to not play in this rain and scheduled it some other time, we definitely would have liked to do that. But you know, you play every chance you can get. It’s just the nature of New England baseball.”
BRYANT 12, HARVARD 2
Two monster innings by the Bulldogs and a host of throwing errors doomed the Crimson in the light-shortened second game of the afternoon doubleheader.  Bryant put five on the board in the top of the second and added seven more in the fourth to put the game out of reach. Harvard tried to respond to both scoring sprees, getting both of its runs in the bottom half of the same innings, but was unable to overcome the large deficit.
“We thought it would be a good chance for guys who couldn’t pitch this weekend to get their arms working in preparation for the Beanpot,” Walsh said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t stick with them.”
The experience gained by the four pitchers who took to the mound for the Crimson was negated by four Bulldog runs off passed balls and wild pitches, including three in the second inning off starting pitcher sophomore Danny Moskovits.
“That’s just how baseball goes sometimes,” freshman shortstop Carlton Bailey said.
Bryant put up 12 runs on just eight hits, thanks to four Crimson errors. Harvard was also aided by a Bulldog wild pitch as senior shortstop Sean O’Hara scored an unearned run in the fifth after having advanced on a fielder’s choice.
The Crimson scored its only other run of the game on a solo homer to center field by senior catcher Cole Arledge. It was his first on the season.
The game was called due to darkness after the conclusion of the sixth inning.
BRYANT 3, HARVARD 2
It took extra innings, but Bryant narrowly defeated Harvard on an RBI single by David Soltis in the top of the eighth. Strong relief pitching was the story for both teams, as Crimson sophomore pitcher Matt Doyle pitched five innings of one-hit baseball and Bulldog senior closer Mark Andrews pitched two and two-thirds innings of no-hit ball to finish the game.
“Matt Doyle did an outstanding job,” Walsh said. “That was the best effort that he’s ever had in a Crimson uniform. Five innings, one hit. He gave us a chance.”
That chance was taken away from them by Andrews, who struck out five of the eight men he faced. Andrews forced Harvard to leave five runners on base in the last three innings, when a run would have won the game.
“[Andrews] was filthy,” Walsh said. “He already has 10 saves this year. That great slider, four-seam fastball combination he has is dangerous.”
Despite Andrews’ prowess on the mound, the Crimson was certainly within striking distance of extending its win streak to three if not for a fielding error in the top of the eighth that set the stage for Soltis’ game-winning hit.
A hard line drive was misjudged by senior centerfielder Dillon O’Neill, sailing over his head and putting the winning runner–junior Connor Carignan–on second with Soltis coming up to bat.
“Dillon is one of our best defensive players,” Walsh said. “It’s a shame that ball got over him.”
The bad weather and Andrews’ continued excellence on the mound prevented Harvard from mounting a comeback in the final frame, as freshman pinch runner Jeff Hajdin reached second on a steal only to have the game end on a groundout to short.
“We had chances in that game and just didn’t execute,” Bailey said. “It’s too bad, but it happens.”
Andrews showed signs of tiring late, and it was unclear whether or not the Bryant senior would have returned to pitch in the ninth inning had it been necessary.
“I don’t know how long he would have been able to go,” Walsh said. “And who knows what would have happened if we didn’t fall behind in the eighth.”

After spending most of his life on the basketball court, it wasn’t until after his Harvard graduation that Fred Schernecker ’89-’90 graced the greens with his presence. Now, as the Crimson’s director of golf, Schernecker has represented the Harvard golf program for the past 13  years.
As a Harvard student, Schernecker played for the Crimson from the 1985-86 season until he captained the 1989-90 season, missing the 1987-88 campaign to study at the London School of Economics.
As a player, he was acknowledged as an outstanding shooter and leader.
“Fred was a constant presence who you could always count on as a teammate on the court,” former teammate Scott Gilly ’90 says. “He would provide leadership and [was] always behind each and every player 100 percent. His signature shot was definitely his fadeaway three-point jump shot because he couldn’t get off the ground enough to dunk.”
Schernecker’s fondest memories from being part of the team were not particular moments in a game but rather the opportunities to develop close relationships with teammates.
“The greatest resource at Harvard is the students,” Schernecker says. “The best part was spending time with the other team members. I don’t necessarily look at [playing basketball] as an achievement but as an overall experience.”
Interestingly, his ties to basketball were what opened up the world of golf.
Warren Smith, a golf professional and a teacher, went to every single one of the basketball team’s practices and games and ended up becoming a father figure for many of the guys on the team, including Schernecker. After his graduation from Harvard, Schernecker learned the game of golf from Smith.
“[Previously] I had very minimal exposure to golf,” Schernecker says. “While I certainly knew golf players, I felt that it was not really a sport before I understood what [it] was really about.”
Smith started the Crimson women’s golf team in 1993 and remained the coach for 11 years. In 1998, the veteran coach asked Schernecker for help with driving the van for the women’s team.
“One thing led to another, and pretty soon I became the head of golf,” Schernecker says. “[Smith’s] the reason why I’m involved in the Harvard golf program.”
The director of golf, a position created eight years ago, is responsible for many of the logistical aspects of the golf program. Schernecker is in charge of recruiting, scheduling, organizing travel, acting as a sounding board for coaches, and fundraising. More importantly, though, he is a great resource for the team members for both academic and career planning.
Just as Smith became a great friend and inspired Schernecker to take up golf, Schernecker has the desire to do the same with the student-athletes on both the men’s and women’s teams. He builds on his experiences as a former Crimson athlete to help the students navigate the Harvard experience.
“[Schernecker]’s really there for you in any capacity in which you want him to be,” women’s captain Mia Kabasakalis says. “He has a really good ear. He meets with the team members at least one or two times a season. He really understands people, and he knows the way to interact with them that will produce the best results.”
“Being a student-athlete at Harvard is not the same as in any other place,” women’s coach Kevin Rhoads adds. “Having a good feel for what students can handle, [Schernecker] knows exactly how to approach any situation. He knows what it is like and it is very unique opportunity to have him with us. We’re very lucky to have him.”
Perhaps Schernecker’s most impressive quality is his ability to juggle his responsibilities here at Harvard and Schernecker Property Services, Inc., his business he developed as an undergraduate.
“He is the perfect role model,” Kabasakalis says. “He is extremely humble and is so efficient. He gets up at four in the morning to get his work done. The way that [he] manages everything is incredible.”
But Schernecker isn’t just all business.
“He is a really funny and goofy guy too,” Kabasakalis adds. “We all love him, and we get so excited whenever we see him.”
Though he only used to play basketball once a year at the alumni game, he recently started to play twice a week, and he tries to golf at least once or twice a week during the summer.
“When you find things that you are passionate about, you tend to be able to find time to do those things,” Schernecker says. “I have the privilege to work with...great people. I see my job as a way to let them be successful. They do a great job, and it allows me time to pursue the things I’m passionate about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though White Panda, Sam Adams, and Far East Movement provided ample distraction for Harvard students on Sunday, a different trio also impressed in Cambridge this past week. Three Crimson athletes outperformed the competition and took home All-Ivy League weekly honors, as was announced by league officials earlier today.
Freshman outfielder Jack Colton was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week after hitting .643 in four contests against Brown. The Harvard baseball team overcame a 2-0 deficit in games to split the series, winning back-to-back contests on Sunday over the Bears and snapping a four game losing streak. Colton played a big role in these victories, going 9-for-14 from the plate, earning four RBI, and scoring two runs of his own over the course of four games this weekend. But the Crimson couldn’t hold onto the momentum, dropping two games to Bryant yesterday.
A Harvard rookie also dominated on the softball diamond, as freshman third baseman Kasey Lange took home Ancient Eight Player and Rookie of the Week honors. Lange batted .591—including three home runs in a doubleheader against Holy Cross—and committed zero errors, starting each of this week’s seven games. The rookie has earned at least one RBI in the Crimson’s last seven games.
In women’s lacrosse, sophomore midfielder Jennifer VanderMuelen earned Offensive Player of the Week accolades after an impressive seven-goal, 17-point effort over two games. VanderMuelen netted four against No. 12 Princeton, as Harvard stunned the Tigers, 9-8.  The sophomore has scored in every game of her college career so far and is currently on a 26-game scoring streak.

A new website, Mobi, has been released to help Harvard students better search for interesting activities and weekend events. One of the creators is Haoqi Zhang, a Harvard teaching fellow and Computer Science Ph.D. student, who developed the site to create a "new way to plan events together" by allowing people to either find or add activities that may interest others. The team has created an online tutorial to help guide people into how to use the website.
The creators believe that if the website is a success they would localize it in the future due to its flexibility. "There is nothing about Mobi that is university specific in terms of how it's intended to be used to plan something," Zhang said. "We're trying to understand how it works and getting a sense of how people might use it."

It's not everyday that you get to use Playboy and Harvard in the same sentence, but in Playboy's May issue (note: link not safe for work) rating the top party schools in America, the magazine named Kirkland H33 the most coveted dorm room in the United States as a result of its storied history as the room in which Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook.
Current residents of the room are Wenqian (Wendy) Wang '11, Kaitlin S.L. Koga '11, and Kathyrn L. Wilcox '11. Harvard was the only Ivy League besides Yale, which won an award for "Best Naked Parties," to make its way onto Playboy's annual superlatives list.
