After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the persistent critical and financial success of live-action superhero films in recent years, their animated counterparts have been surprisingly sparse. Writer and producer Phil Lord and producer Christopher Miller have taken to filling that gap, first with 2017’s “The Lego Batman Movie” and now “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” a rollicking work of creativity that takes advantage of its form to tell a modern superhero story in an unprecedented way.
“Into the Spider-Verse” follows Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), an Afro-Latin American teenager from Brooklyn struggling to adapt to a new high school. One day, he is bitten by a radioactive spider and develops abilities in a universe wherein Peter Parker (Chris Pine) is already Spider-Man. When a supervillain opens a portal to parallel universes, Peter is killed trying to stop him, and several other iterations of Spider-Man personas from other realities are pulled into Miles’s world. He must learn to navigate his abilities and stop the villain from opening the portal again and destroying the universe.
This incredible film creatively takes advantage of the animated form, featuring a mélange of graphic styles that come together for an exhilarating visual experience. Art directors Dean Gordon and Patrick O’Keefe led a team of 142 animators to present the bulk of the film in a beautiful, slick, and detailed fashion saturated with vibrant, atmospheric colors with elements of comic book style, like sound effect graphics, woven throughout. After Miles develops his abilities, several scenes are stylized like comic books, complete with narration in yellow text boxes and thought bubbles. More than comfortable with being meta, Miles also comments on these elements, and whole scenes are translated into pages of a comic book.
The premise of the film relies on multiverses, which are implicitly understood in the modern comic industry, and the film engages deeply with its roots by introducing each new Spider-Man with their own comic book cover. “Into the Spider-Verse” then takes this visual integration even further by using different styles to express the realities of its different heroes as well. For instance, Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), a Japanese girl from the year 3145, gets full anime sequences, while Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), a literal pig, fights using cartoon tropes, ensuring that the visual experience is never anywhere close to boring.
In addition to visuals, the plot strikes a nice balance between hitting the classic notes of a superhero story and maintaining surprises for viewers of all ages and with varying degrees of familiarity with the Spider-Man story. Miles and his family ground the film’s emotional beats, but the different versions of Spider-Man contribute unique perspectives on family, loss, loneliness, faith, and heroism. Spider-Man is often considered one of the most relatable and accessible superheroes; he is neither a billionaire nor an alien, but a normal, awkward teenager who chooses to be great after crazy things happen to him. “Into the Spider-Verse” highlights this sense of universality, as the multiple realities attest that “anyone can be behind the mask.”
The film is purposeful in making room for diversity in a genre largely dominated by white male stories (although  “Wonder Woman” and “Black Panther” are recent exceptions): the multiverse premise allows for an iconic and traditionally Caucasian male hero to instead be represented by a young Afro-Latin American, a woman, and an Asian American on the silver screen — all of whom are portrayed by a fantastic and diverse cast. Each character’s differences and unique backgrounds are not merely incidental, and contribute to their stories and capabilities. For instance, Miles tags graffiti in the subways with his uncle (Mahershala Ali), and his music preferences shape the film’s notable soundtrack, which features artists like Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Jaden Smith. Additionally, Peni codes and controls a futuristic spider robot, and Spider-Woman’s fighting is informed by her time as a dancer. The associations of African American youth to rap music or Japanese people to high technology may fall on stereotypical lines, but are thankfully complicated by colorful individual development. Even Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), an older version of the hero, has a distinct personality and faces conflicts shaped by his age and new role in life, now that he worries he is past his prime.
The tactic of creating new versions of existing characters simply to enhance diversity has prompted controversy in the past, but the multiverse explanation presents these heroes as equally unique and important in their own realities — not for who they are behind their masks, but for who they choose to become. “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” invites viewers on a fast-paced, funny, and thoughtful ride that lives up to — and differentiates itself from — any of the myriad live-action superhero blockbusters that have come before it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Class at 10:30 a.m., interview at 4 p.m., meeting at 7 p.m., study the rest of the night. From sunrise to nearly sunrise again, every minute is neatly assigned to a colorful task on our Google calendars, creating a rainbow of responsibilities for each day.
Something seems to be missing within all of the orderly chaos, though. What is it? Oh, right. We forgot to schedule time for our friends.
With so much time blocked out for our own obligations, we inevitably fail to make time for others (and no, the 30 seconds of promising to grab a meal sometime do not count). We may sometimes drop everything to offer our friends a shoulder to cry on, but this opportunity rarely presents itself when we are constantly caught up in meetings, study sessions, and other concrete obligations. As friends become less and less of a priority within our schedule, we may find that we ourselves have no one to turn to, which breeds a campus culture burdened with loneliness and resentment.
The problem lies in the fact that students here simply do not have the emotional space nor the time to genuinely be there for others. With so much pressure to be high-functioning and constantly busy, students no longer feel comfortable with having free time. Every second has to be spent productively — or at least that’s what it has to look like. There have been times when I have climbed into bed for a nap, exhausted and sleep-deprived, only to roll around in vain due to pacing thoughts about the emails to which I need to reply, the pset that’s due, all the other work I could be doing. Even free time isn’t truly “free” when there’s always something that could be done. And when every second is devoted to focusing on themselves and their own paths to success, how can students have the space to pause and consider what their friends may need?
I can say that I am not the only student on this campus who has felt this way. Too often, we cry, panic, break down, and burn out. Yet this cycle of overloading our plates not only isolates us from our peers, but it also makes us hesitant to be vulnerable to them. To imply that you’re struggling is to imply failure, after all, and who can afford to do that? None of us have the time anyway; an hour spent unloading to a friend is quickly followed by self-loathing and regret over how much time was wasted.
Prior to this year, the College operated on Harvard Time, in which everything began seven minutes later than the written time. But we now run on a different kind of Harvard Time, one in which no minute can go to waste, one that pushes the limits of the 24-hour cycle and prioritizes ceaseless productivity over emotions and relationships. Harvard Time now runs on loneliness, and the seconds that tick by are heard by no one until it is too late.
Perhaps if Harvard Time can be removed, so too can our culture of isolation and silent burnout. Scheduling is truly a matter of prioritization. If it means enough to you, coffee with a friend can just as easily own its own colorful block in your calendar as a meeting for a club or class. As for those of us who simply can’t avoid a packed week, we can make time for genuine friendship in other ways. A text checking in on someone goes a long way, and I’ve found that studying or working with friends has been one of the most effective ways of growing closer to others while still knocking something off of your to-do list. At the very least, we must offer ourselves as a sincere and genuine presence within the lives of others because the comfort of knowing that you have people nearby may be what carries someone through a particularly dark day.
Unless we all take proactive steps to truly be present for others, we will continue feeling unsupported, burdened, and alone, which is a recipe for disaster for a stressed out college student. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy. If we can barely make time for ourselves, then it’s no wonder that we struggle with making time for others. In a culture of business and time efficiency, perhaps we should learn to change what we prioritize. If every minute must be scheduled in our lives, then we can choose to schedule minutes for our friends as well. Maintaining strong relationships is helpful and necessary to not only others but also ourselves, and it’s time to redefine what we consider to be important enough for our time.

In early 2018, Harvard published its Sustainability Plan, laying out new environmental goals in order to be fossil fuel-free by 2050 and fossil fuel-neutral by 2026. Though the University’s goals are admirable, they are noticeably lacking in one important area: meat consumption.
Meat production is one of the primary sources of environmental harm. Anyone who cares about reducing their carbon footprint should put as much effort into cutting meat from their diet as they do into recycling or other environmental initiatives. Those who care about Harvard being environmentally friendly must seriously consider the ramifications of their food choices and pressure the University to be environmentally conscious in purchasing food.
It is too often overlooked how detrimental it is for our society to raise, kill, and eat billions of livestock each year. It is easy to acknowledge that there are harmful effects of throwing out trash instead of recycling; doing so requires little change. Though just as necessary, it is far harder for us to drastically change our diets. But we must do so. The fate of our climate is at stake.
Meat production is one of the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Because of the unnatural raising of cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats, animal livestock is the leading contributor to emission of methane, one of the most detrimental greenhouse gases. Additionally, meat production has an incredibly adverse effect on land consumption, water usage, effluent waste, and fossil fuel usage. (And that does not even take into account the cruelty that these animals endure and the billions that are needlessly killed.) According to a recent study, avoiding meat and dairy is the “single biggest way” to reduce one’s impact on climate change. The study demonstrates that though livestock account for only 18 percent of calories consumed in the world, it accounts for 83 percent of land used for food production and the majority of greenhouse gas emissions (58 percent), water pollution (57 percent), and air pollution (56 percent). For example, one pound of meat uses nearly the same amount of water as does six months of showering or 100 pounds of wheat.
The importance of cutting meat consumption is analogous in many ways to the importance of being environmentally conscious when buying clothing. The clothing industry is one of the most environmentally destructive industries. However, it is overlooked because of the ubiquity and affordability of environmentally harmful clothing. Unlike more comfortable tweaks that environmental neo-liberalism asks of modern-day citizens, it is hard and often expensive to change core aspects of our lives and behavior that negatively affect the climate, like diet and clothing.
This change is necessary, but it should not come from the bottom up. The onus of environmental change should be placed equally, if not primarily, on large institutions and corporations responsible for the design and preservation of this environmentally harmful system. It is not consumers that earn billions of dollars from torturing animals, dumping waste into our oceans, and polluting our skies. And it, therefore, should not be solely the responsibility of consumers to create environmental change.
I do believe that consumers should still strive to avoid meat or food that has a larger carbon footprint in order to actively minimize environmental impact. But it is more important for us to pressure institutions that are responsible for the problem to shoulder the economic costs of environmental consciousness. Thus, it is critical that we place this pressure on Harvard. We must ensure that institutions that buy meat in large quantities, such as Harvard University Dining Services, are aware of the consequences of the food that it purchases.
Among the long list of goals, standards, and initiatives listed in its Sustainability Plan, Harvard has only one point listed under the section titled “Food.” Its sole commitment in altering its vision for dining at the university is to “develop sustainable and healthful food standards that include Green Restaurant Association certification, and achieve University-wide compliance by 2020.” Attaining the bare minimum for Green Restaurant Association certification requires very little change. To be fair, HUDS has published impressive guides like “VER-EAT!-TAS” that advocate more environmentally conscious diets and articulate the importance of changing the food we eat. As outlined on its website, HUDS has also produced tips on how to eat better in dining halls and has put icons on menus to denote foods with less harmful impacts.
Nonetheless, HUDS should not just publish tips on how to be more environmentally conscious when eating in the dining halls; it should be proactive in effecting positive environmental change. Harvard ought to follow the lead of other institutions and radically expand local, environmentally friendly, vegetarian, and vegan options. It could also experiment with initiatives like Meatless Monday, a program that cuts meat entirely from the menu each Monday and has already been adopted by 159 universities. There are many other initiatives that seek to reduce the amount of meat consumed in university dining halls and other segments of society. Many of these initiatives suggest that the placement of options in the dining hall influences diners’ selection. In that vein, HUDS could make meals that disproportionately impact the environment, like hamburgers, less prominent in the dining hall.
When it comes to other aspects of Harvard’s impact on the environment — energy spending, fossil fuel usage and investment, recycling and waste collection — students hold the University to highest standards. We should unequivocally demand the same when it comes to reducing the impact that our diets have on the environment. Doing so requires thinking boldly when it comes to cutting meat in our dining halls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On paper, I should be a full-fledged Generation Z smartphone lover. I run an online business. I stay in touch with my best friends by texting and using FaceTime. I even dated a girl for five months after I got her number by direct messaging her on Twitter. (She sat next to me in homeroom for three years. We had only ever spoken once.)
Despite all this, smartphones scare me. Why? Though they expand our opportunities, they also demand less of us.
In 1993, author and essayist David Foster Wallace wrote an essay titled “E Unibus Pluram” to articulate what he felt was wrong with and addicting about television. Almost 30 years later, the objects of our addiction have evolved from large “piece[s] of furniture” (as Wallace described television sets) to sleek, portable cell phones.
According to the Pew Research Center, 94 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 own a smartphone, as do 89 percent of Americans between the ages of 30 and 49. Flurry Analytics, which, according to Forbes, can track 1.2 billion smartphone users’ daily activity, published that the average U.S. smartphone user is on his or her phone for five hours a day. This usage is a problem because smartphones make two essential components of all relationships — truth telling and the devotion of full attention — more difficult.
On truth telling, electronic communication is rudimentary. I text you something. You read it and reply. I read that and reply to you. Rinse and repeat. But in between messages are long periods of paranoia, frantic backspacing, and overthinking. “He used a period. Does that mean he’s angry? How long should I wait before replying? Is this too much information?” In person, we can reassure each other with a pat on the back, subtly ask for a change in topic by shifting uncomfortably, or communicate passion with rapid speech. Most importantly, we cannot hide our genuine reactions.
In all face-to-face interactions, there is an “interactional synchrony” (a term coined by William S. Condon in a 1960 study and popularized by author Malcolm Gladwell in his book The Tipping Point) when people’s micromovements (occurring about every 1/45 of a second) become synced and their speech patterns align. This synchrony is crucial to human connection, and simply put, it cannot occur over text. By communicating electronically, we get to wear masks with our own faces on them, and honest cues and responses are lost in translation. We see curated versions of each other, not our true selves.
More abstractly, one lesson you learn from substantive conversations is that there are different shades of truth. The truest conversations are easier spoken than typed: The passions we have need not be filtered or retouched. To truly know a person is to look him in the eye as he describes his favorite movie, to laugh with her as she makes an offhand remark about the cold restaurant food. These moments are what truly connect us, and they cannot consistently occur through text on a screen.
Smartphones also add unnecessary competition to relationships. As a result, they have negatively reoriented our value systems. Case in point: This month, a tweet went viral and gained over 240,000 “likes” and 68,000 retweets. The tweet read: “If I’m watching Netflix on my phone and if I have to pause the movie every 2 mins for me to reply to your ass best believe you matter [sic]”
The popularity of this tweet — one that equates relationships with curated entertainment — goes to show how deeply flawed smartphone-based relationships are. Wallace wrote that television viewership “trains us to see real-life personal up-close stuff the same way we relate to the distant and exotic, as if separated from us by physics and glass, extant only as performance, awaiting our cool review.” Smartphones have the same effect.
Our phones are the places where conversations with friends are on the same plane as media, memes, and viral vapidity. In a society already obsessed with control and indifference, smartphones pit our friends against corporations and celebrities that make money by pulling our heart strings and distracting our minds. In the words of MIT professor Sherry Turkle, “People can’t get enough of each other if and only if they can have each other at a distance, in amounts they can control.” This is a losing battle for everyone.
It is easy to fall into the trap of passive relationships where people become words. We text friends in group messages for days in a row, but then we realize we haven’t seen them in a month. We forget what color their eyes are, how their laughs sound, what it feels like to hug them. When texting, it becomes easier to ask questions with one-word answers. We are connected to others, but we do not truly know them. When we lock our phones, we have no one to smile with: All we see is our own reflections.
Smartphones are not going away, so we cannot simply blame them for these problems. We must look at ourselves not as victims being acted upon but as people capable of self-reflection and care. Use phones for good. Do not be afraid to be honest. Fall in love with someone’s affect, not their words. Use your phone to stay in touch with people, but turn it off to truly know them.

UPDATED: Jan. 24, 2019 at 1:39 p.m.
Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood film producer who has been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women, has hired Harvard Law School professor and Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. to represent him in his Manhattan sexual abuse case.
Sullivan — who heads the Law School’s Criminal Justice Institute — will serve on Weinstein’s legal team with lawyers Jose Baez and Pamela Mackey.
The New York Post first reported the news Wednesday.
Sullivan confirmed he would be joining Weinstein’s legal team along with Baez and Mackey in an email Thursday morning.
“I am pleased to confirm that I, along with Jose Baez and Pamela Mackey, have been retained by Harvey Weinstein,” Sullivan wrote.
Sullivan also wrote that he looks forward to defending Weinstein, pointing to the producer’s continued claim of innocence.
“Mr. Weinstein steadfastly maintains his innocence in this matter and we are looking forward to assisting Mr. Weinstein in his defense,” Sullivan wrote in the email.
Weinstein faces five charges as a result of allegations that he raped one woman and forcibly performed oral sex on another.
Sullivan has taken on several high-profile cases during his legal career, including defending former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez in his double murder trial and the family of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014. The Harvard Law professor also defended — along with fellow Law Professor Dehlia Umunna — the black Harvard undergraduate arrested last spring by Cambridge Police, an incident that sparked allegations of police brutality. Sullivan and Umunna later announced that charges would not be filed against the student.
Additionally, both Sullivan and Mackey represented the actress Rose A. McGowan in her 2017 Virginia drug possession case. In October 2017, McGowan publicly accused Weinstein of rape. McGowan told the New York Times that Baez’s decision to represent Weinstein is an “egregious conflict of interest,” though she did not mention Sullivan.
Sullivan wrote in an emailed statement that after consulting with an ethics counsel, he does not believe a conflict of interest exists.
“We were pleased to represent our former client, Ms. Rose McGowan, in a matter unrelated to Mr. Weinstein’s current charges. After consultation with ethics counsel, we are certain no conflict of interest exists. We wish Ms. McGowan well with all her future endeavors,” Sullivan wrote.
Widespread accusations of Weinstein’s sexual misconduct were first reported by the New York Times in October 2017, which detailed allegations against Weinstein that stretched back over three decades. Since then, several more women have come forward with their own allegations. The board of The Weinstein Company — the film studio Harvey Weinstein co-founded with his brother — fired him, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences stripped him of his membership.
Weinstein is the subject of several lawsuits, including the Manhattan sexual assault case where Sullivan, Baez, and Mackey will represent him.
The reporting on Weinstein helped spark the #MeToo movement, which has seen countless women come forward and share their own allegations of sexual misconduct.
Weinstein’s Manhattan sexual assault trial is set to begin May 7.
Correction: Jan. 25, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that a judge had cleared the Harvard undergraduate arrested last spring of all charges. In fact, prosecutors chose not to file charges.

Houghton Library will undergo significant changes beginning this fall as part of a year-long renovation project designed to increase accessibility to the building, which houses Harvard’s rare manuscripts and books.
The renovation will include redesigning the building’s entrance, increasing library security, and creating group study and research consultation spaces. The renovation will also add accessible restrooms, an elevator, and a gender-neutral restroom. Administrators have wanted to renovate Houghton ever since the implementation of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, according to Houghton Librarian Thomas Hyry.
The University first started making formal plans to renovate Houghton three years ago, and a recent donation of children’s literature — which includes first editions, manuscripts, and letters — by Susan Solomon and Peter J. Solomon ’60 has accelerated those plans.
“We’re doing things to literally make it more accessible, but then accessible more metaphorically as well,” Hyry said. “We’re trying to make a more welcoming and inviting atmosphere so that when you walk in you think ‘I’m in a special place’ but you don’t immediately wonder whether you’re supposed to be there or not, but your presence there is reinforced.”
The renovation coincides with other recent initiatives to increase visibility: Houghton’s staff began hosting an undergraduate research fellowship four years ago and has digitized much of its collection in recent years.
“It’s a really wonderful opportunity for the library to demonstrate physically that there’s change afoot and at the same time that we respect our traditions and the very valuable collections that we have,” University Librarian Sarah Thomas said.
In deciding where to donate his collection of children’s literature and illustrations, Solomon said he considered Princeton University, the Morgan Library and Museum, and even the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but ultimately settled on Houghton.
“I’ve been involved with Harvard since my graduation in 1960...so I went up and talked with Houghton and I said, ‘You know I really should give this to you,’” Solomon said. “The Houghton collection is very strong in the areas I’m strong in, but they don’t have a lot of the material I have.”
During a visit to Houghton to discuss donating his collection, Solomon noticed some of what Thomas referred to at the time as the building’s “deficiencies,” remarking that Houghton is not very accessible and is rather “like a fortress.” He said he wanted to see the hidden “jewel” that is Houghton become a “more integral part of Harvard.”
“I wanted to open it up, I wanted to have accessibility, including real handicapped accessibility [and] I wanted the whole area in front of it be repaired and enlivened, it had been left in neglect. I said, ‘I’m too old to wait to get this funded, I’ll just pay for it,’” Solomon said, though he acknowledged that some of the money for the renovation will also come from Harvard and other sources.
Solomon estimated that his collection encompasses some six hundred or seven hundred items. The collection features works mostly by American and British authors and illustrators like Helen Beatrix Potter, known for The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and Lewis Carroll, known for Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.
Houghton will receive the entirety of Solomon’s collection over the next few years, according to Solomon. The library plans to exhibit the works it has already received when it reopens in fall 2020.
“The gift itself is quite accessible because people will have grown up with these children’s classics, and they’ll be like magnets to draw in students who will want to not just relive their childhood experience, but actually come to it with a more mature pair of eyes and understand why these particular books are worthy of study and worthy of enjoyment,” Thomas said.
Approximately 300 classes and 3,000 students via their classes use Houghton’s facilities in a year. When the building closes in the fall, Houghton will still host classes — albeit fewer — in facilities in Widener, Pusey, and Lamont Libraries.
Houghton’s reading room will relocate to Widener Periodicals Room which, under its previous name the “Treasure Room,” housed some of Houghton’s collections from 1915 to 1942, after Widener finished construction but before Houghton was built.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When filmmaker Joseph Dorman interviewed Sociology Professor Emeritus Nathan Glazer at City College on 137th street in Harlem, he offered to hail a cab or order a car service to take the professor, then in his 90s, to wherever he wanted to go next.
Glazer refused the offer.
“He said, ‘Absolutely not, I want to take the subway home,’” said Dorman, who wrote and directed the film “Arguing the World,” which featured Glazer and three of his fellow New York intellectuals. “That was a point when they were just beginning to produce subway art in each of the subway stations, and he wanted basically to stop at all the stations on the way home to look at the subway art.”
Glazer, who died Saturday at the age of 95 in his home in Cambridge, studied issues of ethnicity and immigration, often examining them from a global perspective. He is known for being one of the first sociologists to focus on ethnic studies, according to Dorman. But Glazer also explored topics stretching beyond sociology, venturing into varied fields like education, architecture, and urban planning. His work often touched on city life.
Glazer’s free-thinking attitude allowed him to connect his studies to a variety of different fields, according to Sociology Department Chair Jason Beckfield.
“He couldn’t be bound by a certain school or a certain discipline,” Beckfield said.
Glazer started his career in academia, teaching at University of California, Berkeley in 1963 before moving to Harvard in 1969, where he taught in the Sociology department. During his time at Harvard, his courses spanned three schools: the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Education, and the Graduate School of Design.
Tufts History Professor Reed T. Ueda, who was one of Glazer’s students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, called him a “true thinker” and an “independent spirit.”
Glazer wrote several books including “Beyond the Melting Pot,” which explored the plausibility of assimilation as a goal for immigrants. He came to the conclusion that total assimilation of minority groups was impossible and that America would never be a country of “unhyphenated Americans,” but rather would comprise multiple identities.
The city often inspired Glazer’s work, according to multiple people who knew him.
Dorman said Glazer’s research showed attention and care to the specifics of city life and its realities.
“He really observed on the ground, he was not a man of grand theories,” Dorman said. “He really in a lot of ways disdained grand theories, because he saw all the ways that large, abstract theories obscured one’s ability to understand particularities of life...all those particulars added up themselves to something larger than any overarching theory could get at.”
Glazer’s appreciation of the “quirks of the city” caused him to disagree with modernism’s bleak views of city life, according to Dorman.
“He really, in that sense, had a wonderful eye and a love for what makes a city a city,” Dorman said.
Glazer grew up in New York City, living in East Harlem and the East Bronx as the child of Jewish immigrants from Warsaw. Though he left the city after his marriage to writer Ruth Gay ended in a divorce, Glazer remained “absolutely fascinated by New York City,” according to his daughter Sophie B. Glazer ’74.
“Long after he left New York he would come back very specifically, to make sure we saw some particular architectural wonder that he delighted in,” Sophie Glazer said.
To celebrate Glazer’s 80th birthday, the two went on an architectural walk around what used to be the Jewish neighborhoods of Harlem, looking at the changes that had taken place since Jewish families had left there to move to the Bronx.
Early in his career, Glazer became involved in radical politics and joined a group called the New York Intellectuals while he was in his 20s. He later built up a reputation as a neo-conservative, a label which Dorman said was applied “erroneously.”
“He was always a kind of independently ascending neo-conservative. He never stopped being one, but he was never a pure one in any way,” said Eugene J. Dionne ’73, Glazer's undergraduate thesis advisee.
Dionne said that while Glazer took a neo-conservative approach to academic policy research, he cared a lot about economic injustice and was anti-war.
Glazer was not afraid to change his stance on political subjects, according to Boston College Political Science Professor Peter N. Skerry, who worked with Glazer as a Ph.D. student.
“Nat Glazer was always a man who was constantly re-evaluating his views, particularly his political and policy views,” Skerry said.
Dorman said one example of Glazer recanting a previous position is when he changed his stance towards affirmative action. Glazer initially stood strongly against affirmative action, even writing a book about the topic, “Affirmative Discrimination,” in 1987. Eleven years later, Glazer published “In Defense of Preference,” an article that argued the country had not yet reached a point at which affirmative action was unnecessary and could be dismantled.
“He was very, very comfortable with contradictions, with the contradictions in his own thought,” Dorman said.
Glazer retired in 1993, but he continued his research and shifted his focus to architecture. Even as he neared the end of his days, when his vision made it difficult for him to read print books, Glazer continued to read history books off of a computer screen.
“He always said he felt lucky to do what he did,” Dionne said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 25, 2019 at 7:32 p.m.
After months of contract negotiations, Harvard’s graduate student union and the University reached tentative agreements on accessibility to employment records and resources for professional development Wednesday, union bargaining committee members wrote in an email Thursday.
The two agreements mark a moment of consensus between the two sides in a bargaining process that has otherwise been characterized by disagreement and deadlock. Union members have met with University officials once every two weeks since October. After coming to two agreements regarding the severability and recognition articles of the union contract on Nov. 7, the two sides remained at an impasse until this month.
Wednesday’s tentative agreements granted student workers the right to view their employment records including course evaluations that students write about teaching fellows, as well as files that document leaves taken by HGSU-UAW members. The employment records agreement also lets graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants petition Harvard to remove evaluations that are “horribly inaccurate” or “discriminatory,” according to a video posted on HGSU-UAW’s Instagram.
The other agreement — which secures some professional development resources for student workers — allows union members to “request options for additional training in areas where they feel like they want to enhance their work,” bargaining committee member Jenni K. Austiff said in the video. The University also tentatively agreed to compensate student workers for attending training sessions.
The HGSU-UAW bargaining committee hailed both agreements as “valuable protections and benefits to our members” in an email to union members Thursday, calling the University’s pledge to provide greater access to employment records a “critical component of job security.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s goal in contract negotiations is to work with the union to arrive at a contract that takes “into account the interests of both the members of this bargaining unit and the entire University community.”
“The University’s primary goal in these negotiation sessions is to ensure that this initial binding contract makes sense and is fair,” he wrote.
Despite Wednesday’s tentative agreements, however, disagreement persists between the University and the union on several other issues including sexual harassment policies. The union put forward a proposal on harassment and discrimination policies in November but quickly rejected a counter-proposal the University made days later, according to union representative Madeleine F. Jennewein. On Wednesday, the University made another counter-proposal, and the union once again declined.
Both the University and the union have not released the details of their respective sexual harassment and discrimination proposals.
The University’s counter-proposal drew criticism from bargaining committee members in their email to other union members Thursday.
“While the administration has made some incremental movement in increasing protections for student workers, their proposed process still leaves the final decision making in hands of administrators with no option for an impartial third party,” the committee wrote.
Swain wrote in an email statement the University’s counter-proposal “responds to concerns HGSU-UAW members have expressed and gives HGSU-UAW a seat at the table in ongoing efforts to strengthen policies and procedures to ensure a safe and healthy educational and work environment.”
It is unclear when Harvard and the union will agree on a contract, though the process could stretch on for months. At New York University — one of the first private universities to recognize a graduate student union and subsequently negotiate multiple contracts — the union and the school were at the bargaining table for 14 months before reaching an agreement on the union’s contract.
As negotiations continue, bargaining committee members are calling on student workers to communicate any suggestions and concerns they have to the committee.
“When people have stories they want us to hear ... we can transmit to the administration the reality of what is happening at this place,” bargaining committee member Hector Medina said in the video posted on the HGSU-UAW Instagram page Thursday.
“We are actively listening to our members,” Medina told student workers. “It’s a two-way street.”

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the agreements reached during the Wednesday meeting marked the first time the University and the union had reached a consensus on an issue. In fact, the University and the union have previously reached a tentative agreement on two articles: Severability and Union Recognition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School affiliates who worked at Massachusetts General Hospital in the years after the hospital cemented ties with Purdue Pharma — manufacturer of the addictive painkiller OxyContin — say they perceived the company’s influence as minimal at the time.
A lawsuit filed by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 against Purdue in June 2018 alleges the company and its top executives knowingly deceived the public about the risks of OxyContin. Purdue allegedly attempted to influence doctors, residents, and medical students at MGH through donations to the hospital from 2002 through at least 2011, according to a memorandum filed by Healey’s office Jan. 15.
Purdue’s executives — among whom are members of the wealthy Sackler family — targeted MGH in particular due to its prominence and past propensity to prescribe OxyContin, the filing alleges. The company contributed $3 million to a pain program in its name at MGH and at least another $500,000 in additional donations.
“[Purdue] staff told the Sacklers that the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program gave Purdue name recognition among medical students, residents, and the public, as well as political protection against efforts to address the opioid crisis,” the filing reads.
But according to more than 30 former medical students who spent time at the hospital between 2003 and 2010 — many of whom went on to work as residents and physicians at MGH after graduating — Purdue’s attempts to curry favor with hospital staff did not appear to have any tangible effects. Most said they did not feel Purdue’s presence at all, and some praised safeguards in place at the hospital designed to prevent pharmaceutical companies from possessing undue influence over hospital activities.
As part of their training, Medical School students regularly cycle through the University’s 15 teaching hospitals, including MGH, to gain experience.
Joseph W.T. McQuaid, a urologic surgeon who graduated from the Medical School in 2009 and then stayed on at MGH as a resident until 2015, said he never felt “pushed” to prescribe a particular narcotic while at the hospital, and treatment decisions largely hinged on the patient’s individual needs.
“In urologic surgery, which is my specialty, we use a lot of narcotics and certainly are prescribing them frequently, and not once in my training did I ever hear about any of this,” he said. “I never experienced any pressure to prescribe a certain type of a narcotic as a trainee.”
Other former students said that though the medical community did not yet fully grasp the dangers of long-term high-dose opioid use at the time, policies at MGH and the Medical School shielded them from feeling Purdue’s efforts to promote its narcotic to doctors and Medical School students.
“As a student, I remember MGH doing a good job of insulating us from any pharma influence, and don't recall being exposed to any pharma companies,” Anthony D. Sung, a 2008 HMS graduate, wrote in an email.
Purdue began selling OxyContin in 1996, and prescriptions of the drug soon exploded, producing over $1 billion annually in revenue for the company. But in 2007, Purdue settled with the United States Department of Justice for roughly $600 million for misleading doctors, patients, and regulators about the narcotic’s risk of addiction and potential to be abused. The company pledged at the time to change its practices.
But last week’s memorandum alleges that Purdue’s deceptive behavior continued after that settlement, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Massachusetts residents.
A key element in the company’s strategy, according to the filing, was donating large sums to leading hospitals and universities, including MGH and Tufts University.
Though Healey portrays the Purdue Pain Program and other donations to MGH as a beneficial investment for the pharmaceutical company, the reality is more complicated, according to O’Neil Britton, chief medical officer at MGH.
Britton says the hospital’s relationship with Purdue faltered after an MGH researcher — using funds from Purdue — published a “sentinel” study in the New England Journal of Medicine highlighting the dangers of prescribing high-dose opioids for non-oncological pain management.
Robert Josephson, a spokesperson for Purdue, did not directly refute Britton’s account, referring only to a previous statement from the company.
“Purdue’s led industry efforts to combat prescription drug abuse, which has included collaborating with law enforcement, funding enhancements and improvements to state prescription drug monitoring programs and directing health care professionals to the CDC’s Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain,” Josephson wrote.
As deaths from prescription painkillers — as well as heroin and other synthetic drugs such as fentanyl — increased exponentially and quickly grew into a national crisis, the consensus among doctors has evolved. Whereas physicians used to commonly prescribe opioids for chronic pain, these drugs are now largely reserved for patients with cancer, in hospice, or recovering from a serious surgery.
In order to reduce the risk of improper pressure to prescribe, MGH officials have sharply limited the ability of pharmaceutical companies to meet with doctors and medical school students in the past ten years, according to Britton.
“We have gone from probably an open-door policy to a very closed-door tight-knit process,” he said.
Britton said Purdue’s attempts to fund MGH research are not inconsistent with the behavior of other pharmaceutical companies, especially when dealing with highly-regarded hospitals such as MGH, where studies carry disproportionate weight in the medical community.
“From their standpoint, when there is good news around a trial, and when it comes from a prominent place, where everyone considers that place to have great scientific integrity, it’s a boon for them,” he said. “It’s a publicly traded company, they announce successful trials all the time, and with a shared brand, around a Harvard institution or Stanford or any other big hospital, it’s a big boon for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Come February, some Harvard researchers might not receive their paychecks on time because of the ongoing partial federal government shutdown.
At least eight postdoctoral fellows, whose research is funded by government agencies including the National Science Foundation, will not receive their monthly paychecks at the beginning of February if the governmental gridlock stretches on for another week. During the shutdown, the agencies are unable to process their payments.
The shutdown — now the longest in American history — has lasted thirty-four days as of Thursday as President Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress have sparred over the administration’s plan to build a wall on the United States-Mexico border. Trump has asked for $5.7 billion to fund the project, while Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and other high-ranking Democrats have staunchly refused to provide the cash.
“I could imagine people that are on the NSF and don’t have some savings up, or they don’t have friends that, you know, could just lend you some money before you’re paying back,” said Christopher Gerig, a postdoctoral fellow in the mathematics department whose funding comes from the NSF. “Then, that’s a huge issue.”
A spokesperson for the NSF did not respond to a request for comment.
As some fellows face the possibility of not receiving their February paychecks on time, the University is also considering how to support affected postdoctoral researchers, Stephen Kargère, director of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Office for Postdoctoral Affairs, wrote in an emailed statement.
“The plan is to support them through this really tough time for them and their families,” he wrote.
He noted, however, that specific plans for helping the researchers are still “under consideration.” One possibility is that Harvard could give them loans, he wrote.
As some fellows wonder when they will receive their next paycheck, they cannot turn to the NSF to answer funding questions. Roughly 1,700 of the NSF’s 2,000 employees are not designated essential personnel, meaning they have been on furlough during the shutdown. As a result, the agency cannot process grant requests, make payments, or respond to inquiries.
“I don’t have anyone I can ask,” Joel R. Leja, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, wrote in an email.
The shutdown has also removed another resource that some postdoctoral fellows use to seek answers to questions they have about their NSF funding: because of the shutdown, the annual NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowships conference — usually held in early January — did not take place in 2019.
“This is our venue to get guidance regarding the NSF AAPF rules, how we are allowed to spend our research fund, how to best fulfill our obligations to the NSF, etc.,” Leja wrote. “As the NSF administrators were furloughed this year, none of this happened. This has caused a lot of confusion, particularly among new fellows.”
Postdoctoral fellows are not the only ones whose research funding might be affected by the shutdown; some faculty members have been unable to renew and receive grants, collaborate with federal scientists on furlough, and access some government databases.
Though fellows funded directly by the NSF might not see their February stipends on time, not all Harvard postdoctoral researchers or students whose funding originates with the NSF face that risk. Some Harvard graduate students participate in the NSF’s Graduate Research Fellowship Program, which provides monthly stipends, covers students’ tuition, and sponsors their research. Those individuals are still able to receive their monthly stipends because the NSF funded those grants in lump sum payments to the University before the shutdown started.
Harvard is responsible for distributing those NSF funds to students — a responsibility University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard would continue to fulfill.
“The University is continuing to pay fellowship stipends for fellowships awarded to Harvard University, even if the federal agency that is the source of funding is included in the partial federal government shutdown,” he wrote.
It is unclear when the political gridlock will end. The Senate voted on two bills Thursday that proposed ways to end the shutdown, but ultimately the legislative body rejected both.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two weekends away from Bright-Landry, the Harvard men's hockey team returns to face off against visitors No. 10/9 Clarkson. The Crimson (8-6-3, 5-5-2 ECAC) is skating against the Golden Knights (16-6-0, 7-3-0) for the first time all season on Friday night; the last time the two teams saw each other was in a heartbreaking OT loss for Harvard last season at Lake Placid. As always against a ranked team, a win could have ranking implications for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team has a bad history with Clarkson and 3-1 leads. On Friday night, the Crimson found itself in that dangerous position again, having lost its lead and fighting in overtime for two points. This time, though, a set play boosted Harvard past the Golden Knights.
On an offensive zone draw two minutes into the extra frame, the Crimson called a timeout. The plan was simple: sophomore Jack Badini, the nation’s second-best faceoff man (67%), would win the draw back to his classmate, defenseman Reilly Walsh. Walsh would rip the shot to the far side of Clarkson junior net-minder Jake Kielly. And it happened exactly as they planned.
“It went perfectly,” Badini said. “Probably if I did that ten times, it would happen once or twice.”
A heartbeat after the puck was dropped on that last faceoff, Walsh’s OT winner helped Harvard (9-6-3, 8-5-2 ECAC) topple No. 10/9 Clarkson (16-7-0, 7-4-0), snapping the visitors’ eight-game winning streak. Sophomores shone on the scoresheet: all four goal-scorers for the Crimson were second-years.
But the contest did not begin so favorably for the home side. Less than four minutes into the contest, Clarkson struck first. Junior co-captain Nico Sturm was positioned in front of Harvard senior goaltender Michael Lackey just in time to receive a feed from junior linemate Haralds Egle. His quick shot slipped through Lackey on his glove side.
In past games this season, the Crimson has faltered to start play and failed to recover from early setbacks. This was not one of those games. Instead of allowing the momentum to shift wholly in the Golden Knights’ favor, Harvard pressed on, outshooting Clarkson almost two to one in the first period. That pressure paid off late in the frame, as Badini beat Kielly with a backhand to knot the game at one.
“When you play good teams, you really just have to stay with it,” head coach Ted Donato said. “...Win or lose, I thought we did a lot of good things.”
The Crimson was in turn outshot 6-14 in the second period, but the team put up two unanswered goals. The first of those came, again, from Badini on the rush, on a feed from junior forward Nathan Krusko. The second came after a strong effort from co-captain Michael Floodstrand, who forced a turnover and fed sophomore Henry Bowlby at the right circle. Though the Golden Knights had their chances, momentum seemed to be going Harvard’s way.
“I thought we played well in the third period,” coach Donato said. “We gave up a couple chances, a couple bounces end up in our net. But that’s what good teams do to you.”
Clarkson arrived with a response in the third period. Rookies Josh Dunne and Anthony Callin each tallied a goal for the visitors, and in six minutes of regulation with the score tied, neither team could pull ahead. Particularly disappointing for the Crimson was the fact that the tying goal ricocheted off a defender’s stick — Walsh’s stick. But Walsh found redemption with his own tally, and Harvard emerged from the night with two points.
Interestingly, the whole game was played without a single penalty being called — a factor that might have changed the contest, considering Harvard’s NCAA-best power play. The shoot-first mentality and quick pace the team kept up during the game, however, served it well despite the lack of special teams. Three Crimson players had five shots to their name: Badini, rookie defenseman Jack Rathbone, and junior defenseman Adam Fox. At the other end of the ice, Lackey’s .903 save percentage goes against his fairly consistent recent successes. But the net-minder did not look shaky, despite the numbers.
A fruitful offense is crucial as Harvard comes upon the next milestone of the season. The Beanpot is fast approaching, and while the Crimson has tested itself against BU, its other crosstown rivals pose different challenges. In terms of ECAC play, the table is tighter than ever: only three points separate sixth-place Harvard from Cornell at the top of the table. Upcoming matchups against St. Lawrence, Dartmouth, and No. 16 Union will make all the difference to the Crimson’s seeding hopes.

One of the most unexpectedly stressful parts of going to Harvard is crossing the street. No matter where you live, you just can’t avoid this high-stakes task, even when you’re heading to an interview or midterm that’s nerve wracking enough on its own. While this everyday nightmare is something that all students must face, we all go about it in our own way. So, what’s your pedestrian style?
The Sheep
Once upon a time, you knew how to “look left” and “look right”, but now you look straight ahead at other pedestrians, trust their judgment, and cross when they cross. People accuse you of being a lazy follower, but you know this is a genius strategy to make others do the mental labor of deciding when to cross.
The Reckless
Drivers and bikers tremble in fear when they sense your aura nearby. You look both ways before crossing, but you cross no matter what you see coming your way, forcing someone to hurriedly hit the brakes. You make eye contact with the poor driver through the windshield and smirk at them as you walk by. You are either absolutely fearless or just running late. Nothing like relishing in the knowledge that you are going to lead a Sheep to disaster one day.
The Indecisive
A string of cars are coming, or maybe that red hand on the traffic light is flashing for the last few times. You can’t tell if there’s time to make it across and decide to wait it out. When you realize that you totally could have gone four seconds ago, you suddenly bolt across the street without thinking. Some driver gets annoyed and honks at you, and you anxiously replay that moment in your head for the rest of the day.
The Slowest Walker On The Planet
You cover ground more slowly than Ice Age glaciers did. As you amble across the street, other pedestrians stream past you. Sometimes you walk slowly because you’re going someplace you don’t want to be, but usually, this is just who you are.
The Orderly
You wait when you’re supposed to wait, walk at a reasonable pace, smile at strangers, wave at babies, and say excuse me. You deserve nothing but excellent pedestrian experiences, but somehow unfortunate things keep happening to you. Your phone falls, your coffee spills, cars splash you, or your foot gets stuck in an uncovered hole in the road. Why is the world so unfair?
If you’re going to cross the street every day in Cambridge, you might as well do it with some personal flair. Go forth and travel safely from destination to destination!
