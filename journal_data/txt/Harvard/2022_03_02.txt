After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My first week on campus involved a lot of laughter and looks of confusion. In the hustle of introducing myself to the largest freshman class size that Harvard College has ever had, I would run through quick facts about myself and then wait for the responses of my peers. The responses of mirth and barely hidden chuckles, gasps and words of pity were quick to come on everyone’s faces. No one ever seemed happy or interested to know I was from Oklahoma.
I understand that it might be easy to look down upon my seemingly average pan-handled home state from the supposedly extravagant East and West Coasts. But when I introduce myself as a student from Oklahoma, I am not looking for reactions of shock or giggles or second-hand embarrassment. Rather, I am looking for an understanding that our respective hometowns played a crucial role in making us the people that we are today. Reactions that look down upon the place where I was born and raised seem to only cement the notion that my home is less than others, thereby making me less than others. To outsiders, I am simply the girl from Oklahoma, nothing more.
I know that Oklahoma deserves some of the negative reactions it gets. And frankly, I disapprove of some aspects of Oklahoma as well, like its troublesome history — such as the Tulsa Race Massacre, where a white mob burned over a thousand buildings and killed hundreds of Black people — and abusive, uninformed decisions. Even the creation of Oklahoma was undesirable: It began as a territory for the use of the colonizing American government to forcefully relocate thousands of Native Americans on the Trail of Tears. Moving forward through time, Oklahoma hasn’t done much to change that negative reputation. The Bible Belt state leads with some of the worst public schools, the most damaged public health, and the highest incarceration rate in the U.S. Moreover, two years into the pandemic, much of Oklahoma still opposes measures that prevent the spread of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.
But this place, with all of its pitfalls, is my home. This is the place where I had my first kiss, my first crush, my first love. This is the place with the most beautiful clouds and fruitful land I’ve ever seen. This is one of the few places where stars still shine undimmed by pollution and where the moon seems to light up the whole night sky. This is a place full of back porch conversations and rampant tornadoes with children huddled around the windows to “catch themselves a ‘nader.” Not being fully south or midwest, Oklahoma still encompasses the classic Southern hospitality and Midwestern “get ‘er done” attitude. This place is my home. I don’t claim or identify with its behavior and continued problems — but I do claim the memories and relationships that I have built here. I claim the rolling plains and the turbulent winds. I claim the open space and the clean air. I claim the smiles through the car windows and the waves as you pass someone on the street. I claim the Oklahoma that helped raise me and nurture me to become who I am today.
So when people laugh at or pity a small-town girl from rural Oklahoma, they do so with the limited knowledge that an outsider would have. But when I say I am from Oklahoma, I am not laughing or looking for pity. For my classmates to automatically see my home state as a negative reflection of who I am further alienates me from them. To frown upon others' roots rather than being understanding of where they come from is emblematic of the rising division in our nation, perpetuating an environment that is already dense with the disease of “us versus them.” In a world where we are all just striving to belong, why should one person’s birthplace be inferior to another’s? I am simply saying that I come from my home, the same as you. I am a girl from Oklahoma, nothing more and nothing less.
Home is not a physical location. Home is where you find your safe space. Home is where comfort can thrive peacefully in the uncomfortable. Let’s rejoice in the diversity of people’s homes, let’s understand that they are complex and can be the worst and yet most important place in someone’s life. Take pride in the place you grew up in, even with all the roses and thorns. Don’t judge your home with the opinions of others, rather see it through the memories of your life. I celebrate my home and know that one day I will bring it change. The parts of it that I don’t claim, the tangled lines of the state’s history, will one day be transformed. One day, we will all find the beauty of each other’s homes and empathize with the roots of each other’s stories.
I love my home with all my hate, and you should too. It’s Oklahoma, a love-hate story after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, I heard the metallic clink of tiny coffee spoons against porcelain reverberate through a cafe in downtown Florence; the espresso machine, operated with fast, frantic precision, filled the looming frescoed ceilings with high pitched squeals. I fidgeted with two euro coins in hand as I stood in a crooked line, bothered by the inconsiderately animated conversations around me, the elderly people squinting their eyes haltingly to discern the glossy glass dessert case contents, and the wonderstruck tourists who took up too much of the limited space.
As usual, the jokes and small talk exchanged between cafe patron and cashier held up the line and made the transaction most inefficient. But having grown up partly in Florence, coffee is a religious affair, and ever since I can remember, this crowded cafe has remained one of my family and friends’ favorite gathering places. So as always, I waited.
I can be impatient, though. I can recall too many times that I hurried through the ritual to rush into the pristine emptiness of the piazza, to break from the noisy bustle — even though it was this wonderful chaos I would come to miss the most.
A few waves of pandemic out, I regret my irreverence. I should’ve listened closer to the coffee spoon clinks calling strangers, friends, and family to gather. Treating these endangered moments of connectedness and noise and chaos as a duty rather than a privilege, I squandered the tiniest, most wonderfully insignificant moments.
I feel this sensibility more than ever now, as I’ve witnessed cafes in post-pandemic Florence grow quieter. The welcoming clinks no longer ring out from open doors and street corners, but rather echo occasionally from behind thick, beige-walled apartment buildings. Ever since the lockdown started last year, the clinks have mostly been replaced with the muted shuffle of paper takeaway cups. These antiseptic units usher customers in and out of the cafe quickly. They make coffee appear most unnatural in the hand of an Italian — someone who has internalized devotion to the sanctity of a singular moment of pause that can come in a porcelain cup.
One year ago, I visited the cafe for one last time before a complete lockdown, before it would close indefinitely for the first time since World War II. This time, with no line, I proceeded all too quickly. Soft jazz music, ordinarily drowned out by voices, played overhead — a sound too cinematically and uncomfortably fitting. I could see the glistening marble countertops too clearly — the same ones usually covered by leaning arms and gesturing coat sleeves. The bottles of liquor at the bar were arranged too neatly. Like the emptiness of Piazza Duomo or the perfect stillness of Piazza della Signoria, everything was too quietly flawless and statically beautiful. The coffee tasted better when we sipped rubbing elbows with strangers, overhearing snippets of the lives we would probably never come to know.
I felt the loss of the old coffee ritual so deeply because chaos colors the lives we live. The tangential moments we share and the small unimportant things matter. And in the face of big, uncontrollable things, they matter even more.
Months later, I visited Harvard hoping that being physically on campus might somehow fill the college-shaped void in me. But without shouts across the Yard, or the shuffle between lectures in Sanders, or even the whirring threat of nearly getting run over by a scooter, the millions of tiny red bricks and the still gaze of John Harvard offered little solace.
This year, returning to life on campus finally hushed that silence. Off Zoom, it’s easy to appreciate the tangibles that make Harvard a special place: the resources, the academics, the beautiful Houses we inhabit. But what makes it truly alive are the moments we bring into its spaces. It’s the way we live in them. The way our conversations flow from common rooms to dining halls or the debates that keep us up too late at night. It’s the sound of us and all our passions, the continuous Cambridge traffic background noise included.
While distanced from Harvard, I found that, oddly, I was as nostalgic for the good, serendipitous moments as the messy, even distressing ones I encountered while on campus. The good and the bad of chaos, inextricably intertwined, cannot exist one without the other. But in the silence, it felt like neither. And as the pandemic waxes and wanes, the sounds come and go — but when I do hear them now, I listen a little more closely, maybe just a little more patiently, too.
Each sound is a heartbeat, and when they become more frequent, they create a pulse. Or maybe each sound is the ticking of a clock. Things change around us, but the clock keeps on ticking, time keeps passing, and for better or for worse, everything keeps on going. It is at once unnerving and comforting to realize these moments are all we really have. And if that’s the case, then we should appreciate them all the more — for all their color, chaos, and wonderful insignificance.

On February 18, 2022, Demya T. Toogood ’23 got stood up. It was just four days after Valentine’s Day, but it wasn’t a date who flaked on her — it was her Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services therapist.
The excuse? None was provided in the short, to-the-point note that Toogood received from her clinician, in which she learned that her appointment — slated to take place in just four hours — had been postponed to April 8, thundering in a rain-check of nearly two months.
“I feel like literally everyone has had problems with CAMHS,” Toogood told me. “It’s what’s here, but I didn’t really have very high expectations.”
Toogood’s underlying intuition is woefully prescient: Today, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, the wait time for an initial appointment at CAMHS stands at six weeks. That’s a lengthy drudge in any setting, but it’s particularly weighty within the domain of mental healthcare, where a single day of delayed access could induce a 1 percent loss of patients. And in Harvard's own gates, weeks-long appointment delays are not only a cornerstone of campus-wide chatter, but have also been tied to help-seeking aversions, worsened wellbeing, and even hospitalizations.
The resource strains which undergird this problem are taking place at the wealthiest academic institution in the world. So why can’t Harvard just dole out some gold from its  53 billion dollar pot? Sadly, it’s not that simple: According to University Health Services Director Giang T.  Nguyen, the endowment is already earmarked for specific schools and units. And so the outwardly bottomless chest retains an untouchable mystique, a dismal reflection of its limited flexibility despite its enormity.
Instead, the entirety of HUHS’ infrastructure — of which CAMHS is just one small portion — is funded by the student health fee, currently set at $621, and bolstered by occasional philanthropic donations. In other words, HUHS functions much like a traditional health maintenance organization. Every system of this sort tends to require some form of rationing, because healthcare demand will virtually always outstrip supply. In some cases, rationing is gratingly explicit, and patients are flat-out turned away. In others, care is rationed based on one’s ability to pay. And in still other instances, like here at home, we get slapped onto a CAMHS waitlist, or flaked on by our very own providers.
But we’re all getting manhandled by the system, clinicians and students alike, as we struggle to operate on a student-fueled budget that’s bereft of any financial backing from the University; an institution that, while seeping with wealth, is seemingly just as detached as it is endowed.
As the University fails to lift its invisible hand, CAMHS has spent years swimming in a sea of since-sunken solutions: In April 2017, CAMHS started working with iHope, an online program that was met with tremendous success; offering students free, evidence-based care through video-conferencing sessions. But the partnership has since been severed – swapped out for a collection of online CAMHS groups and workshops, according to Newton. In another reach for a lifeline, CAMHS crafted a revised appointment model back in the spring of 2018, which cut wait times for a short while. But its limited success flickered with the seasons, dimming almost completely by the following fall.
But as CAMHS has been treading through testy waters for years, pushing with resolve to stay afloat, the organization hasn’t come out completely empty and dry. The July 2021 introduction of the CAMHS Cares Line, reachable at 617-495-2042, marks the team’s latest stab at wrestling excess capacity — and the 24/7 support line, made possible by parent philanthropy, has in fact gained steady traction.
Admittedly, this line – despite its ambitious aims – is limited in its capacity to deliver efficacious care, not least because most students turn to CAMHS in pursuit of consistent and stable therapy, a demand which the evidence backs. But the significance of the line rests more in what it tacitly signals than in what it can tangibly do: CAMHS cares, as the line’s name so fittingly suggests.
And those who care, I’m convinced, will find a way to deliver. Maybe that includes bringing iHope back in the game — after all, CAMHS has proved that it has the infrastructural capacity to forge such partnerships. Maybe it means more proactively soliciting donations; or maybe it means something else entirely.
Only time will tell. In the interim, we’re waiting for solutions – and the line is out the door.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard faculty members gathered in a lecture hall last Friday — but not to teach a class. Rather, they were there to learn about graduate students’ calls for changes to Harvard's sexual harassment reporting process.
The Feminist Working Group of Harvard’s graduate student union hosted the teach-in, which aimed to engage faculty in the union’s calls for reforms to sexual misconduct complaint procedures. The union has long petitioned for the University to allow third-party arbitration for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints.
Koby D. Ljunggren, president of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, co-led the event with legal experts and Jade d’Alpoim Guedes — an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of California, San Diego, who alleged former Harvard Anthropology professor Gary Urton sexually harassed her while she was a graduate student.
“Faculty have expressed a lot of confusion surrounding our demands around improvements on University processes that deal with cases of identity- and power-based harassment and discrimination,” an event description said.
“The protections and procedures the University currently offers are inadequate and do not provide justice for survivors,” the event description said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
Following a lawsuit challenging the University's handling of sexual misconduct complaints against Harvard professor John L. Comaroff, the teach-in aimed to offer Harvard faculty a chance to learn about the union’s push for revised Title IX procedures.
“One of the big deficiencies in our campaign is that it’s always been very difficult to engage faculty,” Ljunggren said. “It’s always been one of our goals to bring faculty into the fold and help get faculty up to speed in this conversation.”
Ljunggren also offered an overview of different campus groups’ demands, highlighting Our Harvard Can Do Better, an undergraduate advocacy group dedicated to ending “institutional and cultural enablers of sexual violence at Harvard.”
Ljunggren said the union hopes to take its demands for third-party arbitration beyond small-scale faculty outreach.
“I think the next idea now is to go to the department level and try to do departmental teach-ins as well,” they said. “Because some faculty might not be super comfortable coming into an everyone-invited space, and at the local level, they might feel more comfortable.”
Now away from the bargaining table after HGSU-UAW ratified a four-year contract in November, Ljunggren noted that the union is moving towards broader reforms to how the University deals with sexual harassment complaints.
“Since our contract isn’t up for negotiation, what we’re really pushing for is independence and transparency in the Title IX process,” Ljunggren said. “We’re hoping that, by pushing for those things, down the line we will also be able to achieve things like third-party arbitration.”
Ljunggren added that the union hopes to build a broader “campus-wide coalition.”
“In terms of our demands from this campaign, we're really trying to focus on the whole campus community and not just ourselves,” they said.

Harvard’s Institute of Politics announced the launch of its Student Leader Scholarship, a pilot initiative that will provide a $2,000 need-based scholarship for several of the Institute’s undergraduate student leaders during the IOP’s 2022 student leadership term.
Only five to seven of the 32 members in the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee will be awarded scholarships under the pilot program. The fund aims to “support a consistent commitment to engagement and learning at the Institute of Politics.”
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 wrote in a statement that the IOP worked alongside the Harvard College Office of Financial Aid, Phillips Brooks House Association, and Harvard Kennedy School to create the initiative.
“We understand that IOP leadership roles can be a significant time commitment and students of every background should be able to lead at the IOP and consider careers in politics and public service,” Gearan wrote.
Janna E. Ramadan ’23, president of the IOP, said in an interview Sunday that she hopes the scholarship will lessen the financial burden on students who make a major time commitment to work at the IOP.
“We recognize students that are in SAC or in IOP leadership are giving a lot of their time to this institute,” she said.
IOP Vice President Tabitha L. Escalante ’23 said she understands the importance of needing financial support because she used to work four jobs on top of her involvement in the IOP.
“It’s obviously something that you can’t always put your entire heart and soul into when there are other things going on in your life,” she said. “It’s a choice every day to be able to do that, and it gets tough.”
Ramadan said it was critical that the Student Leader Scholarship not impact the financial aid packages of its recipients.
Melody M. Wang ’22, who serves as a chief of staff in the Fellows and Study Groups program, called the scholarship a “step in the right direction” but said she believed that it needs to be expanded to other members of the IOP.
She noted there are non-SAC leadership positions to which students devote a lot of time and where financial support would also be helpful.
“I think recognizing that is important,” Wang said. “If the IOP could help with the financial accessibility for people like me, or in my role, I certainly think it’d be beneficial.”
IOP spokesperson Lauren L. Miller said in an emailed statement that the Institute hopes the fund will help eliminate financial barriers for students and that the IOP intends to “reassess it in the future.”
Escalante said they are hoping to launch a general fund later in the spring semester that will be “specifically geared toward general members.”
“We really want to break down any financial barriers that may come up for students before they actually even enter to ensure that they know that the IOP is a place that’s welcoming of people of all backgrounds,” she said.
Ramadan said that the origins of the scholarship extend back to Jerry “DJ” Lacy ’22, who served as the IOP’s treasurer in 2020. Lacy said he thinks the scholarship is going to be “huge” for students going forward.
“It definitely makes me feel better about leaving the IOP, and hopefully I left it in a better spot than when I found it,” he said.
Correction: March 2, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated five to seven of the of Harvard IOP’s 32-member Student Advisory Committee are eligible to apply for the Institute’s new scholarship program. In fact, all Student Advisory Committee members are eligible to apply, but only five to seven will be awarded the scholarship.

Harvard Yard was struck by three burglaries in nine days, with students in Canaday Hall, Mower Hall, and Wigglesworth Hall reporting trespassers and stolen laptops.
During all three thefts, a suspect trespassed into a student’s residence, stole a laptop, and escaped undetected. Several other items were also stolen in the Wigglesworth burglary, including two additional laptops, an iPhone, and an iPad.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote an advisory email to Harvard affiliates Friday afternoon after the first two burglaries at Mower and Wigglesworth.
“In both instances, occupants reported that while they were sleeping, someone climbed through their first floor window and stole laptops, Air Pods, a backpack, and a wallet from their rooms,” Catalano wrote.
In the advisory, Catalano reminded students to secure their dorms’ windows and doors and urged them to report any suspicious activity in or around the undergraduate residences. He added that it was unclear whether the Mower and Wigglesworth incidents were related.
Nicholas D. G. Apostolicas ’25, who lives in Mower Hall, said he had left the window in his first-floor suite’s common room open about six inches while working on a project in his bedroom next door. Around 2 a.m., an intruder slid open the window screen and climbed in.
“I was completely oblivious to what was happening,” Apostolicas said. “If I instead just went out to say hi to my roommate or something, I wonder about how that would have gone down.”
According to Apostolicas, the members of his suite did not notice anything amiss until the following morning when his roommate texted their group chat to ask if anyone had seen his laptop. Soon after, Apostolicas noticed that some of their belongings, such as masks and water bottles, had been thrown out of their common room window.
“Things started to click then, and I was like, ‘Oh, shoot,’” Apostolicas said. “We called HUPD but, honestly, they say ‘Oh, we'll look into it,’ but we just know nothing's going to be done.”
“If they had cameras or stuff that would have been a lot different, but there's really just not much they’re able to do in order to help,” he added.
Four days later, HUPD closed the case with no resolution.
Apostolicas noted that though several other expensive items were also in the common room, such as his camera, the thief had only stolen the laptop.
“The whole situation is quite bizarre and kind of frightening as well,” he said.
Connor J. Buchheit ’25, who lives in Mower Hall in the dorm adjacent to Apostolicas’ suite, said he was shocked to learn of the incident.
“I certainly felt a little bit scared because it’s the dorm right next to me,” Buccheit said. “We've been keeping the window closed ever since that happened at all times.”
Sabrina M. Freidus ’25, whose laptop was stolen during the Canaday burglary two days after the advisory, said she was surprised that someone burglarized her suite given that it is not on the ground floor.
“I always thought that, being on the fourth floor, we were safe from anything like that,” Freidus said. “The fact that we have a hallway door and a suite door — I just didn't think that it would happen.”
Freidus said she noticed the suspect — whom she described as a tall man wearing a puffy navy jacket — standing outside her door as she was leaving her suite Sunday evening. She thought the man was one of her suitemates’ guests and allowed him to enter. When she returned, she could not find her laptop, though none of her floormates’ belongings had been taken.
Freidus noted that her laptop was still connected to Apple’s Find My application, and that since the theft, she had watched its movements using the service. Since the burglary, the laptop has been transported to Medford and Boston’s South Bay neighborhood.
“I don't think it's going to change my mindset when I walk around campus,” Freidus said. “But I am definitely going to be better about keeping our suite door locked.”

Sherrilyn Ifill, an influential civil rights lawyer who leads the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, will receive the 2022 Radcliffe Medal, Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study announced last Friday.
Ifill, an author and law school professor, has headed the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund since 2013.
The medal, the highest award given out by the Radcliffe Institute, honors an annual recipient who “embodies its commitment to excellence, inclusion, and social impact,” a press release announcing Ifill’s selection said. It was first awarded in 1987.
Previous recipients of the award include former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, author Toni Morrison, philanthropist Melinda F. Gates, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Ifill will receive the award on Radcliffe Day, which is held during Harvard’s Commencement week in May.
As an NAACP lawyer, she has litigated voting rights cases and fought against education inequities and voter suppression. She first joined the NAACP in 1988, but left the organization to join the faculty at the University of Maryland Law School in Baltimore, where she taught constitutional law and civil procedure.
Ifill serves on a commission assembled by President Joe Biden last year that is tasked with examining reforms to the Supreme Court.
Ifill was previously recognized as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine.
This year, Radcliffe Day’s programming will focus on examining how to increase inclusivity in higher education.
“Sherrilyn embodies Radcliffe’s highest ideals,” Tomiko Brown-Nagin, the Radcliffe Institute’s dean, said in a press release. “She is an influential scholar and educator, and she is deeply engaged in the hard work of change making. As a nation, we owe a great deal to her pathbreaking leadership.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team of YouTubers disguised as Harvard students crashed some undergraduate classes Tuesday to the dismay of several professors and students.
Jidion Adams, known on YouTube as “JiDion,” trespassed into at least two classes — a General Education course in Harvard Hall and an introductory biology course in Sanders Theatre. Adams, who has over 4 million subscribers on YouTube, is known for making prank videos.
According to students in Life Sciences 1B: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences,” a group clad in Harvard apparel and talking loudly entered Sanders Theatre well after class had begun. Students said Andrew J. Berry, an LS1b professor, asked the impostors to leave after Adams began typing noisily on a vintage typewriter.
The YouTubers initially left but returned shortly and began shouting on the balcony of the theater. After Berry confronted them again, they left a second time. Hopi E. Hoekstra, the LS1b professor lecturing when the group entered Sanders Theatre, continued teaching through the interruption.
Berry said he asked Sanders’ audiovisual staff to call the Harvard University Police Department, who arrived after the group had left. HUPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Adams declined to comment on the interruptions, though he posted on Twitter and Instagram stating that he had been “kicked out of Harvard.”
LS1B student Raymond Zheng ’25 said he “didn’t appreciate” the interruption and called it “disrespectful,” though he noticed some students in the class found humor in the situation.
Hoekstra wrote in a statement that she felt “lucky” to teach Harvard students because of their “maturity and composure” during the disruption.
Adams also gave an impromptu speech at a rally hosted by Asian American student groups supporting the creation of an ethnic studies department, where he claimed he was a Harvard student on his first day of class.
Asian American Association board member and rally organizer Chelsea Wang ’25 said she deduced Adams was not a Harvard student and though his overall message was “positive,” she was “a little concerned about his role in the rally.”
In an emailed statement, Adams wrote that he “loved the message” of the prior speakers and said he related to “the struggles of not getting the same opportunities as others.”
Saba Mehrzad ’25, a student in Gen Ed 1052: “Race in a Polarized America,” said Adams crashed her class, interrupting the professor several times with off-topic questions and comments.
Mehrzad said she found it “kind of alarming” how easily non-affiliates could sneak into Harvard classes.
Jennifer L. Hochschild, the professor for the Gen Ed, wrote in an email that the interruption was “frustrating and disrespectful.”
“I am especially concerned that the interruption was disturbing to many of the students — who were perfectly polite and remained focused on the class material, but were clearly dismayed,” Hochschild wrote.
Berry said he responded to the ordeal in an effort to minimize disruption to the lecture.
“I’m assuming that there will be plenty of disappointed YouTube-ees who feel it’s necessary to contact me to tell me that I was disrespecting this person’s rights,” he said. “But, anyway, I was respecting the rights of my students to epigenetics.”
“I’m just pleased that we managed to get rid of these clowns,” Berry added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard Divinity School alumni in humanitarian aid professions reflected on the impact of their education at HDS and discussed the intersection of ethics, religion, and spirituality at a virtual panel Tuesday.
The discussion included three HDS alumni — interim director of Religion and Inclusive Societies at U.S. Institute of Peace Palwasha L. Kakar, Church World Service President Richard L. “Rick” Santos, and International Bridges to Justice founder Karen I. Tse.
Moderator Susan O. “Susie” Hayward, associate director for the Religious Literacy and the Professions Initiative at HDS, began by acknowledging the importance of the panel, noting the crisis in Ukraine and other locations around the world.
“This is critical for a world that faces current and pending crises, like the current crisis unfolding in Ukraine, which I know is top of our mind and hearts,” Hayward said. “But also those currently unfolding, in Yemen, in Myanmar, in Syria, and those currently unfolding and yet to unfold related to the climate collapse that is causing untold suffering in many places around the world.”
The panelists discussed how HDS improved their understanding of the intricacies of spirituality and religion in the context of humanitarian action. Kakar described learning to better navigate the “messiness and the complexity of religious roles and institutions, both in conflict and peace and politics.”
“It really helped me in the work that I do at the United States Institute of Peace, on doing religious landscape mappings and really developing a methodology where it's not someone from the outside, but voices from the inside telling us what's important about the religious narratives, what's important about institutions,” Kakar said.
When discussing the ethics of resource procurement and decision-making, Santos said many of the issues surrounding funding and resource allocation center around the historical power of European and U.S. countries.
“I think the long-term justice issues have to revolve around who makes decisions, who has the power in that decision-making,” Santos said.
Tse said she believed addressing such questions of justice often deeply involves spirituality, a connection she found during her time at HDS.
While at Harvard, Tse said she realized that “love and justice and spirituality are very married.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students called on Harvard to establish an ethnic studies department and condemn racism against Asian Americans during a Tuesday morning rally in Harvard Yard.
More than thirty affiliates joined the rally, which was co-hosted by the Asian American Association, the Asian American Women’s Association, and the Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies. The protesters opted to congregate outside University Hall, where the Faculty of Arts and Sciences would previously gather for its monthly meetings.
The FAS faculty held its March meeting virtually Tuesday afternoon.
The rally was catalyzed by the racist attack against Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22, in which signs containing an anti-Asian racist slur were posted on his door last month. Organizers said though the protest was prompted by the racist incident, the rally's main purpose was to advocate for an ethnic studies department.
Students at Harvard have been calling for an ethnic studies concentration for decades. Despite a pause in the search for ethnic studies faculty in 2020 due to Covid-19, FAS Dean Claudine Gay told The Crimson last month that the FAS is now “actively recruiting” four scholars.
In a speech during the rally, AAA board member Chelsea Wang ’25 said the racial slur fueled the “perpetual foreigner status” of Asian Americans, and she condemned the lack of Asian American history in school curricula at Harvard and beyond.
“As long as Asian American history is not taught as American history, Asian Americans will never be Americans,” Wang said.
Muskaan Arshad ’25 questioned whether ethnic studies is an “institutional commitment” in her speech and said Harvard is an “inhospitable place” for scholars of ethnic studies, citing the high-profile departure of African and African American Studies professor Cornel R. West ’74 last year.
“During the pandemic, when athletics was at a standstill, they continued to look for an athletics director, while pausing the ethnic studies cluster hire. Is ethnic studies actually a priority?” Arshad asked during her speech. “Or is it the same empty promises we’ve been hearing for the past 50 years?”
In an interview after the rally, Ellen S. Deng ’24, co-president of AAWA alongside Angie D. Shin ’23, called on the University to provide clearer communication about its ethnic studies search.
“We do, unfortunately, find it disappointing that institutional change does take this much time. It does take this much bureaucracy,” said Deng, a Crimson blog chair. “Our demands are just that the administration be more transparent.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, whose office is in University Hall, stepped outside to listen to Arshad and Wang’s speeches.
University spokespeople Jonathan L. Swain and Rachael Dane declined to comment on the speakers’ criticisms.
Deng said joining together to demand ethnic studies has strengthened the partnerships between affinity groups on campus.
“I feel like we've seen the development of an even stronger Panasian coalition in the past couple of years and I think that we're hopeful to see that grow,” Deng said.
In her speech, Phoebe H. Suh ’22 said the importance of ethnic studies is a “matter of life and death” for Asian Americans, pointing to a spate of violent hate crimes against Asian Americans since the beginning of the pandemic.
“We’re working toward a future where we don’t have to fear,” Suh said. “Teach our history. That’s what we want. It’s not hard.”

In the midst of a hectic schedule — flying between Boston, Rwanda, and Haiti, teaching at the University, and meeting dignitaries — renowned Harvard physician Paul Farmer always made time for the people in his life, his colleagues and students say.
When Darja Djordjevic ’08 reached out to Farmer to discuss working in Rwanda, his team told her to head to MIT where he was giving a talk.
“I got to sit with Paul nearby and listen while he did one of his canonical, traditional Paul Q and A’s, which he was famous for, which would last a few hours,” Djordjevic said. “Paul had this indefatigable passion for teaching and engaging with students.”
After the lecture wrapped up, Farmer invited Djordjevic, a freshman student at the Harvard Medical School, to his 50th birthday party. There, he introduced her to major supporters of his global nonprofit Partners in Health.
“Paul welcomed us and included us even when we were students and ... novices in these areas,” she said.
Farmer, who dedicated his life to providing care to the poorest areas of the world, died Feb. 21 at the age of 62 from an acute cardiac event in his sleep, according to PIH.
Though he can no longer carry out his work, HMS professor Anne E. Becker, who taught alongside Farmer, said his dedication to teaching inspired future generations to integrate social justice into their work.
“When we’ve all been thinking, ‘How will there ever be another Paul Farmer?’ he has sown the seeds of the future,” Becker said. “It won’t be Paul Farmer, but it’ll be another cadre of brilliant scholars.”
Born in West Adams, Mass., Farmer attended Duke University, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1982.
Afterward, he traveled to Cange, Haiti, to work in public health clinics. There, he developed a lifelong interest in helping the world’s poor.
In 1987, he co-founded Partners in Health, a global nonprofit that builds public health infrastructure in impoverished regions.
After receiving medical and doctoral degrees from Harvard, he joined the University’s faculty and served as chair of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at HMS. He also served as chief of the Division of Global Health Equity at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
In 2011, PIH opened Butaro Hospital in Rwanda and, four years later, established the University of Global Health Equity — a private institution for teaching, research, and care.
According to Farmer’s colleague Adia Benton, his unique insight into health care stemmed from his ability to recognize structural inequities.
“He was curious about the day-to-day existence of people, and he was keen, so astute about drawing connections between the every day and what some people call global forces,” Benton said.
Benton said that Farmer’s book, “Women, Poverty, and AIDS,” exemplified how he examined structural class and gender inequities to explain global health crises.
“He always came from a perspective that was attentive to class, that was attentive to social hierarchy in ways that was racialized and gendered,” she said.
Those who knew Farmer closely said he, most of all, was “deeply, deeply human,” according to April F. Opoliner.
Opoliner, a former teaching fellow for Farmer’s popular course now known as General Education 1093: “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Cares? Reimagining Global Health” pointed to Farmer’s humility despite his accomplishments.
“I think of him as a human who cared deeply about other people, and we can all be humans who care deeply about other people,” she said.
According to HMS lecturer Jason B. Silverstein, a member of the Gen Ed 1093 teaching staff, Farmer would ask his teaching fellows for a list of the names and school photos of the students in his course every semester. By the time the course started, Farmer had memorized every one.
“If you were a student in the class, I guarantee he knew exactly who you were, and he cared very deeply about it,” Silverstein said.
Scott S. Lee ’03, who worked with Farmer for his undergraduate thesis and graduate dissertation, said Farmer believed everyone deserves to be treated with love.
“He showered everyone with this deep love, and that is what I think was the most incredible about him,” Lee said.
According to Opoliner, remembering his human side empowers others to carry out his vision.
“My concern is that when we make him bigger than life, when we hold him up as something so remarkable, we can almost undermine his message, and that we then turn and sit there and say, ‘Well, we can never be Paul Farmer,’” she said.
When Lindsey M. “Marty” Zeve took over as a lecturer for Gen Ed 1093 in fall 2020, she offered to draft a note for Farmer for prospective students. Her draft of the note was mostly in first person: “I’m Paul Farmer, and I’m so happy to welcome you all.”
The note, when Farmer returned it to Zeve, was completely different. Farmer had eliminated every first-person pronoun to include the entire teaching staff in the note.
“For me, it’s not about the ‘I,’” he wrote in a note to Zeve. “It’s about the ‘we.’”
Lee said that instead of highlighting his own achievements, Farmer would celebrate the broader work of his colleagues and students.
“He would say he doesn’t deserve it — this kind of attention,” he said. “He would put the focus and attention on his patients, the people in Haiti and Rwanda and Sierra Leone and Lesotho and Peru and Russia.”
Lee added that Farmer’s main message was that “justice is simply love structured into society.”
“This idea that everyone is a human being, everyone deserves to be treated as such is a message that the world really needs right now,” he said.
Correction: March 2, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated HMS lecturer Jason B. Silverstein is a former member of the Gen Ed 1093 teaching staff. In fact, Silverstein is a current member of the course staff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For its season-opening series, the Harvard baseball team was spoiled with sun and warm weather as it took on No. 24 University of Miami on the road.
“It was good. Long overdue, you know, I think the guys obviously trained pretty hard,” proclaimed head coach Bill Decker on the team retaking the field for its first game in 720 days. “It was just good, good to be able to fuel them together again, good to be in the same dugout again, you know, good to be in sunshine.”
“It's been so long. It's just like, you go to play the summer league ball and you're playing with a bunch of guys you don't know and it's meaningless games,” added junior catcher Zach Brown, emphasizing the importance of team chemistry. “Having been out there with like all the guys who — we've all gotten really close — you know, this year and last year, all the new guys just meant a lot to go and win the first game and be back out there.”
The storm the team faced got worse with time, though, as Harvard dominated the first game Friday 11-6 before dropping the other two to the Hurricanes, losing 1-2, and 0-10, respectively.
HARVARD 0, UNIV. OF MIAMI 10
In the series finale on Sunday afternoon, the Crimson fell behind early to Miami and could never make up the deficit, losing 10-0. Harvard started senior right-handed pitcher Jaren Zinn. Zinn gave up four runs in the bottom of the first, three coming from a home-run by Miami’s Jacob Burke, as well as four in the bottom of the second, after a combination of a player being hit by a pitch, a wild pitch, infield error, and a couple of singles. Zinn was pulled from the game before recording an out in the second, and was charged with seven earned runs.
After junior utility man and righty Pryor Thomas relieved Zinn, he posted a scoreless outing. The combination of relief following Thomas of sophomore RHP Porter Jordheim, senior RHP Jack Mahala, and junior RHP Will Jacobsen only gave up three hits and two runs in the remaining six frames. The runs were two solo homers by CJ Kayfus off Porter in the third, and Carlos Perez off Jacobsen in the 6th.
The offensive could not get anything going, though, as Harvard only recorded three hits in the entire game. They were dispersed among their nine half-innings, and at no point in the game did the Crimson have more than two baserunners.
HARVARD 1, UNIV. OF MIAMI 2
Coming off its unexpected win Friday, the Crimson attempted to continue its momentum Saturday before ultimately falling short. Junior left-handed pitcher Tim Williamson got the start, tossing three frames. He earned only one run, giving it up in the bottom of the first, as Miami’s Mike Rosario hit a sacrifice grounder to first, sending Kayfus home after his leadoff triple.
Sophomore infielder Chris Snopek evened the score for Harvard in the top of the fourth, launching his first collegiate home run off the Hurricanes’ Carson Palmquist.
First-year RHP Sean Matson came in to relieve Williamson in the latter half of the fourth. In his collegiate debut, Matson pitched four full innings, struck out six, walked two, allowed two hits and was charged with one earned run. The run was a result of a Yohandu Morales leadoff triple in the fifth, followed by a Maxwell Romero RBI double. This would ultimately become the edging run as both sides pitched clean boxes for the remainder of the game.
HARVARD 11, UNIV. OF MIAMI 6
The Crimson returned to its first collegiate competition since 2020 in great force. Entering the series as underdogs to No. 24 Miami, who were on a five-game winning streak, Harvard brought Florida a storm of its own in the series’ first game.
Only four of the Crimson’s starters had previous NCAA experience: junior catcher Zach Brown, junior third baseman Will Jacobsen, junior first baseman Logan Bravo, and junior center fielder Hunter Baldwin. The remaining six starters, as well as the other three pitchers to enter the game, all made their collegiate debuts.
Junior right-handed pitcher Adam Stone started for Harvard, going four innings in 74 pitches and giving up two earned runs. Stone is a highly ranked MLB-prospect, his name gaining traction in talks of the upcoming MLB draft. Although he gave up two runs in the bottom of the first, Stone’s teammates quickly retaliated, scoring three in the top of the third and two in the fourth.
First-year RHP Tanner Smith came in to replace Stone in the bottom of the fifth, in which the Hurricanes evened the score. They then went up by one after Edgardo Villegas scored in the sixth off of a wild pitch by Smith. However, the Crimson demonstrated resilience. It took the lead again in the top of the seventh with a two-run homer by Brown, and added four more in the top of the eighth, after a series of walks, wild pitches and a balk.
“At that point, you know, we had just gone down one run. And I was down in that count and ended up coming through and I think that was just like a big breakthrough moment for us. That kind of turned the game around,” Brown said of his moonshot.
The highlight of the game would come on the very last play. Baldwin made a diving catch in centerfield with Miami’s Romero in scoring position for the third out of the bottom of the ninth. The play would lead the junior to be featured in the weekend edition of SportsCenter, as the number nine spot in the Top Ten Plays segment.
“Obviously, you know, they put up a two-spot in the first inning, we responded, and I think that's the thing I liked about this club. They responded. You know, we had a tough fifth inning, but they responded again, you know, within the seventh and eighth, and it kind of extended it a little bit,” commented Decker on his team’s resilience. “So it was a great win Friday night, you know, it's just — it's awesome.”
The Crimson finds itself on the road again in Houston, Texas, this upcoming weekend for a four-game series against Rice University. The Harvard squad will play under the Friday lights at 7:30 p.m., returning Saturday for two seven-inning double header games, at 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. The Sunday finale matinee is at 1 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University's men's swimming and diving team traveled to Princeton’s DeNunzio Pool last week in hopes of winning the program's fifth straight Ivy League title. After four days of electric racing, the Crimson emerged victorious in a closely contested championship.
No. 18 Harvard tallied 1,596 points, edging out fellow Ivy heavyweight Princeton (1,492) by 104 points. Both schools beat out third-place Penn (1,066) by a significant margin.
Harvard has not lost the Ivy league championship since 2016, continuing a run of success for head coach Kevin Tyrell, who captured his sixth title and the 28th Ivy title in program history.
Harvard did not hesitate to put its mark on the meet on Day One, taking first place in both the 200-yard medley relay and the 800-yard freestyle to sweep the two opening events of the championship in convincing fashion and put itself atop the points tally going into Day Two.
The quartet of senior Dean Farris, junior Jared Simpson, junior Umitcan Gures, and senior Raphael Marcoux set school, meet, and pool records with an NCAA A cut time of 1:24.06 in the 200 medley relay. In the 800 free relay, first-year Ben Littlejohn, sophomore Marcus Holmquist, senior Mahlon Reihman, and Farris registered another pool record with an NCAA A cut time of 6:16.19.
Day Two saw Harvard’s freestyle contingent continue its dominance, with Reihman claiming the 50-yard freestyle from lane one with an NCAA B cut time of 19.42, followed by Farris in second and two other Harvard athletes placing in the top five.
“If you've got a lane, you've got a shot”, said Reihman after his surprising victory. Not among the favorites entering the race, even he was in disbelief after seeing his name on top of the board: “[it took] me a little double take to realize, and it was just true ecstasy.”
The Crimson carried this momentum from the individual event to win the 200 free relay, with Reihman, Marcoux, Holmquist and Gures closing the night with a meet record time of 1:17.14.
Senior Jake Johnson also set a new school record in the 200 IM (1:43.82) for his second program record of the meet, but the performance was not good enough to match Princeton superstar Raunak Khosla.
Day Three was Harvard's most successful of the meet, with the Crimson tallying four individual event titles and a victory in the 400 Medley relay.
Gures won the 100-yard butterfly for the third straight season behind an NCAA A cut time of 44.89, setting school, meet, and pool records in the process. Harvard took three of the top five spots, and extended its win streak in the event to four years in a row.
Senior Dean Farris won the 200-yard freestyle, also for the third time and for the program's fourth time in a row with an NCAA B cut time of 1:32.67.
Sophomore Will Grant was next on top of the podium, capturing the 100-yard backstroke with an NCAA B cut time of 46.58.
The 1000-yard freestyle gave spectators a glimpse at the program's future, with first-years Shane Washart and Arik Katz taking first and third respectively. Washart won the event with a time of 8:52.09.
“I really just wanted to go out, easy speed, nice and controlled, and then really start to turn it on in that second half,” Washart explained after the win. “I was really happy with the way I swam it, especially after last night taking third place. To be in my home state, and being a freshman, it doesn't really get better than this.”
Closing the night with the 400-yard medley relay, Harvard won the event with an NCAA B cut time of 3:05.72, establishing new school, meet, and pool records in the process. The group of Farris, Gures, Holmquist and junior Jared Simpson helped the Crimson win the event for the 20th time, and the third time in the last four seasons.
The fourth and final day saw three Harvard athletes win their second individual titles and the team capture a victory in the 400 free relay.
Washart won the 1650-yard freestyle with an NCAA B cut time of 14:47.51, capping off an outstanding Ivy league championship for the first-year.
Grant captured the 200-yard backstroke, to add to his 100-yard backstroke gold with an NCAA B cut time of 1:41.43.
“200 back is my favorite event,” Grant said after the race. “I really enjoyed getting to score points for the team. It’s a pretty tight meet and the guys who had just swam the mile before me had really fired me up.”
Dean Farris finished a stellar four-year run in the Ivy League Championships with a win in the 100-yard freestyle in an NCAA B cut time of 41.97. Farris — who also contributed to four of the Crimson's relay wins — earned the meet's Career High Point Swimmer award.
Farris reflected on his final Ivy League Championships with Harvard: “It was pretty close with Princeton all the way — we haven't really had that in my three other years here. … I’m proud of our guys for pulling it out. In my freshman year we kind of built a powerhouse, and we’ve continued it from there. We have some great recruits coming in, so I’m really pumped to come back and sit in the stands to watch these guys.”
Harvard finished the championships similar to how it started, closing the meet with an emphatic win in the 400-yard freestyle relay. The quartet of Reihman, Holmquist, Farris and junior Ryan Linnihan won the race with an NCAA A cut time of 2:50.40, setting meet and pool records in the process.
“[We’re] just living in the moment. … It was just ridiculously exciting, and I’m just happy to be here with these guys,” exclaimed Linnihan after the win, which was the cherry on top in an outstanding Ivy League Championship.
Over the course of the four days, the Crimson won 13 events, sweeping all five relays. Harvard tallied four NCAA A cut times, five school records, five meet records, and five pool records. A total of 17 different Harvard student-athletes posted NCAA B cut times over 40 events in addition to two NCAA B cut relay times.
Coach Kevin Tyrell was grateful after a sixth Ivy League title.
“The greatest thing this year was just to have a championship, to have all eight schools. … The league’s a great place to be, and we want to keep it going,” he said.
Tyrell highlighted the role of co-head coach Samantha Pitter and diving coach Matt O’Neill in the team's success. “[Pitter] is an amazing coach, an amazing person, and we’re very happy to have [O’Neill] with us on the diving front, who’s only making great strides with the diving program,” he added. “It comes together with the coaching staff.”
Despite the victory, Tyrell and the Crimson are already looking to build on their conference title in the upcoming national collegiate championship meets in Atlanta, Ga. The NCAA Zone Diving Championships will take place between March 7 and March 9, followed by the NCAA Championships (March 23-26).
“The next challenge we have is NCAAs,” Tyrell said. “We're really looking forward to that, and hopefully, we can bring some credit to the league.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 727 days away from spring competition, Harvard Softball (3-2) has returned in full force, competing in five games over three days from Feb. 25 to Feb. 27 at the Hatter Classic in DeLand, Florida. Currently ranked third in the Ivy Preseason Poll behind rivals Columbia and Penn, the Crimson haven’t played a spring game since their March 1st, 2020 win over North Carolina Central.
The weekend offered an opportunity for Harvard to not only flex the might of its tried and true veteran players, but also showcase the team’s new talent. Nine current roster members helped raise the Ivy League Championship Trophy in 2019, and senior infielder tri-captain Morgan Melito and senior outfielder tri-captain Alyssa Saldana remain from the 2018 back-to-back Ivy Championship Team.
“We really do appreciate every moment that we can get out there,” Melito said. “It’s wonderful to be back.”
Double headers on both Friday and Saturday set up the Hatter Classic to be action packed. Friday offered a pair of Harvard wins, over both the University of Rhode Island (3-7) and Stetson University (9-4). In the opening game of the tournament, the Crimson made a furious comeback with six runs in the top of the seventh to take the win over Rhode Island, 11-5.
After closing out the final inning of the Rhode Island game, first-year pitcher Katie Arrambide extended her success in the second game of the tournament, giving up just two hits in a five-inning, 9-1 win over Stetson.
“We have an older, upperclassman-dominant, experienced defense,” said Arrambide, crediting her success to the depth of the current roster. “It was great to feel supported by my team on my first outing.”
The tournament continued on Saturday, where the Crimson fell to both Marist College (5-5) and Stetson. In a 10-1 five-inning loss to Marist, Harvard struggled to recover from the Red Foxes’ early lead, who sealed the deal by plating six runs in the fourth. Junior center fielder/utility Megan Welsh scored the sole run for the Crimson in the fourth, after an RBI double by Melito.
The evening matchup against Stetson proved to be a grueling back-and-forth for the two teams, with the Hatters pulling ahead from a tie game in the third after an early Crimson lead. Even though home runs from senior center fielder/utility Teagan Shaw and Melito reclaimed the advantage in the top of the fifth inning, Harvard was unable to hold off Stetson’s three-run pinch hit walk-off home run in the seventh by Evette Morgan.
“It was a very hard fought battle on both sides,” Melito said. “Hats off to them. They played a great game, we played a great game. It came down to just a couple of hits, and sometimes that’s just how the cookie crumbles.”
“We put up a really good fight against them in the first game, and that would prompt them to want to come for us more in the second game, which they did,” Arrambide agreed.
In a triumphant end to the week's competition, the Crimson redeemed itself against Marist with a 4-1 win. Sophomore infielder Kendall Jean showed strong offensive play with three RBI and a run. Junior pitcher Lindsay G. Poulos returned to the mound after coming back from injury, posing a promising return for one of Harvard’s key players.
“One of our biggest things was getting everyone an opportunity to perform, and we had a lot of players come in and execute their jobs, whether that be at bat, come in to pitch, or to run,”  Melito said.
As the Crimson looks forward to the rest of its season, it continues to reap the benefits of a talented coaching staff. This is Head Coach Jenny Allard’s 27th season with the Crimson. She was recently announced as being inducted into the National Fastpitch Coaches Association (NFCA) Hall of Fame.
“It’s absolutely no surprise,” Melito said. “She's been in the program since the early days, since the beginning.”
Melito’s action-packed weekend earned her an accolade of her own, being recognized as the Ivy League’s Player of the Week, her first and the program’s first since 2018. Over the course of the weekend, she had eight hits, two home runs, and eight RBI for a total of 15 total bases, and was instrumental in Harvard’s pair of victories.
As the Crimson looks to continue its season this weekend, Arrambide affirmed the team’s commitment to focus on building cohesiveness, doing their jobs, and being ready to compete at all times.
“Keep the energy high, both in the beginning of the game, at the end of the game, beginning of the weekend or end of the weekend and continue to be relentless offensive,” she commented.
Harvard will be back on the road this weekend, traveling to Birmingham, Ala. for the Green and Gold Classic, where the team will compete against both Longwood University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
