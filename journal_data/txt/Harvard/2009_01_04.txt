After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The impending inauguration of President-Elect Obama provides an opportunity to consider the future of his new administration as well as reflect upon the record of the outgoing administration. I submit that future generations of Americans will appreciate the accomplishments President George W. Bush achieved in the face of the extraordinary challenges that have confronted America during his tenure. Historians will remember him much more fondly than the fickle winds of public opinion see him today.It’s important to keep in mind that President Bush was confronted with tremendous difficulties when he ascended to office on Jan. 20, 2001. The country witnessed a struggle for the presidency that lasted over a month past Election Day and President Bush faced the challenge of uniting a divided country. He also had to grapple with an inherited recession immediately upon assuming office. The Dow Jones reached its high in January 2000, one year before President Bush took the oath of office.  However, these challenges paled in comparison to the extraordinary tragedy that befell the nation eight months later.The president’s most important accomplishment has been keeping America safe since 2001. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 85 percent of Americans believed it was likely that we would be attacked again.  The lack of attacks has not been for want of trying: since September 11 the U.S. Government has foiled plans to blow up ten planes flying from the UK to the United States simultaneously,  the terrorist plot to explode JFK airport in New York,  the Al Qaeda plan to fly an airplane into the tallest building in L.A.,  and other planned attacks, domestically and internationally. Considering the many foiled plots that have not been made public, the safety and security of the Unites States since September 11 has been truly remarkable. The Bush administration worked to ensure America’s safety by reforming our homeland security and intelligence infrastructure to face the new threats of terrorism. New intelligence and security departments and offices were created, emergency management plans improved across all levels of government, legal reforms implemented, and borders made more secure. In addition to overseeing a rapid recovery from the 2001 recession due to tax cuts and shrewd economic policy,  the administration has made consequential efforts to shore up America’s economy in this latest financial crisis. As the largest buyers of sub prime mortgages from 2004 to 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped fuel the housing bubble and exacerbate the burst.  The Bush Administration tried no fewer than 18 times, publicly and on the record, to push Congress to agree to reform these Government Sponsored Entities.  And while Defense and Homeland Security spending has increased to face the perils of a post-9/11 world, the growth in non-security discretionary spending has been lowered to 1 percent,  lower than inflation, and well below the 15 percent growth in President Clinton’s last budget.  America’s trade has increased by 60 percent under President Bush, following a more than quadrupling of the number of free trade agreements in place since Bush took office.  The president has done an admirable job under trying worldwide economic circumstances, and as a result America’s 2008 Gross Domestic Product growth was higher than that of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, or Japan, as well as the average for advanced economies, according to International Monetary Fund projections. President Bush has also made an unprecedented effort to reach beyond our borders and save lives overseas. His efforts to fight AIDS in Africa have been extraordinary. In Vice President-elect Joe Biden’s own words, “The president’s Emergency Action Program for HIV/AIDS has saved more than a million lives. It may be the greatest legacy this president leaves.” The incredible progress that has been achieved in Iraq and Afghanistan is evident in the lives that their citizens now live as peace and freedom take root. While there was a worldwide intelligence failure and there were postwar planning and strategic mistakes under Secretary Rumsfeld in Iraq,  the strategy was adjusted and we may soon see a fountain of democracy in an otherwise turbulent Middle East. In addition to the politically historic progress of the democratically adopted Status Of Forces Agreement between the U.S. and Iraq,  Iraqis’ quality of life has improved. According to the Brookings Institute, telephone subscribers in Iraq have increased by 17 fold and internet subscribers have increased by 183 fold from prewar levels, and there were more than 400 independent media sources as of two years ago while none existed before the war.  While it’s easy to focus on the headline making, day-to-day difficulties of war, historians will have a broader perspective, recognizing that more than 50 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan were liberated by President Bush’s courageous policies. Ultimately, President Bush strived to serve all Americans, whether working with Democrats on No Child Left Behind or the Medicare prescription drug benefit, or in appointing the most diverse group of top advisors in history.  When the dust settles and historians begin to analyze the Bush Presidency, they will recognize his successes. For generations to come Americans will benefit from our footing in the war on terror, citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan will enjoy lives of freedom, and millions of Africans will live without disease because of President Bush. Indeed, President Bush has had a steady hand in turbulent times, possessing the courage and fortitude to make difficult and unpopular decisions. He sought the best for America, not the praise of the liberal media, and that will vindicate his presidency.Caleb L.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several weeks ago, Mexican police in Ciudad Juarez had some unexpected visitors—or at least parts of them. In a cooler left by a station near Ascension, the police discovered the heads of four men between the ages of 25 and 35. Officers reported some difficulty in identifying the severed heads, as they could belong to any of nearly a dozen local victims who were kidnapped by gunmen the previous week.  
Ciudad Juarez, reportedly the most dangerous city in the Mexico,  is at the forefront of a nation-wide spike in crime rates. Although the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Mexico’s previous ruling political party, had turned a blind eye to traffickers for years, the National Revolutionary Party (PAN) adopted a strict approach against drug trafficking and related crime shortly after it came to power in 2000.  In reaction to new policies, particularly President Felipe Calderon’s two-year-old crackdown on drug trafficking violence,  noncombatant deaths—numbered at 3,000 since January 2008—have risen significantly. 
One unusual consequence of the ensuing chaos has manifested itself in the Mexican world of fashion. Colombian designer Miguel Caballero has opened a new shop in Mexico City that is drawing worldwide attention for its merchandise: luxury bulletproof clothing. With prices ranging from a few hundred dollars to $7,000, Caballero’s leather jackets, polo shirts, coats, shorts and ruffled tuxedo shirts are becoming increasingly popular with political leaders and celebrities from around the world.  
Caballero’s posh protective apparel, sold in the more affluent part of Mexico City, can withstand ammunition from weapons including a nine-millimeter pistol, a submachine gun, a .44 Magnum, a 3.57 revolver and even knives, allowing customers to escape gunshots and stabs with little more than a bruise.  According to Caballero’s web site, titled “High Security Fashion,” his multiple lines of fitted jackets and elegant collared shirts provide the opportunity to “minimize…risk and preserve…life.”  In fact, Caballero, who has come to be known as the “Armani of armor,”  routinely demonstrates the life-saving capabilities of his products by allowing potential customers to shoot hired salespeople clothed in the bulletproof apparel. 
Although they have not offered exact figures, Caballero’s spokespeople have reported that increased crime rates have helped business significantly.  Caballero’s success speaks to a disturbing trend among the Mexican elite. Bulletproof clothing is emblematic of a greater divide between Mexican problems and Mexican money; as a BBC report revealed in October, the Mexican wealth gap is the largest in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with “some parts [comparable] to Spanish or German cities, but other parts…more like the poorest parts of Africa.”  
But just because the Mexican elite can afford to forget about the social issues of their communities doesn’t mean that they should. That wealthier individuals can pay for the resources necessary to survive social turmoil is a given in any society, but what distinguishes Caballero’s customers is that they seem to embrace their greater access to security in a particularly conspicuous and inconsiderate manner. No one would insist that all Mexican citizens bear the burden of the heightened crime rates equally or that wealthy and influential Mexicans pour all their excess funds into law enforcement; however, it is fair to expect that all Mexican citizens show some engagement and investment in the problems, even when they are not as directly affected as their fellow citizens. A crime is not merely the making of one criminal nor the tragedy of its victims. It is rather the convergence of societal forces for which all citizens are responsible. The Mexican elite should act accordingly and not behave so frivolously in the face of calamity.

Visiting the sites of recent tragedy, one is always struck by how life goes on. In Mumbai, train passengers wait in crowds at the station, couples walk hand-in-hand on Juhu Beach, rickshaws honk incessantly and refuse to acknowledge lane indicators, customers haggle with street vendors, and the smell of spices and dust fills the air. In a word, all is normal.Reading the Mumbai papers, however, one gets an entirely different impression. The press has filled in the gaps in the city’s understanding of its recent attacks with a narrative of imminent danger and Pakistani aggression. This coverage, tinged with bloodlust, is at fever pitch—and it is incessant.Announcing on the Times Now news channel that Pakistan was refusing to acknowledge captured terrorist Ajmal Amir Kasab, for example, a reporter stated with grave certainty that “in their heart of hearts” Pakistanis knew Kasab belonged to them. And despite government officials’ heated debate over whether to issue an ultimatum to Pakistan, many journalists raised the war whoop when Pakistan responded by redeploying troops to the Indian border.This behavior has not gone uncriticized. In Mumbai’s Daily News and Analysis newspaper, Media Development Foundation chairman Sashi Kumar chastised television journalists, asking: “Did they really have to cry themselves hoarse about the enemy at the gate? They were all sabre-rattling in the direction of Islamabad.” Or as the New York Times put it, more delicately, the Mumbai attacks have “prompted bellicose outbursts from the Indian news media” against their Muslim neighbor.Media hawkishness is nothing new, of course. There are more than passing parallels between Indian news coverage of the Mumbai attacks and American coverage from the rubble of the World Trade Center. In India, the attack is already referred to as 26/11, mirroring America’s 9/11. And the rhetoric as a whole is eerily similar to that used by the American media preceding the invasion of Iraq.The link doesn’t completely hold, though, and that’s because an Indian newspaper has a slightly different notion of what an article should be than an American newspaper does. Reading a piece in The Times of India (the world’s top-selling English language broadsheet, with a circulation of two and a half million) is like listening to a very informed, very opinionated friend chattering into your ear. Reporting is a chummy business—and a biased one. Take, for instance, the lede of a recent Times top story: “Pakistan on Friday was back to its intransigent ways, batting aside India’s demand for action against perpetrators of 26/11 and putting paid to any hope that it might bend under international pressure.”That this sort of writing—which the Washington Post  might run in a controversial op-ed—is regularly published on Indian front pages with nary a raised eyebrow, certainly makes for more interesting media. Even Americans used to Bush’s chats with Bono might be shocked by the spectacular and celebrity-saturated character of Indian journalism. Opinionated, snappily-written news stories are a central part of this culture.But this very chumminess, this congenial and unabashed insertion of a viewpoint, is what makes the Indian media’s warmongering ways so risky. The ideal of true journalistic objectivity, fact firmly squared off from value judgments, may be just that—idealistic. But newspaper readers in India and elsewhere deserve an account of the attacks that hasn’t already settled on Pakistan’s complicit “intransigence.” Anything more opinionated should be left to the editorialists.These considerations aren’t just nitpicking. In the immediate wake of the attacks in Mumbai, the first reaction was grief, accompanied by the pride of a nation that would not be forced to its knees by a few rogue terrorists. The second, from intelligent pundits who remembered the horrors of previous wars, was relief: “At least India’s not seeking revenge on Pakistan.” That relief may have come too soon. Certainly few things can pull together such a huge and diverse nation like tragedy. But surely there are better ways to unite it than to call for blood.Jessica A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Far be it from Harvard students to put aside political mindedness on account of preparing for final exams. Hundreds of students in the College have recently found time to take up a new cause: protesting the placement of final examinations on Jan. 20, the day of President-elect Barack Obama’s inauguration.  
Over 30 exams have been scheduled for Jan. 20, and more than 2,000 Harvard students have exams that day. At last check, the Facebook group, “Petition for Make-Ups of Harvard College Exams on Inauguration Day 2009,” was pushing 300 members.  The group’s accompanying petition had garnered nearly 600 student-signatures. “Harvard should let us participate in this historical moment to the fullest extent,” Kyle de Beausset '08-'09, a Crimson editorial writer and frequent student-activist who is leading these efforts, wrote alongside his online signature on the petition.  One Facebook group member likened the protestors’ struggle to a fortune cookie she’d found on the ground outside the Harvard Science Center, which read, “[W]hen spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion.” An inspiring rallying call for these poor, disenfranchised Harvard students. Their main man Barack would be proud.
According to the petition’s central text, “Inauguration Day is a federal holiday (for DC-area employees) and, more importantly, a deeply meaningful time for Americans all over, young and old, Republican and Democrat. This year is an especially historic moment in which we deserve the right to fully participate, and we are asking for institutional support from Harvard College and the Registrar’s Office to do so.”
Excusing the gag of supposed bipartisanship, what makes this inauguration so “historic” for petition-signers has nothing to do with what one might guess. It has nothing to do with Barack Obama being the first black man elected President of the United States. His blackness is inspiring, but his meteoric rise to power has been an experience fairly different from that of a typical African-American leader. As an icon of African-American progress, Obama’s story is anomalous—he had a white mother and was raised by his white grandparents; he is not descended from slaves, but rather from a Harvard-educated Kenyan.
No, Obama’s election is exciting to Harvard students not because of his blackness—it’s exciting because he’s their guy. An unprecedented number of Harvard students worked on Obama’s campaign, and more meaningful still, he is cut of the same cloth as they are. On the campaign trail, he was the candidate who got grief for arugula-eating. He’s the husband in a lawyers-in-love marriage, his family is considering adopting a rescue-dog, and he plays recreational basketball with his white-collar friends. Obama champions Harvard students’ conception of what the world should be like—in Obama, the Harvard types have finally found a president who shares their notions of how best to proceed in this age of global terrorism and economic instability. Roundtables with mass-murdering dictators? Wonderful. Wealth redistribution across the board? Excellent. Never mind that these aspiring Harvard politicos have never taken part in major lawmaking. Neither has their pal Barack.
The old quip goes that if you’re a conservative at 20 you have no heart, but if you’re a liberal at 40 you have no brain. This may be reductive, but there’s some truth in it yet. The sort of impulses that drive Barack Obama in policy-making are the same as those that drive young people to form such strongly left-leaning political positions. The impulse comes from a lack of experience and from a lack of faith in the experience of predecessors. The view presumes that virtually all of the political leaders that have come before now have either failed to realize something obvious or, worse, are too misguided or self-serving to seek solutions that prioritize anyone other than themselves. It is precisely because of this view that so many Harvard students and their contemporaries are hoping to attend Barack Obama’s inauguration: We’ve miraculously chosen one of our own.
Far more tragic than these cries of passionate jubilation sounded from within Harvard Yard are their echoes beyond the College gates. Many pundits have dubbed Obama a modern Lincoln or even the next FDR. As Eleanor Clift, a long-time journalist and pundit who is nearly 70 years old, gushed on the McLaughlin Group last week, “Yes, Barack Obama is obvious [as the Biggest Winner of 2008]. But I would like to broaden it a bit, because I think it’s the restoration of democracy in this country. The people have truly spoken, and spoken loud. And I think his election really helps restore America’s standing in the world. It’s a lot to expect from one human being. But he always said it wasn’t about him; it was about us. And so that’s my story, and I’m believing it.” 
Have the believers prepared themselves for the disappointment they will experience when the honeymoon winds down? The President-elect has already evidenced some surprising departures from his previously audacious and hopeful self. Immediately after being elected, Obama began giving speeches in which he emphasized that the struggles ahead might be harder than expected. And though transparency is supposedly trademark Obama, some journalists have noted that Obama has begun to take on habits of his predecessor Bush, who is notoriously tightlipped.  In the wake of the recent Blagojevich scandal, Obama has snapped or clammed up when asked for details about his team’s involvement in the investigation. He’s begun adding old-timers to his cabinet and deploying Clinton White House staffers. Could it be that even the beloved Obama, Crown Prince of Change You Can Believe In, is giving up the good fight? Harvard students may need a day off to grieve that historic moment, too.

Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan, who is rumored to be president-elect Barack Obama’s choice for solicitor general, won praise over the weekend from one of Ronald Reagan’s solicitors general, who said in an interview that she is a “fresh face” that “some of the justices might appreciate.”The endorsement came from professor Charles Fried, the Law School’s best known conservative and an academic who served as solicitor general from 1985 to 1989 and as a judge from 1995 to 1999.As solicitor general, the United States’ chief legal advocate, Kagan would represent the U.S. government before the Supreme Court and other federal courts. The United States is party to about two-thirds of cases brought before the high court.Kagan served on the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School with Obama in the early and mid-1990s.Though Kagan has never argued a case before the Supreme Court, Fried said that her lack of experience before the court is secondary to her time at the Law School.“Several hundred Harvard Law students are about as tough an audience as you can get,” Fried said.During her time at the Law School, Kagan has taught constitutional and administrative law. She became dean after just two years as a full professor, succeeding Robert C. Clark as dean in 2003.Kagan has received praise for record fundraising, winning approval for significant changes to the first-year curriculum, and poaching distinguished law professors like Chicago’s Cass R. Sunstein ‘75 and Stanford’s Lawrence Lessig.“I’m happy for her but sorry for us,” Fried said. “She’s a very hard person to replace.”Kagan clerked for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and U.S. Appeals Court Judge Abner Mikva before serving as a domestic policy adviser under President Clinton.During their time at the Law School, which did not overlap, both Kagan and Obama served as research assistants to constitutional law professor Laurence H. Tribe ‘62, who in recent years has generously praised Kagan and emerged as a close adviser to Obama.Kagan did not respond to requests for comment, and officials from Obama’s transition office declined to comment.—Staff writer Elias J.

Various labor and healthcare groups have rallied to the Cambridge Health Alliance’s side in recent weeks, forming a coalition called “Put Patients First” to urge Mass. Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78 to steer clear of further cuts to Medicaid. At the same time, city councillors and residents have demanded greater budgetary accountability from the CHA and expressed concerns regarding health service cuts that the alliance had made. At a December council meeting, Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons proposed an order that would have withheld the CHA’s city funding and stopped health clinic closings for the next six months if the alliance failed to submit a plan to solicit community input. The order, which failed, was also supported by City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who is demanding “line-item accountability” for the CHA’s expenditures.“When we’re cutting services, not only do we have a responsibility to know what we’re paying for, but we also should have some voice in choosing what we pay for in cutting services,” Decker said. “I do support the idea that the city pays the hospital $5 million dollars, but right now its unclear what we get in return for that.” Decker said she certainly is “not looking to harm services,” and pointed out that her entire family receives health care at the CHA even though she has the financial means to go elsewhere. Decker criticized councilors for being “more anxious about making hospital administrators nervous about losing dollars than about the services that we do know today we’re losing.” She questioned the CHA’s closure of the Oliver Farnum Senior Health Center in December—which she said forces the elderly and handicapped to travel further for health services—and its reduction of midwifery services, which she said “saves hospitals far more money than OBGYNs,” who are licensed physicians and charge more for deliveries.Decker also demanded precise accountability by the CHA for its operation of the Cambridge Public Health Department, which she said has engaged in vague “homeland security work” that may stretch outside of Cambridge.“I might choose, as a representative of Cambridge taxpayers, to keep the [Farnum] Senior Center, even if it’s not at full capacity, than rather to be doing homeland security work in Everett,” Decker said. “The information and facts the city council is provided with is unclear.” CHA spokesman Doug M. Bailey acknowledged Decker’s concerns, saying “everyone’s frustrated and I understand the frustration, but we’ve been engaging in intense discussions and negotiations with [various governmental offices], and we expect to have more avenues for community input on the situation before it reaches a resolution.” He added that the closing of the Oliver Farnum Center was an issue of “utilization” and not driven by the governor’s emergency budget cuts in October.“If you look at who was using [the center], it mostly wasn’t seniors. It was our least profitable center, and there’s another similar one less than 2,000 feet away,” Bailey said. “You really have to study utilization and need and make decisions based on that.”As for Simmons and Decker’s suggestion of withholding funds, Bailey said that “the solution to diminishing funding is not to diminish funding more,” and said that at this point “closing hospitals is not on the table.” He noted that even without considerations of further state budget cuts, the CHA is due to lose $95 million this year and more in 2011 because of the 2006 Massachusetts health care reform bill. While Bailey did not say why the mental health services were among the first to be cut by the CHA, he pointed to inadequate state reimbursement for safety-net hospitals. “Mental health and addiction treatment is 48 or 49 percent of our [healthcare] makeup, and that is not reimbursed at a rate that is feasible,” Bailey said. “I understand the thinking that hospitals are likely to cut mental health first because it’s least profitable.”Brian Rosman, research director for Health Care For All, a health policy group, said that health-care reform did address reimbursement concerns, appropriating $90 million a year for three years to increase state payments to hospitals. But he said that “implementation by the Romney and Patrick administration appears to have really shortchanged some of the key services, particularly mental health.” State Representative Alice K. Wolf agreed with Rosman’s reimbursement concerns, saying that state officials should be aware of the problem.“[Health] Secretary [Judy Ann] Bigby knows this because I had a meeting with her last May, and she said, what we really need to do is raise the reimbursement rate,” Wolf said. “They have subsequently cut them twice.”­—Staff Writer Peter F.

As the effects of the nation’s financial crisis hit Harvard’s schools and divisions, it has prompted a retrenchment by the two schools whose budgets are most dependent on revenues from the endowment. The Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study and the Harvard Divinity School recently confirmed to The Crimson that they are scaling back their growth plans and making selected expense reductions.Harvard’s annual report for fiscal year 2008, which ended on June 30, disclosed that Radcliffe and the Divinity School relied on endowment income for 83 percent and 71 percent of their operating budgets, respectively. The University-wide average for endowment dependence was 34 percent for fiscal year 2008.Harvard’s endowment—valued at $36.9 billion at of June 30—tumbled 22 percent in the ensuing four months, University officials announced last month. As of June 30, 2007, the Radcliffe Institute had $587 million and the Divinity School had $620 million.“When Harvard’s endowment value suffers significant setbacks, the Divinity School’s chief source of revenue is vulnerable to uncertainty, and we need to plan accordingly,” said Jonathan G. Beasley, a Divinity School spokesman.‘TRIMMING AT THE MARGINS’Helen T. Ouellette, Radcliffe’s administrative dean, said the institute is undergoing a budgeting process aimed at “trimming at the margins.”The institute is currently reducing its expenditures by one to two percent from an expected spending level of $24 million, and plans to reduce by an additional four percent in fiscal year 2010, Radcliffe Dean Barbara J. Grosz reported. Radcliffe spent $19.7 million in fiscal year 2008, ending the year with a surplus in unrestricted funds, according to its last annual report.Grosz said Radcliffe was on a growth curve when the initial spending level for fiscal year 2009 was set.“Even as recently as last summer the economic situation looked very different, the Corporation was encouraging us and all of Harvard to grow,” said Grosz, referring to the University’s governing board.Ouellette said the institute is looking to “fairly painlessly slow down this growth.”According to Ouellette and Grosz, this process will include capping the number of scholars accepted to Radcliffe’s fellowship program—closer to 48 fellows than the current 52—and limiting the number of acquisitions made by the Schlesinger Library, which plans to focus on reducing its cataloging backlog this year.The deans said the University also asked the institute to postpone for at least two years its plans to renovate Fay House, its main administrative building, which included making the building more environmentally sustainable.“While this means we have to put off these improvements, including the investment in energy efficiency, we will be saving operating expense in the short-term, and we think the trade-off is a good one,” Ouellette said.According to Grosz, the institute expects to continue to rely on endowment revenue for about 80 percent of its operating budget.“The second source of funds—annual giving—is likely to decline at the same time as endowment income declines,” Grosz said.Ouellette added that the institute is “very hopeful” that it will not have to make personnel cuts.Grosz also discussed Radcliffe’s new academic engagement program, which was inaugurated in November when the institute appointed six “faculty leaders” from across the University to assist in its cross-disciplinary outreach.“The academic engagement program will adapt the whole range of lectures and meetings we’ve convened into a more programmatic set of endeavors,” Grosz said. “So it’s a case of substitution, not growth.”‘ECONOMIES ON ALL FRONTS’Divinity School Dean William A. Graham said in an e-mail that the school is planning for “significant, but in no way crippling, budget reductions.”“We are trying to realize economies on all fronts, in all parts of the School, but not on a one-size-reduction-fits-all basis,” Graham said.He outlined cutbacks aimed at similar budgetary reductions pursued at Radcliffe—at least one percent during fiscal year 2009, and an additional three to five percent for fiscal year 2010.“We will be postponing some new initiatives, taking a hiatus with some ongoing programs that are not essential to our core academic degree programs, and trying substantially to reduce visiting-professor and some adjunct appointments,” Graham said.Beasley, the Divinity School spokesperson, said he could not share details on which programs would be affected because of the ongoing nature of the financial crisis. But he said that the school is considering “anything from cutting back on food and refreshments at meetings to freezing salaries of faculty and exempt staff for [fiscal year 2010].”Graham said that the Divinity School would continue its ongoing search for seven new faculty members and hopes to make at least five of those hires. He added that the school would also maintain the same levels of financial aid to its students—90 percent of whom receive some form of aid.“We are also striving to avoid any staff layoffs if we possibly can,” Graham said.The Divinity School’s second source of revenue behind the endowment is tuition revenue at 21 percent. Beasley said the applicant pool remains strong, and tuition income is expected to stay steady.—Staff writer Nini S. Moorhead can be reached at moorhead@fas.harvard.edu.

WILLIAMSBURG, Va.—In the first-ever matchup between the two oldest universities in the country, Harvard could not rise to the occasion, dropping a tough road tilt to William and Mary, 67-54, on New Year’s Eve.
The Crimson (6-6) struggled from the start to contain the much taller and bigger Tribe (5-6) squad. The team was outrebounded 49-26, outscored in the paint 30-14, and outplayed by a much larger lineup.
Returning from mononucleosis, which had sidelined him since the Dec. 10 game against Northeastern, freshman Keith Wright fought hard in front of his family and friends, but was obviously struggling the entire time. The Suffolk, Va., native finished with four points on 2-of-8 shooting, leaving the Crimson weak down low.
It was too much for Harvard to overcome.
“We have to guard our paint better,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We got to have our post players play bigger, but it was hard, with Keith Wright coming back having missed a couple of games…but we can play better than we did this afternoon from an interior standpoint.”
One bright spot for the Crimson was the play of junior Dan McGeary, who keyed a late comeback in the second half with his hot shooting. The junior finished with 18 points on 4-of-8 shooting from downtown.
The run started with Harvard trailing William and Mary 42-33 with 12 minutes to play. The Crimson needed a spark, and McGeary was the one to give it to the team. In a span of just over four minutes, McGeary knocked down three trifectas, with the final one coming as he fell to the ground. He lifted himself and then Harvard up, 48-47, following a 15-5 run with 6:46 to play.
“The last couple of games, we’ve played some teams with zone defenses,” McGeary said. “Today, I was helped by a couple of guys—Oliver [McNally] and Max [Kenyi]—driving and kicking it out.”
While Wright failed to get back in sync, fellow freshman Max Kenyi finally seemed to hit his stride. Inconsistent all year, Kenyi had a good outing, pacing the Crimson offensive attack until McGeary caught fire. And with junior standout Jeremy Lin struggling mightily in going 3-of-12 from the field, Kenyi’s play kept Harvard in it.
Without production from Lin, however, the Crimson could not recover.
After regaining the lead with 6:46 to play, Harvard went cold, tallying only six points to close out the game.
“We had some deflating plays that hurt us when they were making their strong runs,” Amaker said.

With that elusive first victory behind it, the Crimson can start looking to turn some close losses in its favor.The Harvard wrestling team (1-5) finished winter break at the Lonestar Duals Saturday in Arlington, Texas, besting Stanford 24-21 before dropping close matches to Cal Poly and No. 7 Minnesota, 16-19 and 20-28, respectively. Despite the narrow defeats, junior co-captain Louis Caputo felt encouraged by the Crimson’s resolve against top teams.“The [duals] went well,” he said. “It felt good to pull off the win against Stanford, and we held our own against Minnesota.”In addition to three grueling team bouts in one day, Harvard faced individual challenges last week, sending four wrestlers to the Midland Championships Dec. 28 and 29 in Evanston, Ill. Even with a daunting schedule, Caputo appreciated so many opportunities to compete.“I felt good,” he said. “It’s been a long week with [Midlands], and we were happy to end on a good note.”With a break for exams, the Crimson will focus on individual improvements throughout January, looking to be ready for the start of the dual meet season later this month.“We’ll be specifying our training,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We’ll look at ‘how does this person get better and what do they need to work on?’”With minor adjustments, the Crimson can anticipate bolstering the win column this spring.LONESTAR DUALSThree Harvard grapplers went undefeated and Caputo (19-3) earned upper-weight Outstanding Wrestler honors, but the Crimson struggled to overcome early deficits. Despite additional 3-0 performances from junior co-captain J.P. O’Connor (16-2) and sophomore Corey Jantzen (11-2), Harvard continually suffers by forfeiting the 125 lbs. weight class.“If you have someone there who could win a match or two, it’s a nine-point swing,” Caputo said. “It’s hard, but [having holes in the lineup] is nothing new for Harvard wrestling, and we just have to fight back.”Senior Tommy Picarsic and junior Andrew Knapp added wins for the Crimson, and rookie Walter Peppelman notched a fall to give Harvard its first victory of the season over a talented Stanford squad. The six-point forfeit deficit proved crucial in three- and eight-point losses to Cal Poly and Minnesota.Freshman Spencer Desena (2-5) bounced back from a difficult Midlands performance to notch a decision against the Mustangs, and Picarsic (2-1) earned his second victory of the day, but winning five of 10 bouts could not stave off defeat for the Crimson.Despite a nine-point deficit to open the final match, Harvard led the Golden Gophers through eight bouts. But the Crimson wasted falls by Jantzen and Caputo and a technical fall from Peppelman (13-6) as Minnesota dominated the top two weights to seal a win.MIDLAND CHAMPIONSHIPSCaputo, Jantzen, Peppelman, and Desena traveled to Northwestern’s Ryan-Welch Arena, taking on the nation’s best grapplers.Caputo enjoyed the best result for Harvard and a personal-best fourth place at Midlands, but the small squad struggled to make an overall impact, settling for 21st in the 47-team field.“[The Championships] could have gone better,” Caputo said. “Overall, we’ve got some strides to make, but going to these tournaments is all about facing the best guys in the country and seeing where we stand.”Caputo and Jantzen entered the tournament ranked fourth and first, respectively, but both faltered late in the draw.The third-seeded Caputo rode a technical fall, a major decision, and a 4-2 victory to earn a semifinal matchup with Iowa’s Phil Keddy, who handed Caputo his first loss this season at the NWCA All-Star Classic on Nov. 25.The Hawkeye junior took his second in a row against Caputo with a 6-3 decision on Monday.The Havard grappler bounced back in time to overtake eighth-seeded Jerome Ward of Iowa State in the wrestleback bracket, but came up short in the third-place bout, falling to fourth-seeded Doug Umbehauer of Rider.Jantzen also struggled for the first time this year, dropping two bouts in Evanston. The top seed earned back-to-back falls in what looked to be another dominant performance, but Jantzen could not sustain his momentum, suffering a quarterfinal defeat to eighth-seeded Zach Tanelli of Wisconsin in a 3-1 decision. Although the loss proved disappointing, Jantzen caused greater concern with a minor ankle injury, forcing the sophomore to medically forfeit his wrestleback match.Peppelman went 2-2, winning consecutive wrestleback bouts after dropping a major decision to second-seeded Jake Patacsil in the opening round. After notching a decision and a technical fall without relinquishing a point, Peppelman finished the tournament with a 4-1 loss to Pittsburgh’s Mark Powell.In the heavyweight division, Desena could not muster an upset over top-seeded David Zabriskie, losing 9-0 before bowing out to Iowa’s Eric Thompson in the wrestlebacks.—Staff writer Max N.

The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team began the new year with a bang, defeating previously-unbeaten Navy 188-112 at Blodgett Pool Saturday.  The Crimson, currently tied for first in the Ivy League with perennial rival Princeton, improved its record to 5-0 and 3-0 in the Ivy League.  The victory continued the momentum the Crimson established before the break, posting a 121-108 victory over Arizona State (0-3) on Dec. 19 at the Mona Plummer Aquatic Center in Tempe, Ariz.Although Harvard was able to overcome strong Navy and Sun Devil teams, the Crimson was presented with the toll of a long winter break and looming exams.“Like the rest of the team, I struggled from the training and from coming back after not being here for a while,” Guernsey said. “Exams are hitting, so it’s the time where we’ve got to buckle down and make sure we’re getting the work done that we need.”Harvard coach Tim Murphy was pleased with his team’s win, however he also noted the need for hard work and improvement before Harvard’s next meet.“We’ve got to train faster and train a little bit better than we have,” Murphy said.  “We’re in a fairly good spot right now, but there’s a lot of work left to be done.”HARVARD 188, NAVY 112Harvard’s impressive victory was led by sophomore Zac Ranta, who has broken onto the Ivy diving scene this year. Qualifying for the NCAA A Division Championships, the Hales Corners, Wis. native also claimed first in both of the day’s diving events.  Ranta posted a score of 296.47 in the 1-meter dive, surpassing the second-place finisher from Navy by over 60 points, and a remarkable 349.51 in the 3-meter dive.Sophomore Henry Winslow followed Ranta in the 3-meter event, scoring 267.83 for a solid second-place finish.  Winslow also placed third in the 1-meter dive.The Crimson divers’ victories were matched in the pool, as Harvard claimed 11 of the day’s 16 events.“We did pretty well,” co-captain Eric Lynch said.  “We did a good job of stepping up and especially of just winning races.”Harvard showed its strength in the backstroke events, dominating both the 100- and 200-meter swims. The Crimson swept the events and then some, capturing the first four places each time.Sophomore Jordan Diekema placed first in both the 100- and 200- backstroke, with times of 50.67 and 1:52.01, respectively. Freshman Ian Mirisola, sophomore Derick Chui and freshman Rob Newell claimed the next three spots in the 100-meter event, with Mirisola and Chui swapping places in the 200-meter swim.Junior Alex Meyer was another decisive force for Harvard, finishing first in both the 1650-meter freestyle and 500-meter freestyle. After staying neck-and-neck with Navy’s Erik Hunter for the first two-thirds of the 1650-meter event, Meyer was able to kick in and touch the wall in 15:40.46, ending a length ahead of his opponent.The Crimson also placed first in both of the day’s relay events.  Diekema, junior Simone Melillo, senior Bill Jones, and co-captain David Guernsey took the 200-meter medley relay in a time of 1:32.40.  Winning the final event of the meet, the 400-meter medley relay team of Diekema, sophomore Will Heyburn, Jones, and Guernsey touched the wall in 3:07.24.HARVARD 121, ARIZONA STATE 108Jones proved to be the key to the Crimson’s narrow victory, posting 18 points in one day by winning the 50- and 100-meter butterfly events. The senior finished in times of 22.46 and 50.47, respectively.Harvard also claimed the third through sixth spots in the 100 butterfly, as well as third and fourth in the 50-meter.The Crimson nearly produced the same results in the 100-meter IM race, taking first as well as the third through fifth spots. Paced by sophomore Douwe Yntema, who finished first with a time of 53.73, Harvard also took the seventh-place spot with junior Tommy Gray rounding out the event with a time of 56.44.Guernsey finished second in the 50-meter freestyle, falling behind Olympian Mohammed Madwa with a time of 21.58.—Staff writer Alexandra J.

The 20th Annual Badger Hockey Showdown in Madison, Wis. turned out to be no vacation for the Harvard men’s hockey team, as the Crimson (4-8-2, 4-3-2 ECAC) dropped both the semifinal and consolation games Dec. 27-28 against two non-conference opponents.Lake Superior State (3-6-5) advanced to the championship game—won by Wisconsin Dec. 28—after blowing past Harvard in a 6-2 victory on Saturday afternoon. The Crimson fell to Alabama-Huntsville 4-1 on Sunday after defensive breakdowns in the third period against the Chargers (3-10-1).LAKE SUPERIOR STATE 6, HARVARD 2Harvard’s offensive explosion in the first period was chilled by the Lakers thanks to a Troy Schwab goal at 9:51 that robbed the Crimson of the momentum it had built by out-shooting Lake Superior State 10-1 up to that point. Schwab also recorded three assists.“We had as many chances as Lake State offensively, and at the end of the day we didn’t capitalize,” junior Alex Biega said. “It starts with X’s and O’s, and we just have to stick to the gameplan.”By the end of the first period, the score stood at 2-1 after Biega—who also assisted on the Crimson’s second score—answered two Lakers’ goals with one of his own at 18:51 in the first.The events of the second period action against the Lakers served as a reminder of how quickly a hockey game can change from a back-and-forth battle to a blowout.With the team having already rallied twice to get within one goal of the Lakers, Simon Gysbers and Fred Cassiani beat freshman goalie Matt Hoyle in a 91-second span.“In general, our offense starts from our zone, and if we can establish a defense mindset, the offense will come,” Biega said. “Because we’re lacking on defense, we didn’t execute the simple passes in our own zone.”At this point, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 opted to give junior goalie John Riley his first substantial playing time of the season. In the remaining 25 minutes, Riley recorded 11 saves and allowed the game’s final goal, coming at 11:53 in the third.Freshman Daniel Moriarty also beat Lakers’ goalie Pat Inglis at 10:55 in the second period to make the score 3-2, marking his second straight game with a goal.“Daniel has done a great job,” co-captain Jimmy Fraser said. “He’s worked his butt off from day one. Fortunately for him, he’s being rewarded with more ice time. He’s on our power-play unit now and starting to see more offensive situations.”The Crimson also went 0-for-5 on the power play, and despite the problems surrounding the defense, Harvard’s penalty kill went an impressive 5-for-6.“Lake Superior State was a great team, and we did not have an answer to match their play,” Fraser said. “They outworked us, and they definitely deserved to be in the championship game.”ALABAMA-HUNTSVILLE 4, HARVARD 1When the Crimson entered the third period of the consolation game trailing 1-0, Harvard only needed 20 more minutes of hard skating, sound fundamentals, and a few breaks to erase the memories of the previous night’s loss.Though Moriarty added his third goal in as many games at 6:31 off assists from junior Doug Rogers and sophomore Chris Huxley, his efforts came too late, as UAH had already struck for two goals during the first six minutes of the period.Despite out-shooting the Chargers 37-29, Moriarty’s power-play goal—the Crimson went 1-for-4 on the power-play for the game—marked the only time the team scored.Harvard’s stinginess on the power play could not stop UAH from using the man-advantage to pull away in the third. Kevin Morrison struck for the Chargers only power-play goal of the evening at 5:30 to make the score 3-0.The game also marked junior John Riley’s first collegiate start in goal, as he finished the night with 25 saves.Though challenged in the first period during two UAH power plays, Riley kept the game scoreless, stopping five shots—two coming from point-blank deflections.“He works hard and had a great game for us. Unfortunately our defense couldn’t back him up,” Biega said. “Those three goals should never have gone in if we had had that sense of coverage.”Riley’s lack of ice time might start to change early in 2009.“I think having him start in goal was a great motivational lift for us,” Fraser said. “I think there’s going to be a real competition to see who starts in goal next weekend.” —Staff writer Robert T.

And the slump continues.The Harvard men’s hockey team fell to No. 8 Princeton, 5-1, Saturday night at the Baker Rink in the rivals’ first contest since last season’s ECAC playoff championship in which the Tigers (13-2-0, 8-1-0 ECAC) seized the title. The weekend’s losses extend the Crimson (4-10-2, 4-5-2) winless streak to 10 games, paralleling last season’s 10-game dry spell during the winter months.“The last couple years, we’ve gone through some sort of slump similar to what we’re experiencing now,” co-captain Jimmy Fraser said. “We’ve just stayed positive and kept working hard in practice...and we came together as a team. We’ve been doing that already and just haven’t seen results yet, so we’re going to continue to harp on that theme in the locker room.”Princeton nabbed the lead less than two minutes into the game with a quick shot past freshman goaltender Matt Hoyle into the right pocket.“Both [weekend] games, [our opponents] were able to get goals early in the game…and tonight they were able to score in the first minutes,” Fraser said. “We need to have a better start.”After a few Harvard attempts to close the gap, sophomore Michael Biega evened things up for the Crimson at 7:49, picking up a pass from freshman Eric Kroshus and slamming a one-timer into the Tiger net. But the first-period goal was the last Harvard would put on the board against Princeton, perhaps not surprisingly, as the Tigers outshot the Crimson in every period and more than doubled the Crimson’s shots on goal overall, 41-19.“Unfortunately, we weren’t able to produce enough offense to win the hockey game tonight,” Fraser said. “If you look at the shots, they put a lot of pucks on the net, and if you do that, you’re going to win...The opposition scoring early is one factor in terms of them scoring goals, and they’re just getting more shots on the net, and when you do that, you increase your likelihood of scoring.”The Tigers reclaimed the lead halfway through the first period with a man-advantage goal. Princeton’s Dan Bartlett picked up a pass on the right side and came in from behind the net to tap in a goal at the left post, putting his team ahead, 2-1.Hoyle limited the Tigers’ lead to one by making several difficult saves in the last five minutes of the frame, getting his pad on a Princeton attempt and then diving to block the rebound shot. Hoyle made 27 saves over the course of the night.Early in the second period, Harvard picked up its first power play of the game, giving the Crimson a good chance to even the score. But the Tigers snatched up a turnover at the offensive blue line and ripped a short-handed breakaway shot to boost their lead to 3-1.Harvard got another power-play opportunity halfway through the middle frame, but Princeton goaltender Zane Kalemba got in front of shots from sophomore Matt McCollem and freshman Alex Killorn. And when the Crimson got a short-handed breakaway of its own, Kalemba stepped in front of sophomore Pier Olivier-Michaud’s shot to keep Harvard scoreless in the second period.Princeton kept its momentum in the third frame, out-shooting Harvard, 19-8. The Tigers slammed in their second power-play goal at 8:37 and secured another breakaway goal at 11:21 to bring its lead to 5-1. Sophomore Ryan Carroll took Hoyle’s place in the net for the remainder of the game, making nine saves before the buzzer.Harvard was held scoreless on all three of its man-advantage chances.—Staff writer Courtney D.

The bad bounces continued for the Harvard men’s hockey team (4-9-2, 4-4-2 ECAC) as it dropped a 5-2 decision to Quinnipiac at the TD Banknorth Garden on Friday night. “We came back in the third, but I think it’s just an ongoing story,” junior Alex Biega said. “We’re in a little bit of a slump right now. The puck didn’t bounce our way sometimes, but at the end of the game, I think Quinnipiac just capitalized on their opportunities.”With the score tied at two apiece, a simple swing in momentum turned the tide in the Bobcats’ favor. “The way they played, we really had to be aware defensively throughout the game,” Biega said. “They were fortunate enough to get some lucky bounces and get some odd man rushes at the end of the game. We really have to limit our mistakes throughout the game—they’re costing us.”Quinnipiac scored three goals in the last five minutes of the final period to capture and maintain the lead. Jean-Marc Beaudoin scored the game-winner when he snuck around the left post to slip the puck behind freshman goaltender Matt Hoyle with 3:26 remaining.Just 38 seconds later, David Marshall scored the insurance goal from the right-hand side, and Bryan Leitch made the final score 5-2 when he tallied an empty-net goal. The Crimson faced a formidable opponent in Leitch, who scored twice on the night and currently leads all Division I in scoring with six goals and 23 assists. “We had a couple [of] defensive breakdowns and unlucky bounces,” Hoyle said. “I personally made a mistake I shouldn’t have made by allowing them to score two goals so close to each other.” Prior to the Bobcats’ offensive onslaught late in the third period, Harvard kept toe-to-toe with Quinnipiac by responding with a goal of its own whenever falling behind. Back-and-forth play characterized much of the first period, and it wasn’t until Beaudoin scored at 8:55 to give the Bobcats the lead that the real action of the match began.The Crimson responded with a tally of its own a mere three minutes later when senior defenseman Nick Coskren tipped the puck into the net to tie the game up at 1-1 after a shot on goal from junior defenseman Alex Biega was deflected by Quinnipiac netminder Bud Fisher. “[This game] was a step forward for the team collectively,” Biega said. “When things got tough, we stayed with them. We tried to score goals that way.”The Bobcat offensive unit took over in the second period, out-shooting Harvard, 15-8. The effort paid off about halfway into the second period. Quinnipiac capitalized on a 5-on-3 man advantage when Leitch fired a wrist shot from the right circle to beat Hoyle and take a 2-1 lead.Biega tied the game up again about five minutes into the last period when he deflected a shot on goal by freshman forward Colin Moore into the net. Biega now leads Harvard scoring with five goals on the season.“Some of the forwards had a break in the zone, and we were talking all week about just putting the puck on net and making things happen,” Biega said. “I just stuck my stick in there. That was a prime example of what happens when you put the puck on net. I would give all the credit to [Moore].”Despite the third period tally, Harvard could not match the Bobcats’ late offensive explosion, as Quinnipiac fired 14 shots and scored three goals in the final period. The loss to the Bobcats marked the ninth game in a row without a victory for the Crimson. “We started off really slow last year with almost the same record, but we came together as a team,” Biega said. “We’re taking the appropriate steps forward to make us a winning team again.”—Staff writer Lucy D.

With no time left in regulation and only a few hours left in 2008, the Harvard women’s basketball team (8-6) found itself tied with crosstown rival Northeastern, 67-67 on New Year’s Eve. But the Crimson vowed to end 2008 triumphantly and defeated Northeastern (3-8) in overtime, 78-72.“I think that for us, especially in overtime, we were focused on making sure that each possession was valuable, taking care of the basketball, and playing big defensively,” co-captain Niki Finelli said. “I think when our focus shifted to defense, our offense followed, and that is what allowed us to get out in front in overtime.”The Crimson entered overtime play with grim determination. It scored the first seven points of the stanza to pull ahead, 76-74. The Huskies refused to lay down without a fight, and promptly dropped a three-pointer with only three minutes left on the clock to bring them within two possessions of a win, 74-70.Then with less than 50 seconds left, freshman Brogan Berry hit two critical free-throws for Harvard to push the Crimson lead to 76-70. The Huskies’ next possession yielded two points, once again bringing them within four. But with 31 seconds left, Northeastern fouled Emily Tay, who made both of her shots to put the game out of reach at its final score of 78-72.“I thought Northeastern played very well,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They are a young team. We knew in spite of their record they were dangerous because it’s a lot of freshmen, and a lot of why they have not been able to win I think is inexperience, so they are getting better each game.”The Huskies’ came out strong, taking a 7-2 lead over the Crimson in the first three minutes of the game. But over the next two minutes of play, which included three rebounds and four points from Finelli, Harvard pulled ahead, 8-7. Finelli had a game-high 18 points.“Niki [Finelli] was your ultimate senior captain” Delaney-Smith said. “She did it at both ends. She was a leader, she shot, she just had the all-around, senior leader, captain game.”Finelli was not the only Harvard player who had a stand-out game. Four Crimson players scored in double-digits, including Berry, who also had six assists, and Emma Markley, who picked up four steals.“There are things that do not show up statistically, like great defensive plays, like [sophomores] Jackie [Alemany] and Claire Wheeler had some big rebounds,” Finelli said. “I think it was a complete team effort that allowed us to win yesterday.”With a shot from Dani Iervolino, Northeastern then pulled ahead, 10-8, and maintained the lead for the next five minutes, until a jumper from Berry put the Crimson back in the lead, 19-18. But the Huskies quickly capitalized on a shot from Kim Carr and regained control of the score, 20-19, until a three-pointer from Alemany put the Crimson back in front, 24-22. The Crimson made a season-high 11 three-pointers during the course of the game.“I think that was [Northeastern’s] gameplan, to see if we could beat them with outside shooting,” Delaney-Smith said. “We actually have really dangerous outside shooters, we just haven’t consistently taken advantage of that. We have players with the capability to hit threes, and that’s basically the reason we won.”The first half ended with the Crimson leading the Huskies, 29-28. Northeastern refused to simply give up the game and scored the first points of the second half to regain the lead, 30-29.“Northeastern is a big crosstown rival for us, and we just really tried to stay focused,” Finelli said.This rivalry was exhibited in the intensity of the second half, which resulted in four ties and 10 lead changes between the two teams. But Harvard never game up the fight, and in overtime, tallied its last win of 2008.—Staff writer Stephanie Krysiak can be reached at skrysiak@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team opened 2009 in the best way possible, besting Santa Clara 73-68 at Lavietes Pavilion on Friday.The Crimson (7-6) got balanced scoring production, as four players were in double figures. Junior guard Jeremy Lin led the way with 17 points, and junior forward Doug Miller scored a career-best 15 points. Senior guard Drew Housman had 16, and freshman forward Peter Boehm added 13.Harvard used this balance, as well as some excellent ball control and defense, to overcome a big size disadvantage against the Broncos (7-8). Led by 6’10, 275 lbs. center John Bryant, Santa Clara out-rebounded the Crimson, 42-24, but committed 20 turnovers against just six for Harvard.“We knew they were going to be tough inside, but we have a lot of speed, and our gameplan was to run ’em and run ’em the entire night,” Housman said. “It worked out for us, we executed pretty well.”Leading for most of the game, the Crimson dug deep to get away from the Broncos three times when the visitors made it close in the second half. Trailing 37-36 early on after the break, Housman faked and drove to the hoop for a three-point play, giving the team a lead it would not relinquish. Lin copied Housman with his own three-point play on the next possession. Captain guard Andrew Pusar then put back a miss to make it 44-37.Miller put back his own miss the next time up the floor, but Santa Clara would make it 47-43 with 12:08 left. Lin answered with a quick bank shot. Boehm then hit an open three, and Lin followed—after taking a pass from freshman guard Oliver McNally at the top of the key—with a bullet pass down low to an open Miller for a layup as the Crimson went up, 54-43, midway through the half.The Broncos did not fold, however, and brought Bryant and three teammates back into the game, including Kevin Foster, who hit two quick threes. The visitors soon closed within four, at 54-50, with 8:04 left to play.Harvard yet again had an answer. Off a pick-and-roll, Lin found Miller for a layup—one of Lin’s nine assists, matching his career-high against just one turnover.“He made every right decision, being so unselfish and making plays and finding shots for his teammates,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s such a huge weapon for us with what he brings to the table.”After Pusar stole a pass on the next possession, Lin recorded another of his assists as he drove and dished to McNally who nailed a big three-pointer.The Harvard defense clamped down  as well, allowing just one field goal—a put-back by Bryant that McNally immediately answered with a long jumper with 4:20 left. The Crimson capped its strong run with some more playmaking from Lin. With the shot clock running down, he drove and kicked to Pusar, who buried a three from the corner, making it 64-53 with 2:17 left. Santa Clara kept at it, but solid free-throw shooting by the home team kept it at least a two-possession contest to the end.In the first half, Harvard came out smoking and led by double figures for most of the half before the Broncos rallied to cut the deficit to two at the break, 31-29. Miller led the charge on both ends, scoring six points on 3-of-3 shooting, including two reverse layups around Bryant off passes from Lin.On the defensive end, he bodied up Santa Clara’s big man, limiting his touches and effectiveness, despite giving away four inches and 55 pounds.“I’m so proud of how Doug played,” Amaker said. “He gave us incredible effort on the interior. I was really proud of how he finished around the goal and rebounded the basketball.”Bryant finished with 14 points, 11 rebounds, and five blocks—four of them off shots by freshman forward Keith Wright, who was making his second appearance after recovering from mono. Foster added a game-high 20 points, but it was not enough to overcome Harvard’s suffocating defense and consistent shooting.“I definitely think this is one of the best team games we have had all year,” Lin said. “That’s good to build on, especially with the Ivy League two games away.’The Crimson’s Ivy opener is Jan. 10 at Dartmouth and it has one more tune-up before then, as it travels to local rival Boston College on Wednesday. —Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team ended the Women of Troy Basketball Classic in Los Angeles with two losses. The two losses, though, could not have been more different. On Dec. 19, the Crimson (7-6) went down 54-49 to a Siena team that it had beaten by 23 points just three weeks earlier.The Saints scored the last nine points of the game to take the win and ensure a miserable night for Harvard.“We could not have played worse against Siena,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We were sloppy on both ends of the floor. There was nothing positive about the game.”Coming off the dismal display against the Saints, the Crimson took the court 24 hours later to face the tournament hosts—the University of Southern California—probably the toughest opponent on its schedule all season. Despite the fact that Harvard’s upset bid ended in a 95-74 defeat, the Crimson played the Trojans nearly even in the second half and can take a lot of encouragement from the way that it competed against one of the top teams in the country.“We responded really well against USC,” Delaney-Smith said.Playing in her hometown, co-captain Emily Tay led her squad in scoring in both games. The senior was named to the All-Tournament Team and also moved into third place in Harvard’s all-time assists list.SIENA 54, HARVARD 49The Crimson may have left the Galen Center Friday night looking for answers, but the game started with plenty of promise. Harvard jumped out to a 10-2 lead, and it looked as if another big win was in store.The Saints (2-7), however, had other ideas. Siena dominated the next 10 minutes, using a 22-7 run to take the lead. “I think we all played individually, and Siena just played better as a team,” said Tay, who finished the game with 12 points and three steals.The Crimson was without its other co-captain, Niki Finelli, who was sick with the flu.“It was tough to play without her,” Delaney-Smith said. “She brings an enormous amount of energy and leadership to the floor.”Harvard found itself up 49-45 with four and a half minutes to play. Saints’ Captain Heather Stec, who finished with a game-high 17 points, made back-to-back baskets to even the score at 49 with 2:42 remaining.The final two minutes saw the Crimson miss four three-pointers.“Several of our go-to players did not step up and did not want the shot,” Delaney-Smith said.Siena was able to hit five free throws to earn the victory.USC 95, HARVARD 74Harvard entered Saturday’s matchup with USC (6-4) knowing that a win was unlikely but looking to make up for the disappointment of the Siena game.“We knew we were the underdogs, but before the game there was a great energy about the team,” Tay said. “It was completely different [from] Friday,” she added.While the Crimson was playing its worst game of the year against Siena, the Trojans were nearly pulling out a win against No. 8 Duke. USC built a 17-point second half lead Friday night, only to be taken down in overtime by the Blue Devils.After six and a half minutes of play, Harvard found itself up 15-14 on the Trojans.USC responded with a 23-5 run in the middle of the first half, helping it to take a 19-point lead into the break.“When you play against a team like USC, you have to take them away from their comfort zone and hope they miss shots,” Delaney-Smith said. Unfortunately for the Crimson, the Trojans didn’t miss much. USC shot 57 percent from the field in the opening period, finishing the game with a season-high mark of 54 percent.In particular, Harvard’s tough defense was unable to slow freshman All-American Briana Gilbreath, who scored 17 of her game-high 22 points in the first half.After the break, the Trojans quickly extended their lead to 27. The Crimson, however, refused to go away. Harvard demonstrated its resilience in a second half that saw it play mighty USC even.On the night, the Crimson did everything right except make their shots, hitting just 37.5 percent from the field.“I loved our patience and our balance, but some of out shots just didn’t fall,” Delaney-Smith said.Tay and sophomore Emma Markley led the team with 16 points each, and sophomore Claire Wheeler was a force on the boards, grabbing eight rebounds. Freshman Brogan Berry was named Ivy League Rookie of the Week for the third week in a row after her solid showing in the weekend tournament.Harvard’s performance against a national powerhouse stood in stark contrast to the previous night’s disaster. “It says that we are young,” Tay said of the team’s inconsistency. “It’s been a rollercoaster ride so far this season.”—Staff writer Jay M.

In a season in which nothing was going quite right, something finally clicked for the Harvard women’s hockey team.The Crimson (5-5-3, 5-2-2 ECAC) got a big win Dec. 17 in Hanover, N.H., taking down No. 3 Dartmouth (7-4-1, 6-2-1), 3-2. Sophomore Liza Ryabkina played the hero, netting the game-winner early in the third period.“It was a hard-fought game, and we capitalized on our opportunities,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “The kids were ready to go. They played very alert, together hockey.”Just three days after being upset on the road by Connecticut and falling out of the national polls for the first time in over six years, the Crimson came out firing against the Big Green.Harvard had to fight through nearly three minutes of penalty kill early in the first frame, after defensemen Kathryn Farni and Kati Vaughn were called for hooking. But as soon as Dartmouth’s advantage expired, the Crimson struck.Sophomore defenseman Leanna Coskren found tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt on the left side of the ice, and the senior took care of the rest. Vaillancourt brought the puck through the Big Green zone and slid it past Dartmouth netminder Carli Clemis, giving Harvard a 1-0 lead.With the tally, Vaillancourt became just the seventh player in Crimson history to record 200 career points.The Big Green got even before the first period was over. Junior defenseman Jen Brawn was called for hooking at 16:35, and Dartmouth’s Maggie Kennedy capitalized on the power-play opportunity.The second period brought more of the same back-and-forth play. The squads traded shots, with Harvard dealing the first blow.At 6:04 in the second frame, sophomore Katharine Chute notched her second goal of the season to put the Crimson back ahead. Vaillancourt and tri-captain Kirsten Kester were credited with assists.The recently reshuffled line of Kester, Chute, and Ryabkina accounted for three of Harvard’s seven points on the night, showing that the team can rely on its depth to win games.“I think we had three balanced lines that can play all the time,” Stone said. “The kids worked hard.” Just six minutes later, the Big Green came back to tie it up once again. Dartmouth sophomore Amanda Trunzo took a pass from Kennedy and slid it just inside the left post, knotting the score at 2-2 heading into the second intermission.Despite injuries, line changes, and 12 games worth of frustration, the Crimson was determined to make its last period of 2008 a memorable one.“We came out really wanting this win and really hungry,” sophomore forward Kate Buesser said.The team didn’t waste much time in the final frame. Four minutes into the period, Ryabkina took a pass from freshman Whitney Kennedy and, with a strong wrist shot from inside the right circle, sent it soaring past Clemis for the go-ahead goal.The assist was the first point of Kennedy’s young career.“After [Ryabkina] scored, the bench was really ignited. Everyone was just flying,” Buesser said. “We just wanted it more than Dartmouth, and I think it showed.”The Big Green peppered junior goaltender Christina Kessler with shots for the rest of the period and was even able to put one in the net, but the would-be equalizer was called back because of a high stick in front of the goal.“We didn’t want to give up the early goals, but Kessler was tough down the stretch,” Stone said. “I do think we could still play better defensively all around, but we’re getting there.”Kessler made a season-high 32 saves, including 16 in the third period alone, to preserve the lead. Clemis finished with 16 saves.The win, Harvard’s first against a ranked team this season, sends the team home for winter break with a restored sense of confidence.“I think this was huge for our team. We’ve been having kind of a rough start here,” Buesser said. “I think this is really going to set a tone for the new year.”“Every win is a big one,” Stone said. We had a pretty tough schedule from the beginning of the season to this point—who we’ve played, injuries we’ve had, people being in and out of the lineup. The kids expected more of themselves last night, and they got it.” —Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s basketball team is checking off credentials on its non-conference list as it readies for Ivy play. Its most recent acquisition? A tough, come-from-behind win on the road.The Crimson (7-4) rallied from seven points down in the final two minutes to beat UC Santa Barbara (3-5) in a 61-59 nailbiter Dec. 17 at the Thunderdome in Santa Barbara, Calif.After the two teams traded leads for most of the second half, the Gauchos used an 8-2 run with under five minutes to play to put themselves up by seven with 1:17 to play. The run set the stage for Harvard’s own furious scoring streak. Sophomore guard Christine Matera and co-captain Niki Finelli hit back-to-back shots from distance, which they sandwiched around a Brogan Berry steal. Up by one, UCSB center Jenna Green traveled in the paint to send the ball back to the Crimson and set up senior forward Katie Rollins’ game-winning layup. After yet another Gaucho turnover, Rollins hit a free throw with three seconds remaining to seal the win. UCSB’s late-game seven-point lead was the largest either team had enjoyed all evening. The matchup featured 18 lead changes and six ties.  In the tightly contested matchup, last-minute defense made the difference. While allowing the Gauchos to shoot 47 percent from the field on the night—a clip that Harvard can’t expect to allow in a victory—the Crimson held UCSB scoreless in the final two minutes. “They got grizzled by our defense, and we were able to capitalize on their mistakes,” Finelli said. The win was the third straight for Harvard after a disappointing loss at Boston University on Dec. 9.  “It’s a huge game for us in that we’ve been able to come back from that game,” Finelli said. “[UCSB] plays in a big conference, and it’s a big confidence builder for us to prove that we can play with some really talented teams out here.”The thrilling ending masked some ugly second-half shooting numbers in the Crimson box score. After shooting well in the first half (44 percent), Harvard connected on just 8-of-34 attempts from the field—including 4-of-13 from three. But two of those long-range shots that did fall proved to be the game’s biggest. While Matera shot just 4-for-11 on the night (3-for-9 from distance), she has come on of late, scoring 11 points in each of her last two contests. “Every shooter has a stretch of time where they’re just not feeling things—they’re in a slump,” Finelli said of Matera. Finelli led the team with 13 points and eight rebounds. Emma Markley’s six-point night ended her streak of double-digit scoring at 10 games. “I liked the team determination,” Crimon coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It wasn’t our best team basketball, but there was this feeling of the team coming together with a will to win.”Both teams started with hot shooting from the floor, with the Crimson gaining an early, but short-lived, advantage. Berry, Finelli, and Rollins all hit jumpers—with Berry adding a three-pointer for good measure—en route to a 10-6 lead after four minutes. The Gauchos kept pace, and while one of Matera’s threes gave Harvard a five-point lead with 7:41 to go in the half, the Crimson entered the locker room with just a two-point edge. Green paced UCSB with 10 of her 16 points before the break. The two squads traded baskets for most of the second half, and only in the waning minutes did Harvard appear to be in trouble. Two straight baskets from Kat Suderman (10 points) put the Gauchos up seven, setting the stage for the Crimson’s last-minute heroics. —Staff writer Emily W.

The arrival of Quinnipiac at Bright Hockey Center on Saturday provided the Harvard women’s hockey team with a chance for redemption after the previous night’s defeat.Coming off a tight 1-0 loss to divisional foe Princeton on Friday, the Crimson (6-6-3, 6-3-2 ECAC) took advantage of a shoddy Quinnipiac defense while simultaneously keeping scoring opportunities for the Bobcats (3-18-2, 2-7-2 to a minimum in a 3-1 victory.Saturday’s game also provided senior goaltender Brittany Martin with another chance to reestablish her previously dominant play in goal. Once again filling in for junior starter Christina Kessler, Martin flirted with a shutout until two minutes remained in the third quarter.Bobcat junior Janine Duffy ended those hopes when she pushed in a shot with 2:12 to go. Martin was otherwise impenetrable in the net, making 25 saves in the game.“She stepped up,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She’s done everything we’ve asked her to do. “Yesterday she did a great job. Today she did a great job,” Stone added.The late goal was catalyzed by a hooking call against sophomore Liza Ryabkina at 16:37 in the third—the last of five Harvard penalties. Although the women’s squad staved off Quinnipiac’s assault following the previous four penalties, the mounting errors eventually took their toll.“Ultimately what matters is that we came out with the W,” Martin said.Quinnipiac also refocused its attack in the third, outshooting Harvard 16-14.  Prior to the third, however, the Bobcats’ offensive efforts lacked the zeal mustered in the final period. The first two periods belonged to the Crimson, who attacked the Quinnipiac net in a rhythmic fashion that wore down the Bobcats defense and forced Qunnipiac goaltender Tia Wishart to frequently swipe at dangerously close pucks.Eventually the barrage of shots paid off.  At 12:41 in the first, Ryabkina swooped in behind the Quinnipiac goal from the left corner and fed the puck to captain Kirsten Kester. Kester then knocked it through Wishart’s legs to earn the first goal of the game and the first of Kester’s season.“She’s our emotional sparkplug,” Stone said. “That really set the tone.”  The second goal came in the next period, when senior Kati Vaughn accepted a pass from tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt at 10:13 and launched the puck from long range into the Bobcats net.Harvard out-shot Quinnipiac 19-4 in the first frame and 13-6 in the second. The Crimson was firing on all cylinders—each of Harvard’s three goals and four assists were contributed by different players.“You want to have that balance within your lines,” Stone said.Using this balance, Harvard tacked on a third goal with four minutes remaining in the final period in a setup similar to that which earned the Crimson its first tally. Instead of Kessler and Ryabkina, though, it was sophomore Amy Uber’s and junior Anna McDonald’s assists that allowed junior Randi Griffin to earn her first goal of the season and increase her team’s lead to 3-0.  Harvard kept Wishart on her toes throughout the game, even remaining aggressive in 4-on-5 situations. Instead of defending its goal and making attempts at clearing the puck, the Crimson preferred to take the fight to the Bobcats territory where Harvard continued to fire at Wishart despite the player deficit.Perhaps the only area lacking for the Crimson was penalty conversion—despite two opportunities, it failed to take advantage of Quinnipiac’s errors. The power play has hurt Harvard all season; the Crimson has scored on only 13-of-79 opportunities thus far.  —Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

The new year was supposed to be a new start for the Harvard women’s hockey team, but instead, 2009 just brought more of the same.The Crimson (5-6-3, 5-3-2 ECAC) suffered another disappointing loss on Friday night, falling to conference rival Princeton (8-8-1, 5-5-0), 1-0, at Bright Hockey Center. “I thought we put together a good 60 minutes of hockey, and it’s a little frustrating that we didn’t pull out the win,” senior goaltender Brittany Martin said. “To be honest, I think we outplayed them, but their goalie stood on her head and had a good game, and the pucks just didn’t drop our way.”The Tigers got all the offense they needed on a second-period goal from freshman Heather Landry. At the midpoint of the frame, Landry received the puck in the right circle and slipped it past Martin to put Princeton ahead for good.Freshmen Julie Johnson and Charissa Stadnyk recorded assists on the play.“For the first five minutes after the goal, we kind of threw the puck around a little and let things get to us, but we calmed down after,” Martin said. “I was really proud of our effort in the third period, and I think we barreled right to the net.”The Crimson got several quality chances in the final period, including a short-handed breakaway from tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, but Tigers netminder Kristen Young was impenetrable.“They capitalized on one of our mistakes, and outside of that, I thought we put a tremendous amount of pressure on them,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Their goaltender played very well, our goaltender played very well.”Young turned away all 31 of the shots she faced, while Martin made 20 stops in net for the Crimson.Late in the game, junior defenseman Jen Brawn sent a slapshot in from the left side, but the puck bounced off of Young’s pads and was picked up by Princeton. In a final attempt to even the score, Martin was pulled with 57 seconds to play. But Harvard struggled to keep control in the Tigers’ zone with the extra skater, and time expired without the Crimson getting a real opportunity.Although Princeton held the advantage in shots in the third period, 6-5, Harvard out-shot the Tigers overall and controlled the first 30 minutes of play.Vaillancourt, who had a team-leading five shots, set up several good opportunities in the first period, but the Crimson was unable to capitalize.Sophomore defenseman Leanna Coskren created some breakaway chances of her own, while junior defenseman Kathryn Farni and junior forward Randi Griffin recorded four shots apiece.Neither team was able to convert on the power play, as Harvard went 0-for-4, and Princeton was held scoreless in its three opportunities.The Crimson was playing the game without half of its typical starting lineup. Tri-captain Jenny Brine and junior defenseman Cori Bassett missed the game with injuries, and junior goaltender Christina Kessler is away from the squad to play with the Canadian U-22 national team.Kessler is competing in the MLP Cup in Germany, which goes through tomorrow.“That’s hockey. It’s going to happen,” Stone said of the absences. “These seasons are so long, and it’s rare when you keep everyone in the lineup. We’re never going to bank on those excuses—they’re great opportunities for other kids to step up.”The loss also breaks Harvard’s 27-game unbeaten streak at Bright. The team’s last defeat at home came almost two years ago, a 2-1 loss to St. Lawrence on Jan. 26, 2007.“You’ve got to be resilient, and I liked our effort tonight,” Stone said. “There were so many good things that happened, and they made more stops than we did. But overall, it’s a great effort to build on.” —Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard men’s basketball team trekked to the great white north to the land of the Black Bear.Luckily for the Crimson, it was battling the University of Maine, and its opponent’s roar and bite were less lethal than real black bears, as Harvard (5-5) grabbed a 76-63 win at Alfond Arena.Immune from the brutal storm raging in the cold outside, the Crimson got hot in the second half, making 13-of-22 shots after the break, including 6-of-11 from long range, while stepping up the defensive pressure to escape the Black Bears’ (5-6) home territory unmauled. The win snapped a three-game losing streak for Harvard.“The coaches told us before that this was a big momentum game,” captain guard Andrew Pusar said. “We had two hard losses before this that we should have won. “This gets us back in the right direction,” he added.The Crimson got its most balanced offensive performance of the season so far, as five players scored in double figures. Junior guard Jeremy Lin led the team with 18 points, with freshman forward Peter Boehm adding 14 and Pusar scoring a season-best 12. Junior guard Dan McGeary and freshman guard Oliver McNally came off the bench to score 11 and 10 points, respectively—both season-highs.The reserves came through, especially midway through the second half. As Maine rallied from a 30-23 halftime deficit to tie things up with about 14 minutes to play, strong play from the backups kept it a back-and-forth game for the next five minutes.After a layup from Lin with 9:33 left gave Harvard a 48-46 lead, McGeary nailed a three on the next possession to push the margin to five. After the hosts responded with a bucket, McNally nailed two free throws. He would add a three-pointer several possessions later after the Black Bears clawed their way back to make the score 59-54 with 6:10 left.“The guys off the bench did a great job,” Pusar said. “Oliver and Dan came in and took over the energy of the game. They shifted the game in our favor, and we were able to extend our lead.”McNally’s shot kick-started a 14-5 run to put the game out of reach.Harvard’s tough defense and hot shooting in the second half keyed the push to leave Black Bear country intact. Maine dominated the boards, grabbing 42 rebounds—21 on the offensive end—to the Crimson’s 27, but the Black Bears were corralled into shooting just 17-of-37 from the floor after the break and 26-of-64 for the game.“We did a real good job taking their offensive plan away from them,” Pusar said. “We made it difficult for them to pass the ball around the perimeter, and it was quite uncomfortable for them,” he added.—Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard men’s basketball team kept its fans in the holiday spirit on Dec. 28, easily dispatching Daniel Webster, 94-51, at Lavietes Pavilion.Though junior guard Jeremy Lin once again led the Crimson (6-5) statistically, many of Harvard’s bench players saw quality minutes against the Division III Eagles (3-4).“[There’s] nothing like having a game, putting yourself in some situations and things, and you learn about your team a little bit,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was pleased that different players were able to give us good minutes and good effort.”Harvard opened the game with an easy three-pointer from senior guard Drew Housman and never relinquished the lead.Daniel Webster stuck with the team early in the game, shooting 48 percent from the floor in the first half, but turnovers turned out to be the Eagles’ downfall, as their 25 giveaways led to 36 Crimson points.Led by junior Dan McGeary’s three early three-pointers, Harvard shot 58.1 percent overall and 58.3 percent from beyond the arc in the first half, taking a 51-32 lead into the break.As the second half opened, Daniel Webster began to fade. Harvard started a 31-10 run early in the half, including a streak of 11 straight points, to put the Eagles away.Daniel Webster also found itself in foul trouble, dishing out 22 fouls compared with the Crimson’s 16. Harvard capitalized on those opportunities, shooting 21-of-25 from the charity stripe.In just 25 minutes played, Lin put up a team-leading 16 points, seven boards, five assists, and four steals.“We feed off of Jeremy and the little things that he does that ignite our ball club,” Amaker said. “He’s the catalyst and he’s been that way for us all season, and it doesn’t surprise me to see his stat line the way that it is.”Lin ranks in the top 10 in the Ivy League in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, one of just five players nationally to do so in his conference.“I think that shows how talented or versatile this team is,” Lin said. “I just need to drive and pass it out, and we have so many shooters. [Freshman] Peter Boehm has been playing out of his mind recently. So it’s just trying to do what I can, nothing special.”In his fourth game in the starting lineup, Boehm continued to impress, scoring 14 points in 22 minutes. Boehm—who earned his second straight Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor for his performance—has finished in double figures in every game he has started.“It’s been critical, his ability to stretch the defense, because he’s a good shooter…That has enabled our team to have a little different dimension, and I like that with our ball club,” Amaker said.Freshman Max Kenyi and Housman scored 11 points apiece.Most impressive were the contributions of players who haven’t seen much action, like freshman center Peter Swiatek.In 18 minutes played, Swiatek put up nine points and six rebounds, shooting a perfect 3-for-3 from both the floor and the free-throw line.“I thought his effort was tremendous,” Amaker said. “I was very happy to see him get the minutes that he was able to get today because he’s deserved it, and he made the best use out of it.”Freshman Hugh Martin made his Crimson debut, playing 10 minutes and bringing down three rebounds.The easy victory gave Harvard confidence heading into a tough stretch of games that will culminate with the team’s Ivy League opener on Jan. 10.“We have a two-game win streak…but we’re trying to build momentum for the Ivy League,” Lin said. “We’re trying to find our identity, trying to figure out what we can improve on in terms of defense to try to take us to our goal, which is winning an Ivy League championship.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard men’s basketball team scored 42 of its 63 total points from long range on Dec. 17, shooting a blistering 67 percent from behind the arc, but it could not overcome Rice’s second-half comeback as the Owls (4-5) beat the Crimson 67-63 at Tudor Fieldhouse.Harvard (4-5) took the lead in the final minute with two free throws by junior guard Jeremy Lin, but Rodney Foster answered for the hosts with a three-pointer with 40 seconds to play to give his team a 62-61 lead it would not relinquish.Free throws turned out to be the deciding factor in a game that remained close until the Crimson grabbed an 11-point lead about halfway through the second half. The Owls had a 29-14 free-throw attempt advantage on the game.Rice did not even need excellent shooting from the line to mount its comeback—it only made 62 percent of its free-throw shots for the game—as the pure advantage in quantity proved to be enough to squeak by the hot-shooting Harvard team.Harvard freshman forward Peter Boehm—starting his second game in a row as classmate Keith Wright sat out due to an illness—led the long-distance charge, making 7-of-9 three-point attempts on his way to 23 points, a game high and a new career mark. His hot hand did not see many minutes in the second half due to foul trouble—he ended up fouling out with four minutes left in the game—but the Crimson shot well enough without him. The team’s 78-percent mark from downtown in the second half was a key factor in the surge that almost saw a Harvard victory.The Crimson’s foul trouble led to more than just Boehm sitting out much of the second half. The Owls were granted six free throws in the last 30 seconds of the contest, and by connecting on five of them, they were able to outscore Harvard 5-2 to close out their victory.Boehm’s first half performance—17 points, 5-of-6 from long range—allowed the Crimson to enter the locker room after the first period with a one-point lead.Lin chipped in 17 points for Harvard but shot just 29 percent from the floor.—CRIMSON SPORTS STAFF
