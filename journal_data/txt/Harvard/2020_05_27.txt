Car Seat Headrest’s newest album, “Making a Door Less Open,” is a sweeping blend of genres, all characterized by the same relentless dynamism. Rock ‘n’ roll tradition and techno influence compete throughout the album, rising and crashing into each other in every song. Released on May 1, “Making a Door Less Open” is the indie rock band’s tenth studio album, and a testament to the band’s propensity for musical innovation and burning lyricism.
From the start of the album opener, “Weightlifters,” Car Seat Headrest set up perfectly for the synth-packed album, its discordant mix of vibrant keyboards and rock-fueled guitar riffs drawing listeners deeper into the song. As the song progresses, the lighter drums and ambient synths of the beginning devolve into a frenzied combination of guitars and searing vocals. “Put your heart on the target / They expect you to scream / Music blasts through the market / It's the sound of machines,” lead singer Will Toledo sings as the music builds with a swelling sense of chaos. His light vocals form a striking contrast to the shouting harmonies that overtake them. The song, like much of the album, is one of loss and gain, as the medley of instruments continue to alternate and build onto each other.
The band employs a similar tension in “Can’t Cool Me Down” and “Deadlines (Hostile).” Both find their dynamism in the use of rising and falling melodies, united by constant drum beats cycling under aching vocals and synths in the background. “Deadlines (Hostile),” in particular, showcases Car Seat Headrest’s alternative music influence. The song is loud and loose, a perfect track for driving in the middle of the night with the windows rolled all the way down. Driven by Toledo’s vocals, the whisper-singing of a bored rock star, “Deadlines” sounds like freedom: dangerous and reckless, but also a source of epic catharsis.
Throughout “Making a Door Less Open,” Car Seat Headrest’s members refuse to narrow themselves down to a singular sound. In “Hollywood,” they’re the quintessential rockstars. Grungey guitar riffs open up the song, and from there it only gets rougher. “Hollywood makes me want to puke!” Toledo yells over the raging music, his voice just breaking under its power. With “What’s With You Lately,” on the other hand, the band bares all. For that one song, they ditch the techno-fueled musicality that permeates the album, replacing it with a soft, melancholy acoustic guitar. Toledo’s vocals, too, are replaced with the voice of lead guitarist Ethan Ives. “You’re not the only one that’s angry / You shut the door they call you crazy,” Ives sings over the light fingerpicking, providing a much-needed refresher from the incessant energy of the rest of the album.
With an album full of shorter numbers ranging from one to five minutes, Car Seat Headrest appear to be moving away from the lengthy tracks they’re known for. When they do attempt to pull longer songs off, they do so less successfully. The longest song on “Making A Door Less Open,” the seven-minute “There Must Be More Than Blood,” is perhaps the only piece off the album that leaves something to be desired.The song starts slowly, and though one would expect the ballad to build up into the same complex blend of instruments as the rest of the album, it never does. After the energy and intensity of the preceding songs, “There Must Be More Than Blood” falls short. Still, those seven minutes of mellow musicality serve to provide an important reprieve in the album, a space to savor Car Seat Headrest’s musicianship and Toledo’s soothing vocals.
“Making a Door Less Open”’s closing track, “Famous,” winds the album down with a dissonant mix of disembodied voices and synths reminiscent of the opening song. “Please let somebody care about this,” Toledo sings as the album draws to a melancholy close. With that, Car Seat Headrest wrap up a powerful album, cementing themselves as kings of the indie rock scene.

Karla M. Cornejo Villavicencio ’11 makes it very clear in the opening pages of “The Undocumented Americans” that her autobiography-exposé is not a sanitized “success story” crafted to make white America feel good about itself. Rather, she writes, “I wanted to tell the stories of people who work as day laborers, housekeepers, constructions workers, dog walkers, deliverymen, people who don’t inspire hashtags or T-shirts, but I wanted to learn about them as the weirdos we all are outside of our jobs.” Her point? Undocumented people need not be “heroes” for their stories to be important, valid, and, above all, told.
Cornejo Villavicencio elaborates that “This book is for everybody who wants to step away from the buzzwords in immigration, the talking heads, the kids in graduation caps and gowns, and read about the people underground. Not heroes. Randoms. People. Characters.” Cornejo Villavicencio touches upon a common American trope: Tying one’s worth and inherent value not only to labor, but to the amount, type, and perceived social capital of such labor. She never outright says it, but the entire book is a critique of that premise, demonstrating through her chronicles of the daily lives of the people she interviewed that while work is part of one’s identity, it cannot present an individual’s whole story.
Instead, Cornejo Villavicencio talks about the effects of work (“muscle to flooring to woodwork to welding to painting to cement work to brickwork to carpentry to insulation to stucco to electrical work to just about everything else in the construction universe,” among many others) on the body and mind; she talks about botanicas — herbal stores that also offer further medical treatments — in Miami; and she talks about the agony of mothers in Flint, who carry the weight of knowing their children will be affected by lead-tainted water for the rest of their lives.
Of course, “The Undocumented Americans” is not comprised solely of narrative based on interviews. Cornejo Villavicencio offers her own commentary. “What promises can you make to a child about the world of possibility ahead of them when the state has poisoned their bloodstreams and bones such that their behavioral self-control and language comprehension are impaired?” she asks.
Devastatingly, she adds that “What I saw in Flint was a microcosm of the way the government treats the undocumented everywhere, making the conditions in this country as deadly and toxic and inhumane as possible so that we will self-deport.” Cornejo Villavicencio spares no words for a system that is perfectly happy to profit off the labor and taxes of undocumented people while denying them basic humanity and dignity.
This book is an autobiography, too, born out of Cornejo Villavicencio’s desire to write about her parents as more than “undocumented,” an adjective that says often erases the multitudes the compose a person’s identity. At the end of the book, she writes that her father, after having worked for the success of his children, simply wants happiness. She writes, “It was his turn to be happy. And now my mom is free to figure out what makes her happy, after thirty-one years. Thirty of those years have been spent here in America, being undocumented together. She goes to yoga now. The other day, she had a hot dogs” Happiness arrives in small-scale, bite-size chunks that, together, piece together a sense of self-actualization beyond long-accepted definition of one’s role. Cornejo Villavicencio’s mother, for example, accepts that she is a good mother, and yet wants to”know what it’d be like to be a successful woman on a personal level, not on the level of a mother.”
Cornejo Villavicencio recounts suffering and piled-upon years of hard work to build steady lives. Creating interiority requires telling all sides of the story, and she flatly tells us that being left behind in Ecuador as a baby had a profound, lasting, and devastating impact on her mental health — and not in a “‘wild and crazy and weird and brilliant’ way.” Nothing in “The Undocumented Immigrants” is gratuitous or over-dramatized: not the pain and emotional turbulence, nor the quiet moments of dignity and joy. And yet the righteous anger still comes through to paint a realistic, and more complete, portrait of how undocumented life has manifested in the past, and remains still in 2020.

Frank Ocean, notorious for long stretches between his albums, occasionally appeases fans by dropping singles just when they need them the most. It wasn’t entirely surprising, then, when the elusive, beloved singer released two new songs, “Dear April” and “Cayendo,”earlier this month.
“Dear April” has compelling, enigmatic lyrics and a pleasing melody, but is not necessarily a standout ballad in Frank Ocean’s discography. Alongside relatively simple synth and guitar, Frank Ocean’s vocals helm the song. Perhaps the most captivating part is in the beginning, when Ocean breaks an extended synth chord with his emotive tenor and subtle vibrato, singing slowly and with yearning, “Dear April / The only face in the crowd that I know.” Though the role and identity of the titular April remains unclear, he immediately evokes a universal feeling with this first line — one person can be a comforting anchor in moments of unfamiliarity or uncertainty. Other lines are harder to figure out; “If you could take two strangers / Lead them left and right / At a certain place and time,” he leads up to the chorus, with lyrics that are almost frustratingly vague but somehow still meaningful.
Though the lyrics are thought-provoking, the song is melodically repetitive. This, coupled with a lack of progression in emotional intensity, makes it easy to like, but not love, “Dear April.” Without a memorable chorus, the homogenous ballad is an earnest attempt that falls short of its potential. To his credit, Frank Ocean’s vocals are never without raw emotion. “Dear April” is a vulnerable tribute to a deeply appreciated loved one; “Just like you made me new / Just like you took me through / Just like you woke me up,” he sings in the chorus at the end, but with more veneration — or perhaps more heartache — than before. Although lyrically ambiguous, “Dear April” ultimately evokes rebirth and renewal. In spite of its shortcomings, it’s still a song worth listening to this spring season.
“Cayendo” is another emotive ballad, but it establishes itself as tonally different from “Dear April” with the lonely landscape of a singular electric guitar backing Frank Ocean’s lyrics. Partially sung in Spanish, listeners don’t have to speak the language to comprehend the melancholy mood, which is conveyed by the tender and soulful lilt of the melody. Still, the lyrics are insightful and poetic, especially the verses. The third line, “Si esto no me ha partío', ya no me partiré nunca”, translates to “if this hasn’t broken me yet, I will never break,” hinting that “Cayendo” is a ballad for the brokenhearted. This is confirmed in the chorus, when the lyrics switch to English and he alludes to the pain of unrequited love with the well-crafted lines, “You stood me up, you lay me down / You know too much, I can’t be proud.”
In the chorus, interpolating Sade’s 1988 song “Love Is Stronger Than Pride,” he croons “I still really, really love you” twice over. Deviating only slightly from her original melody, the line is a definite ode to the musical prowess of Sade, one of the many influential R&B singers that paved the way for Frank Ocean’s career. A simple but effective line in 1988, it remains that way today as it plainly states that feelings don’t disappear as quickly as we want them to. After this interpolation, the delicate guitar melody underscores a repetition of the first lines of the song, but sung an octave higher and ringing with flamenco-tinged emotion. While “Cayendo” may at first seem unexciting in terms of musical range, this moment midway through highlights the gradual build up to a more moving moment that showcases Ocean’s vocal range.
The word “cayendo,” meaning “falling” in Spanish, comes up just before the chorus in a line that translates to “If I can stand what I feel, why am I falling?,” and again at the end of the song with the particularly beautifully sung line “acaso voy cayendo,” meaning “maybe I’m falling.” Even if the hook leans too much on the line of a Sade hit, it’s hard to ignore the evocative nature of the rest of the song, and how it seems to perfectly capture the painful vulnerability of being in love.
Although his 2019 single “In My Room” might be a more applicable song to listen to in COVID-19 quarantine, both “Dear April” and “Cayendo” are thoughtful and dreamy enough to gratify us until the long-awaited third album comes out.

Dear Class of 2020,
It wasn’t supposed to be like this. We were supposed to have time. Time to celebrate you, indulge you, and offer you a space to prepare emotionally for your next chapter. We wanted to meet your parents, step-parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends; make small talk, make jokes, share stories. We were looking forward to corralling you — all of us in full regalia — at the crack of dawn on Commencement day, so we could march in procession with you to the Yard (parting a sea of cars and watching passersby smile). We had plans to sit among you in Memorial Hall for an uplifting senior chapel. And finally, back at the House, after all the formalities in the Yard were over, we were ready (full of emotions ourselves) to hand each of you your diplomas as your names were called, to give each of you one last handshake or (more likely) hug, while your loved ones watched proudly under a warm May sky (or a downpour, which seems to happen suspiciously often on graduation day).
Still, alongside all these regrets, we also feel a lot of gratitude. We cherish the semesters we did have together. We are so glad that we had as many chances as we did to play with you and work with you. We feel honored to have been able to watch you grow, and to grow with you. We are grateful to have been trusted with your friendship.
In the weeks since you all departed from campus, we have thought about you every day. Our hearts ache for those of you struggling with illness, or caring for ill members of your families. We worry about those of you who have seen parents lose jobs; or who have lost jobs and opportunities of your own. But we also marvel at your resilience and generosity: the ways that you have adapted to dramatically new ways of learning, socializing, and living; the impulse so many of you have shown to serve, to help, to give back; the kindness with which you have supported one another. None of us can choose the historical moment into which we are thrust, but we can choose how we respond. And you have all responded with such grace, creativity, and courage. That makes us very proud.
As the semester now winds down, we wish for so much for all of you: good health and safety, first and foremost, but also meaningful work, moments of joy and fun, and friendships that nurture and enlarge you. We are glad that there will be a chance, at least virtually, to celebrate all of you later this week. And we are even more comforted and energized by the University’s firm promise that, when the health risks of this time recede, we will all gather in the Houses again to renew friendships in ways that are not possible at a distance. It will be all the sweeter, all the more meaningful, for having been deferred.

Dear Classes of 2020 and 2021,
Now is the time to think outside the traditional set of jobs in finance and consulting in New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. Be a big fish in a small pond. While you may have been one of thousands of Ivy League grads to end up in New York, you may be one of the only ones in your hometown (or wherever you're waiting out quarantine). You'll get more responsibility earlier and thus build life skills faster. Find the most accomplished person around you and become his or her assistant. It's a great way to understand how a successful senior person (in whatever field) works so that you can become one yourself sooner than later.
As soon as you can, travel. Don't spend a lot of money. Stay in hostels or couch-surf. Spend time with people who don't have a lot. After four years (or 3.75) in a stupidly rich place like Harvard, you need to understand how other parts of the world live. Travel will show you how much abundance you've been treated to, and you'll need less therapy later in life.
Invest, don't buy. You don't need most of the things you think you do in your early 20s. If you are lucky enough to have a job, pay off your debt then buy stock or invest in your education.
But don't go to grad school unless you're completely certain you want to be a lawyer, doctor, or academic. It might be tempting to avoid reality for the next few years by earning another degree. Don't spend $150,000-plus and two-plus years getting a diploma in a field you're not sure you like. You already have an A.B. from Harvard that will open most doors. Get a job where you build the skills you would have learned in grad school but are getting paid instead of racking up more debt. Invest in courses or certifications for specific skills where there's a reasonable expectation you'll see a return on investment (coding, nursing, etc.). Don't buy courses in creative writing, cooking, or music. Don't go to grad school in the arts unless you get into the very best program in the world for your passion and/or you get a scholarship.
Be generous with your time, but not your money. If you're lucky enough to have a lot of the latter, hold onto it for now. You don't have enough experience to spend it wisely yet. See earlier point on investing. As for your time: volunteer, go on adventures, don't be afraid to fall “off the career track” for a few years, as long as you're not accumulating too much debt. As you age, you'll have less time to learn and more obligation to earn. Seek out mentors and let them treat you to lunch. By your 30s, you should be buying the recent grads lunch (and donating to charities and political campaigns…) But for now, it's ok to focus on you.

Four weeks into quarantine, my dream self boarded an airplane.
I didn’t know exactly where I was, or which school I had just been kicked out of. All I knew was that I had been forced to leave campus because of COVID-19.
I was walking past the flight attendant to board the plane when she began to scream. Her voice echoed through the airport as she waved her arms in anger, foam gathering at the corners of her lips: Nobody else would be allowed on;more passengers would make it impossible to social distance on the flight. I had just made it.
The plane appeared military-cargo grade, with thick netting hanging from the ceiling and ramshackle seating too close together. Rows and rows of angry people, sporadically seated in the half-empty plane, shouted at their seat mates for breathing.
They turned to follow me with their eyes as I passed, unmasked faces twisted in jealousy, some licking their lips. I was wearing a mask; they were not.
Before I slept that night, I told a friend that the first thing I wanted to do when all of this blew over was to travel somewhere. Maybe my hellish dreamscape is a harbinger of what air travel will look like. Maybe not.
As the future becomes less certain, our sleep is becoming increasingly animated by quarantine-related dreamscapes.
Deirdre Leigh Barrett is an expert on dreams during crises. An assistant professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he set up a survey to collect dreams related to the COVID-19 pandemic soon after the United States started to close down. When we spoke over the phone in mid-April, she had collected roughly 5,000 dreams from 2,300 people.
Barrett’s book “Trauma and Dreams” includes dreams she collected from Kuwaitis after the Iraq invasion of 1990 and from Americans after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Many of the dreams feature strong visual elements: In the wake of 9/11, people dreamed of plane crashes, buildings falling down, hijackers with knives, images they had seen on television. But during the COVID-19 crisis, where the “enemy” is invisible, metaphors take over.
“Within the metaphoric dreams, the biggest sub-cluster is dreaming about insects. I’ve seen just about every kind of insect,” she says. “Swarms of flying insects coming at the dreamers, cockroaches running at them, masses of wriggling worms. There was one with a grasshopper with vampire fangs. I think that’s maybe the most common because we use the word bug as slang for having a virus.” Barrett has also seen an uptick in dreams about natural disasters — tidal waves, earthquakes, and fires — which are common among people who have lived through catastrophic events.
Dream collection isn’t confined to scientific work — Erin and Grace Gravely, two sisters from California, have created an impromptu, literary magazine-esque website where people can read other people’s dreams and submit their own.
When you first load idreamofcovid.com, you’re greeted by a cartoonish, black-and-white illustration of the COVID-19 virus itself, hovering before a background of pastel purple clouds and yellow stars like a character from a morbid children’s book. Superimposed over the virus are the words “Tell me your dream.” in a pleasant, Georgia-esque font, below which awaits the submission form. Erin goes through 50 to 100 submissions per day, and Grace illustrates the ones that Erin selects – about ten percent. The final products live on a black-and-white homepage decorated with drawings of inanimate objects.
Erin was partially inspired to create the site by a book she read last year, “The Third Reich of Dreams.” The book — out of print and currently listed for nearly $2000 on Amazon — was published in Germany in 1966 by Charlotte Beradt, a Jewish journalist who had secretly collected about 300 dreams from her friends and neighbors in the years following Hitler’s rise to power. Barrett — the Harvard Medical School professor — also mentioned “The Third Reich of Dreams” during our conversation, citing it as one of the largest historic collections of trauma dreams.
Around the same time that Beradt was collecting dreams, so was Major Kenneth Hopkins. Hopkins was a doctoral student in psychology who was captured and held in a Nazi prisoner of war camp in 1940. He collected the dreams of his fellow inmates, 640 in total, planning to finish his dissertation when he was freed. He was never able to do so, however, because he died of emphysema in the camp in 1942. His dream-filled notebooks sat in the Wellcome Library of London, where Barrett found them in 2011. She and six other authors published a paper analyzing the dreams’ contents in 2013. While many historical archives contain some records of dreams, including individual dream journals, few of them are as extensive as Beradt’s or Hopkins’ work, and even fewer deal with dreams during large-scale trauma.
Some of the dreams collected during times like World War II and the aftermath of 9/11 were clearly related to the trauma people were experiencing at the time — but many others were seemingly random. Today, many of the dreams people are having appear to have nothing to do with COVID-19. The Gravelys have published dreams about goldfish, home invasions, Queen Elizabeth, and apartment showers the size of living rooms.
I don’t normally dream, but since being home in quarantine, I have dreamed almost every night. My dreams are vivid and storylike, often highly emotional. And apparently I’m not alone: lots of other people have reported unusually frequent and striking dreams since the pandemic started.
“last night i had a dream that my family was having a family reunion at this pond and i created a skinny e boy bf for myself who i’ve never seen before,” a friend from home texted me. “i wanted to drink a lot of beer but i was hiding it from my family and i told my bf that once i got drunk we could make out but after that he disappeared.” After I responded, “nice,” she texted back: “i miss him already.”
The dreams I heard about while researching this piece ranged from mundane to fantastical. My blockmate was scratching a lottery ticket on the floor of a train and woke up right before she saw how much money she had won. A friend of a friend dreamed about yelling to his dad about it being “absolutely essential” that they subscribe to the Fiona Apple Streaming Service. A freshman friend dreamed that she attended Humanities 10 on a cruise ship on Lake Michigan and accidentally took Louis Menand’s seat, but someone thought she was Louis Menand because she was wearing a cool blazer.
Barrett theorizes that people who are “normally a little sleep deprived” are catching up on sleep and therefore entering more phases of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep each night. According to Patrick J. McNamara, dreams occur in all phases of sleep but are much more “vivid and story-like” when they take place during REM sleep. McNamara, an associate professor of neurology and a sleep researcher at the Boston University School of Medicine, explains that it’s also much easier for someone to remember a dream when they wake up from REM sleep, which happens more often when waking up naturally rather than from an alarm.
Dreamers and dream collectors alike have noted an uptick in anxiety- and fear-based dreams, some of which are directly related to COVID-19 and many that are not. The Gravelys have been keeping track of dream subject matter by essentially creating word clouds, where words appear larger the more times they come up; the word “anxiety” is the largest of them all. Many of Barrett’s respondents dream about themselves or their family members contracting coronavirus, being watched by colleagues or strangers on Zoom, or being coughed on by crowds not wearing masks.
A friend of mine dreamed that she was running from a man in the woods and finally escaped to a main road, only to realize that he had been following her with a drone and was going to find her. Another friend from home dreamed that she wound up naked at a party. One night I dreamed that I was swimming in a deep, dark ocean, next to a massive sunken structure that was blocking my only way to the surface; I could see the bottom of the structure but not the top, and I woke up as I was watching myself swim frantically upward, soon to run out of air.
“With respect to COVID, what we’re getting is a lot of what we call anxiety dreams,” McNamara says. “The neurobiology of REM is specialized to handle intense emotions... So what you get going on in a REM episode is a disinhibition of emotions. Every emotion you experience is more intense in REM sleep.”
Based on the dreams collected by people like Barrett and the Gravelys, some people are having worse anxiety dreams than others.
“[Health care providers’] dreams look like classic post traumatic nightmares,” Barrett says. “They’re much more literal than the other people’s dreams, and they do have visual images for them. They know what it looks like to watch someone dying on a respirator. And so they dream about being at a hospital taking care of a patient who’s dying and they’re desperately trying to save them and something goes wrong.” One idreamofcovid submission is from a Chicago ER nurse, who dreamedt that they incorrectly tested an immunocompromised patient who died before realizing their mistake. In another from a resident physician in Texas, all of the hospital’s personnel were herded into a large room to be infected with COVID-19 so the struggling hospital could collect the insurance money from their treatment.
***
I sit on the floor between my seats with my seatmate, who I think I might know, until the flight attendant comes back and laughs at us for sitting on the floor. Her laughter is forced, a little too loud to hide what might have been nervousness, and she tells us to prepare for landing. But we don’t land; I watch from outside the plane as we shoot straight up, chased by some entity that barrels through the clouds behind us. Although I am watching from somewhere in the sky outside, I can still feel myself on the plane, can hear everyone on board screaming.
As our pursuer grows nearer, I feel the plane’s engine start to wane. For a moment we hang suspended, vertical and dead in the air, until the entire plane bends in half, fluidly, like a diver reaching an apex, and then starts to plummet.
While we fall, reaching terminal velocity in a dead cargo jet, I start to realize that everything is going to be okay. We begin to slow as we get closer to the ground, our curve leveling like a car at the end of a roller coaster hill. We at last come to a stop in a swampy area, the plane suspended in a pond surrounded by thick trees and the sounds of chirping cicadas. In the middle of a calm water evacuation, where everyone mills about in the waist-deep pond, someone brings out a tea set. The sun is setting over a nearby ridge as we crowd together around the porcelain.

Angela Y. Zhong has been dreaming of a freshman fall in Harvard Yard.
“I’m actually really excited to decorate my dorm,” Zhong said. “And just being away from home, since Harvard is so far from me, and the Northeast is different in culture — that’ll be exciting. I’ll have a lot more freedom to do what I want without that much supervision, which I think is great.”
But amid a public health crisis with no cure or vaccine yet in sight, college life for Zhong and her peers this fall could look very different from a conventional term along the Charles. Zhong’s first college “dorm” could be her bedroom in Houston.
On-campus classes, parties, and performances at the College came to a halt in mid-March after Harvard forced most students to vacate their dorms in Cambridge. Following spring break, professors held courses online for the rest of the semester.
In late April, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced the fall semester will resume on time, though he did not specify whether students would be returning to campus. While they await final word on how the College will operate through the coronavirus pandemic — a decision is expected by July — many students are urging the administration not to pursue a virtual term. University President Lawrence S. Bacow said Harvard’s 12 schools may adopt different responses as they strive to “de-densify” campus while continuing their educational programs.
As the Class of 2020 graduates without the fanfare typical of a grand commencement ceremony, the Class of 2024 looks forward to entering Harvard as the world continues to fight an era-defining virus.
Admitted students’ transition to college has already taken an unprecedented form, as senior traditions like prom face cancellation and the Visitas admitted students weekend moved online. The Class of 2024 will continue to face challenges and uncertainties related to the pandemic, but students say they remain hopeful about the beginning of their college career — whatever form it might take.
As incoming freshmen make the transition from high school to college, they are already burdened with a long list of concerns — making friends, living far from home, finding their passions. This incoming class could face even more worries: how courses will be held, how to connect with other Harvard students, financial security, mental health, and how the ongoing pandemic will affect all of the above.
In the eyes of some incoming freshmen, the pandemic may threaten the very core of what makes Harvard special. Many said they are concerned about maintaining the vitality of interpersonal connections if the educational experience takes a different form.
Amen H. Gashaw, an incoming freshman from Snellville, Ga., said she speculates that class formats may shift and facilitate “a new sense of working with other students” to allow for social distancing on campus. She said she is concerned about a lack of usual resources and obstacles to interaction.
“We might be at a bit of a loss, especially since we won’t have access to the same libraries or really know how to navigate the ropes of communicating with our professors,” Gashaw said. “So, we might have to figure this out on a more solitary basis rather than being able to learn from our peers.”
Students who hope to pursue different concentrations said they anticipate that accommodations for COVID-19 could affect their freshman studies in varying ways.
Caitlin A. Beirne — a matriculant from Long Island, N.Y. — said she plans to pursue Theater, Dance, and Media, a concentration featuring “individualized” and “very interactive” classes she anticipates may be especially difficult to conduct virtually. She said she hopes they are held in person.
“Most stuff in theater is about connection and being able to do a hands-on workshop,” Beirne said. “I think that would be significantly harder than the liberal arts classes that I’ll be taking.”
Alexander J. Chen, who hails from Pleasanton, Calif., said he hopes to concentrate in Neuroscience and pursue biotechnology research — one of the reasons that drew him to Boston. Though concerned that an online start would deprive him of proximity to this “ground zero” for scientific advances, he said the circumstances have reinforced his aspirations.
“COVID-19 has made clear that no matter how far we advance in technology, how good our hospitals are, how many tests we do — if these tests and if no hospitals admit or treat patients equally, without consideration for different socioeconomic statuses and backgrounds, then that’s a huge issue that needs to be solved,” Chen said.
Extracurricular life, too, will almost certainly look different come September.
Beirne said she hopes to participate in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program and has spent the past few weeks watching her brother train virtually through the Army ROTC program at the University of Notre Dame, imagining how it might work for her.
“Watching my brother having to do it online because of quarantine is a little different,” Beirne said. “What he tells me is, when they’re supposed to be in the woods outside, he’s in his bedroom — and the cadre, which are the people in charge, are like, ‘Okay, so pretend you’re in the woods and pretend you just broke your leg.’ So it’s more about explaining as opposed to actually doing.”
Greenville, S.C., admit Jacky Q. Huang said he is concerned about how the coronavirus pandemic could impact his financial situation, especially if undergraduates will be learning from home.
“If I would be at home, that is already an extra mouth to feed,” Huang said, adding that being on campus “would really help with that because, at Harvard, I wouldn’t have to depend on them for food, and I can take up a part-time job on campus to cover personal expenses.”
Huang added that he hopes the Financial Aid Office will accommodate financial concerns related to technology necessary for completing summer requirements related to enrollment.
“I need a laptop to do all the work and, until I have a chance to file for laptop grants, I’m going to be laptop-less for this summer, which is kind of important to almost everything,” Huang explained. “Depending on what happens with social distancing, like if I want to do anything this summer with placement tests or things of that sort, I can’t just go to the library.”
The mental and physical toll of online instruction is also becoming increasingly apparent. A recent Undergraduate Council survey of College students found that nearly half of respondents indicated a decline in physical health, and over 80 percent of respondents reported experiencing worsening emotional health since the shift to remote coursework.
As incoming freshmen continue to await a final decision about the fall, students like David Kwak of Seoul, South Korea, believe physical distance among peers would not be conducive to emotional support.
“If you’re trying to grind through work all by yourself, you do have FaceTime and you do have other resources, but it’s much harder to reach out to people if you’re at home,” Kwak said.
Travel bans, border closures, and suspended immigration services pose a unique problem for international students, some of whom worry they won’t be able to fly to the United States at all.
Ruth H. Jaensubhakij ’22, a student from Singapore who helps direct the First-Year International Program, said her team is thinking about how to best support international students concerned about securing visas.
“How do we abate those anxieties among the Class of 2024?” she said. “And how do we better facilitate information so that they know who to talk to about their visas, that they know where to get that information, what kind of challenges they might face as they're going through that process?”
Many future members of the Class of 2024 said they anticipate that academic and social experiences may change and even decrease in quality due to the pandemic.
“I think it’s important for everyone to be flexible right now,” Chen said. “Having a gap year is an option.”
Regardless of disruptions to campus life, many students remain excited for the coming year. Following a month of Virtual Visitas activities, some incoming freshmen said they are already connecting with their soon-to-be Harvard classmates. In the absence of an on-campus admitted students weekend, some students have made extra efforts to foster friendships online.
Melissa Meng from Blacksburg, Va., said she already feels attached to her College class — so much that the relationships she has built thus far are dissuading her from delaying the start of her college career.
“We’ve been doing a lot of video calls — we actually have a regular Zoom call every two or three days, and I think the last one that we had actually went on for 30 hours,” Meng said. “We also have these mini-traditions in the group chats. For example, our Harvard 2024 chat. We have this daily poll, which is like a ‘would you rather’ that someone initiated.”
The students also created a collaborative spreadsheet with incoming students’ contact and social media information, hometowns, intended concentrations, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality types, and Hogwarts houses from Harry Potter in an effort to help students find others with common interests. Meng added that she has joined calls to share application essays or book and movie recommendations.
FIP and other pre-orientation programs have yet to finalize programming for the Class of 2024, but the Dean of Students Office has announced they “will not proceed as usual.” Michel B. R. Nehme ’22, who also helps run FIP, said the team hopes to keep its “family” group model to facilitate close-knit bonds between leaders and incoming students, regardless of potential restrictions on in-person events.
“We’d have some virtual activities where people are still meeting each other in large groups online. But then, instantly, we can have groups of five to seven — depending on whatever the guidelines are — still form clusters and then try to form relationships within those clusters,” Nehme said. “And I think that most of the activities are still amenable for that. You can have talent shows within your family, for example, you can still go out and walk around with your family.”
Many freshmen interested in extracurricular activities look forward to “comping” — training and vetting procedures required for joining many student organizations at the College — after meeting with groups of interest online.
“One of the organizations that I was thinking of joining was the Undergraduate Council — obviously, I would have to run for that. I did the Virtual Visitas event with them and got to talk with a lot of their current members,” Meng said. “I also really want to join the Asian American Dance Troupe; I attended one of their sessions for Virtual Visitas, and it was a lot of fun learning dances with them.”
Many extracurricular groups are already developing contingency plans for alternate comp requirements or activities, should the fall semester be online.
General Manager of a cappella group The Harvard Krokodiloes Channy Hong ’19-’21 said that a virtual fall semester would considerably alter the group’s traditional recruitment timeline. He added that the singers will adapt and could create a series of virtual performances, recording individual parts and compiling them together to produce a single recording.
“We are definitely, definitely thinking about how we can still further our mission of spreading joy and value of our music, especially throughout this pandemic,” Hong said.

Though he has spent much of his career toiling in research over models and figures, Harvard School of Public Health Epidemiology Professor Marc Lipsitch is no stranger to talking to people about science.
The epidemiologist is a more frequent social media user than many of his peers; between posting brief nuggets of explanation about his latest discoveries and shouting out his colleagues’ work to the general public, by last year, he had amassed a modest Twitter following of around 4,000 users, according to his postdoc, Pamela P. Martinez.
“I've always enjoyed science communication,” Lipsitch said. “I just find it fun, and I also find that I learn a lot.”
But beginning in early March — when an outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic first began to sweep the United States in earnest — Lipsitch’s follower count saw a rapid ascent; now, it sits at around 188,000.
As people scrambled to learn about the little-understood enemy suddenly derailing their lives, Lipsitch — a preeminent scholar on infectious diseases and pandemic response — said he saw an important role he might play. Drawing off experiences in the classroom and the newsroom, he became not just a leading COVID-19 researcher, but also an ambassador for the scientific community, distilling complex concepts down to tweets, op-eds, and sound bites the public could understand.
According to friends and colleagues, Lipsitch’s role as interpreter stems from a longstanding commitment to science communications, expertise in both advising governments and conducting research, and strong ethical imperatives.
“His leadership has really shone through in this particular epidemic...in his ability to corral researchers and epidemiologists around the state, around the country to do all of this [research] while serving as an advisor to governments and international entities,” said epidemiology professor Michael J. Mina. “I think it's just been extraordinary how much of his wisdom he's been willing and able to share and including in the press, of course, and in the media.”
“All of those combined, I think it's only fitting that he has emerged as one of the leading epidemiologists surrounding this epidemic,” Mina added.
Lipsitch said in an interview with The Crimson in early May that he took a “winding path” to reach the field of epidemiology. While he found that he enjoyed learning about plants and animals and modeling their populations in a freshman ecology class at Yale University, he nonetheless wound up as a philosophy major.
“As a college student, I really also liked philosophy and decided I should do the less profitable thing while I was being supported to do my studies,” Lipsitch said. “If I wanted to do biology, maybe I could support myself doing that later.”
Despite his serendipitous focus on philosophy as an undergraduate, Lipsitch continued to explore his interest in ecology and dynamical systems, spending a few summers learning how to combine math and biology at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico.
After winning a Rhodes Scholarship, he said, he planned to obtain a second bachelor’s degree in biology — but again, “sort of by accident,” his plans changed.
“When I got there, I got talked out of it and just told, ‘Why don't you just do a graduate degree?’ which was a little bit odd, since I hadn't done very much as an undergrad,” Lipsitch said. “But I jumped in.”
Five years later, he found himself graduating from University of Oxford with a doctoral degree in zoology. After receiving more theoretical training in zoology and population dynamics, Lipsitch joined a lab run by Bruce R. Levin, an Emory University biology professor. It was in Levin’s lab that Lipsitch began working on evolution and response to vaccines and antibiotics — an area of interest he would sustain throughout his academic career.
During his time at Emory, Lipsitch also worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he first encountered the close relationship between epidemiology and biology.
“I was following in the CDC tradition that biology can inform epidemiology,” Lipsitch said. “I was working in the lab and talking a lot to the epidemiologists — I think that's where I began to realize how complementary those two types of research really are. We can learn a lot about how things work in humans from studying them in animals.”
“What became more clear to me is that going the other direction, and learning about what parts of mechanistic biology are really important by studying the patterns in humans, is equally interesting and equally rewarding,” he added.
Lipsitch’s unconventional path has in turn allowed him to amass a diverse portfolio of research.
In addition to his longstanding interests in the evolutionary biology of bacteria and drug resistance in bacteria, he has also studied methods for analyzing disease data and for informing responses to pandemics. Other areas of interest include disease transmission, immunology, and vaccine development.
His training in philosophy in part precipitated his involvement in science policy discussions. In recent years, for instance, he has become heavily involved in debates over the ethics of gain-of-function experiments — controversial experiments to create more transmissible viruses in labs.
“He has an unbelievable capacity to focus on many projects at the same time — the breadth of his interests and his expertise is enormous,” said Richard Malley, an infectious diseases professor at Boston Children’s Hospital and Lipsitch’s longtime collaborator.
“The areas of concentration that Marc has worked on are so extensive that it’s hard to understand how somebody can be so masterful in so many areas,” Malley added.
Lipsitch said he has found his wide range of research interests and collaborations to be “crucial” to tackling some of the unexpected and unknown challenges posed by COVID-19.
“Having a thriving set of research programs around the country and around the world, in different groups, on a whole range of pathogens and ways of studying them... is really crucial when you face a pandemic,” Lipsitch said. “You don't know what you're going to face, and you don't know which types of approaches are going to be useful, and you don't know which problems are going to pop up that you maybe were studying in a totally different context.”
“It really turns out to be, in my opinion, critical to have this infrastructure that you build up during so-called ‘peacetime,’ and then you draw on during pandemics,” he added.
Thanks to his training, Lipsitch has become well-versed over the years in both battling pandemics as a researcher himself, and on advising governments on how best to do so.
During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, he served on President Barack Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Working Group, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “Team B,” an elite group of academic researchers and outside advisors.
He has also advised the Food and Drug Administration, World Health Organization, and various governments such as Canada and Mexico on infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.
Lipsitch has drawn off this experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, participating in weekly WHO calls with modellers from across the globe and serving on the committee guiding the University’s response to the virus.
At the state level, he is chairing a committee to advise Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 on creating a “data driven policy” for the state, according to Mina.
He has also received requests for advice on coronavirus response from governments across the world, including Canada and Israel.
“I got a call from the Prime Minister of Israel who just wanted to talk about what they were doing,” Lipsitch said. “That's a level of advice that I've never been asked to do before and has been really interesting.”
Lipsitch himself has taken on a number of projects related to the virus. With his colleagues and trainees, he has investigated the design of vaccine trials for the novel coronavirus, antibody response to vaccines or prior infection, and the virus’s seasonality.
“It’s an absolute map or sort of guide book for future research in the things we're going to be doing going through the pandemic. It has enormous, enormous implications,” epidemiology professor William P. Hanage said of Lipsitch’s work on seasonality.
Much of Lipsitch’s research has been made possible by the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, a School of Public Health research center he founded in 2009.
The CCDD is unique among similar centers, Lipsitch said, because its affiliates boast an unparalleled diversity of fields and areas of expertise. Members work collaboratively in disciplines ranging from machine learning to evolutionary biology; all, however, specialize in infectious diseases, including pandemic response.
“I really am just more reinforced in this idea that you have to have well supported generalists who integrate different types of data and really go after problems,” Lipsitch said. “That's the kind of people who can address the pandemic.”
His colleagues at CCDD, including immunology and infectious diseases professor Yonatan H. Grad and Hanage, said Lipsitch’s work during the pandemic has been “prolific.”
“I've been astonished by how prolific and seemingly indefatigable he is,” Grad said. “He has maintained a pretty incredible pace of productivity on both the academic front and also on the science communication front.”
“I think he must have cloned himself in his lab, and there are actually several Marc Lipsitchs running around,” Hanage added.
While Lipsitch said it has been “really enjoyable” to communicate more with the public during the pandemic, he also pointed out that “providing science-based advice to the public” is typically a government function.
“It has been incredibly time consuming and, frankly, is something that would be less necessary if the federal government was more visibly out front on providing science-based advice to the public,” Lipsitch said.
But in the face of a lack of adequate federal communications, Lipsitch said he feels it is scientists’ duty to take up the role of public communicator, interpreting the information they learn as the public health crisis continues.
“I think it's been obligatory for people in the academic sector and others to try to provide that voice of… ‘what do we know?’ and ‘what do we not know?’” Lipsitch said.
In the early stages of the pandemic, Lipsitch said he made the conscious decision to dedicate significant amounts of his time to both research and to scientific communication. During the pandemic, he has penned several opinion pieces in the New York Times and scientific journals explaining some of the more complicated aspects of the virus to the general public.
He has also taken to social media to dispel falsehoods and misconceptions surrounding the novel coronavirus while also sharing a selection of findings from scientists across the world with his followers.
In fact, Lipsitch’s vested interest in scientific communication stretches back to his time as a graduate student. For instance, in the mid-1990s, he penned two articles for the New York Times — one explaining a pregnancy-related scientific discovery, and another analyzing the fear behind bacterial antibiotic resistance.
“There are a million things I could do that a lot of other people could do better than I can or as well as I can,” Lipsitch said. “There are a few things that I both enjoy more than most people and I'll probably do as good a job as anyone would. Science communication is one of those.”
He said scientific communication was a skill one of his Ph.D. advisors, the late Robert M. May, greatly emphasized.
“I very strongly remember him saying, ‘If the freakin’ person can't explain it, it's their fault. They don't understand it,’” Lipsitch said.
Levin, his postdoctoral advisor, said the ability to communicate ideas simply has gained Lipsitch more public influence than many other academics.
“Scientists can sometimes be so removed that nobody understands what they're getting at even when they're right — or, for that matter, when they're wrong,” Levin said. “We can all get into our precious academic holes and stay there, and influence nobody, but that's not been the case for Marc.”
Those around Lipsitch say one of his defining traits is a willingness to respect and promote the careers, views, and voices of colleagues and trainees alike.
“Really good mentors often treat their trainees as colleagues,” said Sarah Cobey, a University of Chicago ecology and evolution professor and former postdoctoral fellow of Lipsitch. “He absolutely did.”
When mentoring students and when teaching classes, Lipsitch said he prefers an active approach, involving a lot of time at the whiteboard — or, since the pandemic struck, in front of a tablet.
Some of his trainees said he can often be found at the whiteboard during lab meetings, working through mathematical equations and trying to solve problems on the spot.
“He actually engages in the details of the research,” postdoctoral fellow Martinez said. “He will stand up with me in front of the whiteboard and say, ‘Okay, let's try to figure out how to fix this part that you are stuck on.’”
For former Ph.D. student Matt D. Hitchings, Lipsitch’s support significantly “altered the path” of his career. At the beginning of his time in graduate school, Hitchings had been interested in working with Doctors Without Borders, but was having trouble reaching the right people in the organization. Lipsitch — who had co-authored a paper with the director of the organization’s epidemiology department — helped Hitchings establish contact.
“He barely knew me at that point, but he gave me a good recommendation,” Hitchings said. “That turned into two internships in consecutive summers, and I'm still working with them to this day, six years later.”
Fourth-year graduate student Christine R. Tedijanto, who currently works with Lipsitch, emphasized the encouragement he provides as an advisor and mentor.
“He really believes in your work and advocates for you to step up and push that work beyond even what I think it can be,” Tedijanto said. “He doesn't think that just because you're a student, you can't do great science.”
Known to take his lab on bowling excursions and encourage a lighthearted working environment, many of Lipsitch’s trainees and colleagues said he cares about them beyond their scientific contributions to his lab.
“He created an environment that not only prioritized the highest quality science and trying to identify and answer important questions that contribute to science and public health, but also doing so in a community that prized integrity and generosity and kindness,” said Grad, who worked with Lipsitch as a former postdoctoral fellow before joining CCDD as a faculty member.
Grad added that among Lipsitch’s many “impressive traits,” the predominant one is simply being “a good person.”
“I think that's the key thing about Marc. Not only does he do work at the vanguard in the field, actually at the vanguard of several fields, but he is someone we all trust and like and admire.” Grad said. “Really an exceptional human being.”
Similarly, asked to describe his former mentee in a nutshell, Levin said Lipsitch fully embodies the word “mensch,” a Yiddish term for a person of integrity
“He's a kind and compassionate and caring person beyond science,” Levin said.

The duo garnered millions of views on social media, partook in an interview with NBC, and won messages of support from the likes of prominent U.S. senators, sports stars, and other media personalities. For a Harvard Undergraduate Council election, the attention directed towards James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 was unprecedented, helping propel them to a narrow yet resounding victory.
Mathew and White-Thorpe’s message was one of transformational change, seeking to catapult the student government to action on issues of diversity, inclusion, and belonging.
“We gotta do something different, something that no one’s expecting when they think of student government,” Mathew said in January on NBC’s “The Kelly Clarkson Show.”
The video that had launched the new president and vice-president into the national spotlight — gaining 5.3 million views and counting — was intentionally designed to reflect their intended mode of collaborative governance, according to White-Thorpe.
“I mean there’s a reason why James and I did not speak, or rap, or sing, or anything in that video,” she said. “It was about extending our platform so that we can collaborate with others and lift everyone’s voice.”
Yet in the nearly five months since the duo took office, many Council members say Mathew and White-Thorpe’s aspirational goals have failed to come to fruition, partly due to problems of their own making.
And in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic that forced students to leave campus, these representatives say Mathew and White-Thrope failed to fulfill the needed role of conveying student concerns about grading, mental health, and other issues to administrators.
Mathew and White-Thorpe did not respond to multiple requests for comment about criticism of their leadership.
In the aftermath of the transition to virtual instruction, students and administrators debated how to ensure equitability in the College’s grading policy.
While some students advocated for grading to remain as it was, others advocated for one of various models, including opt-in pass-fail, “universal pass,” and a so-called “Double A” model ensuring a grade of A or A- for all courses.
As students continued to discuss the best way forward and consider how to lobby administrators, Mathew and White-Thorpe informed the student body they were endorsing the Double A model using the UC’s official email address. The duo did not consult the Council as a whole or wait for responses to a survey asking undergraduates their views on the issue, according to multiple UC members.
“We’ve done so as two concerned students within a larger group of dedicated organizers, consisting mainly of individuals outside of the UC,” Mathew and White-Thorpe wrote in their email endorsing Double A.
Although some representatives such as Chair of the Academic Life Committee Fernando Urbina ’22 were aware of Mathew and White-Thorpe’s email before it arrived in students’ inboxes, most other members were not notified of the email’s existence.
Urbina acknowledged in an interview that he, Mathew, and White-Thorpe should have been more forthcoming with the Council on their thought process. Yet he argued that because of the uncertainty related to grading policy, UC leadership had to act quickly.
“And I mean, I believe it is true that we did begin to work on the ‘Double A’ model before we totally talked to the Council,” Urbina said. “I definitely think we potentially should have released a survey to the student body and have the Council more in the loop the full time.”
Three days later, the Council met virtually for the first time since leaving campus in an “emergency session,” allowing undergraduates to share their views with the UC. More than 200 representatives and constituents participated in the meeting.
But rather than follow Mathew and White-Thorpe’s lead, the UC rejected a Double A grading model, choosing instead to endorse a universal pass system.
UC secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 said the differing endorsements of UC leaders and the Council as a whole compromised the body’s advocacy efforts.
“When the whole Council comes together and comes to a different decision, it definitely does send a poor message and that there was a disconnect between the President, Vice President and the rest of the Council, because ultimately, we should all come to a decision together in the hopes of representing the student body, the best that we can,” Brennan said.
Days after the Council’s emergency session, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh announced the College would adopt a universal emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading model due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Although Gay’s announcement indicated administrators considered input from the UC in its decision, some representatives questioned the efficacy and relevance of the Council’s advocacy, given that the UC was still debating grading models the day before the switch to Satisfactory-Unsatisfactory.
“For all we know, they had made the decision before we even sent out the survey,” said UC Treasurer Noah Harris ’22. “We’re out here trying to sell students on ‘we’re able to represent you, we’re meeting with the administration, we're making your voices heard.’ But at the same time, the administration is not looping us in on any type of decision or even giving us any type of clue.”
Both current and former Council representatives said it is not entirely new for a gap to exist between the administration and the Council. Harris said he wants to build a better relationship with administrators.
“I would prefer us to have more of a working relationship where they actually tell us what's going on and trust us to just take that information as well as possible and try and help students with it,” Harris said.
But according to multiple Council members, Mathew and White-Thorpe have yet to bridge that gap during their time in office.
Several Council members drew contrasts between Mathew and White-Thorpe’s approach and that of their predecessors, former President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and former Vice President Julia A. Huesa ’20. While Palaniappan and Huesa often asked the Council about topics that representatives wanted them to discuss in meetings with administrators, multiple representatives said they have not seen the same engagement from Mathew and White-Thorpe.
Under the Council’s new communication guidelines, representatives need approval from Mathew or White-Thorpe to work with administrators on projects. That requirement provoked a brief flare-up when two representatives sought to bypass the policy.
After the release of a student experience survey commissioned by the Council, Chair of the First-Year Class Committee Jenny Y. Gan ’22 and Lowell House Representative Oliver S. York ’21, the coordinators of the survey, scheduled a May 20 meeting with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to speak about the results. They did so without Mathew and White-Thorpe’s approval.
When the UC leaders discovered the existence of the meeting, they pushed back against their exclusion, arguing they deserved to be in the room given their roles.
On May 19, Gan sent a text message to Mathew and White-Thorpe saying she would keep the meeting with Khurana limited to York and herself in response to White-Thorpe’s request she allow her and Mathew to participate.
Mathew and White-Thorpe did not dismiss the possibility of going around Gan and York to obtain access to the virtual meeting, but Gan and York finally acceded to their demands before that was necessary.
“If you would prefer not to send us the link, we have no problem simply reaching out to Dean Khurana’s office,” White-Thorpe wrote.
In a May 23 message sent in the Council’s Slack channel, York questioned Mathew and White-Thorpe’s involvement with the UC’s Student Experience Survey.
“Where have James and Ify been during this process?” York wrote in the Slack message, which followed Mathew and White-Thorpe’s email to the student body about survey results on Saturday morning.
Past Council presidents and vice-presidents said discontent within the UC and about the body from undergraduates was far from unprecedented, perhaps most strikingly in 2014, when Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 won the presidency promising more tomato basil ravioli soup and thicker toilet paper.
General dissatisfaction with the body came to the forefront again during the most recent presidential election, when Aditya A. Dhar ’21 and Andrew W. Liang ’21 received the most first-choice votes running on a platform of abolishing the UC. Because of the Council’s ranked choice voting system, though, the pair ultimately lost to Mathew and White-Thorpe.
Dhar and Liang said in a May interview that in addition to the over one thousand first-place votes they received from ordinary students, multiple UC members expressed support for their candidacy.
Dhar and Liang said that despite losing, there was an unexpected efficacy behind their campaign message. Both attribute their popularity and what they perceive as low turnout in recent elections — averaging roughly 50 percent— to the UC’s perceived inability to communicate progress on its initiatives to students.
“The reason that there is generally low turnout is because, in all honesty, an important and small subset of people are affected by the policies that the UC needs to pass,” Dhar said. “And so the consequence is that the vast majority of students don't really feel the day-to-day impact of the UC.”
Former UC president Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said she was disappointed to hear that such negative sentiments ran so deep among students.
“I think hearing about that campaign makes me sad, to be honest,” Zhang said. “I will say that with any student government—there's always going to be push back on it.”
Former UC vice president Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said the Council’s popularity among students often fluctuates.
“I think you’ll see these ebbs and flows of people taking the Council very seriously and people not taking the Council seriously, and it kind of swings in this, you know, back and forth motion, and people handle it different ways,” Boucher said.
But many long-time representatives argued that the current leadership has exhibited particularly poor communication and engagement both within the Council, as well as with students and administrators.
For instance, many say the switch to a more compressed Council meeting schedule has hampered efforts to thoughtfully craft and consider legislation.
The Council’s executive board, which includes the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, and committee chairs, meets weekly to discuss legislation for the upcoming general meeting.
In these meetings, the executive board compiles the week’s legislation from the committees — which is later presented at the general meeting to the entire Council — into an agenda.
Previously, executive meetings took place Fridays, two days before general Council meetings. Under Mathew and White-Thorpe’s tenure, that meeting has occurred just an hour before the general meeting. Multiple representatives said the shorter time period between executive and general meetings prevented general meetings from running smoothly, in part because representatives sometimes have felt unprepared to vote on legislation.
“So, because it is an hour before general meeting, it means that some legislation that might need to be written during that executive meeting has had to be rushed and, like, has had to be put in as a new business in the general meetings,” UC Head of Communications Yousuf Bakshi ’23 said. “There's just not enough time to consolidate everything before the general meeting.”
Given several instances of breakdowns in communication between council members, many on the UC contend that Mathew and White-Thorpe should take a more active role as executive leaders.
Social and Residential Life Committee Chair Jack M. Swanson ’22 said the UC's response this semester “obviously could have been improved in a number of ways.”
“The biggest issue with the response was not so much the ideas that we had or the effort that we put forth on the part of individual members, but we didn’t have a strong leadership to guide all of the efforts that we had,” Swanson said.
Others urged a more generous view of Mathew and White-Thorpe’s perceived communication issues, given that the coronavirus upheaval occurred just a month after the first general meeting which they presided over.
“I would say they’re still learning, that’s how I would describe it,” Chair of the Finance Committee Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 said.
For some UC representatives, the Mathew and White-Thorpe administration has provided them with the freedom to launch their own initiatives. While a few council members have welcomed this independence, others expressed a desire for more top-down guidance.
“It seems to me that in the absence of leadership, a lot of committee chairs have had to step up and sort of guide the discussion and bring our ideas to the fore,” Swanson said.

At the close of Fiscal Year 2019, Harvard’s endowment was valued at $40.9 billion, the largest sum in its history. Though administrators fretted about low returns compared to other Ivy League schools and the prospect of a future recession, they basked in their record-setting financial achievement.
Then came the coronavirus pandemic.
Facing a teetering global economy and the threat of a lethal virus, Harvard has invoked austerity measures including salary and hiring freezes and the possibility of furloughs and layoffs, leaving some workers with an uncertain future.
To address these labor concerns, Harvard College Students for Bernie launched its #40BillionForWhat effort.
“Forty billion for what, Harvard?” the campaign statement reads. “What is the point of our University’s hoarded wealth, if not to ensure the well-being and safety of its community during a time of fear, uncertainty, and instability?”
The campaign echoed calls before the pandemic from activists who urged the University to use its endowment to advance social good.
Oya Gursoy ’21— a member of Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, one of a number of campus divestment movements — said that the pandemic has made the “facade” of the endowment visible.
“If you can't use the endowment during a pandemic, then when can we, in fact, use it? Then what is the endowment for?” Gursoy asked. “If it's not going to be used during a pandemic to support faculty and students and workers, then when is it going to be used?”
The University has said the value of the endowment has likely declined due to the impact of the pandemic on the global markets. Administrators also contend that much of the endowment is made up of restricted assets — which cannot be used for purposes other than those stipulated with the donation — and that the endowment must be preserved for posterity.
So far, Gursoy and other activists have remained unsatisfied with this response.
At the heart of the debate are contrasting perspectives on what the endowment truly is, and who it exists to serve. How the endowment is utilized will play a critical role in shaping the University’s response to the pandemic, and the implications of that decision will influence how affiliates perceive the endowment in the future.
The endowment dates back to 1638, starting with John Harvard’s gift of 400 books and half his estate that made him the University’s namesake, according to University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
Other accounts trace it back to 1649, when four alumni donated a parcel of real estate — “a once upon a time cowyard” — to the College. Today, Widener Library occupies that land. In 1669, a number of lumber merchants pledged to donate 60 pounds to Harvard for each of the next seven years, a commitment they sometimes fulfilled with lumber products.
“This development has been assembled really over hundreds of years, literally hundreds,” Bacow said. “Having been assembled over centuries, we can't just spend it all at once.”
Today, the endowment retains real estate and natural resources as asset classes, but few other relics of the time period exist in the University’s financial strategy. And though funds may have been accumulating for centuries, rapid growth is a much more recent development.
From the 1640s to the mid-20th century, the endowment was managed conservatively and made up of fixed-income investments. When Harvard Management Company was founded in 1974, it was valued at $1.1 billion.
In a video to mark the 40th anniversary of HMC in 2014, Walter M. Cabot ’55 — its first CEO — explained the rationale behind the move to internal management.
“The Corporation, with the endowment up close to $1 billion, wanted more internal control,” Cabot said. “They wanted more to be a part of the governance of the portfolio.”
Former University President Derek C. Bok said the shift was the brainchild of George F. Bennett ’33, a former Treasurer of the University.
Bennett formerly served as the president of State Street Bank, which managed the endowment before the founding of HMC. Upon his retirement, Bennett proposed that the University found an outside company to manage the endowment, as the crucial endeavor of managing Harvard’s funds had become “too big a job.”
Along with the change in management came changes to the endowment’s contents.
Before the founding of HMC, the endowment funds were split between bonds, cash, and shares of major companies with reliable returns, known as “blue chip common stocks.”
Under Cabot, HMC broadened its focus. Its managers shifted assets from a domestic portfolio to a global portfolio, transitioned from public securities to private securities, and established a trade desk to invest in bonds.
“The key to investing is a long term vision, and as long as we could recruit good people and the returns were satisfactory, in the long run, it was both good for the University and cheaper, because we could run the money at a lot cheaper rate than what pension funds charged,” Cabot said.
Under HMC, the value of the endowment at first grew slowly. In 1984, a decade after its founding, it had doubled, to $2.5 billion. By 1994, it doubled again, to $6 billion. And by 2004, it almost quadrupled, to $22.6 billion.
Though its growth was at times inconsistent, the endowment had ballooned to $36.9 billion in 2008. Then the Great Recession hit, slashing its value by a third. It didn’t recover until 2015, and it didn’t stick — in 2016, its value dropped back below its 2008 value.
Since then, 2017, 2018, and 2019 saw consistent low levels of growth, and the endowment stood at $40.9 billion in June 2019.
The coronavirus pandemic has almost certainly ended that trend. In April, Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister told The Crimson the endowment had likely declined “substantially” and cited an estimate that put the value in the “mid-30 billion range.”
As a looming economic downturn became more and more evident, the University has hesitated to depend on endowment funds. Instead, in April, top administrators announced a salary and hiring freeze, the cancellation or deferral of all discretionary spending, and cuts to their own salaries.
To administrators, the endowment is not intended to cover all unexpected expenses, no matter the circumstance. When constructing its annual budget, Harvard often plans to cover roughly a third of its expenses with a five percent endowment payout, leaving the majority of the endowment to generate returns for posterity.
“We have a legal and moral responsibility to maintain the purchasing power of that endowment, so that it sustains future generations,” Bacow said. “There's issues of intergenerational equity that need to be considered.”
Bacow and Hollister both cited the fact that Harvard has experienced financial hardship in the past — like the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918, the Great Depression, and World War II, as well as several other recessions.
“Prior generations have had to make hard choices to scale their expenditures in proportion to their revenues, and by making those hard choices they have passed onto future generations the resources which allow them to be supported by the endowment,” Bacow said. “It's our responsibility also to make hard choices. We can't just say that we are exempt from having to do this.”
In her 2008 Commencement Address, former University President Drew G. Faust acknowledged the endowment’s longevity.
“Our endowment represents an accountability that generation after generation of Harvard graduates have voluntarily assumed, acknowledging the value of their own past education and investing in the future of learning,” she said at the time.
Administrators also point to legal restrictions on the endowment — which is made up of over 13,000 individual funds — that prevent administrators from distributing money at will.
“The vast majority of the endowment is highly restricted, and we cannot redirect funds that are restricted for one purpose to be used for another,” Bacow said. “Legally, we cannot do that. So, our ability to dip into the endowment is limited.”
In a 2016 letter to Congress, Faust explained that just 16 percent of the funds are considered “unrestricted,” though that figure includes funds dedicated to a specific school. Around 80 percent of endowment funds today are dedicated to individual schools.
Bok noted that many of Harvard’s top donors give to a particular cause or initiative that they want the University to pursue. Common restrictions are funds dedicated to professorships and faculty salaries, financial aid, research, specific initiatives, and support for libraries and museums.
Sandy Baum, a senior fellow for the Center on Education Data and Policy at the Urban Institute, said the coronavirus pandemic challenges the assumption that the endowment should not be overspent in the present day.
“If you spend too much of it now, then you won't be able to provide in the future the same quality of education for generations of students to come,” Baum said. “On the other hand, if right now we're in a crisis, and you're not able to provide opportunities to students today like the ones that you want to be able to provide in the future when we're not in a crisis, then you need to think about spending a little bit more today.”
Bacow conceded that within the limited flexibility that they have, administrators will use the endowment “more heavily” than they might have if the coronavirus pandemic had not occurred.
“We will use the endowment more heavily than we have in the past precisely because of the circumstances that we find ourselves,” Bacow said.
The University’s response has left few student activists satisfied.
“They're sort of like, 'Can't we just save the world? We have all this money, let's save the world,’” Baum said.
Baum noted that even given its limitations, the University has access to an undeniably large sum of money. Compared to its peers in higher education, Harvard boasts the largest total endowment in the world.
“They don't have $40 billion that they could use,” she said. “But they do have more resources than certainly most businesses that are trying to figure out how to survive now.”
Thomas D. Parker ’64, a senior fellow at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, said the school still lacks enough money to avoid all consequences of the pandemic.
“I think Harvard can use some of its wealth to try to mitigate the effects of the current crisis,” Parker said. “But it's clear that there's simply not enough money there just to continue business as usual. The arithmetic doesn't work out.”
Another key factor to contextualize the endowment’s value is the annual operating expenses of the University in a normal year. Parker said the endowment would typically constitute “about seven or eight years” of operating expenses, which totalled $5.2 billion in FY19.
But these are not normal times, and the pandemic has led to unexpected expenses and cuts.
Labor activists in Harvard College Students for Bernie and other groups have sought to ensure that the brunt of the financial downturn does not fall on Harvard’s workers. They have called on Harvard to use the endowment to provide their employees with pay while they are unable to work, contract extensions for those who need them, and sufficient paid sick leave.
Ruy Martinez ’22, a member of Harvard for Bernie, said workers’ compensation should be prioritized equally to the needs of faculty and students.
“They are as vital to the Harvard community as professors and students,” Martinez wrote.
Even before the coronavirus pandemic, Harvard’s Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers frequently invoked the endowment in their calls for fair pay. During their month-long strike in December 2019, union demonstrators often chanted, “Harvard, pay your worker scholars! You have 40 billion dollars!”
Olivia Crough, a graduate student and union member, wrote that their demands were not aimed at “liquidating the principal of the endowment.”
“We are asking for endowment growth to be slowed to match inflation and for a higher percentage of returns to be allocated toward fairly compensating the work of graduate students and adjunct faculty,” Crough wrote. “This would not only maintain but advance the endowment’s core mission.”
Crough wrote that she has not been convinced by administrators’ explanation that the endowment must grow for the future.
“The administration leans on platitudes like ‘intergenerational equity’ to justify the cuts it chooses to make,” she wrote.
While a number of students and faculty activists urged Harvard to aid its workers by engaging its endowment, some conservative politicians demanded Harvard not receive federal aid because of its wealth.
The federal government allocated $8.6 million to the University under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which included a Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund.
The allocation triggered uproar from Republican politicians, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and President Donald J. Trump. Almost all of them cited the size of the endowment as a reason Harvard should not receive federal funds.
“Well, look, I don’t like when Harvard that has, I think, a $40 billion dollar endowment, or some incredible amount of money, that Harvard gets this money?,” Trump said at a press conference. “Harvard should pay this money back. I want Harvard to pay that money back.”
In reality, Harvard had not yet applied for or received the funds which it was allocated. Though at first a spokesperson for Harvard said the University would dedicate 100 percent of the funds to student aid, they later announced that they would not take the funds at all — a move that Trump lauded.
Bacow attributed the decision not to take the funds to “unattractive” restrictions placed on them.
“We were not allowed to use the money to support our international students, and we are not allowed to use the money to support our undocumented students,” Bacow said. “We thought that, among other things, that if we took the money, we would have to dip into other resources to treat our international students, and undocumented students on an equal basis to all others who would be eligible to receive those funds.”
Baum attributed the controversy over the CARES Act funds to conservative animosity towards colleges and universities.
“The Republicans in particular feel like these are liberal bastions of indoctrination,” Baum said. “They actually are looking for any opportunity they can get to sort of stick it at these places.”
This was not the first time Republicans targeted higher education endowments. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 levies a 1.4 percent excise tax on the endowments of private colleges and universities with at least 500 students and endowment assets that total over $500,000 per student. The tax was estimated to cost Harvard $40 to $50 million.
At the time of its passage, the Cato Institute’s Neal McCluskey wrote that the tax was “little more than a politicized ‘Take That, Harvard!’”
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers said he sees the endowment tax as a politically-motivated “act of revenge.”
"I both think it was motivated in a fake way, and I think it doesn't correspond to any principled kind of tax policy,” Summers said.
Mae C. Quinn, a professor at the University of Florida, said labelling the endowment tax and the controversy over the CARES Act funds as part of the conservative political agenda is a scapegoat for universities like Harvard to avoid engaging with genuine concern about their level of wealth.
The idea of an endowment tax had liberals supporters, too, like former Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jay Gonzalez, who wanted Harvard to pay $500 million in taxes.
“Folks are concerned about universities being able to stockpile this money, and not utilizing it in ways that could advance the public good,” Quinn said.
Joshua Humphreys, a senior fellow at the Croatan Institute and former Harvard lecturer, wrote that large endowments are a symptom of an “academic arms race.”
"It [is] not clear why an institution of higher learning continues to strive to increase the size of the endowment, rather than to use it in different ways to maintain stability of mission and to reinvest in the university,” he wrote.
Harvard administrators maintain that a growing endowment is vital to its mission.
In her letter to Congress in 2016, Faust explained that tuition and grants do not cover the full cost of education and research, respectively.
“Increasingly, endowments play a significant role in bridging these gaps and making it possible for Harvard to pursue its mission,” she wrote.
Without an endowment, Harvard would likely experience greater year-to-year financial instability and have less autonomy, since it would be more beholden to donors, Parker said.
“In terms of private universities, it's pretty difficult to think of being truly great without having a substantial amount of money in the bank,” Parker said.
Jay Mathews ’67 — an education columnist for the Washington Post and a former editor of The Crimson — wrote that he does not think that endowment size correlates to a university’s greatness.
“I don't think it says anything important about the quality of the school,” Mathews wrote in an email. Still, he conceded there are benefits to the school’s endowment, which has grown from less than $1 billion in his time at Harvard to $40 billion today.
“I think it gives the school great room to be creative and innovative, and in some ways it has done that,” Mathews wrote. “It supports some important research.”
Mathews noted that as the size of the endowment grew, so too did its prominence in campus conversation.
Today, it’s a frequent topic of debate. There are at least four divestment groups on campus: Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, Harvard Puerto Rican Debt Divestment Campaign, and Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine. All four recently formed the Endowment Justice Coalition, with the sole focus of pushing “for a new vision of Harvard’s obligations as a moral actor.”
Gursoy said that because it is an educational institution, Harvard should focus on social good, “rather than adding more zeros to the endowment.”
Bacow has previously said that the endowment should not be used “as an instrument of social policy.”
“I think there are far more effective ways for us to influence social policy, public policy, as well, through our research, our scholarship, through our actions and through our teaching,” he said in 2018.
Likewise, Parker said he believes that if the University wants to continue to grow, “in terms of its ability to address important issues of the day,” it will need its endowment funds.
“Those issues are not going to diminish over time, and there's no reason you should think that you would need less money to address those issues over time, and not more,” he said.
“I think that across the ideological spectrum there's a tendency to to overestimate the way in which the endowment can be a kind of all purpose rescue fund. It really can't,” Parker added. “People misunderstand — both on the left and right — the availability and the extent that the endowment can be a kind of deus ex machina, which comes in at the end of the day and saves everybody.”
As the pandemic alters almost every aspect of life on campus, the calls for Harvard to reconsider its traditional approach to the endowment have grown louder: if not now, when? How the University chooses to answer this question in the midst of a crisis remains to be seen, and might set a precedent for decades to come.

After the novel coronavirus pandemic upended Harvard’s operations this spring, the University faces a host of unprecedented challenges, trying to prevent a public health crisis on its campus, vastly altering its academic systems, and recouping financial hits.
But each of those issues affects not only Harvard’s students, faculty, and administrators, but also its waged employees, from lab workers and teaching fellows to custodians and faculty assistants. And on top of the troubles, Harvard must also navigate an unusual task: Over the course of this year, it is scheduled to negotiate five separate contracts with five of its labor unions.
The University’s contracts with four of those unions — Service Employees International Union, Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards’ Union, Harvard University Police Association, and the Area Trades Council — will expire later this year, forcing Harvard to renegotiate the agreements nearly simultaneously. The University’s contract with HUSPMGU is set to expire June 30, while contracts with SEIU and HUPA will expire in November, and ATC’s contract will end in December.
On top of those negotiations, Harvard and its graduate student union are still trying to reach their first contract, more than a year after the union first formed.
After months of stalemate, the student union and the University are beginning to approach a consensus. Bargaining committee member Lee Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in an update to union members May 23 that Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers is currently negotiating a one-year contract that would go into effect July 1.
According to some experts — like former National Labor Relations Board chair William B. Gould IV — such a bulk of negotiations on the horizon will present a challenge for Harvard.
“Bargaining is never easy. When you’re dealing with a lot of different unions at different bargaining tables, that’s — as a general proposition, having nothing to do with Harvard — a recipe for instability,” Gould said.
When Harvard and the unions come to the bargaining table — virtually or otherwise — this year, the global pandemic will likely cast their negotiations over health and safety in a new light.
The sides will likely consider entirely new types of contract provisions, according to Gould.
“Anything involving health and safety is vital to both employees and employers,” Gould said. “They’re going to be important and they’re going to be complex.”
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in late April that Harvard will be open for fall 2020 in some capacity. The University’s various schools must decide by July what the format of that semester will look like, weighing whether and how students will move back to campus and if classes and student organizations will meet in person or online.
Such considerations raise questions about safety measures for the University’s workers who may return to campus in the fall. Over the course of the spring semester, Harvard workers expressed concerns about public health risks they faced working on campus day in and day out.
In early April, Harvard’s custodians reported a lack of proper protective equipment; days later, Quincy House dining staff stopped working after two of their co-workers tested positive for COVID-19.
Former chair of the National Labor Relations Board Wilma B. Liebman predicts that reopening campus would give rise to a “whole host of issues” that unions have never before had to consider in contract negotiation, such testing, social distancing measures, protective gear, and job sharing plans.
32BJ — a regional branch of SEIU that represents the Harvard Arboretum’s employees, security guards, and custodians — has two contracts set to expire in November: one with the University for custodians, and one with a contractor, Securitas, for security guards.
In the initial phase of the pandemic, the main concerns for custodians were finding adequate access to protective gear and maintaining proper social distancing measures, 32BJ Vice President Roxana Rivera said.
“The issue when the pandemic first hit was the issue of safety of our members,” Rivera said. “So we engaged with the University just in regards to the issue of people having personal protective equipment as well as that there were social distancing protocols in place.”
HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Cory W. McCartan, meanwhile, said he fears that student research workers may face unsafe working conditions once Harvard’s labs reopen. HGSU-UAW has encouraged the University to develop a new system for workers to anonymously report health and safety concerns in labs.
“Harvard has talked about the approach they’re going to take to ensure safety and some of those occurred, but there’s still problems as long as you have people in enclosed space, sharing the same space,” McCartan said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment for this story.
The pandemic poses not only a public health crisis for the University, but also a financial one: a circumstance which union leaders fear could put workers’ employment in jeopardy.
Facing an estimated shortfall of $415 million this fiscal year, the University instituted hiring and salary freezes in mid-April.
In light of the financial woes, administrators told staff and faculty in that same announcement that Harvard was considering furloughing and laying off some workers. The University has yet to announce definitively whether it will take the measure; but by now, many employees say they feel anxious and uncertain about the prospects of their continued employment at Harvard.
According to Carrie Barbash, who serves as president of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, many HUCTW members feel that as the University decides how to resume campus operations following the summer, their livelihood hangs in the balance.
“The thing that I would say we're most still concerned about is the potential of layoffs or furloughs,” Barbash said in early May. “We'd like to find a way to avoid that altogether.”
Though securing their new contract by November 15 is an important goal for 32BJ, Rivera said, potential job losses form an even more pressing concern.
“The most concerning thing we are dealing with right now is that Harvard has now announced that they are considering furloughs, unpaid furloughs,” Rivera said. “It's a huge hardship for folks to face unpaid layoffs by the University.”
In March, the University decided to finish the semester with remote instruction, sending most students off campus after spring break. While Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in April that FAS has yet to decide whether the fall 2020 semester will look the same as spring, University faculty have nonetheless been preparing to potentially teach classes online.
Liebman said she believes compensation will become an even more critical provision in contract negotiations — especially for those who typically work on campus — if Harvard decides to deliver instruction remotely next semester.
“I can’t imagine that that’s not going to become an issue for those unions, to get some kind of economic security for their members,” Liebman said.
After Harvard announced it would guarantee pay and benefits to employees who were able to work but unable to report to campus due to the pandemic, 32BJ president Rivera said the union’s priorities shifted to guaranteeing the same protections for contracted workers — employees that are not employed full-time with the University but through a third-party contractor.
“We also had to advocate with the University that that policy cover the contracted workers because initially when they announced the stay-at-home policy with pay, it did not include the contracted workers on campus,” she said.
The most recent University policy extended those protections to all employees through June 28.
HGSU-UAW, meanwhile, recently reached agreements with the University regarding compensation, including a 2.8 percent raise for salaried student workers next year and a $16 to $17 minimum hourly pay rate, according to Kennedy-Shaffer.
“Our priority is to secure protections for student workers in the midst of a pandemic and an economic collapse for the year ahead, and to establish a strong foundation on which to build in the future,” Kennedy-Shaffer wrote.
Still, some union members remain concerned about compensation for international student workers who must remain in their home country during the pandemic and helping Teaching Fellows teach more effectively over Zoom if Harvard continues online.
Harvard recently proposed shortening the term of its contract with HGSU-UAW to one year due to the uncertain situation of Harvard’s finances. If the union and the University agree to the proposal, the first contract would expire in 2021, promptly bringing the two parties back to the bargaining table.
As Harvard negotiates contracts with its unions this year, bargaining — like teaching — may also take an online form if the coronavirus pandemic continues to necessitate social distancing.
Harvard and its graduate student union have already engaged in three remote bargaining sessions using the online platform Zoom.
But McCartan said the platform has certain limitations compared to in-person bargaining.
“I do think there’s advantages to being in-person in that you can have physical documents to look at, you can step out into the hallway for a quick conversation if you need to — stuff like that that’s just not possible when you have this clunky Zoom setup,” McCartan said.
“At the end of the day, bargaining is just people talking to each other and Zoom allows that to happen, so the core work happens regardless, and we're making it work as best we can,” he added.
Liebman said labor agencies such as the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and European Works Councils have also been conducting negotiations over Zoom, and the platform appears to be working effectively.
“It may be second-best, but it certainly does provide a forum and people are learning how to adjust to it,” Liebman said.
Further, though the novel coronavirus has presented unprecedented challenges for unions and universities alike, some say the outbreak could have an unexpected positive side effect: it may facilitate cooperation between Harvard and its unions during bargaining.
Earlier this month, United States Senator Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Representative Andrew S. Levin said in a video posted to Twitter that remote negotiations present an opportunity for HGSU-UAW and Harvard to engage in “marathon bargaining” and finally settle on a contract.
Liebman said the pandemic could lead to “interest-based bargaining” — a more mutualistic format in which parties focus on problem-solving and reaching common ground.
“There is a shared mutual interest and concern that hangs over these negotiations that might not have been as obvious beforehand,” Liebman said.
McCartan also stressed the importance of cooperation during negotiations amid a global crisis.
“When you’re bargaining, you don’t bargain in a void,” McCartan said. “You obviously have to understand what the other party’s capabilities, limitations, and approach are.”
Still, Art, Film, and Visual Studies Ph.D. candidate and union member Xavier Nueno said he thinks Harvard should sign a contract with its graduate students to show its commitment to the “intellectual community.”
“These are extraordinary times, and they call for extraordinary leadership,” Nueno said.
Despite the constraints and hardships COVID-19 poses on a temporary basis, its alterations to contract negotiations will likely have a lasting impact.
Protections for unionized employees only last as long as the contract — and if two sides fail to settle or renew their contracts, there is no guarantee that previous agreements from before the pandemic will be extended.
As the public health crisis unfolds, Rivera said 32BJ is seeking to ensure the University does not overlook protections for its workers as it deals with various economic and academic pitfalls.
“As we looked into going into negotiations this year, we did not expect to be faced with the unprecedented crisis that we're in right now,” she said. “That will have an impact into the negotiations that we will be having going forward.”
Rivera added that reaching a contract that continues to secure wages, health care, retirement plans, and paid time off for members remains a priority in negotiations.
She also said sustained wage increases over the upcoming years and workers’ safety assurances will be essential, adding that the COVID-19 outbreak brought those needs to the fore.
“We're going to do all that we can do to ensure that we protect everything that we've fought for, and that we lift up the stories of the janitors at Harvard, who are the frontline workers that have been risking themselves,” Rivera said.
While HGSU-UAW’s contract will expire in just a year’s time, McCartan said achieving a first contract would serve as a major milestone and could facilitate bargaining significantly during renegotiation.
“The biggest difference is not everything is on the table anymore and that you already have a contract to work from, and rather than having to reach agreement on language from scratch on every single article, you can focus on the articles that need to be tweaked,” McCartan said.
Ultimately, the task of negotiating five different contracts against the backdrop of a global pandemic may provide new insights into the ethos of the University as a whole, according to Liebman.
“Some have said that companies or employers can come out of this crisis either as heroes or villains,” Liebman said. “This is an opportunity for Harvard and other universities to really come out of this crisis as heroes in terms of their labor relations, to take the high road and really just seriously address these critical worker concerns and economic concerns.”

The day the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences formally announced its expansion into Allston, computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 asked his computer programming team for their thoughts on the news over lunch.
One of his students responded, “Where’s Allston?”
Lewis explained that it was near the Harvard Business School, over on the other side of the river. He recalled that the student wasn’t sure where the Business School was located but asked if it was related to Spangler — the Business School student center. Lewis then learned that many of his team members frequented Spangler in search of study spaces and late night snacks.
The key takeaway from this exchange, according to Lewis, was this: if food is readily available at a Harvard building, students will come. He made sure to emphasize this idea as an author on a “White Paper on Teaching and Community Spaces in Allston” penned by SEAS affiliates in January 2013.
“Like Napoleon’s army, the student body marches on its stomach,” the report reads.
When the report was released, the physical foundation of what would become the Science and Engineering Complex lay untouched during a years-long lull in construction due to the 2008 financial crisis.
Today, the SEC stands nearly complete, with construction cautiously resuming after yet another hiatus, this time a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Many design suggestions have been implemented since the 2008 delay, such as the inclusion of the SEC Café — drawing in students with food, just as Lewis suggested back in 2013.
COVID-19, which struck just as the SEC was teetering on the edge of completion, marks the latest development in a tale of conception and construction spanning the last three decades. Along the way, the University, SEAS, and the building itself have all adapted and evolved.
Beginning in 1988 and throughout the 1990s, Harvard — in search of more academic space beyond its already saturated Cambridge property — quietly began to purchase acreage south of the Charles River in Allston. By 1997, University officials said Harvard had acquired 52.6 acres of land in Allston with an investment of $88 million.
“This part of Boston used to be where freight was offloaded on the trains coming from the west,” Lewis said. “There’s a restaurant called The Stockyard [...] but the reason why it’s called The Stockyard is because it’s located on the place where the cattle from the west were unloaded from their trains and were corralled in the pre-refrigeration days before they were slaughtered and sent to the butchers.”
At the time, Harvard was roundly criticized for the acquisition. An editorial in the Boston Globe described the move as “a stealthy land grab,” and then-Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino condemned the University’s “total arrogance.”
Yet, the question still remained: What would Harvard do with this vast, largely industrial land?
Lewis, who also served as Dean of the College from 1995 to 2003, said while Harvard’s acquisition of acreage in Allston began many years ago, the answer to that question and the decision to expand SEAS into Allston constitute relatively recent history.
Ten years after the Allston acquisition was officially announced, Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan — unveiled in January 2007 — detailed Harvard’s aims for expansion into Allston over the next 50 years, including the creation of a new science complex.
In October 2007, the Boston Redevelopment Authority — now known as the Boston Planning and Development Agency — unanimously approved plans for Harvard’s 589,000-square-foot science complex in Allston. The structure was originally intended to house the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology department in a four-building complex designed by the German architectural firm Behnisch Architekten.
The science complex was the first project from the 50-year Institutional Master Plan to begin construction. But while Harvard broke ground on the first building in spring 2008, University officials continued to debate the fate of the additional buildings into the summer of that year.
These debates were interrupted in February 2009 after then-University President Drew G. Faust announced that the University would slow all Allston construction for the remainder of the year. Faust would then completely halt construction in early spring 2010 upon completion of the multi-story, below-ground foundation.
Faust’s announcement came after an unprecedented 30 percent drop in the University’s endowment the previous fiscal year. The strain of the financial crisis at the time all but wiped out Harvard’s multi-million dollar Allston development fund, according to University officials.
“That was a big one,” SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff said of the 2008 economic crisis-induced disruption. “The foundation was built, which, when people hear ‘the foundation was built,’ they think there’s a slab of concrete that was poured. It was a three-story structure below ground and several acres large.”
“With the markets collapsing and the impact on the Harvard endowment, the difficult decision was made to just halt construction,” he added.
The University spent a significant amount of money to mothball the site and ensure that the foundation would not suffer deterioration in the years following the economic crisis, according to Karoff.
Approximately two years after Faust suspended construction on the Allston Science Complex, the University announced that work on the building was set to resume in 2014. This reboot would mark a turning point in a number of formative decisions that have shaped the complex.
After the construction halt in 2009, University officials began to consider the possibility of housing the stem cell department in existing University facilities. Two years later, the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology department moved into the newly-renovated Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building.
The physical foundation of the Allston Science Complex remained, however, and in 2012, Faust announced that the complex would be a major focus in the University’s capital campaign to raise $6 billion following the 2008 financial crisis.
As the University began raising money for the Allston complex, discussions also emerged about the departments this new space should house. In May 2012, University officials announced that one of the departments on the table was Bioengineering.
In February 2013, Faust announced that SEAS would relocate “in almost its entirety” across the river in “as little as five years.” The news — dubbed the “Allston bomb” by engineering professor Robert D. Howe — shocked SEAS affiliates and received sharp criticism from faculty members.
“By the time we emerged from that financial meltdown, needs and priorities had changed,” SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III wrote in an emailed statement. “We inherited a fully constructed foundation upon which to build and worked with the original architectural team (Behnisch) to design a building to support the teaching and research requirements of engineering and the applied sciences.”
In the coming years, however, the announcement faced several changes. While Faust originally projected that almost all of SEAS would move to the new complex, by 2014 it was decided that only two-thirds of the school would relocate.
The same year, SEAS administrators announced that the complex was slated to open in 2019. A year later, however, they announced that the opening would be delayed to 2020.
Though the construction faced a number of setbacks, the aim of fostering interdisciplinarity through the space has remained unchanged since the proposal of the first iteration of the Allston Science Complex, according to SEAS Executive Dean for Education and Research Fawwaz Habbal.
“The emphasis was mostly around how to create interdisciplinarity across the whole University,” Habbal said. “That emphasis is still there, and we want to have a connection with the College and have a significant interaction with the College.”
A month before the official announcement that SEAS would be expanding to Allston, 13 SEAS affiliates published a “White Paper on Teaching and Community Spaces in Allston” dedicated to creating spaces that foster effective learning and collaboration.
The report detailed suggestions for the complex, including having reconfigurable active learning spaces, investing in consumer-grade communication and media technology, creating adjacent project and laboratory spaces, and maintaining spaces for social interactions.
Habbal, a member of the SEAS task force that authored the white paper, said the group focused on how to create spaces that allow students to bring their ideas to life.
“Students are very clever. They’re able to come up with all kinds of ideas. We need to figure out how we can enable these ideas and make it happen,” Habbal said.
The structure of the complex as it is known today — a six-story building containing a central atrium, labs, classrooms, lounge spaces, and a cafeteria, among other features — was revealed in 2015 at a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting. The 2015 plans established that the first two floors and front lawn of the complex would be open to the public, addressing concerns about public accessibility to Allston residents.
Harvard filed an Institutional Master Plan Notification Form with the Boston Planning and Development Agency and began the formal review process for the Science and Engineering Complex in November 2015. In addition to changing its structure from a four-building complex to a single-building complex, its area was also reduced by about 100,000 square feet.
The BPDA unanimously approved Harvard’s $1 billion proposal during a meeting in April 2016 — nearly ten years after the approval of the original four-building Allston Science Complex.
In 2016, Harvard also began to finalize a land acquisition deal that began in 2000 with railroad company CSX Transportation, paying the company $147.4 million. CSX yielded its easement rights for the entire property to the University following environmental remediation, according to Harvard spokesperson Kevin Casey, which allowed for the development of the SEAS complex and a new park.
In December 2017, Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh oversaw the placement of the final steel beam onto the Science and Engineering Complex.
Since then, construction steadily progressed as SEAS affiliates anticipated the opening of the complex to students in fall 2020. The complex expected to receive its certificate of occupancy in May 2020, with the initial transition of office spaces beginning the first week of June. The remainder of faculty was slated to move into the complex in a second wave in January 2021.
The entirety of Harvard’s campus felt the sharp and swift ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic, and SEAS was no exception.
On April 11, Doyle announced that Harvard would postpone the Allston SEC opening from fall 2020 to spring 2021 in an email to SEAS affiliates. This delay marked the latest disruption in the complex’s nearly five years of construction.
Doyle wrote that until this most recent postponement, Harvard had managed to keep the project “on schedule (and on budget).”
Although Boston’s mandatory halt on citywide construction in March caused inevitable delays for the opening of the SEC, there is a silver lining in how far the project has come, according to Doyle.
“The good news is that we made it to the 26 mile marker in a five-year, construction marathon,” Doyle wrote. “We have less than a mile to go to cross the finish line.”
Doyle also noted that the circumstances surrounding the delay due to the coronavirus pandemic are vastly different than those surrounding the 2008 economic crisis, which had left the building’s foundation idle and its finances uncertain.
“In that context, the recent pause in construction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was a relatively small blip, albeit an inconvenient one,” Doyle wrote.
In accordance with Walsh’s “Temporary Guidance for Construction in the City of Boston,” the SEC can resume construction on May 25, on the condition that crew members follow state safety guidelines. Harvard Capital Projects, which manages the construction of the SEC, said work on the building would indeed resume the week of the 25th, according to SEAS Assistant Dean for Campus Planning and Design Pamela Choi Redfern.
“There’s a lot of new protocols in place to help with the new working environment that we’re in,” Redfern said.
The protocols include measures to ensure social distancing by, for example, limiting the number of individuals who may be in an elevator at a given time, according to Karoff.
Like Doyle, Redfern, who has been involved in the SEC project since 2012, said the project was close to completion before the coronavirus pandemic struck.
“It’s been a long road to get here and we were right at the finish line,” Redfern said. “Before construction got halted, we had about three months of work to complete before we started moving in.”
“Given that there are social distancing guidelines and some expected extension of work, it’s probably right now in the range of 12 to 14 weeks.” she added.
At the time of the latest construction delay, SEAS faculty members had been preparing to start moving over to the Allston campus. These preparations, for now, are all on hiatus.
“I was in the very slow process of winnowing down my office, getting rid of old papers and books and things that didn't need to move. So, of course, that’s on hold,” computer science professor Stephen N. Chong said.
Chong was also a member of the working group in charge of coordinating the Allston class schedules, which were going to be offset from Cambridge-based classes by 45 minutes. This, too, has now been put on hold.
Redfern said she is now working on re-planning the expansion into Allston.
“[Redfern] had a very elaborate, incredibly well-orchestrated plan to get everyone into the building by September,” Karoff said. “That’s thrown out the window.”
Karoff, meanwhile, has been working on several issues SEAS faces as it adjusts to the new reality of the pandemic.
“There’s just a lot of planning going on across SEAS around planning for all the potential scenarios for teaching in the fall, planning in the near-term for reoccupying and rebooting the research labs,” he said.
Karoff added that administrators are also thinking about how to respond to the financial impact of the pandemic, both in terms of how to address the reduction in Harvard’s revenue and how to generate revenue through new programs.
In the face of uncertainty about what campus life will look like after the pandemic, it is difficult to gauge how the pre-pandemic vision for the SEC might need to change, according to Doyle. He wrote that social and workplace behavioral norms will inevitably evolve.
“One of the central design principles of the SEC was to encourage random interactions, serendipitous ‘collisions’ that lead to intellectual collaboration among students, faculty, researchers and others,” Doyle wrote. “That concept of physical interplay is a bit at odds with the social distancing requirements of the post-pandemic world.”
James H. Waldo, a computer science professor and the Chief Technology Officer for SEAS, said that although the delay may have disrupted plans to open in fall 2020, it did provide extra time to finalize the building.
“I’m thankful this time around that the delay was only a couple of months. It really means a postponement of about a semester of us moving into the building, and in some ways, that’s nice because the schedule was pretty tight,” Waldo said. “The upside is it gives us more time to be sure that the building is ready for occupancy and for teaching.”
Habbal echoed Waldo’s optimism, adding that every project delay — including this most recent one — has given SEAS affiliates the opportunity to make improvements.
“Sometimes delays give you time to reflect and try to perfect your plans, and that’s been all of the case with this building,” Habbal said. “Every delay we had, we ended up going back, reflecting, trying to figure out improving the plan, and changing the plan sometimes because things change.”

At Harvard, it is not uncommon to hear speculation about who could someday be bound for the White House. When former President John F. Kennedy ’40 arrived at the College in 1936, however, few would have made such a prediction.
But eighty years later, JFK’s political dynasty is still alive at the school that helped spur it — thanks, in part, to a family-University relationship unlike any other.
Harvard’s relationship with the Kennedys is one that has lasted more than four generations, transcended traditional boundaries, endured turbulence, and ultimately proven mutually prosperous. It has helped create a political dynasty that has produced a United States president, numerous influential members of Congress, and one of the country’s most prominent schools of government.
Today, a new generation of Kennedys maintains the mantle of the family legacy, as well as its relationship with the school that helped to build it.
As U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) makes an audacious run for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, arousing memories of Camelot for many, the Kennedy family political legacy — one that has never lost when on the ballot in the Bay State — is at a crossroads. And with former U.S. ambassador Caroline B. Kennedy ’80’s headline-grabbing departure from the Harvard Institute of Politics Senior Advisory Committee, the family’s involvement with the University, too, stands at an important juncture.
The Kennedys are not the first bloodline to have produced many prominent Harvard graduates. But since Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. graduated from the College in 1912, the family and the school have held a unique, mutually beneficial relationship that has had lasting implications on the family’s political pursuits and the University’s growth.
After gaining prominence in business and politics, Kennedy Sr. raised his nine children — in particular, the four boys — with exceedingly high expectations.
His sons — Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. ’38, John F. Kennedy ’40, Robert F. Kennedy ’48, and Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54-’56 — all went on to follow in his footsteps by attending the University.
“The Kennedys kind of became part of the ruling class at this time,” said Thomas J. Whalen, a professor at Boston University who has studied the family. “But an institution like Harvard allowed them to stay in that… to kind of pass on these connections to their children. That’s how an elite survives.”
It was the eldest of the Kennedy clan who many expected to gain political prominence even from a young age. But following his death in a plane crash in World War II, the political legacy was left to his brothers to fulfill.
John F. Kennedy, the next oldest of the brothers, entered Harvard with a high school transcript riddled with Cs and Ds. As a freshman living in Weld Hall, Kennedy worked harder to succeed on various Harvard athletic teams than he did at academics: He earned a spot on the swim team, though he left little impression on the coaches. In his sophomore year, after moving into Winthrop House, Kennedy joined the Spee Club, the Hasty Pudding, and The Crimson, where he served as a business editor.
JFK’s brothers, Bobby and Ted, both attended Harvard after him. They, too, were exceedingly focused on athletics during their undergraduate years, earning varsity football letters.
“Being an athlete was like the other kinds of pressure in their life,” said Larry Tye, a Robert Kennedy biographer. “There was an expectation that they would compete. There was an expectation that the only thing worthy, in terms of the way you competed, was if you won.”
“This was Joe Kennedy’s metaphor for what life ought to be like generally,” Tye said. “You had to win things, whether it was competing in a football game or competing in a political campaign.”
After graduating Harvard, serving in World War II, and working briefly as a newspaper reporter, JFK went on to run for Congress in 1946 with strong support from his father. He spent six years in the House before being elected to the Senate twice, and made the leap to run for president in 1960.
Whalen said Harvard played a crucial role in JFK’s entry into politics.
“John Kennedy certainly spent his entire life drawing on those connections,” he said.
When Kennedy was elected to the White House, he brought Harvard with him. He tapped numerous academics to serve in his administration, including National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, and advisor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. ’38.
“The joke at the time in 1961 was: How do you get to Washington? Well, you go to Harvard Square and turn left,” said former U.S. Representative Barnett “Barney” Frank ’61-’62 (D-Mass.).
Harvard became a part of the fabric of Kennedy’s White House. He returned to Cambridge numerous times following his election, had The Crimson delivered to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., and sometimes listened to Harvard football games on the radio.
As president-elect in December 1960, JFK visited Harvard Yard, where he was greeted by thousands of cheering students.
“It’s like feeling like you were at the center of where history was unfolding,” said Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who was a freshman at the College at the time. “And then when so many faculty went off to D.C. — aside from being pissed off that you didn’t get the course that you wanted to get, like with John Kenneth Galbraith — it was the same thing.”
“There was kind of this proximity to this generation change and this new generation taking power,” Ganz said. “It was very energizing.”
On John F. Kennedy’s final trip to Boston in October 1963, prior to attending a Harvard-Columbia football game, he picked out a location on Harvard’s campus near the bend of the Charles River for the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.
One month later, Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK in Dallas, Texas, sending the country — and campus — into a frenzy.
Following his death, a group of JFK’s closest allies, including his two brothers, began working on plans to memorialize him, albeit far sooner than they expected.
The group settled on the creation of a presidential library that would house a museum and his presidential archives. They also debated proposals to create a memorial of Kennedy that would have an ongoing impact on students.
The discussions ultimately led to Harvard’s Graduate School of Public Administration becoming the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and to the founding of the Institute of Politics.
The creation of the Kennedy Library — which was originally supposed to be part of a complex designed by architect I.M. Pei that would house the Kennedy School, the IOP, and several academic departments — was hampered by years of controversy and anger among some Cambridge residents. Community members raised concerns over the influx of tourism a museum would bring to the area.
“It was a brawl,” said Dan H. Fenn Jr. ’44, the JFK Library’s founding director and a current Kennedy School lecturer.
Some residents advocated to keep the archives housed at Harvard but move the museum elsewhere — a proposal Fenn, a former Crimson president, opposed.
Eventually, when building the museum and the archive together in Cambridge became unfeasible, the family gave up on housing the memorial in Harvard Square. In 1979, the library opened on Columbia Point in Dorchester, alongside the archives and museum.
The IOP, which was also mired in controversy in its early days, became the Kennedy family’s chief point of engagement with the University.
Jacqueline L. “Jackie” Kennedy Onassis, JFK’s widow, sat on the Institute’s inaugural Senior Advisory Committee.
Ted Kennedy, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1962 until his death in 2009, also joined the Senior Advisory Committee shortly after its inception and became its most influential member. Committee members said Ted Kennedy never missed a meeting during his time on the committee, which gathers several times per year.
“He was the leading steward of the family,” longtime IOP Advisory Committee member Heather P. Campion said. “He built the Senior Advisory Committee.”
Beyond his engagement with the committee, Ted Kennedy also leaned heavily on Harvard affiliates in his policy work as a senator, according to Scott Ferson, who worked for Kennedy in the ’90s.
“For his legislative work — and for the work he did on health care, education, justice reform, immigration — he very much relied on the experts at Harvard,” Ferson said. “The staff lists from his entirety in the Senate is littered with Harvard degrees.”
The rapid growth of the Kennedy School under former Dean Graham T. Allison Jr. ’62 in the 1970s and 1980s created conflict between the family and the University at times.
Allison found that the Kennedy name hindered fundraising efforts, according to a 1989 New York Times Magazine story about HKS. In printed materials from 1981, for instance, the school abbreviated its name as “HSG,” for the Harvard School of Government, instead of “KSG,” the acronym normally used at the time to refer to the school.
“In any productive relationship,” Ted Kennedy told the Times in 1989, “you’re going to have these blips. I still have some criticisms. I’d like to see them pay less attention to techniques, more to the values of public life. But I’m proud to have our name on the school and I think my brother would have been too.”
Though the Kennedy family has always maintained strong ties to the IOP, this year brought significant change to the Institute’s Advisory Committee leadership.
In February, the Advisory Committee saw a major shakeup as Caroline B. Kennedy ’80, JFK’s daughter, and Kenneth M. Duberstein stepped down as its honorary chairs. Joe Kennedy III is now the only member of the Kennedy family who is officially involved with the IOP.
Caroline Kennedy — who served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan under President Barack Obama — took on a bigger role on the Advisory Committee following the death of her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr. JFK Jr. had worked closely with Campion on improving the forum, which was dedicated to him in 2003, four years after he was killed in a plane crash.
“As an undergrad and just after I graduated, I attended a lot of meetings with my mother and my uncle, and then with John as he became very engaged and really sort of gave the IOP — and the forum in particular — a real burst of energy through his involvement,” Caroline Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson.
“After he died, I started becoming more engaged with my uncle Teddy,” she added. “And then after he died I’ve continued to stay engaged and work hard to make sure the IOP stays true to its spirit and mission.”
Caroline Kennedy declined to comment on the specific reasons for her departure.
“My goal is to make sure the IOP stays true to its founding ideals and mission and is inspirational and innovative, nimble and dedicated to public service, and committed to undergraduates primarily,” she said.
Asked if she would consider rejoining the board in the future, however, she left the door open to the possibility.
“I need to make sure that I can do what I just said, or that everybody is committed to that same set of ideals,” she said. “And then I would be thrilled to come back.”
The Washington Post reported in February that Caroline Kennedy clashed with Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, and that she and other committee members felt he micromanaged the IOP.
“There were issues between her and school officials over the role of the Senior Advisory Committee and over her role at the IOP and just the structure,” Advisory Committee member Richard L. Berke said in an interview with The Crimson.
“It is critically important that Caroline be a central figure in the leadership of the IOP,” Berke said. “I’m hopeful that the Harvard administration will go all out to try to get her back.”
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said in an interview that he, too, hopes to get Caroline Kennedy back on the committee.
“She has been so constructively engaged with our students and so helpful to the Institute of Politics,” Gearan, a former Crimson editor, said. “It would be very helpful to continue her engagement and her passion for the Kennedy School, for Harvard, and for the Institute. That would be, certainly, my hope.”
Today, the Kennedy legacy is back on the ballot in Massachusetts.
The only Kennedy currently holding public office in the state, Joe Kennedy III, is challenging U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a closely-watched primary.
Tye, the Robert Kennedy biographer, said the young Kennedy’s brand of politics is reminiscent of his grandfather’s.
“I would say that Joe III, in lots of ways, is the closest thing the Kennedys have come to producing another Bobby Kennedy since Bobby Kennedy,” Tye said.
Robert Kennedy served in the Senate from New York and as his brother’s attorney general before being killed while running for president in 1968.
Following his high school days at the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, Joe Kennedy III did not follow the family tradition of attending Harvard and instead matriculated at Stanford as an undergraduate.
“To have family members of mine that were alumni [at Harvard] was a great source of pride for me,” Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson.
“I, for a variety of reasons, having grown up basically in its backyard and having a family that had pretty deep roots in Massachusetts, just wanted to go some place a bit new, and try something a bit new,” he added.
After his undergraduate years and a stint in the Peace Corps, Kennedy returned to Cambridge for law school at Harvard.
Harvard Law School classmates described Kennedy as friendly but low-key, and as a talented quarterback in the flag football league.
“He was friends with pretty much everyone in our section,” said Patrick T. Childress, one of Kennedy’s Law School section mates. “He was always just very relatable and friendly.”
Childress, who was friends with Kennedy, said Kennedy didn’t express plans to run for office during his time at the Law School. But after several years working as a prosecutor, Kennedy won a U.S. House seat in Massachusetts’s Fourth Congressional District.
With his Harvard degree, famous surname, and progressive politics, Joe Kennedy III seems to have many of the same tools his grandfather and great-uncles did. His very appeal in the state still rests, in some part, upon his claim to familial fame.
Nicholas Karnovsky ’19, a 2016 IOP Director’s Intern in Kennedy’s district office, said that legacy “was definitely part of the appeal” of his position.
“While when I interned with him back in 2016, he was still a fairly new congressman, it was pretty clear, to me at least, that he was going somewhere,” Karnovsky said. “He’s the type of person you want to attach your anchor to.”
“I’m not at all surprised that he’s running for the Senate now, given just his accomplishments and his credentials. I think the Senate is step two, who knows what step three might be,” he added. “That was certainly why I was interested.”
Like many of his family members, Kennedy has, too, reaped the rewards of Harvard connections. His introduction of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), his former Law School professor, at the Democratic National Convention put him in the national spotlight in 2016.
Kennedy, who has long been the beacon of establishment politics in the Bay State, has tried to distinguish himself — but hasn’t shied away from his family’s reputation in doing so.
“I think the lesson that I take from my family’s participation in public life has been one that has not been afraid to challenge the structures and institutions of our society to, in fact, be bigger, dream bolder, and deliver more,” he said. “I believe that’s what politics is supposed to do.”
“The role of people in it is not to work your way into an establishment platform and then enjoy the comforts that are provided by it, but to recognize that if that establishment is in fact going to deliver on the promises that we make to our people, then that establishment needs to be constantly be pushed and to constantly be driven to be more and to focus even more deliberately in the ways in which we fall short,” he added.
Asked if, in his current race, his family legacy and Harvard background are an asset or a burden, Kennedy didn’t miss a beat.
“Without question, I’m proud of both,” he said.

University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 has toed the starting line of the Boston Marathon in Hopkinton, Mass. six times.
“Marathon running is supposed to be hard, right? If it wasn’t hard, we wouldn’t do it,” Biology professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, who runs often with Garber, said.
As University Provost, Garber — who took office in 2011 — has grappled with a multitude of challenges in his professional life. The Provost’s office oversees a plethora of faculty and academic offices, including Title IX, Institutional Research, Harvard Library, Harvard University Health Services, and the Office for Dispute Resolution.
Now, he’s charged with solving a problem that for months has gripped not just Havrard, but all of higher education — a pandemic that has shuttered University operations, sent students home, and posed unexpected financial burdens for the school.
In it, Garber faces a marathon that he has been training for his entire career: The Provost is both a trained economist and an internal physician. His doctoral dissertation on wide-scale disease outbreaks — “Costs and Control of Antibiotic Resistance” — is a playbook of sorts for a coronavirus pandemic.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview with The Crimson that Harvard is fortunate to have Garber at its helm during such a time of turmoil.
“If I could have designed the Provost from scratch to be our chief academic officer as we are addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19, I would have designed Alan Garber,” he said. “To have a Provost who is both a physician and an economist at this moment in time is extraordinarily valuable.”
Lieberman, who chairs the Human Evolutionary Biology department, said the two first connected through a love of distance running and compatible research interests. He doesn’t know how many miles they have logged together, but he said he vividly remembers long conversations that matched their long runs.
When training for a marathon, the running itself is draining and Boston’s winter weather is depleting; but in spite of this, marathon runners like Garber still have to log miles upon miles to prepare. Lieberman said he hopes that despite tough conditions, Garber remains determined.
“Those qualities, which make him a very good marathon runner, also make him a really good administrator,” he said. “A dedicated person who goes the distance.”
Garber’s colleagues and friends often remark that he is built for the current moment. With his academic training, his deep knowledge of the University, and his increasingly wide breadth of responsibilities and power, Garber is uniquely suited to run Harvard during an unprecedented financial and public health crisis.
Garber grew up in Rock Island, Illinois, a town bordering Iowa, but his uncommon educational path had him traverse the country from coast to coast.
Garber graduated from Harvard College in 1976 with a degree in Economics. A candidate for advanced standing, Garber completed a masters degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1977 before starting his doctorate in economics and simultaneously enrolling at Stanford Medical School to complete a doctorate of medicine.
Garber quickly fell in love with Harvard the summer before his senior year of high school.
“I actually had visited Harvard once when I was in the summer before my senior year of high school,” Garber said in an interview with The Crimson. “I fell in love with the place. I didn’t know much about it so it was as much about the atmosphere and the people walking by as anything substantive.”
“This is not how I would recommend that anybody choose a college, but it worked out pretty well for me,” he added.
It was Economics 10 — the flagship introductory Economics course offered at the College — that sparked Garber’s interest in pursuing a career as an academic. Despite his initial plan to study biochemistry, he ultimately decided to concentrate in Economics.
“I thought that I wanted to be a doctor for a good part of my childhood,” he said. “But it was when I arrived at Harvard that I decided I wanted to become an academic.”
As an undergraduate, he enrolled in graduate-level courses in Economics before graduating summa cum laude. A member of Phi Beta Kappa, Garber was organized and studied an “unusual combination” of economics and the sciences.
Andrew “Andy” E. Strominger ’77 was a part of Garber’s rooming group in Dunster House when they were College students. He said, even then, Garber’s work ethic was evident.
“It’s not that he worked hard because he needed to keep up with everyone else,” Strominger said.
“I think we’re incredibly lucky,” he added, noting that Garber’s “intellectual bandwidth” in an administrative position is rare.
With his interest in both economics and medicine and a desire to address health policy issues, Garber said he realized at some point that he wanted to go to medical school on the West Coast.
So he constructed a method of attending schools on both coasts at the same time.
“Let me first say that enrolling in two universities on opposite coasts is a good way to make sure that people have a hard time keeping track of you, which at the time I thought had tremendous advantages,” Garber said.
Garber decided to defer his admission to Stanford Medical School and begin his economics Ph.D. at Harvard. Taking a break from his graduate school work in the early 1980s, he then attended medical school for two years.
After his initial start at medical school, he flipped a switch, returning to Harvard again to work on his dissertation in economics. But his clever plan did not pan out. Garber failed to finish his dissertation on the two-year timetable he set for himself and had to head back to medical school for clinical rotations.
“I finished my dissertation when I was doing the obstetrics rotation, which is why you wouldn’t want me to deliver your baby,” he quipped.
After graduating from both Harvard with a Ph.D. in economics and Stanford with a medical degree in 1983 — with research honors — Garber began a residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where he met his wife Anne M. Yahanda, an oncologist.
His career has allowed for him to immerse himself in both economic and health policy.
From 1986 to 2011, Garber was a professor of economics, health research, and policy at Stanford. He also directed Stanford’s Center for Health Policy and the Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research at the School of Medicine from 1987 to 2011. He worked as a physician at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System from 1986 to 2011.
Garber also served as a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, where he oversaw the healthcare program.
Harvard Medical School professor Barbara J. McNeil said she worked closely alongside Garber on advisory committees for Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield. McNeil, who is a radiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said they also met through research meetings.
“I followed his research quite closely for years,” she said, adding that she didn’t need to look at his CV to refresh her memory on what he has published. “He was doing top-of-the-line, very well cited research in the cost effectiveness of various diagnostic therapeutic procedures.”
An expert in the field, McNeil, who now chairs the department of public health policy where Garber teaches, said he is a “superb” teacher and lecturer.
In addition to teaching, Garber saw patients as a general internist up until two months prior to starting as Provost.
The University Provost is a centralizing force in the Central Administration: The deans of Harvard’s twelve schools report to both him and the President.
“That’s true of most places,” Garber said. “But there are some ways in which being provost here is different from other universities.”
The modern-day role of the Provost is relatively new to Harvard, per Garber. It was refurbished under former University President Neil L. Rudenstine’s tenure to “take charge of inter-faculty initiatives.”
Since Rudenstine’s revamp, Harvard has seen three provosts: Harvey V. Fineberg '67, Steven E. Hyman, and Garber. At the time of his start, Garber said there were around five interfaculty initiatives, depending on how one counts — but now, there are 25 to 28. Still, Garber said his role forms more than just those efforts, helping faculty matters and overseeing a wide range of “initiatives of various kinds.”
“Ideally, the Provost office helps advance the academic mission of the entire University,” he said. “That extends from recruiting and retaining the best faculty to ensuring that we have the funds and leadership to pursue new academic programs, whether it's across schools or maybe collaborative across different universities, at Harvard.”
John Thelin, a University of Kentucky professor and expert on American higher education, wrote in an email to The Crimson that provosts typically “ascend through the academic ranks.”
“This means having a Ph.D., being hired in a tenure track faculty position, gaining tenure and probably promotion to full professor,” he wrote. “One usually must have experience serving as an academic dean, but not always. What is crucial is with this base of experience and credentials is whether one can balance the disparate academic colleges and schools.”
Thelin wrote that the provost typically serves as the Chief Academic Officer, serving as a “mediator to orchestrate opinions, priorities and decisions among the numerous academic deans and their colleges.” He noted that a provost candidate must have “ the support and trust of the incumbent president” in order to succeed.
Hyman and Garber both served in the role during former University President Drew G. Faust’s tenure — but it was Garber who Faust courted when the school was searching for Hyman’s successor.
Once Faust began Harvard’s search for the next Provost, she said, Garber’s name continued to resurface. At the time, he was serving on the visiting committee for Harvard Medical School and taught as a professor of medicine and economics at Stanford University.
“I thought, ‘I really need to look at Alan Garber, who has such positive reviews by everybody as a human being and a contributor to higher education,’” Faust said in an interview.
On a trip to the West Coast, she asked Garber to meet with her to give advice on who she should select as the next Provost. But the request had an ulterior motive.
“This is how you try to get people interested in the job,” Faust said. “People said, ‘Maybe Alan Garber would be interested.’ I thought, ‘Okay, let’s see what he has to say.’”
“I don’t think he’d had any intention of being a provost or leaving Stanford,” she added.
The two met at the Rosewood Hotel in Palo Alto near Stanford, where Faust and Garber had the first of a series of conversations about the job that would continue in the search committee.
“I very happily persuaded him that this would be an exciting new adventure in his life,” she said.
“He came and has been here since since then, which I'm very happy about,” she added.
On April 15, 2011, after months of discussions, Harvard announced Garber as the new Provost. Faust said Hyman, who preceded her at the University, helped Garber adjust to his new role, and that he transitioned naturally into the job.
“He’s one of the most intellectually curious people I know, and so the job of Provost is like giving him a smorgasbord of desserts and telling him, ‘Explore all of these fields across the University,’” she said.
Though Garber joined Faust midway through her tenure, he quickly became an interlocutor of her ideas.
“If I had an idea, he both listened to it and tried to find the good parts of it, but then also pointed out what the dangers or weaknesses might be so he could save me from myself a little bit if I was going off in the wrong direction,” Faust said.
Faust said Garber also played a crucial role in her “One Harvard” campaign. Before the campaign, Harvard colloquially abided by an “every tub to stand on its own” philosophy, keeping its 12 different schools relatively separate. During the campaign, Faust launched the first capital fundraising effort that raised money across the schools, with Garber spearheading the project. She said she believes the Provost became the “embodiment” of the One Harvard ideal.
The University Provost serves as a close partner and ally to the University President — a relationship Garber has now maintained with two presidents.
Faust said she and Garber often discussed novels and literature, particularly his interest in fiction.
“He has this whole passion for the humanities and literary matters, as well as his more quantitatively based scientific vocational identities,” she said.
Now, he serves alongside University President Lawrence S. Bacow. Bacow described Garber as a “wonderful thought partner” to have.
“I think the fact that we are both trained as economists also allows us to speak a common language,” Bacow said.
In addition to their training as economists, both Bacow and Garber also boast multiple professional identities and attended institutions outside of Harvard — Bacow as a lawyer from MIT and Garber as a Stanford-trained doctor. Bacow said he believes this allows the two to bring “complementary perspectives and strengths” to a variety of issues.
Garber said the Provost role fits well into his “wide-ranging” interests.
“The provost role is constantly intellectually stimulating and one of the great wonders of this role, is that you get to see what happens in almost every corner of the University and the work of our students and our faculty and our staff is simply stunning, sometimes in ways that don't come to public attention,” he said. “I feel incredibly fortunate to have a window into that.”
While the University Provost’s job focuses mainly on internal Harvard matters, Garber has carved a space for himself in Massachusetts Hall that has placed him at the forefront of some of the biggest decisions administrators have made in the past decade.
He garnered enough respect during his tenure that alumni and faculty named him one of four likely candidates to be Harvard’s next president.
Now, Bacow, who ultimately won the top job, says Garber has served as an essential asset in his administration since his Fall 2018 inauguration.
“I can’t think of a major decision that I’ve had to make during my time as president that Alan has not been involved in,” Bacow said. “We collaborate on decisions regarding the hiring of deans. We collaborate on decisions regarding academic policy when we’re making tenure promotion decisions, recruitment decisions, retention decisions, capital planning decisions.”
Over the years, Garber has accrued a long list of duties across Harvard’s campus. He oversaw the creation of EdX and HarvardX, programs that provide free online courses from Harvard and other institutions. Garber said he considers the creation of HarvardX “a real bellwether event” for him, as he began the project shortly after he arrived from Stanford.
Strominger praised Garber for his handling of much of Harvard’s internal business.
“I think he’s kind of Harvard’s hidden gem,” Strominger said. “It’s not the job of the provost to be a public figure. It’s his job to keep the thing running and make impossible decisions.”
Garber’s responsibilities have created a singular role for him among the University’s administrators — a common occurrence in higher education, according to experts.
“The customary practice was that a Provost was ‘first among equal’ among the vice presidents – but this is no longer to be taken for granted,” Thelin wrote. “It’s a role that has to be conferred and, more important, has to be earned by trust and performance in some very tough turf battles.”
Garber’s seat at the top of the Central Administration has also embroiled him in contentious issues — most recently, tenure promotion decisions and Harvard’s graduate student unionization.
Along with Bacow, Garber chairs ad hoc committee meetings for tenure cases at Harvard, helping to lead the final stage of the secretive, intense process to promote new talent into the highest ranks of the school’s faculty. The normally quiet process made headlines in fall 2019, when the University informed Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña of its decision not to grant her tenure.
Harvard affiliates protested the denial by writing letters to administrators, rallying in Harvard Yard, and staging sit-ins in University Hall and outside Garber’s office. Administrators declined to comment on whether Bacow or Garber chaired García Peña’s ad hoc committee.
Though labor relations does not typically fall under the purview of the Provost, thanks to its direct impacts on academic life at the University, Garber has also taken a leading role in the University’s interactions with its new graduate student union.
In August 2016 — as student teaching and research assistants waded deeper into efforts to form a union — the Office of the Provost sent a message to affiliates arguing graduate student unionization would disrupt academic programming. The email was the first of many Garber would send over the next two years forewarning against unionization, using his role as chief academic officer to stake out the University’s claim that TFs and RAs were primarily students, not workers.
After an initial unionization vote in November 2016 failed, the NLRB overturned the election’s validity, and a second vote succeeded in April 2018.
In May, Garber announced the University would bargain in good faith with the newly recognized Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, despite its previous opposition. Nevertheless, he drew a line in the sand on which issues were fit for negotiation, laying out the three “fundamental principles” the University has sought to adhere to over the past several months of bargaining with the union: to maintain the “integrity” of teaching, “protect academic freedom,” and “serve all of its students,” regardless of whether they are in the union.
After months of negotiations, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers went on strike in December 2019. The two sides, now aided by a federal mediator, have yet to reach a contract, though negotiations are nearing completion.
Garber said that the most consequential decisions he has faced during his tenure, though, have been those related to the coronavirus pandemic — many of which remain ongoing.
Garber — who is a part of a task force overseeing Harvard’s response to the pandemic — was the one to make the announcement April 10 that the University would be open this fall, regardless of whether classes are held online or in-person.
The Provost’s Office has also announced a variety of travel restrictions for Harvard-funded trips during the pandemic. Garber most recently sent a May 11 email to affiliates discouraging them from all personal or professional travel. 
“These were not my decisions as much as joint decisions but they included when we decided not to have students return from spring break, to have the labs closed down,” he said. “They sound like very negative decisions but they were decisions that were made in order to protect the health of our community.”
While Bacow made the final decision to send students home after spring break, Garber has been involved in crafting the school’s logistical and academic plans during the crisis.
His perspective as a physician and an economist seeps into his decision-making, Garber said.
“One thing that anybody who has studied pandemics, epidemics, and the history of pandemics has a lot of respect for the damage that they can do,” he said. “And the other thing that people who have either experienced or studied infectious disease outbreaks knows is that a seemingly small contagion — maybe even an innocuous looking outbreak — could rapidly turn into something that is truly devastating.”
He added that he thinks the steps needed to promote public health and the economy are the same.
“The reason I say that is, if we reopen the economy too quickly without taking appropriate precautions to ensure that there is not a second severe outbreak, the economic consequences will be devastating too,” he said. “I believe that what’s good for the public health will indeed be good for the economy.”
Still, Garber maintains that, despite his expertise, he doesn’t know everything. Administrators say the school is consulting with state and public health officials as they plan for the future, including forthcoming decisions regarding the fall semester.
Harvard administrators have a long list of decisions to make regarding the future of the University during an unpredictable crisis. For Garber, running marathons is “helpful” to prepare for the challenges higher education face today, a test of his own endurance.
“Running marathons helps you understand that the finish line may always seem too far in the distance, and you need to adjust your efforts accordingly,” Garber said. “One thing you know as a marathon runner is that when people think that they're about to run a five mile race and it turns into a marathon it's devastating. But if you know you're in it for the long haul, it’s doable.”

Until the beginning of this year, Chemistry Department Chair Charles M. Lieber — who had been appointed a University Professor, Harvard’s highest faculty honor, in 2017 — was primarily known as a celebrated chemist and renowned nanoscientist.
Since late January, however, he has been thrust into a larger spotlight, awaiting trial after being federally charged with providing fraudulent statements to U.S. government officials in relation to undisclosed work with the Chinese government.
On January 28, Lieber was arrested on one count of lying to the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health about his involvement with the Wuhan University of Technology and the Thousand Talents Plan, a research recruitment program funded by the Chinese government.
In a press release, the U.S. Department of Justice described the TTP as a Chinese initiative that aims to “lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information.”
Charging documents accused Lieber of signing a five-year contract with WUT as a “strategic scientist” in November 2011 and a three-year contract with the TTP in June 2012. His responsibilities included publishing papers and organizing conferences in the name of WUT, accepting several WUT students as visiting scholars, and organizing a Harvard-WUT joint research laboratory in Wuhan. Lieber was offered up to $50,000 per month contingent on his work time in China, living expenses of around $158,000 over three years, and approximately $1.74 million in research funds for the joint laboratory.
The affidavit described Lieber’s primary charges as his false claim to the Department of Defense that he had never been recruited by the TTP, and a fraudulent interview with Harvard authorities, which led the University to misinform the NIH that Lieber had not been associated with WUT since 2012 and was never a member of the TTP.
U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in an interview with Science magazine that his primary concern with Lieber’s case was the large payments involved in the contracts.
“It was the amount of money involved that drew our attention,” Lelling said. “That is a corrupting level of money.”
Marc L. Mukasey, Lieber’s trial counsel, refuted any claims of dishonesty against Lieber in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
“There is nothing corrupt about Charlie Lieber,” he wrote.
Lieber was released after accepting a $1 million bail agreement and surrendering his and his wife’s U.S. passports. Harvard placed him on paid administrative leave, and he has since been replaced as Chemistry department chair by interim co-chairs Theodore A. Betley and Daniel Kahne.
Lieber’s reputation has since become closely linked to his interactions with China, at times even leading to false conspiracy theories online suggesting that Lieber created and sold the novel coronavirus.
Mukasey wrote that such claims are baseless and “brainless.”
“Theories linking him to the coronavirus are 1,000% false,” Mukasey wrote. “That’s the brainless musing of morons on social media.”
Lieber, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence as he awaits trial. Mukasey wrote that he plans to prove Lieber is the victim in this case and not the perpetrator.
“Professor Lieber has dedicated his life to science and to his students. Not money, not fame, just his science and his students,” Mukasey wrote. “But he’s also a fighter — he always has been — so we’re not taking this lying down. We’re fighting back.”
“And when justice is done, Charlie’s good name will be restored and the scientific community again will be able to benefit from his intellect and passion,” he added.
At the heart of Lieber’s case is his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan — and his subsequent failure to disclose TTP funding to Harvard and U.S. government officials.
Founded in 2008, the TTP offers funding to attract skilled academics and researchers to Chinese institutions.
“The Thousand Talent Program that was mentioned as part of the case at Harvard has been quite fabulous and popular,” said Maria Repnikova, the director of the Center for Global Information Studies at Georgia State University. “They are attracting these individuals with resources and creating an environment for them that might not be feasible to create in some of the Western universities.”
In the charging documents against Lieber, FBI agent Robert Plumb described the TTP as a program that “incentivizes” U.S. researchers to transmit knowledge gained in the U.S. to China.
“The Chinese Talent programs have rewarded individuals for stealing proprietary information and violating export controls,” Plumb wrote.
Several academics said such academic recruitment is typical within the field of higher education.
“Harvard is home to many of the leading scholars in the world,” said Michael A. Szonyi, the director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard. “And so if you were trying to build a world-class department or world-class laboratory, it only makes sense that you would try to recruit the skills and talents of people from Harvard.”
China studies professor William C. Kirby, who also chairs the Harvard China Fund, said attracting distinguished talent is a fundamental characteristic of higher education institutions.
“Recruitment and retention is what universities do. You do not want a faculty that nobody else wants. Otherwise you’ve got the wrong faculty,” Kirby said. “So if somebody is not trying to steal your faculty, you have the wrong faculty.”
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Ross McKinney Jr., the Chief Scientific Officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, wrote that Chinese-based faculty recruitment works similarly to U.S.-based faculty recruitment.
“China is trying to acquire talent, which is no different than Harvard trying to recruit from Yale,” McKinney wrote. “It’s not my impression their search is limited to U.S. universities. They’re happy to recruit talent from wherever good science is happening.”
The U.S. government, however, has accused the TTP of stealing proprietary information and knowledge from U.S. institutions. In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy barred all researchers from participating in the TTP. Subsequently, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security declared the program a threat to American interests.
Some familiar with the TTP were reluctant to label its practices as academic espionage.
Tim Byrnes, a physics professor at New York University Shanghai and a member of the TTP, said the program’s system of offering increased funding to top researchers is not dissimilar from other international grant programs.
“This type of system where adding top-ups and adding extra amounts of money, I would say, is not unheard of,” he said. “It’s not a completely China-only type of phenomenon.”
Szonyi, however, noted that disclosure is essential to academic collaboration. Typically, university personnel must report all funding sources for academic ventures outside of their home university; Harvard, for instance, requires faculty to disclose outside funding to the Office of the Vice Provost for Research.
“I think that it’s not right to call [the TTP] espionage. That is simply Chinese universities trying to engage with the leading scholars in the world,” Szonyi said. “To the extent that I’ve worried that that is a gray area, there are actually people at Harvard whose full time job is to receive and evaluate my disclosures.”
Kirby added that there is no coercive element to participation in the TTP.
“First of all, the last that I understood, there actually is freedom of movement in this country and people are free to choose where they would work,” he said. “So no one is being kidnapped, no one is being stolen. It’s the job of universities to find talent and then to try to bring the best of it to their own university.”
In light of international criticism of the TTP, the Chinese government stopped promoting the program in national media in September 2018.
Byrnes said Lieber’s nondisclosure of his interactions with the TTP may have been due to the increasing stigma against the program.
“In the case of Professor Lieber, probably what happened is that he received this thing before it had this kind of negative spin on it,” he said. “It became inconvenient at some point to have this connection, so he tried to cover it up so that he wouldn’t be penalized for other opportunities, like within the U.S., for example. And then that obviously backfired terribly for him.”
Byrnes added that he believes academia and international conflicts should become more separated in the future, so that researchers can focus on intellectual pursuits instead of politics.
“Researchers are not interested in politics or this kind of power struggle between countries – researchers just really want to do top level research and that’s true in the U.S. and China,” he said. “But I think it is a difficult time because, as I said, China’s just really emerged and how to deal with this is kind of a concern of many countries.”
Lieber’s arrest marks merely the latest incident in the long and complicated history of Harvard’s role in U.S.-China relations. Formal relationships between Harvard and China have existed since 1879, when the University hired its first Chinese language instructor.
Szonyi said the U.S.-China academic relationship has been characterized by two key aspects: deeper academic collaboration in the last few decades and an overall deterioration in the two countries’ relations in the last couple of years.
According to the Harvard International Office, Chinese nationals represented 22 percent of the international student population at Harvard in the 2019-2020 academic year. Nationwide, Chinese nationals comprise a third of the international student population, with over 360,000 students enrolled in U.S. universities.
Claude Barfield, a former consultant to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said uneasy relationships with China reflect a larger trend beyond the politics of a given presidential administration.
“The U.S. and China were moving toward some type of contentious relationship, even before the Trump presidency,” Barfield said. “The Chinese had refused to change their market protectionism, huge subsidies given to the companies. They were causing problems all over the South China Sea, threatening the U.S. alliance.”
Others pointed to additional factors that have soured the U.S.-China relationship.
“You also have an American administration that appears to have the need for an adversary, even if some of them are our allies, in order to bolster itself domestically,” Kirby said. “It’s not just the Trump administration, but there’s a greater consensus in the political establishment — a fear of where China may be going.”
“There are also increasing concerns about sharing data, as well as collaborating in the area of science and technology, which relates to the case of the arrest at Harvard,” Repnikova added.
Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said in an April interview that China’s growing economy and technological advancements may have also contributed to U.S. efforts to “outcompete” China.
“My personal view is if you look at the geostrategic balance, this country sees China as challenging its world supremacy, and China is investing more in science and technology than the U.S. is by some normalization metric,” he said.
Due to these concerns, the U.S. federal government has increasingly cracked down on cases deemed as “academic espionage.” The FBI has examined more than 1,000 cases of Chinese theft of U.S. technology, many of which have been connected with research on university campuses.
In a March seminar on academic security, FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said the threat of Chinese academic espionage is one of the nation’s largest security challenges.
“In my 25 years with the FBI, we have faced a lot of challenging threats,” he said. “One that stands out right now as the greatest long-term threat to our nation’s information and ideas and to our economic vitality and leadership is the threat from the Chinese government.”
Lieber’s arrest was just one of many the FBI made in the first half of 2020. On the day of his arraignment, the FBI also announced investigations into two other cases in the Boston area.
Barfield characterized Lieber’s arrest as propagated by the larger context of FBI investigations into U.S.-China relations.
“I think Lieber just got caught in the larger decision that the United States would try to reduce universities’ Chinese relationship here in the United States,” he said. “The worry was that — and is that — you’ve got Chinese researchers who are not really independent.”
Szonyi cautioned that current allegations of widespread academic espionage may be overstated.
“I am absolutely confident that the vast majority of collaborations are academic in nature and should not be characterized as espionage, but rather as knowledge sharing and actually doing what it is that academics do,” he said.
However, Szonyi said there are many gray areas that could constitute espionage. The predominant belief is that scholars should benefit financially when a technology or idea they developed has “practical business implications.”
“That’s relatively straightforward if the idea or the application or the technology is monetized in the United States, but what if it’s monetized in China?” Szonyi said. “From that scholar’s perspective, what the scholar is doing is exactly the same.”
Since Lieber’s arrest, several Harvard administrators have said they support the University’s policies for funding and research disclosure, despite the procedures’ limitations.
Stubbs said in April that the charges against Lieber did not trigger any changes in the current internal review processes. Harvard announced two new research oversight committees last November: one to review sensitive research projects and the other to examine whether Faculty of Arts and Sciences policies comply with federal funding agency guidelines.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a March interview with The Crimson that Harvard is unable to investigate faculty members’ “outside engagements” and instead relies on their “honesty and good faith” to follow appropriate University procedures.
“I think one of the things that we’re struggling with is instances of non-disclosure and how do we take steps to try to identify those instances, given that we’re not a law enforcement agency and we’re not an intelligence agency,” Stubbs said. “We’re working hard to step up and play our role in this evolving landscape of vigilance.”
Lynn Pasquerella — the president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities, which represents nearly 1,400 U.S. institutions of higher education — said any oversight must take into account systemic issues of race.
In August 2019, the AAC&U signed onto a statement urging the federal government to protect the due process and privacy of Chinese students in the face of increased efforts to combat academic espionage.
“We’ve seen an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and bias incidents, and so this provides a backdrop for looking at policies — that even if they are not intended to target or discriminate against individuals from China — have that impact as a fact,” Pasquerella said.
The impact of increased scrutiny into Chinese ties could serve as a deterrent for academic exchange, according to Repnikova.
“At the very least, this creates a lot of anxiety amongst individuals from China — scholars or scientists who are working at American universities — about the extent of the stability of their position, but also the extent of their freedom,” she said.
Kirby said international collaboration is crucial to advancing the “next generations of research.”
“If there are artificial limits on the kind of individuals who can come here, this sets us back, particularly in science and technology. How that is to American advantage is, for me, impossible to imagine,” he said.
Harvard administrators have also emphasized the importance of ongoing collaborations with Chinese and other foreign universities.
Bacow said in March that working with other institutions is crucial to fulfilling Harvard’s goals.
“It’s important that we engage with faculty and scholars in different parts of the world,” he said. “This is, in fact, how we succeed in addressing some of the greatest challenges that we confront.”
Stubbs said in February that “unwritten norms and expectations of conduct” are significant factors in ensuring prosperous relationships between Harvard and other universities.
“We’re wrestling to come to an understanding of how to strike a balance between supporting free and open research in scholarship with some underlying expectation of good conduct in the face of some instances that seem to not conform to those expectations,” he said.
Pasquerella echoed Stubbs’ sentiments, noting that collaboration between people of diverse backgrounds is crucial to addressing global challenges.
“I always come back to the need for global collaboration and addressing the problems for the future, as opposed to nationalistic tendencies that are focused on protecting America-first ideologies,” she said.

Brendan J. Kiely ’23 began keeping a “coronavirus diary” on April 18, about a month after he and fellow undergraduates had been dismissed from campus due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
“After we got the news, everyone scrambled to get plans together, to store stuff and get stuff home,” Kiely said. “Nobody was super concerned about classes for the rest of the week. There were lots of parties. That's what I remember best.”
Kiely was one of approximately 225 students to record their personal experiences during the pandemic, as part of a journaling initiative launched by history instructor Zachary B. Nowak.
Twice a week, Nowak sent out prompts designed to encourage Harvard affiliates to reflect on their memories of the ongoing crisis and challenges they have faced. Student diaries have documented the first time they heard about COVID-19 and took it to be a serious threat and about changes to their end-of-semester and summer plans.
The project aims to preserve stories and evidence of this historical moment for future generations.
“The prompts are things that I'm interested in, things I think future historians will want to know,” Nowak said. “It's a little nudge to students twice a week to take a moment and not just write on Facebook or Instagram or TikTok or whatever. Not that those are bad things, but they're just ephemeral.”
Francesca M. Hess ’20, a participant in Nowak’s initiative, said her diary has attempted to capture not only her own experiences but also her many interactions with friends, family, and even the elderly she serves as part of Meals on Wheels in New York City.
“I document a lot of the conversations I have with them, such as one in particular with a woman who was unable to leave her house for over 70 days,” Hess said. “And she talks about how living through World War II has given her the toolkit to live through this.”
Hess added that she is trying to purposely include other peoples’ narratives in her journal.
At the end of May, Nowak hopes to collect the participants’ diaries so they can be added to the Harvard University Archives.
“This is one of a number of different efforts to really capture the student perspective, and to some extent the staff perspective, of this epidemic, because in 100 years, it's going to be super easy for any historian to write the institutional history, the response of the Harvard president and the administrators and the deans,” Nowak said. “All that stuff makes it into the archive very easily. But it's much less likely that students’ voices will be in the archives, so I really wanted to try to do that.”
During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the Harvard Archives mostly preserved administrative documents, instead of records affiliates’ personal experiences.
“One of the first things we did was look back in time in Harvard's history to look for similar situations, in order to understand how the University reacted at that time,” University archivist Megan Sniffin-Marinoff said.
“There were aspects of what happened in 1918 that weren't particularly well-documented,” she added. “We had an opportunity in hindsight to fix that, this time around.”
The solution, Sniffin-Marinoff and her colleagues decided, would be the Community Archive, a platform for students, faculty, alumni, and staff to submit “materials that were perhaps a bit more personal” and “less official.”
“What we're getting is more of an emotional response to the incident rather than more of an administrative, ‘how do we deal with this’ response, which is the normal part of our work,” Sniffin-Marinoff said.
Several other Harvard-affiliated institutions have undertaken similar efforts to preserve relics of the pandemic. Harvard Business School has been documenting its faculty’s research on the pandemic, according to Business School Archivist Rachel Wise. Harvard Medical School has been conducting oral-history-style interviews with faculty and staff at Harvard-affiliated hospitals.
“I think that people are very conscious that they're living through a very momentous experience, and conscious of taking photos and recording stories and making sure that the documents that are being created are sent or saved and sent to the archives,” Wise said.
The varied submissions to the community archiving projects — including Snapchat images and electronic calendars filled with Zoom meetings — have already painted a complex picture of the emotional effects of the COVID pandemic on Harvard affiliates, Sniffin-Marinoff said.
Wise said her favorite submission so far is a photo depicting a completely empty subway station, sent by a staff member at the Business School’s Japan Research Center.
“I think it's a mixture of confusion and a little bit of grief,” she said. “There's hope in there too. Some people have submitted information that is related to people they know who have passed away during this period, which is very sorrowful. Other people have experienced people surviving it, and so there's joy in that as well. It's a mix of emotions.”
University Librarian and Vice President for Harvard Library Martha Whitehead wrote in an email that the coronavirus pandemic has emphasized the importance of libraries and archives.
“I think one role of libraries is to serve as both a witness to and a steward of human experience,” Whitehead wrote. “With that in mind, right now we’re doing our best to capture history even as we’re living through it.”
In a spring course taught by English professor Beth Blum, students were tasked with writing a chapter of their “own Harvard novel.” Not surprisingly, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic became a popular subject.
“They were very quick to find insights and skills to make their own contribution to Harvard's literary archive of this moment,” Blum said of her students.
After students in ENGLISH 90HN: “The Harvard Novel,” were dismissed from campus, they began to contribute to a class-wide quarantine diary posted on the course website.
Rachel F. Tropp ’20, a student in Blum’s course, said she went from solely reading about previous students’ experiences at Harvard to becoming an active contributor to the University’s narrative and the author of her own Harvard story.
“We all seemed to realize that we might also be living in a time when it's interesting to write down things that we're feeling — like loneliness and anxiety — in our diaries, and it might actually be relevant and interesting to future readers at Harvard,” Tropp said. “A lot of people in the class were also seniors, and we found that leaving Harvard was a good chance to reflect on Harvard.”
History of Science lecturer David S. Unger also encouraged his students to contribute to the preservation of Harvard affiliates’ memories of the pandemic.
Unger’s course HISTSCI191: “Harvard’s Changing Landscape” featured an oral history capstone project. Rather than having his students document the SEAS campus’ move to Allston, Unger asked them to interview fellow undergraduates, resident deans, and graduate students about their experiences with Harvard’s campus closure this spring. Video recordings of these interviews were compiled on a website called “Harvard from Home.”
While the course project is currently being maintained in partnership with the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, Unger said he hopes to connect with the University archives and establish an “institutional home” for his course’s project.
“I would love to make sure that we work with all of these different groups to make all this stuff visible, so that if in the next year or five years or 10 years, someone’s writing a senior thesis about experiences during the pandemic, they'll not have to search odd corners of the internet,” Unger said.
Unger acknowledged that current historians cannot “see the big picture” in the way that future historians will, which is why they need to document as much as possible now.
“Time passes, and you lose things. You forget things, and although at the moment this all seems so intense, it'll fade, it'll be fuzzy, we'll forget little details,” he added.
Alex S. Cohen ’20, another student in Blum’s course, said he thinks keeping records of this pandemic will help prepare for a future global crisis.
“To see the last time the United States had a really serious pandemic like this with significant social ramifications, you probably have to go all the way back to the Spanish Flu, whereas countries in East Asia have recently been exposed to other illnesses in a pandemic setting, like SARS,” Cohen said. “They already are doing better than us, because they have had recent experience to learn from and take necessary precautions.”
While historians, archivists, and students alike have focused on preserving records of the ongoing pandemic, the closure and subsequent phased reopening of Harvard libraries, museums, and laboratories has also raised new questions about the accessibility of pre-existing archival records.
With the public stuck at home, the Harvard Library had the perfect opportunity to launch its first crowd-sourced transcription project spanning archives across the University. This initiative, seven years in the making, aimed to digitize over 700,000 pages of 17th- and 18th-century manuscripts in Harvard’s collections.
J. Ross Mulcare, a University archivist, said the number of contributors to the transcription project doubled when it was opened up to the public. According to Mulcare, five to 10 new individuals are now signing up to work on the project each day.
“The project is sitting — sort of its genesis and its reason for existing — in this moment of the Library still trying to connect to the public,” Mulcare said. “We want to make sure our material is there when people need it, and that they can sort of feel like they have some agency in enhancing the collections.”
Likewise, Harvard Art Museums Director Martha P. Tedeschi noted that Art Museums staff have found digital avenues to engage broader audiences.
“This situation of having to close our doors to our visitors, as well as the Harvard community, has really been the opportunity for us to zero in on what we can do virtually, to engage those same audiences and to also help with remote teaching, to serve remote research,” she said. “So we have gone gangbusters into the digital realm.”
Sniffin-Marinoff said the University Archives are also exploring ways to preserve digital materials, such as more frequently archiving Harvard-affiliated websites with messages about COVID-19. Still, she said physical materials are here to stay.
“I kind of expect when we get back, there'll be a giant pile of mail that we're going to go through,” she said.
Cristina Morilla, associate paintings conservator at the Harvard Art Museums, wrote in an email that while staff have not been able to work directly with pieces in the collections, conservation efforts have still proceeded amid the pandemic from staff members’ living rooms.
“The hands-on component of conservation has been stopped, obviously, but this is just part of our job,” Morilla wrote. “Before starting any intervention we have a lot of work to do: analyze and document the painting, interpret the results obtained from scientific analysis (X-ray, and infrared photography, for example), and discuss among colleagues the treatment to be performed.”
Prior to the enforcement of stay-at-home guidelines, conservators at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard Art Museums would conduct hands-on treatment of more than 7,000 pieces each year, according to an email from Straus Center director Narayan Khandekar.
The coronavirus pandemic has impacted not only the way art is conserved but also the way it is created. Artistic work will play an important part in the recovery from the pandemic, according to Emily R. Novak Gustainis, the deputy director of the Countway Medical Library. The Medical School has partnered with the American Repertory Theater to develop performances based on the oral histories they are collecting.
“The idea is that the art and humanities can help people process the experiences that they've been through and essentially help with the healing process,” Gustainis said.
Tedeschi reaffirmed the importance of art created during the pandemic, even if the only audience right now is the artist.
“I think for so many of us who have never worked remotely before, who are isolated from our colleagues, who are isolated from our public, our audiences, our clients, it’s hard to think on a daily basis that what you're doing is still important,” she said. “But I hope that that doesn't make people feel that there's no point to preserving what they're doing.”

In 2008, a graduate student described her experience walking around campus and searching for Harvard to former University President Drew G. Faust.
“She said she arrived to join the Kennedy School, and she started walking around looking for Harvard, and she couldn't find Harvard,” Faust said. “There was the College. There was the Kennedy School. There was the Law School. But where was Harvard?”
Comments like those led Faust to undertake one of the first major projects of her presidency: convening a committee tasked with fostering connection and interaction on campus. She called it the “common spaces initiative.”
In the twelve years since, the committee has transformed the physical footprint of Harvard’s campus. Its crowning achievement, completed in 2018, was the renovation of the Smith Campus Center — a building that houses administrative offices, cafes, study rooms, and a large public commons.
Before the common spaces initiative, the message to those walking through Harvard’s campus was “keep moving” and “don’t talk to anybody,” according Lizabeth A. Cohen, History professor and former co-chair of the Common Spaces Committee.
Roughly a year-and-a-half after the University completed its renovation of the Center, many of the space’s planners said it has fulfilled their vision as a place that serves both Harvard affiliates and the public.
“We’ve seen people meeting up with friends or colleagues, and others quietly studying. We’ve seen passersby enjoying a performance, others spending quality alone time, or engaging in exciting impromptu collaborations,” Tanya D. Iatridis, senior director of University planning, wrote in an emailed statement. “It’s being used exactly as we had planned and hoped.”
But the space’s status has brought challenges, too. The planners intended to create both a Harvard-focused community center and a public building open to Cambridge residents, but controversies over the treatment of non-affiliates and homeless individuals have highlighted the difficulty of striking that balance. Affiliates say the campus center has fulfilled its promise, but perhaps only for some.
Faust said the common spaces initiative was one of her first priorities as president.
“I had a sense that Harvard was very fragmented into its separate schools and separate identities and workplaces,” she said. “The notion of having a space where people could share ideas and bump into each other and benefit from the extraordinary extent of expertise and knowledge and experience that Harvard represented was a big part of what inspired this.”
To help solve that issue of fragmentation, she created a task force that suggested several projects, collectively known as the common spaces plan.
“[The plan] articulated a spine that ran through the campus from the quad all the way, really, down to the river with several sort of moments and places of intervention, where there could be interaction, where we might intervene and create spaces for people to get together to have intellectual as well as social exchange,” Cohen said.
Before renovating whole buildings, the group started small: they placed chairs in the middle of Harvard Yard. Cohen said placing the chairs in the Yard was “a crucial moment of recognizing that the campus is a kind of hybrid public-private space.”
Still, the arrival of chairs — which today cost around $381 each — also brought unexpected wrinkles.
“The chairs were actually chained down at night. There were some chairs that we put that ended up in dormitory rooms, and we had some amnesties where you could bring your chair back without any punishment,” Cohen said.
In the end, though, the chairs stayed largely in place.
“It was all these fears that really turned out not to be a problem,” she said.
After situating the chairs, the committee moved onto its capstone project: transforming the former Holyoke Center into the Smith Campus Center. The effort was always a component of the common spaces plan, but it would require extensive planning.
“The Holyoke Center was visualized as a heart but we knew that was probably way down the road,” Cohen said.
Indeed, the planning process for the Smith Campus Center included 30 public meetings, 25 focus groups, 6,000 responses to a campus-wide survey, and numerous other discussions.
“One of the things we did was have a lot of focus groups with graduate students, with undergraduates, with staff, faculty, and the overwhelming sentiment that was expressed was that, you know, there's nowhere to go,” Cohen said.
Cohen said that, throughout the planning process, the committee wanted to ensure the space fulfilled many different functions. For example, they fought to make the top floors accessible to more than just the administrators who worked there.
“We always knew that the building would have to be shared between administrative functions and this campus center,” she said. “We could have the sort of bottom three floors and then the top — we argued very hard for that top, because we felt that those views really belong to everyone.”
Cohen said a lot of consideration also went into the types of restaurants that would be invited into the campus center.
“What we did not want was for the Holyoke Center to be kind of threatening to the Square. We actually wanted to enhance the commercial success of the Square, and we argued that this will actually get people off of the campus into the Square and into the city,” she said.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the renovated center has been a “tremendous benefit” to the Square. While six new restaurants in the Smith Center bring more choices to customers, Jillson said their openings have had a “minimal impact” on existing businesses.
“If anything, you know, there’s historically enough business to go around for everybody,” she explained.
Joseph Papa, manager of Mike’s Pastry on Dunster Street — which sits directly across from the Smith Center — said that any competition is “good overall” for business.
“If there’s a reason people are coming into Harvard Square, we’re really pro,” Papa said. “ I think the more businesses in Harvard Square that are thriving and are busy and have foot traffic, I just think everyone benefits from it.”
Lawrence Margulies, president of Pavement Coffeehouse, said the University’s focus on working with local businesses helped him to afford to operate in a location that would ordinarily be out of reach. Pavement occupies a space toward the front of the Center often trafficked by both students and tourists, though Margulies said the former group comprises the largest share of his customer base.
“They really helped put us in a place that we normally wouldn't have been able to attain in terms of what Harvard Square rents are going for. They really looked to only work with small local businesses inside the Smith Center, as opposed to just regional or national players,” Margulies said. “They made it so we could get a foot in the door.”
Despite the campus center’s open doors, Pavement’s student-dominated customer base is perhaps no accident.
Robert Winters, a mathematics instructor at the Harvard Extension School and MIT and editor of a blog on Cambridge politics, said that, even when spaces are designated as publicly accessible, in practice, they are often underutilized by the public.
“The overwhelming majority of people will still be the affiliates,” he said. “Unless you do extensive outreach to try and draw people in, it's inevitably going to be relatively minimally used by people other than affiliates.”
“Should Harvard, for example, be really going out of their way to promote Smith Center, as well as the plaza, as a true public place? Maybe. Maybe, I mean if that's really what their vision was they probably should stick to it,” Winters said. “But it was the student center and probably, I guess in most people's view, still is and will probably remain that way, regardless of any intention.”
Some affiliates said the campus center’s rules also favor Harvard-only events, particularly those run by undergraduates. This academic year, 70 percent of room reservations in the Smith Center came from students, Julie A. Crites, director of common spaces, wrote in an email.
Graduate School of Design student Patrick C. Braga said he encountered difficulties while trying to book a space at the Smith Center for a short public concert.
“It feels like the ability for students to — especially graduate students who don't have access to all the facilities in houses — to be able to use common spaces like the Smith Center or other places on campus for events is just not at all transparent,” Braga said. “And that opacity makes it really difficult to make things happen on campus.”
“I didn't feel very satisfied with the process for using the Smith Center as a space for a public event, in part because it's kind of the one building on campus that very deliberately tries not to be stuck just within one school,” he added.
In an emailed statement responding to Braga’s criticism, University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke said the common spaces office is committed to opening its spaces up for a variety of purposes.
“The office recognizes that students or groups often come together for short-term or even one-time projects, and as such has begun looking at potentially refining the requirements for booking space across campus,” she wrote.
While the Smith Campus Center opens its doors to people from all backgrounds, building staff still reserve the right to enforce certain expectations.
As noted in a building user guide on Harvard’s website for its common spaces, campus center staff enforce certain guidelines that help create “comfortable, convivial gathering spaces” for students, faculty, academic personnel, staff, and visitors alike.
These guidelines include keeping noise to appropriate levels, sharing the space and facilities, cleaning up, and staying awake. Prohibited activities include drug use, playing music on personal speakers, and solicitation.
When visitors do not meet these expectations, security guards may step in or report them to the Harvard University Police Department — which assigns officers to patrol the common spaces during operating hours.
Since the reopening of the Smith Center, HUPD officers are often dispatched to the building to respond to reports of “unwanted guests,” according to the department’s public crime log.
In the winter months, these reports frequently involve violations of the building's no-sleeping policy — a policy that has drawn criticism from witnesses. Security guards and HUPD officers often wake up homeless visitors and others who fall asleep in the campus center.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano highlighted that the department’s priority is responding to “inappropriate or illegal behavior” committed on campus, regardless of an individual’s background.
“Although some of the complaints have been associated with persons who self-identify as homeless, the Department is concerned about inappropriate or illegal behavior committed on campus regardless of the status or affiliation of person(s) involved,” Catalano wrote in a statement Friday. “In the event that misconduct, including sleeping in the Common Spaces, or criminal activity is reported to the HUPD, officers will respond to the location and take appropriate action.”
But one HUPD officer’s conduct in the campus center has sparked further concerns. In recent months, the Smith Center’s goal of fostering “comfortable, convivial” common spaces for all visitors has been challenged by a HUPD officer’s interactions with homeless individuals.
HUPD Officer Anthony T. Carvello — who patrolled the Center beginning in January 2020 — was criticized for his use of force in three separate trespassing arrests at the Smith Center, which all involved young homeless black men.
In September 2019, Carvello put his hand on one man’s neck during an arrest, according to video footage. The man said in an interview with The Crimson that he could not breathe when Carvello grabbed him.
Carvello wrote in a police report four months later that he used pepper spray on another man three times to make an arrest. That man said in a conversation with a HUPD sergeant after the arrest and in an interview with The Crimson that Carvello — who is white — called him a racial slur.
In February 2020, Carvello was criticized again for pushing a man onto the ground while making an arrest. Witnesses and three HUPD officers familiar with the incident said they believe Carvello used excessive force on the man.
Catalano wrote that the department reviewed these three incidents and concluded Carvello’s actions were within HUPD’s guidelines.
“For all three arrests in question there were supervisory reviews of the use of force. In all three incidents the supervisor found that the force was reasonable and within HUPD’s Policies and Guidelines,” Catalano wrote in a statement in March.
But the challenges posed by the Smith Center’s public-private status are now on hold, as the coronavirus pandemic has emptied the space entirely.
The building — which was built on principles of collaboration and engagement — has been largely devoid of visitors since the University sent most students home in mid-March and the state issued a stay-at-home advisory later that month.
Crites, the common spaces director, wrote in a statement that places like the Smith Campus Center will remain a valuable space for collaboration during these uncertain times.
“As we build the on-ramp to ‘new normal,’ and all of us grapple with the loss and grief that is part of our collective experience, spaces to gather safely will be just as important – if not more so – than before,” Crites wrote.
Faust said that difficulties with collaboration during the pandemic have changed the way people work together, and in effect, the definition of a common space.
“It seems so horrible now that we're all separated, we can't be in touch with each other, and we can't come together,” Faust said.
But when Harvard’s campus comes to life again, Faust said common spaces, and particularly the Smith Center, will become more necessary than ever before.
“I think, at its essence, a university and a college of a residential nature is about people coming together and people discovering individuals that they might not otherwise have met and interacting with them and learning from one another,” Faust said.
“I think that's what the Smith Center vision is about, and that's what I hope it will embody,” she added.

For years, the Harvard Republican Club has sought to welcome “everyone to the right of Marx,” according to former member M. Tyler Jenkins ’19.
In a sense, the club can’t afford to be too picky. At a university that President Richard M. Nixon once called the “Kremlin on the Charles,” politically conservative students have long been a small minority, and their beliefs have ranged widely across the right half of the political spectrum.
But Donald Trump’s presidency has thrown a new wrench into the club’s commitment to “big-tent” conservatism and has divided college-aged Republicans between those who support the president and those who do not.
In August 2016, the Harvard Republican Club made waves on national media when it split from its party for the first time in its 128-year history, refusing to support Trump’s bid for president.
In the aftermath of Trump’s election, however, a new faction of conservative undergraduates emerged on campus. These students were dissatisfied with the club’s stated opposition to the Trump administration and attempted to stage a takeover of the club’s leadership.
This year, the Harvard Republicans are gearing up for a critical choice: whether or not to support the president who has won broad support from Republicans nationwide, yet has continued to employ the type of divisive rhetoric that worried club leadership so deeply four years ago.
Few students on Harvard’s campus initially took Trump’s campaign in the 2016 Republican primary very seriously: Students who gathered at debate watch parties were often entertained by Trump’s unapologetic demeanor, but hardly any saw him as a viable candidate, even in conservative circles.
A straw poll conducted at the beginning of the 2016 primaries found that Harvard Republican Club members were almost equally divided between Senator Marco A. Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with no support at all for Trump. Official club campaign activities focused on those two candidates, and club members took several trips up to New Hampshire to knock doors.
In February 2016, both Aaron I. Henricks ’16, former club president, and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, a former vice president, said they knew most self-professed conservatives on campus, but did not know of any Harvard students who supported Trump.
“I think I’ve heard rumors of one existing, maybe in the far reaches of the Quad, but I don’t think they’re serious,” Henricks joked at the time.
But as the primaries progressed and Trump’s candidacy became more serious, the club’s leadership became increasingly concerned with his potential nomination.
Many conservatives already felt it was difficult enough to speak their views on Harvard’s overwhelmingly liberal campus. But now their party was moving toward nominating a candidate that drew virulent opposition from their classmates.
After Bush and Rubio dropped out of the race, the Harvard Republicans’ campaigning efforts slowed to a standstill. The club’s president at the time, Gwen R. Thomas ’17, said the group would not endorse a Trump nomination.
Later that spring, Thomas decided to take the fall semester off and passed on leadership of the club to Declan P. Garvey ’17. The club headed into the summer planning to focus its fall activities on down-ballot races.
“While I’m sure some of you, myself included, are not incredibly thrilled with the top of our ticket, there will be plenty of opportunities to get involved in the campaign: helping Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, state-level races here in Massachusetts, and general conservative activism,” Garvey wrote in a club-wide email.
That same summer, however, some club members began to float the idea of putting out a statement more forceful than Thomas’s non-endorsement. A board member sent a message to the board’s group chat proposing the idea of a “complete rejection of Trump” written by the executive board.
This statement, the board member argued, could help position the club as the “vanguard” of the “Never Trump” movement for college Republicans across the country.
Shortly after, Garvey sent club members a poll to gauge whether or not they believed the club should take a stronger stance opposing Trump. After a few days, Garvey shared the results: 80 percent of respondents indicated they were not planning to support Trump in November, while 10 percent would support him and 10 percent remained undecided.
That night, the club put out its official statement, refusing to support the Republican nominee for the first time in its history.
“Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic,” the statement read. “He is looking to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children.”
The statement went viral and attracted attention from national news media. Club members went on CNN and MSNBC to explain the decision and field questions from political commentators.
“Especially in the mainstream press, there was an appetite for highlighting conservative voices criticizing the president,” Garvey said in an May 21 interview with The Crimson.
Not everyone approved of the board’s statement. Alex J. Cullen ’18, a board member who supported Trump, said he wished he had pushed back on the decision.
“I wish that I would have been the voice — even if nobody else was on my side — to question and to prod and say, ‘why are we making this decision?’” Cullen said in an interview. “There was never dialogue about it. It was sort of an understood thing.”
The club’s statement also placed a heavy strain on its relationship with the Republican National Committee. W. Kent Haeffner ’18, a board member who co-authored the statement, said that he had been interning at the RNC that summer and got an angry call from Sean M. Spicer, then the RNC’s communications director, after Haeffner appeared on CNN discussing the club’s decision.
Later that year, the RNC barred the Harvard Republicans from using the party’s official elephant logo on club t-shirts due to the club’s “failure to support the Republican Party’s presidential nominee.”
An RNC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Nevertheless, Garvey said years later that he never had any regrets about publishing the statement.
“It became a lot easier to be a vocal member and a proud member of the club after the disavowal of Trump,” Garvey said. “People could make that distinction between being a conservative and being a Trump conservative.”
With the media furor around the club, interest in joining the Harvard Republicans spiked at the beginning of the following school year. Incoming freshmen reached out to the club to get involved before the year even began, and more than 130 people attended the club’s introductory meeting in 2016, compared to about 30 students at a similar meeting the previous year.
While the club’s stance on Trump remained the same, opinions varied as to which presidential candidate the club should throw its support behind instead. Based on the poll Garvey had sent out earlier that summer, almost half of the respondents who disavowed Trump planned to support Libertarian Party nominee Gary E. Johnson, while a quarter planned to back Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton.
Other members of the club felt that none of the candidates were good options. A poster advertising the club’s first meeting prominently stated, “Crooked Hillary? Demagogue Donald? How About Neither?”
Instead of campaigning for Trump, the club focused its canvassing efforts on then-Senator Kelly A. Ayotte’s (R-N.H.) re-election.
But Trump’s election in November 2016 was a shock to the club’s internal politics. All of a sudden, the club was forced to reckon with its position under the administration of a president it had denounced just months prior.
Trump supporters became more visible following the election, both in the club and on campus at large, according to Jenkins, who was elected to the board as secretary that fall.
“There was a Trump contingency on campus, and a lot of people didn’t know that they were Trump supporters,” Jenkins said.
“Those people really came out of the woodwork,” he added. “That came out much more when Trump was entering office.”
Over the months after Trump’s inauguration, a couple of small but growing factions within the club began to grow displeased with the group’s continued distancing from its own party’s president.
Jacob N. Russell ’19, a self-described member of one of those factions who said he previously worked on the Trump campaign and transition team, wrote to The Crimson that he thought the club needed to live up to its moniker as an organization for Republicans, not just conservatives.
“By bearing that name we represent the Republican Party on campus,” he wrote in a text message. “It isn’t good when a club bearing the name of a party doesn’t endorse and publicly criticizes the head of that party.”
Tensions came to a head in November 2017, when the Harvard Republican Club held its annual board elections. Believing the club’s leadership needed an overhaul, a new group of disillusioned members organized opposition to the slate of “establishment” candidates for board positions.
That group was led by Russell and Reed R. McMurchy ’19, who had previously served as vice president of social events but had since resigned. McMurchy ran for club president, and Russell ran for vice president of campaigns and activism.
“We had planned this for a while because we weren’t too happy with the club or its direction,” Russell said of the decision to run.
McMurchy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
According to the club constitution, members gain voting rights if they pay dues and attend at least two meetings per semester. But the club’s secretary had not kept attendance records to verify who had attended meetings.
The “anti-establishment” group was able to capitalize on the oversight by recruiting conservatives who were disillusioned with the club to pay dues and show up to vote on election night, even if some may have not attended the requisite number of meetings. When initial voting concluded, the new group of candidates had won every single board position.
The attendance issue generated controversy, and the group’s election commission — made up of members of the outgoing board — called for a new round of elections. Meanwhile, Russell sent an email announcement to the club declaring his slate of candidates the victors and laying out the constitutional backing behind the validity of the election.
The election commission eventually selected a new list of “eligible voters” for a second election, using indicators such as the club’s email list and GroupMe to evaluate whether or not voters had plausibly attended meetings.
Those who had won the election the first time around felt like they were being robbed, while members currently on the board believed the anti-establishment had unfairly rigged the election.
“In terms of the people I recruited, it was individuals who had conservative dispositions and were fed up with the club itself and definitely would have been more active if the club was under new leadership,” Russell said. “Most of those people weren’t allowed to vote the second time.”
By the second election, McMurchy had dropped out of the running for president, leaving Kiera E. O’Brien ’20 in an uncontested race. The board that was ultimately elected the second time around comprised a mix of factions — making for some uncomfortable tension, according to several members.
Some members who were directly involved traded personal insults over the club’s email list, while other club members sent long messages questioning potential constitutional issues with the election commission’s handling of the situation.
“The past few years exposed tensions within the party and the club, and these tensions have continued to damage the unity of the club, as demonstrated by the lack of transparency of the electoral process and the insults hurled at members,” one email read.
“I too would like my $5 back,” another email read, requesting refunded club dues. “It has become clear to me that membership in this club is not worth the price of [a] six pack of beer.”
Attendance dropped dramatically in the months following the election.
“Many of the people who had put energy into going to the meetings, showing up, voting — people who left that night thinking that they had successfully turned a zombie club into a real club — had to come back a second time half thinking they wouldn’t be let in the door,” Finn C. Brown ’19, who served as board treasurer at the time, said.
In the aftermath of the election, O’Brien sent out an announcement calling for club unity, along with a detailed survey to gauge the beliefs of club members.
“I thought that was important to be a guiding principle of my leadership,” she said.
A “large majority” of active club membership filled out the survey, and a majority of respondents still “felt good” about the Trump non-endorsement decision in 2016, according to O’Brien.
O’Brien said she focused the club’s efforts that year on repairing the relationship with the RNC, promoting transparency, and campaigning for other elections, such as Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79’s gubernatorial campaign.
When the 2018 club elections rolled around, they proceeded without controversy. Victoria M. Marquez ’20, who was elected president, ran on a platform of improving the club’s reputation.
“We’ve been down but we’re not out,” Marquez wrote in her candidate statement. “Lackluster member turnout, low campaign participation, and insufficient initiative may have shrunken our ranks to a fraction their former glory, but all is not yet lost.”
“Here comes the comeback. Let’s get to work,” she added.
Wesley L. Donhauser ’21, who was elected a vice president of the club, concluded his candidate statement by writing, “Let’s Make HRC Great Again.”
In addition to increasing engagement and repairing relationships within the organization, this year’s club leadership must again decide whether or not it will support Trump’s re-election campaign.
Donhauser, now serving as the club’s president, said the club will not make a decision on its 2020 stance on Trump until they can have an “open mic discussion” within club membership, hopefully on campus.
While the final endorsement decision lies with the club’s executive board, Donhauser said he hoped the club’s membership could come to a consensus through “open and honest discussion.”
“I do think the 2016 decision to not endorse Trump was part of the fact that he had never held political office before,” Donhauser said. “Now, after three or four years of his presidency, we have a lot more meat to go off of.”
Donhauser declined to comment further on the club’s stance on Trump for 2020, but said that the club’s decision in 2016 would not “matter too much” in its decision making process going forward.
“I think Donald Trump has done some good things for the United States. I think he’s also made some mistakes. All I can say for certain is that we have more to go off of now than in 2016,” he said.
Though Donhauser declined to speculate on the upcoming endorsement, board members from years past offered mixed predictions of what this year’s board will decide.
Marquez, the club’s previous president, noted that many new members join the Harvard Republicans each fall, making it difficult to anticipate their political leanings. But Brown, a former treasurer on the board, said he thought the club was more likely to endorse Trump this year.
“I’d say there’s better odds than not that they do,” he said.

In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III infamously proclaimed that “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.”
In the past, such an “act of God” has taken the form of devastating hurricanes, whiteout blizzards, and even an act of terrorism. Despite the magnitude of these instances, the University in each case only resolved to cancel classes for a week at most.
In the University’s almost 400-year history, however, there have been a handful of times in which students’ residential arrangements were placed in flux throughout a semester. These include the British occupation of Boston in 1775, the Spanish Flu of 1918, and the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.
Each of these instances disrupted one of the most prominent tenets of the College experience — house life.
The house system was established in the 1930s under the guidance of then-University President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877. To counter socioeconomic rifts among in the student population, Lowell called for demarcation of the undergraduate population into groups “large enough to give each man a chance to associate closely with a considerable number of his fellows, and not so large as to cause a division into exclusive cliques.”
That plan eventually evolved into the current house system, composed of 12 distinct dormitories that serve as the nucleus for upperclassman life on campus and a shared connection between alumni and current students alike.
If students return to campus at any point in the coming months, however, the house system and residential life they will experience is likely to be substantially different from years past — thanks largely to social distancing measures related to the coronavirus pandemic.
At the time of the 1775 campus evacuation, Harvard was composed of just five buildings that were converted into housing for more than 1,600 American soldiers as they attempted to slow the British advance into Boston.
“[The soldiers] take over Hollis, and also Massachusetts [Hall]. There are people in Holden Chapel,” Harvard history professor Zachary B. Nowak explained in a recent interview. “And these soldiers are stuffed in there. These buildings usually can't fit 60 students, but there are 400 soldiers in there.”
While the soldiers inhabited campus, Harvard affiliates migrated to Concord, Mass., where they resumed classes in October of 1775. The University operated in Concord for an entire year.
During the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918, students urged then-President Lowell to close the University, as the world struggled to contain the deadly virus that may have killed as many as 40 million people.
Lowell chronicled his struggle in deciding whether or not to keep the University open in letters to his friends. “I have been talking over the question of opening with some of our medical experts. Doctor Christian felt as you do, that we had better postpone the opening. On the other hand, Doctor Rosenau...thinks it would be a mistake for us not to open on time,” he wrote.
Despite the rising death toll, Lowell decided to keep the University open amid the pandemic.
The decision was unpopular, exemplified by a scathing critique featured in the former magazine Harvard Illustrated: “The authorities here and elsewhere have deemed the effects of the epidemic to be of so alarming nature as to warrant the closing of theatres, moving-picture houses, and the like, and the prohibition of public meeting of every kind...It is under these circumstances that Harvard University keeps open its doors.”
To protect students on campus, the University broke up large classes and mandated that students who sneezed or coughed during lectures be quarantined. At one point, the University infirmary was overwhelmed with more than 60 patients with the deadly flu.
With guidelines to mitigate the high infection rate, traditional campus life was rendered obsolete. Though students remained on campus, the Harvard Alumni Bulletin deemed campus life “virtually adjourned.”
One hundred years later, the coronavirus pandemic gave these words new meaning.
On March 10, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that students would have to vacate their on-campus housing within five days and complete the duration of the semester virtually on Zoom, a video conferencing platform.
Across the country, moving boxes and trucks became an all-too-familiar sight on college campuses, as students were forced to bid farewell to collegiate life within a matter of days. Colleges ushered their students and faculty into an unprecedented period, attempting to create a virtual college experience to replace what had been left behind.
For students at the College, this meant that classes, extracurricular activities, formals, and traditions like Housing Day and Visitas — usually populating campus spaces like Sever Hall, the Science Center, the Houses, or the Yard — all had to find new homes on Zoom.
Though colleges were forced to rapidly shift to virtual learning in March as the pandemic worsened, administrators across the country are now afforded a longer timeline but must potentially plan a full semester around the uncertainty of coronavirus.
On May 12, Cornell University sociology professor Kim A. Weeden and her colleagues issued a forthcoming paper showing all students on a college campus are connected by three “degrees of separation” or less.
Weeden said her findings empirically indicated that college campuses can catalyze an outbreak.
“The primary finding is that these direct and indirect connections between students through their classes create a small world network on college campuses,” she said. “Of course, the concern is that that social structure is also a fertile condition for the epidemic spread of a disease, so we can imagine a disease spreading across these direct and indirect ties.”
The study, entitled “The Small World Network of College Classes: Implications for Epidemic Spread on a University Campus,” drew data from the course selections of Cornell’s approximately 15,000 undergraduates to determine students' connectivity.
According to Weeden, however, the results of the study are independent of the student population’s size.
“That key figure of about three degrees of separation, or reaching most students with three degrees of separation — that is not sensitive to the size of the university,” she said. “So that part of the network structure seems to be consistent.”
The study concluded that administrators can take steps through “hybrid models of instruction” to reduce contact in the student population without eliminating it. Weeden’s study did not factor in residential spaces such as dining halls, which she said will be “much trickier” to address.
C. Robert Horsburgh, an epidemiology professor at Boston University, said all colleges across the country face similar problems when deciding whether to reopen. Residential colleges like Harvard will additionally need to rethink student accommodations to ensure appropriate social distancing measures, according to Horsburgh.
“Are we going to have less people in each dorm, so that they don't run into each other so often?” Horsburgh asked. “And if so, how are we going to increase the dorm space capacity to handle half as many people in each dorm room?”
Many public health experts agreed on the necessity of a rigorous testing infrastructure to allow students to return to campus. Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 announced plans last week to increase the number of coronavirus tests administered each day from the current 10,000 to 45,000 by the end of July, and to 75,000 per day by the end of the year.
As of Sunday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Massachusetts reached 92,675, out of 532,373 tested in total.
Davidson H. Hamer — a global health professor and infectious disease specialist at BU — said campus outbreaks pose not only a danger to the student population, but also a grave risk to older populations on campus.
“The real risk is — if students are asymptomatic shedders or mildly infected and shedding — is the infection of faculty and staff or older members of the campus,” he said. “It spreads to more vulnerable populations like that.”
Former BU Dean of Arts and Sciences Virginia Sapiro wrote in an email that reopening campuses in any location would pose the risk of an outbreak.
“Student residences and communal areas are the perfect setting for transmitting disease regardless of whether the T runs by or you can hear cows moo-ing,” she wrote. “There may be more ways to get in trouble in a city in terms of places to go to pick up the virus, but once the virus enters a college community, it will explode.”
Despite the plethora of public health obstacles, colleges nationwide are considering their options for a possible return to residential life. Harvard is no exception.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced Harvard will resume teaching for the fall semester, though no determination has been made whether this instruction will occur in person or online. In an interview with The Crimson last week, Bacow said Harvard’s campus will be open, though the process of repopulating is “likely to vary by school.”
Bacow said the University is currently exploring options to maintain social distancing guidelines in its residential spaces, including non-traditional housing stock for undergraduates.
Other colleges, however, have taken it a step further.
The president of the University of Notre Dame, Reverend John I. Jenkins, sent a May 18 letter to faculty and staff committing to in-person classes starting the week of August 10. He wrote that the university would complete the full semester by Thanksgiving without breaks, in an effort to decrease the likelihood of students carrying the virus to and from campus while travelling. Jenkins also wrote that he prefers this plan over one of gradual student repopulation to preserve a full campus experience.
“Some institutions are electing to reduce the number of students on campus by inviting back only a portion of the student body at any time,” Jenkins wrote. “We have resisted that course because we believe in the educational value of the on-campus experience for all our students, and we recognize it is particularly valuable for students whose living situations away from campus may not be as conducive to study.”
Jenkins also outlined strict social distancing and quarantine protocols that will be in place and wrote the university will act “aggressively” to contain cases on campus.
“We believe that, with extensive protocols of testing, contact tracing and isolating or quarantining, coupled with preventive measures such as an emphasis on hand-washing and norms for social distancing and wearing masks in certain settings, we can keep our campus environment safe,” Jenkins wrote.
In a similar vein, several Boston-area colleges have announced intentions to reopen their residential systems in the fall, including BU, Tufts University, and Northeastern University. BU also plans to operate an independent coronavirus testing program for its students, faculty, and staff.
Additionally, universities have said students’ return to campus is contingent on the virus’s progression and guidance from health officials.
According to Hamer, one way to return would be through a staggered arrival, allowing every student to be tested as they step foot on campus.
“I think there's a movement towards a plan for many — at least a potential plan — to have every student tested on arrival, and if it's a large university like Harvard or Boston University, then that can mean a lot of tests all at once,” he said. “So one strategy that would help decongest arrival would be to try and have students arriving on different days to try and stagger their return.”
He added that many social distancing practices will become commonplace or even mandatory — meaning that students will return to a college life very different from what they left in March.
“Wearing masks is going to be something that most universities are going to consider and probably require, especially in public places including classrooms and cafeterias,” he said.
Horsburgh said he is concerned about how extracurricular groups will function in these conditions. Under the proposed strict social distancing guidelines, he said activities such as athletics or theater could look drastically different.
“You’ve got to get people apart, and yet college is a mixing experience. So, it's going to be real different if people can't mix much,” Horsburgh said.
“It's hard to imagine how the dorms are going to work,” he added.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on residential planning, referring to previous statements from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay. According to these statements, a decision on the fate of students’ potential return to campus will be made by July.
In her April email to faculty and staff, Gay said repopulating the undergraduate Houses will be FAS’s most difficult task.
“Our most daunting challenge will be how and when to stage the return of undergraduates to their residential Houses,” she wrote. “But we will not bring students back until we can do so safely, in a manner that protects individuals and our broader community from undue risks associated with Covid-19.”
With Harvard remaining tight-lipped about fall planning and the deadline for a decision a month or more away, much uncertainty shrouds the future of the College’s residential learning mission. Despite the challenge of on-campus learning, however, Hamer said there would be compelling advantages to bringing students back.
“Personally, I think that the need to have students actually present on campus and having various collaborative activities and educational activities needs to be considered,” he said. “It's very disruptive to have to do everything by remote learning. I think it probably just doesn't work as well.”
“I think there's going to be a balance between the risk of importation and potential spread of disease on a campus and the lack of benefit that students would get from having that educational experience,” he added.

On the morning of March 10, after Harvard mandated students vacate their dorms to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Caroline S. Kristof ’20 sat at her desk staring at the stack of thesis books towering before her, the pages overflowing with five thousand little post-it notes.
She weighed a couple courses of action in her mind while sitting there. The responsible thing to do would have been to buckle down, carefully peel each of the sticky notes from the pages, and return the books to Widener Library before packing up the rest of her dorm room.
But as campus changed around her, she couldn’t.
“How could I waste a single second doing this when I could be spending time with people who I don’t know when I’m ever going to see again?” she said.
Despite reports of the coronavirus’s escalating toll, students had largely gone about their lives as usual in the weeks before Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the campus closure. They rushed from classes to clubs, buoyed through waves of exhaustion by the far-off promises of warm nights, picnics, and outdoor concerts. Seniors toiled over their theses, fueled by excitement for the weeks of celebration and release between exams and graduation.
Upon waking to Khurana’s email, the Class of 2020 lost innumerable traditions, farewells, and last memories of places and people they might never see again. With just five days left on campus as Harvard students, they had to pack up all their possessions, bid uncertain goodbyes, and reconcile themselves to an unknown future.
With the weeks leading up to graduation spent in their childhood bedrooms, many seniors have reimagined the canonical senior spring experience, trading spring break trips for service projects, final sports seasons for at-home gyms, and stage performances for virtual fans.
After the shock Kristof and her classmates felt wore off, they entered a season of losing and gaining — losing Senior Week, Commencement, and thesis celebrations, and gaining something strange and new.
“The night before one of my friends left and I just remember talking and raving about how much of a dream it’s gonna be when we get the email from the University saying, ‘This is the day you guys are coming back,’” Eric J. Cheng ’20 said.
“I think that this senior spring that we didn’t get is just a reminder that we can have what we wanted to have and constantly be looking forward to it for the rest of our lives,” he said.
Before Harvard’s announcement on March 10 that students must vacate their dorms in five days, Adam E. Harper ’20 said he felt he had been awake for “10 days straight.” Having just returned from his rugby tournament in Los Angeles, Harper spent the entire night before the news working on his thesis. Sleeping for just two hours, he rushed to rugby practice at 7:30 a.m.
When he returned to his dorm, he and his roommate read the news: “Harvard College students will be required to move out of their Houses and First-Year dorms as soon as possible and no later than Sunday, March 15 at 5:00pm.”
“Literally within seconds in the class of 2020 Facebook group, it was like, ‘Senior week starts now,’” Harper said.
For many, it did. Immediately after the announcement, students poured out of their dorm rooms, coalescing in the streets to drink, dance, and cry. Seniors ditched classes and tuned out the daily drum of obligations, eager to spend their final days on campus differently. They flooded the Class of 2020 Facebook group with messages urging any secret crushes to confess their feelings and corralling friends to gather on Widener steps for an impromptu senior class photo.
“You’re walking, then someone’s suddenly like, ‘We’re going to the steps, we’re going to the steps!’” Kristof said. “Somehow we gathered a thousand of us. You know how impossible it is to schedule a single meeting with a single person? And then somehow in two hours, we got our entire class on Widener steps.”
“I think that the mentality of the first few days was just ignore, push this under the rug, let’s just appreciate each other and do everything we had dreamed up doing in the last three months,” Kristof added.On some days, that meant nonstop drinking with friends and dancing at bacchanalian final club parties that stretched from day to night. On others, it meant picnicking by the Charles River at sunset or taking one last trip into Boston.
“It was the least amount of sleep I've ever gotten in my entire life,” Aishah Ahmed ’20 said. “I don't think I slept for probably 96 hours."
“I definitely thought in my head, ‘I'm supposed to be social distancing,’ but it's really hard to not succumb to the allure of spending time in massive crowds with all of your friends,” she said.
They undertook unusual activities, too: playing Leonard Bernstein ’39’s piano, sliding down the Widener steps on a mattress, holding roasts of friends, hosting sleepovers, pouring cheap booze under the Lowell Bells, climbing onto dorm fire escapes, and dancing on the tables of the Lampoon.
But the pandemic that had caused all the commotion wasn’t completely absent.
Hakeem Angulu ’20 said news of the College’s mandate swept him into a “whirlwind” of logistics and emotions. While some could party before a road trip home, he knew he couldn’t return to his hometown in Jamaica.
His friends staged last-minute graduation and thesis photoshoots on Widener Library’s steps. Since his own thesis remained unfinished at the time, his friend lent him a traditional black binder.
They were generous in other ways, too, opening up their homes for those in need of accommodations and quietly commemorating their time together.
“There was a lot of sitting in each other's rooms and crying and reminiscing and making promises and plans for the long future,” Angulu said.
Despite classmates dancing, hugging, crying, and planning, Elias W. “Eli” Russell ’20 said saying goodbye to campus felt most real when he was alone.
“I went crazy decorating my room this year, and I had an amazing setup because I was in Cabot. I had my own bedroom, bathroom, and common room and all the walls were covered in stuff,” Russell said. “I think when I finally took things off the wall, that’s when I realized, ‘Oh, this is just a room.’ That was when it felt like, ‘Oh, I'm out of here.’”
As she arrived home in New York City, the last days on campus past her, Isabella Di Pietro ’20 faced a “pretty big reality check.”
Her family owns five restaurants in the city, and New York Mayor Bill De Blasio had ordered all restaurants to close except for takeout and delivery on March 15. Soon, her father had to close four of the places they owned and lay off 95 of their 102 employees.
“It was a pretty devastating thing,” she said. “Telling them they have to go home is just awful.”
But the family had an idea: they could keep the lights on and the staff employed by taking donations to provide meals to frontline healthcare workers. All they needed was a website for the operation.
“I studied history and literature, so that was not in my wheelhouse,” Di Pietro said. Luckily, she could enlist the help of a friend from Cambridge, Edith Herwitz ’20, who has a background in computer science.
“We actually started working on the website together and 18 hours later, we launched,” Di Pietro said. “And right away, we saw an incredible outpouring of generosity.”
Between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. the first day, Di Pietro said they received $12,000 in donations. They have thus far raised over $1.4 million and delivered over 100,000 meals between Di Pietro’s family’s restaurants and the 18 other collaborating restaurants.
The organization, named Feed the Frontlines, is now transitioning to combatting the “staggering” food insecurity in New York City.
Di Pietro works full time on Feed the Frontlines with many of her closest friends. Though she will still “walk” in virtual commencement, she decided to take a leave of absence this semester to fully devote herself to this project.
“School feels very far away from me right now,” she said.
Other seniors have also traded studying on campus for relief work at home.
After quarantining together for two weeks in New York, Harper and Kristof said they were also seeking ways to confront the pandemic.
Harper said he reached out to a friend from Harvard, Cara Kennedy-Cuomo ’17, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s daughter. He asked her if there was anything he and Kristof could do to help in the state government.
“She said, ‘You can't really help remotely, but you can come to Albany,’ and we're both like, ‘Oh, okay,’” Harper said.
Harper and Kristof moved into an apartment hotel in New York right before the peak of hospitalizations in the state. They began by assisting with sourcing masks, gowns, and gloves — then quickly transitioned to hospital coordination, stockpiling, and testing. They also copy-edited Cuomo’s slides each morning, fielded calls about potential partnerships between businesses and the state of New York, worked with a crisis hotline service to create resources for frontline workers, and wrote briefs for senior aides about testing, supply chains, and contact tracing.
“It was so crazy seeing how every single person who was working was doing 97 things at once,” Kristof said.
“96 of which they've never done before,” Harper added.
Around Easter, he and Kristof said they received daily notifications to their state email inboxes every morning at 6 a.m. updating the increasing number of coronavirus-related deaths.
The responsibilities and reminders immersed them in the reality of the pandemic, Kristof said.
"Obviously, it was such a privilege to be able to watch the press briefings live and copy edit the slides and see in real time how a government is reacting and handling it and how transparent they are about how much they don't know,” she said.
One day, Harper said a receptionist in the office asked him to read a letter addressed to Governor Cuomo from a Northeastern Kansas farmer named Dennis Ruhnke.
“He basically said, ‘Governor Cuomo, you'll never read this letter, but I have a wife who has one lung and has diabetes, and we're really scared. We have five N95 masks — we’re keeping 4 for us — from when we farmed in the 70s,’” Harper recounted.
He and Kristof shared the letter with Cara Cuomo, who passed it on to her father. Days later, Governor Cuomo read the letter on national television — and it quickly swept national headlines as an emblem of selflessness during the pandemic.
“Stuff like that stuck with us as much as sitting in on crazy meetings and understanding what being at the forefront of the response is like,” Harper said.
“It also distracted us from our own kind of massive shift and trauma from graduating college,” Kristof added.
Harper said he and Kristof will return home for two weeks and continue their work as a summer job.
Other students have transferred their on-campus activism to advocacy work related to the pandemic.
Angulu said he is collaborating with Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Nicco A. Mele to advocate for prison reform related to COVID-19, to which the incarcerated population is particularly vulnerable.
Yong Han Poh ’20, who served as the co-Editor-in-Chief of the Singapore Policy Journal while on campus, said the journal’s staff had engaged local academics, activists, journalists in virtual panel discussions about migrant worker policy, among other social issues. She added that the pandemic has exacerbated “dismal” working conditions.
Po said the return home allowed her and her colleagues at the journal to be “more looped into the local news cycle.”
“I have to say though that it’s been really hard juggling all of this with school work — there were many points in the past two months when school just felt bizarre and completely pointless,” she added. “I've had some time to rest recently, especially since school is over, and I plan to use this time to re-group and figure out how best I should spend my time (and what I want to do post-graduation).”
Khurana said in an interview earlier this month that he was “heartened” to see how many students are rising to the moment and taking charge in this time of crisis.
“I've been inspired by students summoning all sorts of qualities of keeping their wells of empathy, expanding their circles of concern about how we can create a better world for the future,” he said.
For every new task a senior found, another gave one up.
Had Harvard not closed campus, Margaret T. Canady ’20 and six classmates would have directed a dance show in the Loeb Experimental Theater called “Like a Good Conversation.” The group had danced together for nearly their entire time at college — in the Ballet Company, the Modern Dance Company, Expressions Dance Company, and Eleganza.
“The show was supposed to be a celebration of the four years we've had together,” Canady said.
After returning home, she floated several ideas with the scattered group, including compiling a montage of previous dances. Eventually, though, they deemed such a video an underwhelming alternative. She ultimately decided on producing the original show online.
The dancers taught choreography over Zoom for an hour each day over the course of three to four days, navigating internet lags and mirrored webcam images.
The dancers then filmed their respective parts with their phones. Canady and Angie Cui ’20 edited the videos together into one synchronized dance, set to the song “We Find Love” by Daniel Caesar.
“It felt good to make work and collaborate on projects again and to do that within the constraints of being in totally different parts of the country,” Canady said.
Other seniors who participated in the performing arts on campus have developed solo performances.
Jessica L. Ding ’20 said she was seeking a sense of consistency after she returned home to Pennsylvania. She decided to post videos of herself playing the harp on her Instagram.
Ding started by posting excerpts of the pieces she learned for her dual degree program at the New England Conservatory. It wasn’t long, though, before her friends started sending song requests, like “Remember Me” from Coco and “Oogway Ascends” from Kung Fu Panda. She numbered her videos to mark the days since she left Cambridge.
“It's been nice just to have something regular to do everyday, and it's been really fun just learning new pieces — not for a purpose, but just because people want to hear music,” Ding said.
Elmer Vivas Portillo ’20 — who had developed an interest in photography while at Harvard — said he also learned to create from afar. He read articles about photographers who had used FaceTime to conduct remote photoshoots and decided to try the method out, reaching out to his friends to solicit their participation in his virtual photoshoot experiments. Accounting for the sometimes blurry images, he made collages and superimposed frames on top of one another.
“I realized this is not only fun, but it's a personal challenge that I think can help me grow,” Vivas said.
With little other than the internet to entertain them, some seniors have found new media to explore. As a class project for Music 284r: “Sounding Identity,” Cahleb E. Derry ’20 started a podcast featuring young black artists. Derry, an aspiring talk show host, said he hopes the project will outlast the pandemic.
He released his first episode, which featured Kaedi Dally, the bassist for the female a capella group Citizen Queen, several weeks ago.
“As my teacher said, there's a huge hole missing for black queer folks in podcast content,” Derry said. “I've been thinking a lot about the ways that black musicians and musicians of color are cut out of the picture so often, but their art forms are taken by white artists. I really wanted to counteract that by highlighting what black artists are making.”
On March 11, a day after the College’s message about campus closure, athletes received another disruptive notice: the Ivy League had cancelled the remainder of its events for the season. For some, this meant their last match had taken place in 2019, before most Americans knew what a coronavirus was.
Christian E. Athanasian ’20 was gathered with his lacrosse team for a bonding event when they learned about the cancellation. Among other major milestones, Athanasian said the lacrosse team had high hopes for winning the Ivy League tournament and advancing to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament under their new head coach.
Now back home, Athanasian said he has been trying to supplant lost time playing lacrosse with other endeavors.
Recently, he started teaching himself yoga to become more flexible.
“It's just hard to take something away that was so important from your life that was also physical,” he said. “So I’ve been trying to adapt to new physical challenges that I hadn't necessarily gone after before.”
Baseball player Chad N. Minato ’20 was in the middle of practice when the announcement hit. Aside from the promise of games and championships ahead, he said he particularly missed the experience of playing with his teammates every day.
“I was just looking forward to being able to play out this last year with my teammates, my friends,” he said. “That's what I feel like we missed out on.”
But, like the artists who transferred their work online, athletes soon heard they might be able to play again as the NCAA announced that it would grant an extra year of eligibility to athletes due to the pandemic.
Because the Ivy League generally prohibits graduate students from playing for the varsity teams, Minato and several of his teammates began considering a transfer.
“It was actually exciting for us, and interesting to be going through the recruiting process again at this age, already having the perspective of having already played four years of college baseball,” he said. “It’s an entirely different feeling than when you're in high school going through this.”
Considering a potential career in professional baseball, Minato said he will play at Cal Baptist University in Riverside, Calif., next year while pursuing an MBA.
Cheng, the Class of 2020 first class marshal, said he spent hours agonizing over his pre-recorded opening remarks for Harvard’s virtual graduation.
With Harvard-provided lighting equipment suited on his phone and a teleprompter on his computer, he recorded the speech around 50 times, making mistakes and starting again.
On May 28, seniors would have streamed into Harvard Yard in their caps and gowns, sitting together with a now-laughable closeness. Instead, they will take part in a live-streamed celebration, receiving rolled up diplomas in the mail.
In any other year, Cheng and his classmates would use the ceremony to say their last goodbyes before entering adulthood. But, like so much else, the pandemic has forced them to say modified farewells.
Memie H. Osuga ’20 spent most of her senior spring off-campus finishing a film thesis, which she conceived in the fall as a meditation on online connection. Her goal, she said, was to bring “legitimacy and sweetness” to the concept of virtual relationships.
“Most of my senior spring was spent working on this film, which was joyous and weirdly self-reflective in light of self-isolation,” she added. “It was just kind of funny to work on a film about online connection living within the confines of my room.”
Despite spending months thinking about the power of digital connection, Osuga said virtual classes and commencement are no substitute for “truly experiencing” the last months of school.
Jeremy L. Tsai ’20 said that while he admires his classmates’ work to plan graduation, he feels the online ceremony lacks many of a traditional Commencement’s best features.
“There's a sort of recognition that feels less possible when everyone is anonymous and behind their screens just watching your pre-recorded video,” Tsai said.
“Once you're at Harvard, it's kind of like, ‘Go go, go!’ and you're constantly doing things and you don't always have the time or space to reflect,” he added. “I think a lot of us were looking forward to having the time and the space to rekindle friendships, to think about how we’ve changed and learned and grown over the last four years.”
But Maureen Tang ’20 said being home has actually allowed her to reflect more deeply on her time at Harvard.
“Often in school, we don't take a lot of time to be present,” she said. “Being alone for most of the days gets you to think a lot, and I think it made me reflect more on my college experience — maybe more than I would have if I was at school and busy with all the things going on like Commencement and Senior Week.”
For the Class of 2020, the spring has brought its own kind of math. The pandemic subtracted sports seasons and final performances, Senior Week parties and thesis photoshoots, extracurriculars and Commencement exercises. But, after a while, it added something, too: frontline jobs and rediscovered hobbies, time for self-reflection and moments of self-discovery, and — eventually — a new sense of what it means to be part of a class.
“I like to think that this time that we did not have will just motivate us to sprinkle these months that we didn't get into the rest of our lives, our five-year reunion, 10-year reunion,” Cheng said. “The process of being a Harvard graduate is not something that leaves you. It's a world that you're a part of, if you want to be a part of it, for the rest of your life.”
“I think in some ways it’s an opportunity,” he said.

UPDATED: May 29, 2020, 8:53 a.m.
Instead of taking his Advanced Placement United States History exam the afternoon of May 15, Cambridge Rindge and Latin School junior Andrew W. Mello went shopping. At noon, he drove to the store and bought groceries, while his neighbor waited in the car.
Mello’s neighbor is at high risk for severe complications from coronavirus and could not enter the store safely, so Mello did the shopping for her. He said he plans to take his exam at a later date.
Mello is just one of many Cambridge students whose day-to-day life has been upended by the public health crisis.
When the coronavirus pandemic caused many academic institutions to close in mid-March, students were sent home to transition to remote learning. Cambridge Public Schools was no exception.
The district, consisting of 20 schools – a handful of which surround Harvard’s campus – initially announced a “two-week closure” on March 12th, according to Superintendent Kenneth N. Salim.
Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 then extended that closure through April for all schools in the state. Nearly a month later, he announced that all Massachusetts schools would be closed for the remainder of the school year.
“That move to sort of turn on a dime to shift into a remote learning environment is something that none of us have ever had to contend with,” Salim said. “Even making that kind of shift when you have a year in advance planning is a pretty significant shift. And so, to do that in one fell swoop is a challenge.”
After the district-wide closure announcement, Cambridge Public Schools Chief Information Officer Steven W. Smith said he was in “reactionary mode.” His team had less than 24 hours to supply every student with a Chromebook for the transition to virtual classrooms.
“Majority of students grades three through eight left the schools on that Friday with Chromebooks,” he said. “Nine through 12 already had Chromebooks assigned.”
In the following weeks, about 800 more Chromebooks were ordered for students in kindergarten through second grade.
Additionally, the district procured approximately 400 WiFi hotspots to deliver to households without reliable internet access, and twice a week, the carpentry shop bay of CRLS converts into a walk-in IT help center, serving anywhere from a dozen to 50 students and staff, according to Smith.
Smith also said students will keep the hotspots and Chromebooks throughout the summer and for as long as virtual learning continues.
During the pandemic, CPS students have had to adapt to changes in and out of the classroom, but many were dismayed that their school year was cut short.
“It wasn’t [until] about the fifth week of the quarantine that CRLS administration came out with a really concrete plan of how our classes are going to work,” senior Sekai T. Carr said.
CRLS Principal Damon Smith wrote in an emailed statement the school sent out communications detailing updated academic expectations each time closures were announced or extended. Additionally, he wrote that a distance learning schedule was shared in the first week of April, which came into effect mid-month.
CRLS, the district’s only comprehensive high school, resumed classes virtually on an abbreviated schedule, with often just one class a day. Many high schoolers said they aren’t learning remotely as much as they were in person.
“As much as we have tried to replicate the experience of school virtually, nothing compares to being in class,” Smith wrote, adding that the school will continue to enhance virtual learning opportunities.
CRLS seniors were also forlorn about spending their last weeks of high school away from their peers, concluding a four-year journey with neither prom nor traditional graduation activities. Carr said he might not even want to attend the virtual graduation ceremony.
“I was kind of like, wow, this is really gonna be how I end my high school experience, which is kind of disappointing,” Eli A. Siegel-Bernstein, another senior at CRLS, said.
Carr’s classmate, Isabelle A. Agee-Jacobson, called the ending “abrupt.”
“Everybody's talking about all these details related to graduation and prom, and there's just this sense around you that helps you say goodbye,” Agee-Jacobson said. “We just don't have that, so I think it's just gonna feel really, really abrupt.”
Smith sympathized with students' disappointment.
“[Graduation] is THE highlight of the year for just about everyone in the school community and I am most saddened that we will not be able to be together,” he wrote. The district is looking for a future date to celebrate seniors in person, Smith wrote.
Still, students said they were looking ahead to their futures after graduation. Some of them have decided to attend college in the fall regardless of whether or not the semester convenes virtually. Others, such as Carr and Siegel-Bernstein, intend to take a gap year.
“No matter what the situation is, I really want to go to Alaska next year and be a salmon fisherman,” Siegel-Bernstein said, after his original gap year plans to teach English in Lebanon were put on hold as a result of the virus.
Civics teacher Kathleen K. FitzGerald coordinates the Enhanced Senior Year program at CRLS. The program typically invites upperclassmen to pursue independent projects, teaching assistantships, and internships.
This semester, more than 80 juniors and seniors signed up. But the pandemic has cut many students’ opportunities short. Some had their internships rescinded, while others personally deemed their still-ongoing jobs unsafe. One student even re-centered their thesis project around COVID-19. Regardless of their situations, students in the program are still preparing final presentations, according to FitzGerald.
In her civics classroom, FitzGerald said that for years her students have held a poster exhibition for their final projects. But after shifting to remote learning, she decided to replace the posters with virtual speeches, which she found to be very successful and plans to assign again next year.
“I’m excited that this [pandemic] forced me to shift something that had been feeling a little old,” FitzGerald said of the previous poster display. “I’m going to keep this assignment no matter whether we’re back in or not.”
FitzGerald added that schools have served as sanctuaries for students, providing them with social and emotional benefits that have been lost during the pandemic.
“So many students will come to school and feel really safe there and comfortable there,” she said. “The most important thing for us as educators has been really staying connected with students and making sure that they’re okay in terms of mental health.”
Nina C. Nolan, a parent and chair of the Putnam Avenue Family Association, said that the Putnam Avenue Upper School has been proactive in “acknowledging the whole child.” PAUS is sending out wellbeing resources and encouraging creative outlets for students, according to Nolan.
Regardless, CPS parents said their children miss attending school and spending time with friends.
Christina T. Lively whose 10-year-old son attends Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. School said her son recently told her that he hopes Governor Baker opens up the state again so he can have playdates again.
Sending kids home has spotlighted inequities across Cambridge. The gaps in educational attainment by students with varying grades or abilities, especially those in special education programs, have been stark.
One parent — speaking under the condition of anonymity given her line of work — wrote in a statement that school was her childcare equivalent. Navigating virtual education for her children since has been “a rotten time.” As a healthcare worker and single mom, she wrote in a text message that she is unable to supervise her kids at home.
“I felt the stress of implementing a school like structure or routine at home, that still [hasn’t] happened,” she wrote. “[The kids don’t] take it or me seriously.”
“School is a joke,” she added.
Younger students and families with lower technological literacy have especially struggled with online learning. Virginia Cuello said her daughter, who is in middle school at PAUS, has grown frustrated with technology.
“She’ll write everything out, and then she has to type it. She’s not the [fastest] typer,” Cuello said of her daughter. “She feels bad about not being able to finish...I’m there to support her. I tell her, ‘just do what you can.’”
Students in kindergarten through second grade received touchscreen Chromebooks. CPS CIO Smith said that these laptops are ideally more user friendly, but technological literacy still remains a barrier for many students.
One parent, Kathryn K. Carr, said she was thankful she could read English — the sole language many school announcements are delivered in.
Others wished for more accessible programs for students. Nolan said that while some PAUS teachers have offered “office hours,” it is likely that many PAUS students don’t know what that is.
“The teachers are saying that they had office hours...I was like, I never heard of office hours until I got to college,” Nolan said. “And if you’re a middle schooler, you don’t want to go to the office, like why would you show up?”
Some Cambridge parents reacted quickly to the closure, organizing fundraisers to do “emergency patchwork,” according to Jodi B. Sperber, who serves on the board of a parent-run nonprofit dedicated to supporting King Open School.
Family organizations at King Open, MLK School, and PAUS held fundraisers and bought gift cards to local supermarkets for food-insecure families. At the Peabody School, the parent-teacher association gave out grants to their teachers.
However, many parents have had to adjust to new schedules as a result of not only working from home but also having their children at home.
“We have relaxed on the rules about gaming and watching TV,” Shalini Gautam, president of the Peabody School PTA, said. “But I must admit that even for myself, it's like, as this is becoming the new normal and we have sort of adapted, it's time to bring back some guidelines on ourselves and the kids.”
Sperber, who has a son in elementary school, also talked about the difficulties of navigating a new virtual classroom dynamic, particularly with respect to the role of the teacher.
“As a parent, I'm trying to figure out what that line is between letting her still be the primary teacher versus I’m the one that sees him most, so am I now the primary teacher?” she said. “I honestly don’t know how to answer that.”
Parents, however, are still finding ways for their children to socialize and remain connected to the school.
“Anybody who has a birthday, the parents set up a Zoom call so kids are able to get together and celebrate,” Gautam said.
Some students have also played video games together, including Animal Crossing and Minecraft, to keep in touch.
Across Cambridge, many low-income families have relied on school cafeterias to feed their kids five days a week. Once schools closed, these students would have been left food-insecure, according to Cambridge Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon.
“A lot of public schools that have a high number of low-income students declined to close for snow days or other emergencies because of the food access,” she said. “For a lot of our students, that’s where the majority of their nutrition comes from — the school cafeteria.”
Mallon also serves as the K-12 strategic lead for a local food security nonprofit, Food for Free, where she had been planning for an emergency meals program for weeks, should schools close due to the pandemic. Soon after the district announced closures, Food for Free organized eight meal pickup sites around the city. Volunteers signed up to distribute meals prepared by school cafeteria staff.
“[The cafeteria staff] miss the kids,” Mallon added. “They have thrown every ounce of love into these meals that they could over the last 10 weeks.”
This grab-and-go meal program serves two meals a day to 500 kids in the district. Despite shortages, staff hashed together an assorted menu offering halal meals, vegetarian alternatives, and pizza Fridays.
Mallon plans to transition the service into an official initiative of the Department of Human Service Programs and extend meals through the summer such that there is no interruption in meal service once the school year ends.
While the coronavirus pandemic has certainly underscored inequity across the city, “the inequities have always been there,” according to CPS Title I Family Liaison Debbie J. Bonilla.
Title I schools receive federal funding because a high percentage of their students come from low-income backgrounds. As part of her job, Bonilla connects with low-income and homeless families to understand how the district can best support them. During the pandemic, this has become a round-the-clock job.
“What is the need right now for families, and how do I get it out to them?” she asked. “How do we meet families where they're at? There are families that we don't even hear from, how do we make that connection?”
Bonilla also said it is a huge challenge for these families to prioritize education amidst other challenging circumstances. She cited examples of undocumented families who hesitate to reach out to assistance programs that require them to share personal information, as well as families with precarious living situations.
“It’s really hard for them to think of schoolwork and all the stuff that we're talking about,” she said. “Not everybody's going to be able to get on and be involved in this schoolwork for eight hours, six hours, or four hours a day. It's just not going to happen for everybody.”
Bonilla added that it is sometimes difficult to tell which families are in these situations.
“You don't know everything that a family is going through or carrying. Even if they have a roof over their head, there’s so many other things before this pandemic that people were going through,” she said. “And that invisible luggage — you don't always see it, so you just have to remember that we're all going through something.”
Claire B. Spinner, CPS Chief Financial Officer, said when her team first started planning the district’s budget for 2020, they had “no inkling” that they would need to take a global pandemic into account. In fact, the budget for the 2021 fiscal year was decided earlier on the same day CPS announced it would close.
“We’re really focused on our continued implementation of our District Plan. We're very focused on how are we aligning what we're doing with the outcomes that we want to see,” she said.
Spinner and her team quickly pivoted, analyzing the effects of district-wide school closure on its budget. Currently, CPS has not laid off any staff members and is continuing regular pay and benefits. They found that even with the additional expenses occurring from bulk purchases, such as the Chromebooks and WiFi hotspots, the district will have a greater end-of-year balance than usual.
This is in part due to large savings in energy and transportation.
“We were already sort of lower than normal on bills because it has been quite a warm winter,” Spinner said. “We ended up saving about three-quarters of a million dollars — about $750,000 — in our transportation costs.”
In a typical year, any leftover balance from CPS’s budget is then reabsorbed by the city. This year, however, Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale is willing to re-allocate leftover funds into next year’s budget to help mitigate COVID-19 recovery costs, according to Spinner.
Spinner said the future COVID-19-related costs are “mind-boggling to think about” but said there would be expenditures related to increasing health and safety measures in schools, such as additional handwashing facilities.
As the academic year comes to a close and the state of Massachusetts slowly reopens, Cambridge families are thrust into a precarious summer and uncertain fall.
Many Cambridge families rely on summer programming as a seasonal daycare. Parents working essential jobs and those returning to in-person employment cannot care for kids at home. Carr said she is “terrified” for what the summer holds.
“I have to start physically being at my job again, but my kids don’t have any summer school options,” Carr said. “What does that mean for me?”
Both CPS and Harvard’s Phillips Brooks House Association will offer some virtual summer programming for K-12 students, but these students will still be at home — with or without their guardians.
Most PBHA term-time student enrichment programs ended early due to the pandemic. PBHA coordinator Fahedur Fahed ’22 said the organization is interfacing with Superintendent Salim to coordinate virtual offerings for low-income Cambridge K-12 students over the summer.
Fall plans remain undecided, though school officials meet regularly to develop a COVID-19 recovery plan, according to Salim.
Harvard Business School lecturer John J.-H. Kim ’87 co-chairs the Public Education Leadership Project, which partners with urban school districts across the country to develop management strategies. He said he hopes districts develop plans for the upcoming school year by mid-July, likening such plans to application updates.
“When Microsoft used to come out with their Windows 93 or 95 or 98, it would spend years building the new version,” Kim said. “Whereas today, when you look at the apps on your phone, they get updated almost daily.”
He said that schools need to follow the latter model of monitoring and frequently updating their plans — an “innovation, agile approach” for the 2020-2021 academic calendar.
Bonilla, the Title I Coordinator, emphasized the importance of coming together during the pandemic.
“We're no longer my school, my family," Bonilla said. "We are just all of us working as one.”

After Harvard and most other universities in the United States transitioned to virtual platforms in March, students largely hunkered down away from their dorm rooms, dining halls, and college classrooms, to abide by various social distancing measures as the coronavirus infection rate in the country skyrocketed.
Now, after the spring semester has come to a close and large portions of the country begin easing restrictions brought on by the outbreak, administrators must consider the question: what will happen in the fall?
In April, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 informed Harvard affiliates that classes and research would resume in the fall, though whether classes will be online or in-person has yet to be determined.
“Because most projections suggest that COVID-19 will remain a serious threat during the coming months, we cannot be certain that it will be safe to resume all usual activities on campus by then,” Garber wrote. “Consequently, we will need to prepare for a scenario in which much or all learning will be conducted remotely.”
In an interview with The Crimson, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said administrators continue to discuss various scenarios for the fall semester, but have not yet decided how it will be formatted, and if — or which — students will be allowed to return to campus.
Harvard administrators have said they will continue to monitor public health guidance in their decision-making, and aim to limit the risk of an outbreak on campus with various public health measures should they deem a return to campus possible for undergraduates.
Harvard Medical School professor Marcia B. Goldberg ’79, who serves as the director of research in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, said students may be able to return to campus in the fall with certain measures in place, but no plan can guarantee that an outbreak will not occur.
“Nothing is going to be 100 percent foolproof. There will be some people getting sick, we know that,” she said. “But I think there are safe ways to return to college, where the numbers of people who are getting sick, and the numbers of people who are dying from this disease, is minimal.”
As university administrators around the country plan for fall, some are focusing on creating timelines and health protocols for students’ return to campus, while others have decided the risk is too high altogether.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an April email to students that, in accordance with guidance from public health experts, administrators were exploring a “broad spectrum” of potential scenarios for the fall semester.
Khurana added that the planning team would decide on the status of the residential campus for the fall semester no later than July.
Richard Chait, a Harvard Graduate School of Education professor who studies the management and governance of colleges and universities, said the “multifaceted” decisions universities have to make for the coming semester are not guaranteed to remain in place even after being announced if new data or guidance is released.
“It’ll be final until it’s not,” Chait said. “I hope students will be charitable for the university if they decide that the original decision, in light of new data, is the incorrect decision.”
Chait said amid the uncertainty, administrators have to think about a multitude of factors when deciding on the format of the fall semester. He emphasized that health and safety — for students and staff alike — was the primary concern, but educational considerations, financial issues, risk management, and athletic programs also must be taken into consideration.
“You put all those together, and you have just a hairball of issues in an environment that’s completely shrouded in fog,” he said. “No one knows.”
International students also pose a specific set of financial and risk considerations for universities to consider.
Sheela Murthy, an expert on United States immigration law, highlighted that if online classes continue through the fall, international students may be less inclined to pay the “big bucks” often required to enroll in U.S. colleges, which could contribute to further financial loss for universities.
The arrival of all students — international as well as domestic — poses a legal and reputational threat to universities, which could potentially face lawsuits if any students fall ill and die from the coronavirus while on campus.
“If kids come here and get the disease and fall ill and — God forbid — pass on, what are the legal ramifications for the university in terms of being sued?” Murthy said. “That would be way more than whatever cost that they’ve lost and result in ill will and getting a bad name overall.”
Universities also must consider the location of their campuses; for urban campuses like Harvard, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview with The Crimson administrators have to consider that many University employees rely on public transportation to commute to and from the campus.
Nevertheless, some universities have decided that with certain precautions and changes in place, a return to campus for undergraduates is possible.
Boston College announced on May 19 that it intends for on-campus classes to resume as scheduled for the fall semester with increased physical distancing and sanitization protocols, as well as COVID-19 testing and isolation procedures developed by its University Health Services.
Similarly, the University of Notre Dame announced that, with increased health protocols, students will return to campus in August. Notre Dame will conduct the fall semester two weeks earlier than previously planned, cancel fall break, and end before Thanksgiving.
Harvard College has not yet announced its plan for the fall semester, but Bacow said plans are “likely to vary by school” and will be communicated to students once administrators reach a decision.
The Medical School, however, has made a decision about the fall — it announced on May 13 that fall semester classes for first-year students would be held online.
In order to facilitate a return to campus, the Centers for Disease Control issued guidance that universities must work with public health officials to establish proper mitigation strategies for “before, during, and after” a potential outbreak.
Higher education institutions’ plans “should be designed to complement other community mitigation strategies to protect high risk populations and the healthcare system and minimize disruption to teaching and learning and protect students, staff, and faculty from social stigma and discrimination,” the guidance reads.
Xihong Lin, a School of Public Health biostatistics professor and co-author of a study that investigated the COVID-19 outbreak and control methods in Wuhan, China, said there are six pillars that must work simultaneously to control the outbreak — mask-wearing, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, isolation, and treatment.
On May 6, Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 issued an executive order mandating that people wear face coverings in public areas, both indoors and outdoors, where social distancing is not possible.
This order does not yet have an end date, but Goldberg said both wearing masks and social distancing measures will be necessary on campuses to protect people at a higher risk from getting infected with the virus.
“Although there’s a risk of a college student getting severely ill, it’s very low,” Goldberg said. “However, college students interact with older people all the time, particularly faculty on university campuses and service workers, whether it be individuals in the cafeteria or building and maintenance crews, or anybody in the local community around the college.”
In addition to these precautionary measures, Goldberg said the ability to “rapidly identify” and isolate infected students will be important, especially because expecting college students to consistently wear masks and socially distance themselves may not be realistic.
“I don’t think anybody believes that college students are not going to be socializing and interacting with one another in close proximity and likely without masks on. Everybody assumes that will happen,” she said. “The real question is, when students become infected, how to manage that so that they don’t put the older populations at risk.”
Lin emphasized that the capacity to identify people with COVID-19 on campus through testing and contact tracing efforts — in which people who recently interacted with an infected person are identified and asked to isolate themselves — is necessary to halt the virus’s spread.
“If one can identify the source of infection, pick the source of infection out of the network, then that will reduce the number of new infections,” Lin said.
At the University of California, San Diego, Cheryl A. Anderson is leading a program that is trying to determine just how possible it would be to control an outbreak on campus.
The initiative includes gathering data to determine the feasibility of having a surveillance system on campus that could detect cases of COVID-19 on campus early, conduct contact tracing efforts, and therefore halt the spread of infection.
Anderson said she hopes the gathered data can be used to help other universities make informed decisions about how possible it is to contain an outbreak if it reaches campus. She added that if colleges do choose to reopen in the fall, some level of infection is all but inevitable.
“We recognize that a campus that has activity in the midst of a pandemic will not be a campus devoid of infection,” she said. “But it would behoove any campus that wanted to have activity to have a way of detecting those infections at their earliest possible time.”
The testing of individuals with symptoms, however, may not be enough to prevent an outbreak. A recent study by the CDC estimated that about 35 percent of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic but can still spread the infection at the same rate as a symptomatic individual. The agency also estimated that 40 percent of transmission occurs before symptoms are presented.
Stephen M. Kissler, a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Public Health and co-author of a study suggesting that social distancing may be necessary through 2022, said another type of testing may actually be the best determining factor for how the virus might impact a campus.
Serological tests, also known as antibody tests, can determine whether or not a person was previously infected with COVID-19. Scientists have not yet been able to determine, however, whether or not antibodies from COVID-19 confer enough immunity to prevent another infection, according to the CDC.
Kissler said serological testing could determine how many people at a university and in the surrounding area may have already developed some level of immunity, which, if high enough, could make the probability of a larger outbreak “very small.”
The number of people with antibodies is likely not yet high enough to significantly limit the spread of infection, however. A recent study estimated that only ten percent of the Boston population has been exposed to COVID-19, and herd immunity is only reached if over 60 percent of the population has been exposed.
According to Kissler, bringing students back to college without a high prevalence of immunity, even if Boston has been able to control the outbreak, could be a “very bad idea.”
“You would be bringing a lot of students to campus who would themselves probably not be affected very badly, but they would be starting infections in the community at a much higher rate, and it would be a lot more difficult to control,” Kissler said.
Kissler said in order to be able to control an outbreak, students would have to actively participate in preventative measures — but it still would not be easy.
“If there’s enough testing in place, if the student body is vigilant enough and willing enough to keep track of their contacts and these sorts of things over time, then I think that with enough buy-in, it would be possible to control outbreaks in the university setting,” he said. “But it would be an immense challenge.”
Universities that have already laid out plans for an in-person fall semester believe it is possible to implement necessary health protocols.
Notre Dame wrote its public health plan “will include comprehensive testing for COVID-19, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation protocols, social distancing and mask requirements, and enhanced cleaning of all campus spaces.”
Additionally, Notre Dame identified facilities where students who test positive for COVID-19 and their close contacts can be quarantined.
In his April email, Garber wrote that to assure the health of Harvard affiliates and people in the surrounding area, the University will need a variety of these systems in place.
“We will likely need adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, reliable and convenient viral testing, robust contact tracing procedures, and facilities for quarantine and isolation,” he wrote. “In the coming months we will learn more about whether these conditions can be met in time for the fall semester.”
Even if public health concerns prevent a return to campus and classes for the coming semester must once again be held online, Garber wrote that Harvard is still determined to provide learning and research at the “highest levels of excellence.”
Deborah M. Jewell-Sherman, a professor of practice at the School of Education, echoed Garber’s determination that the education provided at Harvard would remain high quality, even if educators have to rethink their teaching methods.
“I think that it will take a commitment that I believe we as faculty have, to do this and do it well,” she said. “We’re Harvard. We want our practice to be exemplary.”
Online classes, Garber affirmed, would not simply be attempts to imitate the experience of in-person classes, as they largely were after online classes began this semester.
“Rather than seeking to approximate the on-campus experience online, we can focus our efforts on developing the best possible remote educational experience,” Garber wrote.
Sherman said even though the changes could be challenging, she was “excited” about the way educators could adapt.
“With all the challenges of the pandemic, it gives us the opportunity to rethink education in many, many significant ways,” she said. “It’s almost like we have the opportunity to come up with a new design for a new age.”
Jal D. Mehta ’99, a professor at the School of Education, said online learning works best in interest-driven communities, where people are learning and working together with a “shared purpose or goal.”
According to Mehta, online classes therefore might function better in smaller classes within concentrations rather than in large lecture classes. Mehta said for large lecture classes, a flipped classroom setup would be ideal.
“I think the obvious thing to do in this environment is record the lectures, use the in-person time for questions and opportunities to talk with the professor and the TFs about things that people are confused about, interested in, want to follow up on, or another way to use that time in more interactive ways,” Mehta said.
Mehta added that though building relationships is more challenging and time-consuming online, it can and should be done through, for example, individual meetings between course staff and students.
“If next year were entirely online, at least in the fall, then I think spending the time to build that kind of community upfront will be critical,” he said. “Spending some time to build that will really pay itself back academically as things go on. And I think it would be good for students’ mental health.”
Mehta also acknowledged a clear positive to the transition to virtual programming — at online dissertation defenses, which traditionally have about 15 people watching, unlimited numbers of people from all over the world were able to tune in online to support the student.
Still, the positive aspects of an in-person learning experience cannot always be replicated virtually.
Adam J. Silk ’82, a psychiatry instructor at Harvard Medical School, said educators will have to try to address the “sense of alienation” that people may feel with virtual learning.
“People feel more disconnected from each other when they’re in their own homes or wherever watching a screen,” he said. “That experience of alienation from each other is an unpleasant one and not one that helps learning at all.”
Sherman said she misses the “intimacy” of in-person classes and added that a certain “magic” of learning is lost over Zoom.
“There’s a rhythm to the teaching and a rhyme that’s anticipatory. I miss that a great deal,” she said. “I can try to replicate some aspects of that closeness in the learning community, but technology mutes some of that closeness and I’m not at all sure how to do that.”
The very nature of a college experience, in which students live in close quarters, learn together, and diverse groups of people constantly interact, is exactly what makes a coronavirus outbreak so dangerous on a campus. The people on a campus, Kissler said, are sharing “more than just ideas,” and university administrators continue to confront this irony as they decide on the format of the coming semester.

As first-year students at Harvard Law School, Molly M.E. Coleman and A. Vail Kohnert-Yount both attended a “lunch talk” where an attendee brought up the subject of mandatory arbitration. The practice requires employees to solve workplace disputes through an arbitration process rather than through the courts.
Following the lunch, Coleman emailed Kohnert-Yount after she had raised some concerns with the practice at the talk.
“I was like, ‘Hey, you seem pissed about this. I’m pissed about this. Can we get a beer and talk about it?’” Coleman said, recalling their first exchange.
Kohnert-Yount invited other students frustrated by mandatory arbitration and inadvertently sparked a movement that would define much of their three years at the Law School. The People’s Parity Project was born.
Founded in 2018 by Kohnert-Yount, Coleman, Sejal S. Singh and Emma R. Janger, the People’s Parity Project aims to reform the legal profession by working to end harassment, combat injustice, and protect workers’ rights in the legal field.
The organization focuses on ending sexual harassment of workers within the judiciary, as well as eliminating mandatory arbitration clauses from employee contracts. From a small group of Harvard Law students, it has grown into a network with chapters at nine different law schools, including Yale Law School, Columbia Law School, and Georgetown Law School.
Since its creation, the People’s Parity Project has led several campaigns both on and off campus. The group protested the nomination of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, pressured major law firms to remove their mandatory arbitration agreements, and advocated for courts to reform procedures in response to sexual harassment allegations.
Though founders of the People’s Parity Project will graduate from the Law School this spring, the organization will continue to work toward its mission of “a justice system that values people over profits,”as their website reads.
Still, the organization faces obstacles in its mission to give the legal profession an ethical overhaul.
Many law firms and lawmakers continue to support mandatory arbitration agreements as more efficient and harmless alternatives to resolving disputes through the court system. In the wake of the height of the #MeToo movement and in a period of record unemployment in the legal profession, the founders are also seeking sizable cultural shifts in the field of law.
Diane L. Rosenfeld, who teaches a course on gender violence at the Law School, wrote in an email that the People’s Parity Project gives her hope for the future and proves the capabilities of student activists.
“It fills a needed gap in legal services and promises to create a more equal legal profession overall,” she wrote. “The voice of PPP will only continue to grow louder and more important.”
The founders entered the Law School in 2017 not expecting to spend the next several years advocating for judicial reform and employee rights.
Singh said soon after arriving on campus, the group’s founders came to view the legal system as a profession stacked against workers, consumers, and vulnerable populations and in favor of maintaining and increasing corporate power.
“We all came to law school hoping to fight for workers and consumers and for a just economic and social system, and instead we got here and we saw that the law was even more stacked against the people that we plan to represent than we realized,” Singh said.
Janger described two incidents during that year which motivated the group to organize the People’s Parity Project.
The first was the surfacing of sexual harassment allegations against former Ninth Circuit Appellate Court Judge Alex Kozinski, who was considered a “feeder judge” for students hoping to clerk at the Supreme Court.
“What I think really galvanized all of us was that for so many in the legal profession, that was common knowledge — that was an open secret,” Janger said.
She claimed professors at law schools continued to recommend students to serve as Kozinski’s clerks, despite the open secret of the harassment allegations.
The second motivation for the People’s Parity Project stemmed from learning about mandatory arbitration and realizing how frequently law firms required new, young employees to sign these agreements.
Out of a desire to fix these two issues, the founders formed the Pipeline Parity Project.
The organization rebranded as the People’s Parity Project in June 2019 to reflect the wider goals of the project and its growth beyond the Harvard campus.
“We’re fighting for a legal system that puts people on the equal playing field with corporations so that we can actually hold bad actors accountable for putting profits over people,” Singh said.
The People’s Parity Project soon made headlines for organizing a walkout at the Law School on Sept. 24, 2018, days before Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor from California, would testify that Kavanaugh sexually harassed her at a party both attended in high school.
Hundreds of Harvard students donned buttons reading “I Believe Christine Blasey Ford” and called for a fair investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct brought against Kavanaugh by Ford and Deborah Ramirez, who alleged Kavanaugh assaulted her while they were undergraduates at Yale.
Students also protested Kavanaugh’s affiliation with the Law School. The Supreme Court justice served as a visiting lecturer for nearly a decade, teaching classes like “The Supreme Court Since 2005.” Kavanaugh eventually told the Law School in October 2018 that he would no longer teach his class slated for January 2019.
“Nobody had bothered to provide Dr. Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, or Anita Hill with a fair process that took seriously their complaints of sexual misconduct,” Singh said. “We thought it was incredibly important that as young members of the legal profession we take a stand to say this is unacceptable.”
After organizing the walkout, the People’s Parity Project turned their attention toward judicial reform to protect clerks following the allegations against Kozinski. The organization urged the Judicial Conference — the body in charge of workplace regulations within the federal court system — to implement changes to workplace conduct policies such as creating a centralized reporting channel that allows for anonymous reporting of workplace harassment.
The D.C. Circuit Court subsequently reformed its policies by instituting a workplace environmental climate survey and creating an employee advisory group.
“It’s not just the privileged clerks coming out of Harvard Law School,” Janger said. “It’s also the career clerks, the secretaries, the janitors, and so many other employees who work in a judge’s office or in chambers and are left without protection as well.”
The People’s Parity Project recently continued its fight against judicial misconduct when Law School graduate Olivia A. Warren accused federal judge Stephen R. Reinhardt of sexual harassment in her Feb. 13 testimony to the House Judiciary Committee.
“We submitted written testimony as well to that hearing, and have continued to sort of work in coalition with other advocates on this issue,” Janger said.
In addition to its work in combatting sexual harassment in the legal field, the People’s Parity Project aims to protect law students from signing “coercive” employment contracts, which they claim enable law firms to silence victims of harassment and discrimination.
The organization includes mandatory arbitration clauses and non-disclosure agreements, which prohibit employees from publicly discussing harassment claims, under their definition of “coercive contracts.”
“Forced arbitration, like I said, is a legal tool that employers use to sweep misconduct under the rug — from sexual harassment, to wage theft, to denying people pregnancy accommodations,” Singh said.
Coleman said an estimated 56 percent of non-unionized workers agree to these provisions in their employee contracts, but most Americans do not understand what “mandatory arbitration’’ means.
“People don’t even know that they signed away their rights because lawyers use legalese — use these complicated terms and all these opinions that are basically illegible,” she said.
The People’s Parity Project works on several fronts to scrutinize employers who require mandatory arbitration agreements. Most notably, it supports the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, which would ban employers from requiring employees to sign contracts with mandatory arbitration clauses.
In September 2019, the project joined 70 other organizations in drafting a letter sent to the United States House Judiciary Committee in support of the FAIR Act. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill later that month, but the bill has not yet been taken up for a vote in the Senate.
The organization has also directly pressured law firms to remove mandatory arbitration clauses from their contracts. Through tactics such as distributing flyers, circulating hashtags, and calling for prospective applicants to boycott certain firms, it has convinced more than half a dozen companies to alter their contract requirements for all employees.
“Kirkland & Ellis is one of several companies that we forced to drop forced arbitration agreements by putting them on blast — naming and shaming them and helping inform people who might work there — prospective employees — about their potential forced arbitration agreements,” Singh said.
The law firm Kirkland & Ellis dropped mandatory arbitration agreements for non-attorney staff members and associates in late 2018.
The People’s Parity Project also features a list of survey results on its website which tell law students looking to apply for associate positions at one of 374 firms nationwide whether the firm requires mandatory arbitration agreements.
“These firms rely on students to run, and so if we could show that students were outraged about this and weren’t going to go work for companies that were forcing people to sign away their civil rights when you took a job, we knew that we’d have a lot of leverage,” Singh said.
The group’s founders said they believe Law School students have strongly supported the efforts of the People’s Parity Project because the issues they have taken up with directly affect them once they graduate.
“We’re making headway on convincing people that if we, as law students and future lawyers, don’t want to be subjected to forced arbitration, we also have an obligation to not subject others to forced arbitration on behalf of our clients,” Coleman said.
But the People’s Parity Project has encountered its share of resistance in its mission to reform the legal field.
“A lot of our work is challenging kind of established power, and that can be uncomfortable, especially when those power structures have gone very much unchallenged at places like Harvard Law School,” Kohnert-Yount said.
She argued that law schools teach students from a perspective that looks favorably upon corporate power and places less emphasis on workers’ rights — a view opposite to the goals of the People’s Parity Project.
Kohnert-Yount recalled doing a keyword search of the Law School’s course catalog as a first-year student and finding an overwhelming number of classes including the word “business” in their course descriptions, but only two using the word “worker.” A similar search for the 2019-2020 course catalog finds only three courses that include “worker” while 131 include “business.”
“Our education is very stacked,” she said. “Corporate power is baked into our curriculum.”
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the school offers courses and programs that allow students to work in public service.
“With more than 400 courses across a wide range of subjects and 44 pro bono legal clinics and student practice organizations, through which our students donate hundreds of thousands of hours each year to clients in need, Harvard Law School offers every student abundant opportunities to explore their interests and to serve their communities,” he wrote.
Singh stated the organization’s challenge is to change the way students think away from this mindset to a view which values individual employees.
“It’s getting people to realize that living these values means huge changes to the law and really returning power to working people when the law does not do that,” she said.
The People’s Parity Project also faces opposition to its views on mandatory arbitration.
DLA Piper, a law firm currently subject to social media pressure and an applicant boycott by the People’s Parity Project, continues to support its policy of mandatory arbitration.
“It has been our experience as a firm that arbitration is a fair and efficient way to resolve internal disputes, and one that benefits all parties in what are often sensitive matters for everyone involved,” the firm wrote in a November 2018 statement.
Similarly, U.S. Representative Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) argued during the House floor debate on the FAIR Act in September 2019 that arbitration provides a cheaper and faster alternative to litigation and actually results in less hostility between the parties and more favorable results for the employee.
“The bill’s proponents advance the idea that arbitration is unfair, coercive, and harmful, but that’s far from the truth,” Lesko said.
Even now, the organization continues to expand and launch new initiatives. This summer, the organization created the “COVID-19 Rapid Response / Systems Summer Institute,” which will pair unemployed law students with public interest legal organizations, including those focusing on unemployment insurance advocacy and studying the racial impact of the pandemic.
This program attracted an estimated 1,600 law students from 27 schools across the nation to the work done by the People’s Parity Project — further broadening the organization’s network.
“There’s such a hunger to do this work that, you know, when people see other like-minded spirits who want to change this system for the better, they reach out,” Singh said.
The summer fellowship builds off the organization’s work connecting with students at other law schools to create additional People’s Parity Project chapters.
The organization now boasts chapters in six states across nine law schools — Columbia, Georgetown, Michigan, New York University, Yale, Washington University, the University of Connecticut, and the University of New Hampshire, as well as its original Harvard chapter.
“We found that there are very few spaces where people are organizing around the issues that we organize around, and so whenever we launch a campaign, we hear from students at other campuses around the country who really want to be involved,” Singh said.
Tamar Hoffman, a member of the Georgetown branch, said her school’s chapter launched in the fall of 2019 and has focused on researching non-compete agreements in contracts for low-wage workers.
“I think that it’s really admirable the way that the project started as thinking about the way in which law students have power and also are impacted by inequalities in the legal profession,” Hoffman said.
Mac McMechan, a first-year law student at the New York University School of Law, said their chapter dedicated its time to lobbying for the EmPIRE Act — a bill in the New York legislature that would allow employees to file a whistleblower suit against employers who violate workplace law.
“It’s a bill being sponsored by various assembly members and senators that allows individual workers and organizations helping them to serve as personal attorneys general and bring forth employment claims, like wage theft or unsafe conditions, as a way to get around forced arbitration,” McMechan said.
At first, the People’s Parity Project expanded to different law schools organically through existing friendships and interested students reaching out to the founders of the organization for ways to get involved. Now, the founders intend to reach out and recruit specific schools they think would add diversity to the organization or that reside in a state crucial to the project’s policy initiatives.
“This year, we prioritized doing outreach to schools outside of the top 14,” Singh said, referring to the top 14 law schools designated by the U.S. News rankings. “It’s really important to us that our organization isn't replicating those elite dynamics.”
The four founders of the People’s Parity Project plan to graduate this spring as members of the Class of 2020. Still, Singh assured the organization would continue its mission and grow “bigger and better” in years to come.
The group will remain on the board of directors and will select new leadership to take over the Harvard chapter. Coleman will also serve as the first executive director of the organization.
Even though the four founders will no longer run Harvard’s chapter of the People’s Parity Project, they all plan to continue fighting for the same values the organization champions in their post-graduate careers.
“There’s little point in our law school education if access to justice is closed. Right? And so we’re here to vindicate our legal education,” Kohnert-Yount said.

For junior faculty hopefuls, the University’s tenure process begins with years of managing a rigorous teaching schedule, wrangling students in advising, and making strides in research — a quest to prove they are “scholars of the first order of eminence,” boasting a “capacity to make significant and lasting contributions” to Harvard, per the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ handbook on the process.
“The foremost criteria for appointment are scholarly achievement and impact on the field, evidence of intellectual leadership and creative accomplishment, potential for future accomplishments, teaching and advising effectiveness in a variety of settings with both undergraduate and graduate students, and potential contributions to the University and broader scholarly communities,” the handbook explains.
After seven to eight grueling years of such undertakings — and several rounds of evaluation from their peers — FAS tenure cases ultimately end in the hands of an ad hoc committee, whose composition is secret, chaired by the University president or provost. At the final stage, the president has the sole authority to decide whether a candidate receives tenure and provides no explanation of the decision to the candidate or the candidate’s department.
But Harvard’s November decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña — who studies race and ethnicity — prompted many students and faculty to question the integrity of that process.
Students and scholars inside and outside Harvard protested the denial, staging a sit-in at University Hall, writing letters to administrators, and organizing rallies in Harvard Yard.
More than 100 faculty members, meanwhile, called for a review of Harvard’s tenure procedures “with an eye toward better aligning them with the University’s stated commitments to diversity, inclusion, and belonging” in a December letter addressed to FAS Dean Claudine Gay.
A few days later, Gay agreed to launch a review of the FAS’s tenure promotion system in the fall of 2020, the first such review since the FAS formalized its tenure track in 2005.
Harvard affiliates have since raised many concerns about the tenure process, including the use of confidential ad hoc committees and the lack of accountability in the final decision.
However, the FAS’s review will not examine these aspects of Harvard’s tenure system. Since the review takes place at the level of the FAS, it cannot examine University-wide procedures such as the use of ad hoc committees.
In connection with García Peña’s prominent tenure denial, the review has also prompted conversations about how universities increase the range of identities represented in the research they produce and the courses they offer — and also bolster the diversity of the historically white, male, and upper-class academy itself.
Responding to whether she will examine the impacts that gender and race may have on tenure outcomes, Gay said in March that such traits are not bases for evaluation in the tenure process.
Harvard goes to great lengths to protect confidentiality in its tenure process. The University keeps the composition and proceedings of ad hoc committees secret, provides no feedback to candidates or their departments, and asks faculty to pen private letters about candidates to the dean.
Several faculty said in interviews with The Crimson that secrecy is necessary to ensure candidates receive honest evaluations during the tenure process. At the same time, many said they think the process should be more transparent so candidates and their departments can receive feedback — especially given their heavy investment in the process.
“Given the sensitive nature of the process, where honest opinions are often solicited worldwide, there has to be a certain amount of confidentiality in the proceedings,” Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations professor Peter Der Manuelian ’81 said.
“That said, there could always be more transparency, and one hopes that the outcome of the review process allows the Administration to continue protecting the delicate nature of tenure review while also providing more stakeholders with information along the way,” he added. “This is particularly true in scenarios where what appeared to be a very strong tenure case did not go forward.”
Specifically, Romance Languages and Literatures professor Virginie Greene said a chain of recent tenure denials — including that of García Peña — is “truly hard to understand and hard to bear.” Given the lack of transparency in the final phase of the tenure process, the unexpected denials have broken her trust in the system, she said.
“I myself am not sure how I will be able to be part of any search or review committee for tenure track colleagues in the coming years, knowing that the large amount of time my colleagues and I may spend working on mentoring and on the dossier may just be completely ignored at the end,” she said.
FAS and University spokespeople declined to comment for this article.
History professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74, who previously served on the FAS’s Committee on Appointment and Promotions, said he has been “generally impressed at the rigor and fairness” of the University’s tenure process since joining the faculty in 1995. But over the past few years, he has become more concerned about the process.
“In the past 2-3 years, there have been an increasing number of cases where colleagues I know well and respect found the negative outcome inexplicable and unjustified,” he wrote.
On the other hand, some faculty said they do not think it is possible to provide feedback while maintaining confidentiality.
History of Science professor David S. Jones ’92 said that while it is “immensely frustrating” for departments to put forward wonderful candidates only for them to be denied at the last stage without explanation, he thinks that in any official feedback, candidates could easily determine the origin of different pieces of praise or criticism — thus breaching the confidentiality of the tenure process.
“For instance, if a report came out of the ad hoc committee saying, ‘We liked everything, but your teaching wasn’t adequate,’ the candidate would say, ‘Clearly, my colleagues don’t like my teaching,’” Jones said.
He added in an email that while he believes a change to the secretive nature of the tenure system is unlikely, he thinks a review at the presidential level may reassure faculty of the integrity of the process.
“I don’t think any force of nature will get the President to reconsider the secrecy policy,” Jones wrote. “But I do think that a review, assuming that the President and Provost cooperate and are forthcoming (if not about details of individual cases, then at least with generalities about the factors that influence their decisions), might provide reassurance to departments and faculty that the current processes, despite their secrecy, are robust and appropriate.”
Divinity School lecturer Daniel P. McKanan ’89 said, however, that the University’s existing ad hoc system places control of the tenure process largely out of the faculty’s hands. McKanan — who chairs the American Studies program at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences — said that such was the case for García Peña, with whom many of his graduate students and faculty colleagues worked.
“We control it in the sense that faculty can prevent someone from being tenured,” he said. “There’s an initial stage, controlled by the department if it’s an FAS person, or the school if it’s someone at one of the professional schools. But even if that process is overwhelmingly positive, as was the case for Lorgia, it can be completely overruled at the ad hoc level.”
“It was interesting to read online chat lists after that case was publicized because people who were inclined to defend Harvard’s decision often couched their defense as, ‘We commentators on the Internet don’t really have the authority to judge scholarship; it’s the faculty of Harvard who should be able to judge the scholarship.’ But the reality was the judgment of the faculty of Harvard didn’t count,” McKanan added.
Faculty also expressed mixed opinions on Harvard’s practice of soliciting private letters from faculty in the candidate’s department. According to multiple faculty, many universities do not use the practice — relying instead on a departmental vote and external letters, which Harvard also solicits.
Anthropology professor Gary Urton said he thinks the use of both private letters and a departmental vote reflects a lack of trust in faculty to express honest critiques of candidates.
“Whether a faculty member gets tenure or not can cause dissension within the faculty, so the idea is everybody votes for tenure for everybody, but then some of the faculty might send letters to express a different opinion,” he said. “Some faculty say we should stop private letters, and that’s fine, but then you have to create a culture of trust so that faculty can express disquiet and uncertainty.”
Jones said that while he sees a potential for faculty to abuse the private letter system to express personal grievances, he ultimately thinks the letters are a “useful solution to a perceived problem”: that departmental votes stifle unpopular negative opinions.
“The perceived problem was that if there is a minority who is opposed to a case, they could get bullied or badgered into voting ‘yes’ by pressure from their colleagues. I can certainly imagine that could possibly happen,” he said. “The private letter system is designed to allow that person to make a safe mechanism to say what they really say.”
Gay wrote in her email agreeing to the FAS tenure procedures review that the FAS’s tenure track has improved since its establishment.
“It is meaningful that our promotion rates have risen significantly; that the FAS has achieved near-parity in its offers to ladder-faculty men and women; and that the FAS is stronger intellectually because of these developments,” Gay wrote. “Nonetheless, there is more we can do to make our system even better.”
Still, many Harvard affiliates and outside scholars said they are more concerned about the final stage of the tenure process than the FAS’s own procedures. They said they believe that structurally, the lack of transparency in ad hoc committees and final tenure decisions could allow prejudice against academics who study certain fields or scholars of color to occur without accountability.
While serving as an outside expert for one of Harvard’s ad hoc committees, Indiana University religious studies professor Edward E. Curtis IV said he witnessed a candidate of color being “unfairly judged” based on “the racial dynamics of the room.”
The candidate was ultimately granted tenure, Curtis said, but he wondered what might have happened if he had not challenged the “dominant racist, sexist narrative” he said other members of the ad hoc committee used when discussing the candidate’s scholarship and personality.
“I was very upset and passionate about how the person was being unfairly judged because of a particular point of view on law enforcement that very much reflected a white social position, when really all this person of color was doing in their scholarship was reflecting a very commonly held perception of law enforcement among people of color,” he said. “So it was crystal clear that the racial dynamics of the room were biasing the room against the candidate.”
“In addition, there were comments about the candidate’s personality, which were so typically made about people of color, as hard to get along with. I left thinking very much that the process was unfair to people of color,” he added.
University of California, Los Angeles Asian American Studies professor Renee E. Tajima-Peña ’80 said she thinks Garcia Peña’s tenure denial in particular reflects a broader “pattern” at Harvard.
“Harvard’s just really weak on tenuring women and faculty of color, women of color getting the double whammy,” she said.
Tajima-Peña said that in cases when the department approves of the candidate, she thinks the president’s final decision-making opportunity can serve to overrule faculty opinion based on what scholarly disciplines the president most wants to promote. She said that as a result, ethnic studies candidates may be warier of pursuing tenure at Harvard.
“For the brightest lights in the field of ethnic studies, why would they go to Harvard?” she said. “You would have to be crazy to go to Harvard.”
Shirley Verónica Cardona ’06, co-president of the Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance, wrote in an email that HLAA believes the FAS tenure review must examine how “inherent biases” may rear their heads in ad hoc committees.
“Prof. García Peña’s tenure denial raises concerns about the challenges faculty of color face in getting through the tenure process, especially the ad hoc process, which other universities have eliminated,” she wrote. “While the tenure procedure review will not examine individual cases, any real review must include a review by President Bacow of the merits of an ad hoc process and seek to identify any inherent biases that may exist.”
“As Harvard seeks to attract faculty from under-represented backgrounds to design and execute a world-class ethnic studies program, it is of critical importance for candidates to have trust in the tenure review process,” she added.
Jeannie Park ’83, a founding board member of the alumni group Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, expressed similar concerns.
“We hope the FAS review will explore what disadvantages faculty of color and women and ethnic studies scholars may face in the tenure process,” she wrote. “If Harvard truly wants to diversify its faculty and create an ethnic studies program, there can’t be a one-size-fits-all process.”
“There must be a review of the President and Provost’s mysterious ad hoc process, which can reverse a tenure recommendation by FAS. A review of FAS tenure won’t have impact without further transparency and examination of what happens in the final stages of tenure approval,” Park added.
Many faculty said Harvard loses promising faculty because its peer institutions offer professors tenure a year or two before the University can.
While Harvard only tenures faculty at the full professor level, many other universities tenure professors at the associate professor level.
“When I served as department chair, it was immensely frustrating that we would have faculty who were on the Harvard tenure track, and we had great confidence that they probably would get tenure, but when an offer with tenure would come from another well-regarded, high-ranking institution, we would lose that faculty member,” Urton said.
On the other hand, Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said he thinks the significance of earning tenure warrants a lengthy process, despite concerns about remaining competitive with peer institutions.
“The longer timeframe seems to me perfectly reasonable, given the gravity of what it means,” he said. “The only disadvantage that I am aware of is perhaps a competitive one where institutions will give someone tenure at the associate professor level, and they try to hurry us up so Harvard will make its decision. In a competitive marketplace, there may be a disadvantage, but in terms of the real institutional interest, that part of the system makes sense.”
English chair Nicholas J. Watson said he thinks Harvard’s tenure procedures should take into account the competitiveness of the current academic job market.
“Over the last fifteen years, it has become more and more difficult for those denied tenure in many disciplines to find a new position, as the number of academic jobs advertised at the associate professor level has gone down,” he said. “This means that the consequences of being denied tenure have become more and more drastic — it can, and in some cases now does, require a change of career.”
“We need to face up to this reality and think about how we are going to respond to it, if we believe not just in academic excellence, but in the values of diversity, inclusion, and belonging which have rightly been professed by the University in recent years,” he added.

As the coronavirus pandemic devastated the health of tens of thousands in the Boston area, it also imparted wide-ranging socioeconomic impacts on the city’s many low-income residents.
Amid rising numbers of unemployment and eviction cases, Greater Boston Legal Services has helped to fill resource gaps and provide legal aid to those most negatively impacted.
GBLS, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal assistance to low-income individuals and families, has opened up a variety of new programs and services since the start of the pandemic. The nonprofit has also transitioned its existing services into virtual formats through video conference platforms like Zoom.
GBLS executive director Jacquelynne J. Bowman said the organization is focusing on helping individuals apply for unemployment insurance, as well as helping others receive their federal stimulus payments. The organization is also directing its advocacy work at undocumented immigrants and non-English speaking individuals and families.
In addition to virtual legal consultation, GBLS is providing hotlines for a majority of their services, from unemployment and housing to special services like the Asian Outreach Legal Clinic. Individuals can leave voice messages and receive individualized legal assistance from GBLS attorneys free of charge.
During the pandemic, the agency has also maintained its advocacy work with local grassroots organizations like City Life/Vida Urbana and the Chinese Progressive Association.
David J. McKenna, the co-chair of the wage and benefits practice at Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, said GBLS’s responsiveness to the public health crisis can be attributed to its relationships with individual stakeholders and local services.
“Based on those relationships [GBLS was] able to adapt in a way that they might not have known how to adapt if they didn't have relationships with people who are directly impacted,” McKenna said.
Liliana H. Ibara, deputy director at GBLS, attested to the adaptive measures the agency has employed in order to carry its mission forward.
“Right now I think we're preparing remotely to figure out how we are going to meet a real influx of cases as the courts start opening up again,” Ibara said. “And so we've had to be pretty creative.”
As job losses have surged amidst the pandemic, Ibara said the agency has seen a spike in demand for its employment resources.
In April alone, Massachusetts lost 623,000 jobs, bringing the unemployment rate to 15.1 percent, the highest in over four decades.
Brian J. Flynn, managing attorney of the employment law unit, said that the “unprecedented job loss” has particularly led to an increase in requests from non-English-speaking households.
“[The agency was] particularly unable to deal with the volume of callers for non-English speakers,” he said. “So that is what generated the response to shift our work.”
In order to accommodate this demand, GBLS has translated its services to seven different languages, including Chinese, Nepali, Portuguese, and Spanish.
Among the growing number of non-English speaking clients the agency serves, Flynn said he is especially worried about undocumented immigrants.
“They have no income, and many times, they’re working in industries that are likely the last to come back. Restaurant work, service work, those jobs are probably the last to come back,” he said.
GBLS has historically ensured that its services are accessible to all low-income individuals, regardless of documentation status. In order to fulfill this mission, GBLS withdrew from $1.4 million in federal Legal Services Corporation funding in 1996. The funding, if accepted, would have prevented the organization from serving immigrants or engaging in certain types of advocacy.
Prior to the pandemic, the organization’s employment law unit mainly provided aid to people who were denied unemployment benefits. The practice has shifted its focus to helping people file unemployment insurance applications since March, according to Joseph J. Michalakes, a staff attorney in the employment and housing units.
“And it's not just doing the applications, it's also creating a system to maximize the amount of partners who can help build out our capacity to help as many workers as possible,” he said.
Alongside its response to the unemployment crisis, GBLS has worked to accommodate rising numbers of clients affected by housing insecurity.
It supports these clients through the Massachusetts Defense for Eviction, a virtual walkthrough program that helps people fill out eviction complaint documents and provides self-guided assistance to tenants facing evictions, with services available in Chinese, English, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese.
GBLS has not only responded to emerging housing needs with a direct service provision, but also launched advocacy campaigns targeted towards eviction defense and rent provisions.
Recently, the agency contributed to the effort to enact a temporary eviction moratorium in Massachusetts. Signed into law on April 20, the moratorium puts a halt on all non-essential evictions in the state. It will remain in effect for either 120 days or 45 days after the governor lifts the Commonwealth’s state of emergency status.
Bowman emphasized that the moratorium would not have succeeded if “it was just a bunch of lawyers.”
The moratorium’s success was fostered by partnerships with organizations like City Life/Vida Urbana, legal groups like Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, and state legislators, according to Michalakes.
“We worked in tandem with City Life and other community groups to come up with both an outreach strategy [and] media strategy to get as many stakeholders involved in advocating to shut down the court as possible,” he said.
“I think a provision like this, certainly, if you talked to people before the crisis, is perceived as pretty damn radical,” he added.
As GBLS has adapted its services to meet the demands of the pandemic, it has remained cognizant of the unique legal issues faced by minority groups.
In particular, the agency has targeted its support towards the Asian demographic during the pandemic due to increased “anti-Asian discrimination and targeting,” according to Bowman.
One special service that GBLS offers is the Asian Outreach Legal Clinic. The clinic works specifically with Chinese and Vietnamese speakers to provide assistance in applying for unemployment insurance, public benefits, and other emergency relief funds.
The program is part of the larger Asian Outreach Project, which provides legal assistance to over one thousand low-income Asian immigrants each year.
Bethany Y. Li, director of the Asian Outreach Unit, said the population of Asian immigrants is particularly in need of service because of the lack of native Asian language speakers at other Boston legal groups and organizations.
“I think that initial contact with the community can be really difficult without people on staff who understand the community, and can speak the language who are bicultural and bilingual,” Li said.
The AOU is staffed with Cantonese, Mandarin, Toisanese, and Vietnamese speakers, in addition to interpreters for other Asian languages.
The unit also works closely with grassroots organizations such as the Chinese Progressive Association and the Vietnamese American Initiative for Development to help workers secure better wages and working conditions.
In all of these efforts, GBLS remains attentive to the issues faced by people of color, according to Ibara.
“We do try to, as much as possible, bring a racial justice perspective to our work and to ask for what communities need,” Ibara said.
Bowman said GBLS’s commitment to helping low-income individuals and families will continue beyond the pandemic.
Although she hopes the agency’s current advocacy efforts may yield small steps forward in passing progressive policy, the fundamental work of the organization will remain unchanged, according to Bowman.
“Maybe we can fight to make sure that people at least have some access to enough income to meet their basic needs,” she said. “But I think our role in the community is not going to change. It's going to be the exact same as it was in 1900.”
Other GBLS staff members hoped that, moving forward, the pandemic might spark larger-scale policy change or more creative uses of technology.
Flynn said the pandemic has demonstrated the need for a minimum family income and a more robust unemployment tax system, citing the misclassification of people eligible for unemployment insurance.
“As an organization, what we would hope is that this crisis does reveal a need for a far more robust safety net in this country than we have,” he said.
Ibara said innovative technology usage amid the pandemic may benefit the agency’s future practices. She predicts an increase in the usage of video conferencing technologies that are essential to remote operations, such as Facebook Live and interactive presentations.
“We're thinking about how do we reach clients who were maybe hard of hearing and used to just walk into the office and know that they can get some kind of interpretation help at the office,” Ibara said. “How are we going to do outreach a little differently?”
During the pandemic, student volunteers have supported GBLS’s remote efforts in a variety of ways – from conducting client interviews and legal research to translations and oral advocacy.
It will be essential for GBLS to remain engaged with students, volunteers, and interns in the future, according to Bowman.
“We still have a long way to go,” she said. “I think that is important and critical for future generations, first of all, to understand that this is a shared responsibility, and that we all either rise or fall together.”

With thousands of students living in dense dormitories; eating in communal dining halls; and making near-constant contact in classes, during sports games, and at social events, the realities of college life left campuses like Harvard’s vulnerable when the novel coronavirus swept the United States this spring.
In response, Harvard closed its campus nearly entirely in March in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19 — shuttering labs, moving classes online, and sending all but a few students home after spring break.
But though the University’s spring shutdown was unprecedented in scale, Harvard has dealt with many an epidemic and pandemic in its centuries of operation. COVID-19 marks only the latest chapter in a long history of campus responses to infectious disease, from smallpox in the 1700s to swine flu in 2009, though no outbreak has ever before precipitated such a large-scale and long-term closure.
Graham Mooney, an associate professor at the Institute of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said that universities can prompt a lot of “concern” during outbreaks. As a result, each outbreak has necessitated new and innovative measures to contain the viral spread and protect faculty, students, staff, and visitors alike.
“You have these two things coming together — the infectious diseases and lots of children being in school, all of a sudden,” Mooney said. “The idea that you got all this pathological mixing… schools are seen as centers, foci of infection.”
When an epidemic of smallpox ravaged the New England states in 1721, Harvard was a mere 85 years old.
The idea of vaccines was just beginning to circulate, bolstered by Boston-based physician named Zabdiel Boylston. Thirteen Harvard students, a tutor, and a professor participated in Boylston’s experiments, making them among the first individuals ever vaccinated against smallpox.
During the smallpox epidemic, Harvard held a private, not public, commencement in order to limit virus spread. Harvard never fully closed, but many students fled campus during the outbreak and the University halved tuition for the quarter. Smallpox returned roughly nine years later. The University did not close, but it did cancel summer break to make up for low attendance rates due to the virus.
After that, in 1764, smallpox returned to Harvard’s campus, and in February of that year, Harvard closed its doors. A month later, it re-opened them, but students refused to return out of fear of the virus. Eventually, the decision to re-open was reversed and Harvard remained shut down.
Smallpox remained a constant threat, returning to Harvard’s campus in 1776. While many Harvard tutors and students underwent vaccination procedures, not all did and one unvaccinated tutor died in 1777 after contracting the disease. Harvard decided not to host commencement that year.
During many of the smallpox epidemics, students were instructed to avoid leaving campus, and were not allowed to visit friends or peers at local hospitals to limit the spread of the virus on campus. By the end of the 18th century, as vaccination became more widely accepted, Harvard allowed all students to be inoculated, but did not allow them to return to campus for four weeks following their inoculation. The policy led Harvard to shut down campus for four weeks in 1792 so students could be vaccinated.
In addition to the epidemics that circulated on campus, the epidemic that Europeans brought to Native Americans had a significant impact on the University’s history, according to Zachary Nowak, a College Fellow in Harvard’s history department.
“The epidemic that happens after Europeans have made contact with Native Americans in what is now New England, but before you have this beginning of long term settlement in 1630, 1620… that epidemic is actually also a super important one because that allows the English to settle and to start Harvard,” Nowak said.
Before COVID-19 struck, the most severe pandemic in recent American history — including on Harvard’s campus — dated back to a strain of H1N1 influenza that swept the country in 1918.
Commonly referred to as the Spanish Flu, the pandemic infected one-third of the world’s population and caused over 50 million fatalities, 675,000 of which occurred in the United States alone.
According to the CDC, the outbreak saw a uniquely high mortality rate for healthy people between the ages of 20 and 40 — posing particularly heady dangers to young people living on college campuses.
But despite the flu’s high mortality, the interventions Harvard implemented back then were far less drastic than those it took for COVID-19 this year.
In the fall of 1918, Harvard administrators quarantined the roughly 1,450 men in the Students’ Army Training Corps — a program similar to ROTC — and paused all classes with more than 50 students. Some professors divided their paused classes into smaller sections as a way of circumventing the University regulations.
George R. Minot, Class of 1908 — the acting Medical Adviser to the University during the 1918 pandemic — led Harvard’s charge against the virus, instructing Medical School fourth-years to inspect quarantined students daily and isolate any suspected cases.
Ultimately, Minot and the medical students treated 258 cases of the Spanish flu on campus.
During the Spanish Flu pandemic, many colleges were hit harder than Harvard and imposed more severe restrictions. At the University of North Carolina, the president and his successor both died from influenza, and the entire school was placed under quarantine. Many schools, including Princeton and Wellesley, created on-campus infirmaries; others, like Stanford, mandated all students wear masks.
A few decades the Spanish Flu, Harvard and other colleges also briefly contended with polio on campus, though the case count on campus never reached beyond the double digits. A polio outbreak at Columbia nearly canceled a Harvard-Columbia football game in the fall of 1951, but officials ultimately decided a cancellation was unwarranted.
In the fall of 1955, a Radcliffe freshman contracted a mild case of polio, and 27 other Radcliffe students preemptively received gamma globulin shots. Earlier that same year, a senior at Harvard also contracted polio. Still, the University declined to enact a mass quarantine or take similar steps.
By comparison, the University had reported 127 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among its affiliates as of Tuesday. University President Lawrence S. Bacow informed affiliates of the first Harvard affiliate who tested positive on March 13, just three days after administrators told students to vacate campus. Bacow and his wife, Adele F. Bacow, contracted COVID-19 themselves in late March, and have since recovered.
Preventive measures such as masks and enforced social distancing policies seemed to work much more effectively than therapeutic treatments during the 1918 flu, according to Scott H. Podolsky ’93, a professor of global health and social medicine at the Medical School.
“People did try things, they did try things ranging from vaccines as therapeutics to active immunotherapy as treatment,” Podolsky said. “So there were treatments, but, you know, in hindsight we can say that most of the treatments were probably not efficacious, whereas some of the preventive measures were.”
Nearly a century later, in 2009, another strain of H1N1 hit campus, though on a far less severe scale.
As that strain — commonly referred to as swine flu — swept across the continental United States, Harvard College remained fully operational.
The University’s Longwood Campus — which consists of the Medical School, the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the School of Dental Medicine — closed for several days at the start of May after a third-year dental student contracted what health authorities considered a probable case of the H1N1 flu.
In September 2009, Harvard University Health Services ordered 19,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine, exceeding the usual 12,000 doses. By the end of the outbreak, three dental students had confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus.
Though most of the H1N1 outbreak fatalities were people under 65, the virus’s overall mortality rate was approximately 0.02 percent — far lower than that of COVID-19.
As of May 23, there have been nearly 1.6 million cases of COVID-19 in the United States and over 96,000 deaths, with a death rate of approximately 6 percent.
Harvard’s most recent outbreak, meanwhile, also came to pass on a far smaller scale than COVID-19: In 2016, Harvard University Health Services saw more than 60 confirmed cases of mumps on campus.
The mumps vaccine is only 88 percent effective, and the 2016 outbreak occurred even though 99 percent of undergraduates were vaccinated against it, former HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira said at the time.
After an unspecified number of Harvard affiliates contracted mumps again in November 2018, HUHS urged students to take precautions — especially in advance of the Harvard-Yale Football Game, which normally draws dense throngs of students, alumni, and guests into stadiums and party spaces. But beyond the recommendations, HUHS declined to put any specific restrictions or interventions into place.
Today, it also boasts a wide range of innovations available that allowed it to continue classes online and communicate with and monitor its affiliates across the globe after the pandemic hit this spring.
Administrators are still deciding which of the measures they have taken so far to stymie the virus will remain in place this fall; but regardless, the upcoming semester, like the spring, will likely mark a continuation of an unprecedented chapter in Harvard’s long history contending with infectious disease.
