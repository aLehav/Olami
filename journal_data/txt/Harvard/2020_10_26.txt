After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in March, when the phrase “global pandemic” was something new and scary instead of a cliché, we desperately searched for something to bring color to the bleak monotony of newly-imposed lockdowns. Fortunately for us, the best and brightest stars of our entertainment industry joined together to create a work of art that would raise us up with the sublime power of hope and transcendent beauty. Unfortunately for us, they failed.
Failure, of course, is far too generous a description for what even the “New York Times” couldn’t resist calling a “clusterclump of hyperfamous people with five seconds’ too much time on their hands.” (“Clusterclump,” by the way is one of the more creative editorial compromises this writer has seen.)
But six months after the faux-utopian, sickly-sweetly-patronizing, hypocrisy-smeared, horribly, horribly tone-deaf — in every sense of the word — dumpster fire that purported to be a cover of John Lennon’s “Imagine,” we decided to return to it, hoping against hope that the past half year had vindicated it, and that our fresh ears would come away with a revised opinion. As you can probably tell from the top of this paragraph, this hope was soon to be pulverized even worse than our ears.
As soon as mastermind-ringleader Gal Gadot begins by talking about being “philosophical,” things are worrying. But then she launches into the song itself, and it’s far worse than anyone could have remembered.
“Imagine” is not an especially difficult song to sing. Its range only spans an octave and a third. Each verse uses the same melody, and the same musical phrase is used for the first few lines of every verse. The fact that, despite all this, these people — some of whom are actual singers! — managed to mess it up as badly as they did is, honestly, pretty impressive.
Or maybe we’re just being too harsh. Maybe they meant for it to turn out as it did. The way they didn’t bother to decide on a key to sing in before recording, and everyone just started on whatever note fancy gave them? A radical new chromatic interpretation, lending variety to an otherwise mundane tune! The ones who sang out-of-tune and the ones who barely sang at all? Ironic! The obvious disconnect of lyrics about “no possessions” and “a brotherhood of man” being sung by celebrities in multimillion-dollar homes? Satirical! The whole project was actually a Very Smart Critique of John Lennon’s own hypocrisy, and not just that same hypocrisy all over again. Definitely not.

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of another hit song, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP.” Yet another bop has been drained of all its fun by TikTok creators. The many remixes were amusing at first. I myself enjoyed the “Bohemian Wapsody” rendition of Megan’s verse. But soon, tragedy struck, as it does for all good songs that find themselves wandering the alleys of TikTok late at night. “WAP” and “The Phantom of the Opera.” “WAP” and “Let it Go.” Have these wannabe DJs no shame? Must they ruin every beat they upload to GarageBand? Can they not tell that the “swallow me” lyric falls on the downbeat?!
Having squeezed every ounce of inspiration from “WAP,” Tiktok has finally allowed Megan Thee Stallion’s verse to rest in peace. We can only pray that they do not get their hands on her new collab with Young Thug, titled “Don’t Stop.” Just in time for Halloween, Megan serves us “Alice in Wonderland”-meets-“Goosebumps” in this newest video. Hopefully, this mashup does not inspire any more crimes against Megan’s songs — although a “Don’t Stop” and the “Goosebumps Theme Song” remix could be an exception to this.
Though there’s no storyline, the music video evokes many elements from the Disney classic: Megan begins her first verse dressed as the Cheshire Cat in a pink and purple leotard, complete with his bushy tail. The backlit dancers and spooky circus vibes given by the set amplify the Halloween theme. Admittedly, for a video paying homage to the Cheshire Cat, the lack of glowing eyes and a toothy smile is disappointing.
The music video gets less spooky as Megan Thee Stallion, dressed as the Queen of Hearts, dances in the iconic hedge garden from “Alice in Wonderland.” Enter Young Thug dressed as… Edward Scissorhands? Not quite on-brand, but at least he contributes to the scene by trimming the hedges — yes, with his scissor-hands. Young Thug’s next costume, however, is just as random. He’s dressed as Michael Jackson in the “Thriller” music video, abandoning the “Alice in Wonderland” theme. With so many characters to choose from, excluding the Mad Hatter is almost criminal. Instead, we’re given Young Thug Scissorhands and Michael Jackson dancing with the Queen of Hearts.
Not quite the collab of the century, but still a better mash-up than anything TikTok could create.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 1918. The Spanish Influenza has hit and is rapidly becoming a global pandemic. In the world of “Twilight,” Edward Cullen is sick and alone in an overcrowded hospital in Chicago. His future adoptive dad is about to bite his hand and make him sparkly. He will then spend 100 years as a judgemental virgin before falling in love with a girl who is “not like other girls” and fathering the creepiest baby ever to appear on film.
Flash forward: It’s 2020. It’s been eight months of various states of lockdown and adjusting to a new normal. Zoom has replaced Harvard lecture halls and “Twilight,” a series whose first book was released in 2005, is trending on the internet.
Huh?
No obviously new content coincides with this resurgence. While Stephenie Meyer released “Midnight Sun” — “Twilight” from Edward’s perspective — in August, the “Twilight Renaissance” (as it has been called) predates the book’s release. Sidenote: “Midnight Sun” was Meyer’s second alternative version of “Twilight,” the first of which was her gender-bent — ahem, ctrl find and replace — version of “Twilight.”
With the influx of free time that accompanied lockdown, people needed something to do — and for a lot of people, that something seems to have been revisiting their “Twilight” phase as part of the “Twilight Renaissance” — to which we must ask why.
First, the obvious: “Twilight” is bad. Its lore has more holes than swiss cheese and its plot is as consistent as lumpy porridge. More appallingly, there’s the pedophilic “imprinting” concept; Meyer can say it’s not like that as much as she wants, but it absolutely is a form of grooming. There is also unrelenting racism against Native Americans throughout — not to mention how Meyer bastardized Quileute legends and has never paid the Quileute community a cent. A disappointingly varied array of misogynistic tropes also affect almost every female character.
Inexplicably, enough people still find “Twilight” compelling enough that over 3,500 fanfictions involving “Twilight” have been posted on Archive Of Our Own (AO3) in the last year and the “Twilight” subreddit has over 20,000 members today. This group of returning fans is back with more social awareness than they had in 2005 and are doing active work to recognise how deeply flawed the “Twilight” series is and refute Meyer’s harmful portrayals.
This, however, does not alleviate the question of why people have flocked back to a piece of media that so obviously has so much wrong with it. Is it simply that the pandemic gave a lot of us too much time?
Beyond the dazzling number of issues with “Twilight,” it is possible not all of the cringe-culture surrounding it was fair. Just like boy bands, K-POP, and YA literature, media with a demographic primarily made up of teenage girls is often unfairly belittled and demeaned in a way that media aimed at boys is not. This modern resurgence has allowed adults to shamelessly re-engage with what they enjoyed as teenagers and look at it through a more evolved lens.
Furthermore, “Twilight” inadvertently raises many fascinating themes. The question as to whether these themes were raised intentionally is a discussion for another day. The books are about monsters who do not want to be monsters, and tirelessly fight their natures to try to be good. They examine the difficulty of being brave when everyone else has abilities that you don’t and never letting yourself be helpless. It’s about choices and deciding what you want your life to be. Even if the central romance is deeply dysfunctional, it’s about weighing up how you should be, are, and want to be. The way these questions are considered is anything but sophisticated, yet they are nonetheless fascinating once raised.
At the end of the day, “Twilight” is bad. Yet it was incredibly popular a decade ago, and a degree of that popularity is back now. So why is this specific piece of mediocre, problematic media experiencing a revival?
Even though the parallels between Edward’s and therefore “Twilight”’s origin and our present moment are resonant, that probably isn’t the reason for its return.
Perhaps it’s because “Twilight” is incredibly contrived. The drama is ridiculous and the stakes are barely there — the climax in “Breaking Dawn” is literally some people walking around a field. It isn’t a children’s book, yet you never need to worry that things might end badly. Maybe it also has something to do with nostalgia; In a time where we need emotional support and relief from our difficult circumstances, media we once loved might be a great place to get that. It’s hard to imagine, though, that “Twilight” is the best source of that emotional escapism.
Many questions about this phenomenon still remain unanswered. The return of “Twilight,” of all things, on certain corners of the internet is really weird. Then again, this year has also been really weird and is getting weirder every month. Perhaps that’s all there is to it.

“Time” opens on a grainy, black and white clip filmed on a camcorder. Sibil Fox Richardson is holding the device, trying to find out where she wants to set it up. She is in the kitchen at first, the ceiling fan whirring overhead and the sound of a small child’s cooing floating in from somewhere outside the frame. Once she has changed rooms and propped up the camcorder, she stares unwaveringly into the camera lens. “My husband is in jail,” she says. "I’ve been out now a week and a day.”
Though this is a grim moment to open on, Fox tells the camera that she knows everything will eventually be okay. And thus, within the first 30 seconds of “Time,” the idea of dichotomy is established — black and white, freedom and imprisonment, hope and hopelessness. Director Garret Bradley uses dichotomy throughout the documentary to present the complex story of Sibil Fox Richardson and her husband, Richard Richardson, constantly reminding viewers that nothing regarding family and incarceration is as unblurred or unambiguous as it can often be made to seem.
“Time” moves back and forth between Fox’s homemade recordings of the past, professional recordings of speeches and talks given by a slightly older Fox, and recordings of the Richardson family in the present. Bradley juxtaposes shaky, handheld footage of children’s birthdays, car rides, and other intimate familial moments with sharper images of the present day. In one scene, he jumps between showing a young Fox and pregnant Richardson together and in love, and showing an older Fox and grown-up children in Richardson’s place. Though the story makes these temporal jumps quite frequently, it never feels jarring or misplaced. The black and white further adds cohesion, uniting the timeline across decades of footage. The two opposing colors have both racial and moral connotations, and the use of black and white distills the documentary into its central conflicts by erasing distractions, preventing viewers from forgetting the central crux of the film.
“Time” is told mostly through the perspective of Fox, who served a prison sentence far shorter than her husband’s. After the two of them robbed a bank, he was sentenced to 60 years in jail with no opportunity for parole, probation, or suspension. Though her body is now free, she remains mentally ensnared, devoting every waking hour to freeing her husband. Bradley goes to great lengths to show her dedication, as she makes video journals for him, keeps his memory alive for her children, and speaks at countless venues about her family’s story and America’s incarceral system. “Our prison system is nothing more than slavery. And I see myself as an abolitionist,” she says in a particularly powerful scene.
Everything about Fox is powerful — her strength as she lifts weights in the gym, her calm demeanour as she calls the judge’s office again and again for news, her voice when she asks her congregation for forgiveness. She goes through the agony of uncertainty every day, not knowing when her husband will come home. But perhaps the most compelling part of Fox’s emotional strength is her unwavering hope. When she speaks with Richardson on the phone, she asks, “What’s the first thing you’re gonna do when you come home to me?” Every year, she says, she's certain this “will be the year” he is released; it is clear that she truly believes it. She remains hopeful even when that hope seems naive at best, and that infectious belief in a better future spreads to her children. However, the audience remains hopeless in a solemn recognition of just how stacked the odds are up until the very last minutes of the film when Richard is released. It is a surreal moment to watch, as an angelic Fox, dressed in all white, screams and embraces her husband, who dons a shirt that says “NEVER GIVE UP” as he walks out of jail. It is not a clichéd or predictable ending; it is something that the audience dared not believe was going to happen, which Bradley masterfully delivers to an emotionally resonant and relieving effect.
Bradley won the directing award in the U.S. Documentary Competition at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival for “Time,” becoming the first Black woman to ever win the award. It's easy to see why her work was award-winning — her use of temporal jumps, decades-long narratives, humanization of complex issues, and presentation of dualities all come together to create a masterpiece that keeps her audience deeply invested. “Time” is especially relevant in America’s current social climate, and is a timely, beautiful reflection on the penal system through the lens of Fox's resilient love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A teen leader. A passion to help others. A somewhat niche focus area on kids, elders, or underprivileged members of society. Combine these three, and you get a flood of high school and college students founding and running their own nonprofit organizations.
Don’t get me wrong, I love volunteer work and philanthropy. Before it became a silently agreed-upon requirement for college applications, there was no ulterior motive that high school students may have had in embarking on various volunteering endeavors. And I still want to assume good intentions.
But here’s the thing. The majority of student-founded and -run organizations contribute to causes that are already supported by existing well-established organizations. These previously established organizations have key advantages for making change compared to student-run ones. They tend to have a much higher budget for the operational costs, often allowing for ample professionals and resources, whether physical or virtual. They also are likely to last longer. Especially considering how high school and college students often graduate and relocate from their hometowns, it can be extremely difficult to maintain the continuity of a student-run program once the original founder — who undoubtedly benefits the most from having “founded” something — moves away.
The monetary and timely costs of registering as a nonprofit may not be worth it. Registering as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization in Massachusetts costs about $600 and requires filling out several official government forms such as IRS Form SS-4 — not to mention that you need to establish an official director and officers. For student initiatives such as a local community food bank, $600 is logically too large an investment for close to no real return. Why not just use that money to help the cause you claim to be passionate about? For example, you could purchase tangible supplies, such as loads of canned foods. That money would be much better spent on the cause itself, rather than the bolstering of an ephemeral student effort.
Of course, there are potential benefits to students establishing their own nonprofits. Students tend to have a very strong network of young volunteers that they can reach and mobilize through social media with the push of a button. This also allows them to practice their leadership skills. But experiencing and learning from leadership doesn’t require setting up a completely new nonprofit organization. You can start a chapter of support for an existing organization at your school. That way, you can build on existing resources and potentially have further reach. Because a pre-existing organization may already have cross-country offices and staff, student wide initiatives — even nationwide ones — are much more feasible.
It’s also critical to acknowledge that there are organizations with causes that students may agree with but maintain internal values that are misaligned with the students’ visions. In this case, it makes sense that students would choose to dedicate their time and efforts to an organization that they truly identify with.
But what’s most important to consider is advancing the cause itself. Be careful — investing your time and energy into your own registered nonprofit organization may be serving you more than the cause. This may veer into the dangerous territory of performative activism. We need to decenter ourselves from the spotlight of volunteerism and activism. We need to and realize that we are there to amplify the voices of the underprivileged and aid their solutions.
Furthermore, we often accidentally give too much credit to just the “founder” or the “leader” of a group. No wonder students feel the pressure to create their own organizations to display on their college applications and resumes. But the people in supporting roles are the ones who can serve as the communication liaison between the larger pre-existing organization and the newer school-based student members. Serving in an amazing supporting role is just as important and necessary for the community — if not more — than swooping in with a savior complex.
So please, before you start your own nonprofit, take the time to see if there is already an organization that you can contribute to. Learning to share the stage in making a difference is a lot more philanthropic than craving the spotlight.

Next week will be very hard, even by 2020 standards.
The election, with all its associated emotional and psychological baggage, is coming to a close. After months of disastrous debates and wide distrust of polls, America will speak — though we might not figure what the election results are for several weeks. We expect that most of our campus will spend Tuesday night glued to their screens, overanalyzing the shifting results of counties, districts, and states, fretting over different possible outcomes. The following morning is bound to be politically and psychologically chaotic, a time when we, and the University, need to prioritize our mental health over school.
Regardless of the result, Wednesday will be a day of intense and overwhelming emotion for much of our community. Perhaps we'll wake up in fear and uncertainty, unsure of who will occupy the White House in January. For some members of marginalized groups, there may be joy — accompanied by a deep awareness that even their preferred candidate is hardly a steadfast ally — or maybe grief, at the prospect of another four years of a wannabe dictator eroding rights. There might not be a clear outcome at all, leading to weeks' worth of ballot counting and ever-updating Twitter feeds; or there might be a clear outcome overshadowed by concerns over the likelihood of a peaceful transfer of power.
The emotional implications of these scenarios — or, for that matter, of any possible scenario — cannot be understated.
Expecting our peers to simply go back to work on Wednesday — to dive into a lecture on late Medieval history, to dissect the glands of one toad or another, or to code for hours — is simply unreasonable. Such an approach fails to recognize that if the personal is political, so too the political is personal; that elections and ballots can have a tangible impact on our community's emotional and psychological wellbeing.
We know as much because we've been here before. In the immediate aftermath of the 2016 election, calls to some BGLTQ crisis and suicide prevention hotlines more than doubled; Canada's immigration site infamously crashed. Racism takes a significant psychological toll on our Black peers, which could be magnified on election night. This year, amid uncertainty over whether certain right-wing extremist militias will continue to “stand-by” in the immediate aftermath of the election, and with a raging pandemic growing worse each day, we deserve a break — a day to cool off, to reflect, to check in on each other, and to celebrate or mourn.
Two days off — one to vote, one to breathe — might seem like a tough sell. But it shouldn't. For one, there is a solid precedent at Columbia, where students have for decades enjoyed two consecutive days off leading up to the general election. Attending Zoom school might be important; however, closely following and engaging with the political landscape that trapped us in this digital hellhole is surely more important.
Of course, guaranteeing our well-being on Wednesday just to shift back to normalcy the day after would be absurd. The University must engage more fully with students' mental health and its connection to political or external events, offering comprehensive support. Sometimes tragedy, unmarked and unplanned, can also trigger a sense of loss and devastation in our student body. The blatant racism and chaos that tore across the nation this summer ought to teach us that much. Harvard needs to recognize the pain that marks such occasions by offering a response grounded in sympathy and flexibility and extensions, rather than on workaholic fixation on productivity.
Election night will be rough; the morning after might just be worse. Harvard ought to give its students a chance to process the outcome — whatever it might be.

Twenty-four percent of households in rural America reported they were unable to receive care for serious medical problems during the COVID-19 outbreak, according to a new poll by the Harvard School of Public Health, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and National Public Radio.
Published earlier this month, the poll provides a glimpse into rural Americans’ personal lives and wellbeing during the pandemic. Of the households who reported that they lacked access to care, 56 percent reported detrimental health consequences as a result, according to the poll.
Public Health professor Robert J. Blendon, the co-director of the poll, said the vast majority of data being gathered on the coronavirus has focused only on cases and death tolls. The new poll, meanwhile, focused on wellbeing issues that had previously gone unexplored.
“If you notice, almost all the stories are about cases, screening, and deaths,” Blendon said. “We're not asking if you were screened. We're not asking if somebody died in your family. We're asking about your ability to keep your household viable, which is financial issues, getting health care, and so many people are trying to educate their children at home in this period.”
Blendon said the outbreak unveiled a lack of medical practitioners and resources in rural America, leading to a lack of access to care.
He said that in cities, healthcare providers have tried to establish “networks” to evenly distribute COVID-19 patients across a wide array of hospitals, so that no provider is overwhelmed.
“In rural America, those networks don't exist,” Blendon said. “And many of the medical practices are three physicians.”
Internet connectivity also poses widespread problems for rural Americans, according to the poll. Approximately one in three rural households reported either facing serious difficulties with internet connectivity or lacking access to high-speed internet entirely.
Connectivity problems come at a cost at a time when both jobs and schooling are largely dependent on internet access, according to Blendon.
“I am in rural Illinois, and I can work from home — that's if I can connect to my employer,” Blendon said. “Otherwise, I'm not going to keep this job very long. So these are very real issues.”
Additionally, nearly half of the surveyed households report facing serious financial problems during the pandemic.
“I did not believe that you would have 42 percent of households in serious financial trouble. So maybe I thought 20, maybe I thought 18,” Blendon said. “And then when you came to minority communities, 85 percent of Black households or Latinos said they're in financial trouble.”
The poll is part of an ongoing partnership between the School of Public Health, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and NPR. For more than ten years, the three groups have worked together to poll Americans on a wide range of issues, including discrimination and income inequality.
Carolyn E. Miller, Senior Program Officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said the partnership provides ample resources for large, detailed surveys on broad and important issues.
“A lot of the studies that we do under this grant are much larger than most surveys or research efforts are able to do,” Miller said. “And so it's very gratifying for us to be able to do this, to support this kind of research.”

The Harvard Divinity School launched a new program in Religion and Public Life this month, its first new degree program in 50 years.
The program is aimed at studying the ways religion and civic life interact, said Jacob K. Olupona, a professor of African Religions jointly appointed at the Divinity School and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences who will teach courses as part of the RPL program. It includes both degree-granting and certificate-granting components, as well as a series of public speaker events, panels, and webinars.
By making more explicit the connections between the studies of religious and civic life at the Divinity School, Olupona said he hopes the RPL program will “enable outsiders to know what we do.”
“This is not just a seminary, where we train priests, but we are constantly thinking about the problems and issues of the society,” he said.
Unlike the Divinity School’s program in Ministry Studies, the RPL program is geared towards students interested in pursuing secular fields, such as government or non-profit work, according to RPL program founder and director Diane L. Moore. The program aims to teach an understanding of how religions function in society, rather than a deep scriptural knowledge of particular religions.
“A lack of understanding about religion actually fuels bigotry and prejudice and hinders capacity for cooperative endeavors across a whole range of possible publics,” Moore said.
“The emphasis is working from a non-sectarian understanding of religion to help work with others who are wanting to think about religion in capacious ways,” she added.
For example, Moore said, in the lead-up to the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq, she and other scholars knew that “the complexities of the civic and religious structures of the Iraqi society were incredibly fragile, and the implications of an invasion would be potentially devastating.” But, she said, no one in the administration itself had that understanding.
More recently, in the past decade’s Ebola outbreaks in West Africa, Moore said, foreign health workers’ lack of understanding of the importance of local mourning and burial rites made epidemics more difficult to contain.
Ultimately, Olupona said he thought the RPL program, which includes a public speaker series that will feature journalists, historians, economists, and other scholars, might lead to “public enlightenment” about the centrality of religion to a broad range of civic issues.
“If it is properly handled, and properly pursued, I can see it becoming a major center of learning here at Harvard,” he said.

National newsroom leaders discussed navigating 2020 election coverage in a lecture co-hosted by the Institute of Politics and Shorenstein Center Friday.
Speakers at the event included Brian Carovillano, Vice President and Managing Editor of the Associated Press, David Chalian, Vice President and Political Director of CNN, and Chuck Todd, Host of NBC News’s Meet the Press.
Moderated by Nancy Gibbs, Director of the Shorenstein Center and former Editor-in-Chief of TIME Magazine, the event began with a discussion on how the 2020 election will differ from 2016's contest, particularly given increases in mail-in voting and possible delays in the release of statewide results.
“The biggest thing is the disparity and when some votes get counted,” Todd said. “We could have upwards of 75 percent of the vote not even tabulated in places like Michigan, or Pennsylvania, by midnight on election night.”
The unprecedented nature of this year's election recurred throughout the lecture.
“States and localities are dealing with the counting of those ballots in ways they never have before,” Chalian said. “We're just dealing with such a massive influx of vote by mail absentee vote, and specifically the states Trump was talking about, that don't have a history of dealing with this.”
“In some places, it's just going to take a really long time for them to count,” he added. “And so also sort of being clear in these next 11 days, I think with, with our audiences, about, you know, the need for a little bit of patience here just because of what we're dealing with in the process of casting and counting ballots in a pandemic.”
The speakers also pointed out the differing voting patterns for Democrats and Republicans. Since voting began, more Democrats have participated in the mail-in ballot system, whereas more Trump supporters are planning to vote in-person, Chalian noted.
“Democrats are voting by mail and early and a lot of this is pandemic related, obviously, and the politicization of the pandemic that we've seen,” Chalian said. “Donald Trump supporters and Republicans are far more inclined to say that they are going to cast their ballots in person on election day. So when you have two totally different electorates, if you will, it's going to be this constant need on election night, to be transparent and explain to the audience at any given moment.”
The panelists shared concerns about the danger of releasing inaccurate voting information in order to build a compelling news story early. Gibbs described that pull as the “temptation towards the premature narrative.”
Carovillano argued that a strategy he calls “radical transparency” will be critical in maintaining truthful, real-time information dissemination about voting results.
“We are always conservative — moving more conservative than ever on this election day — when it comes to...calls,” he said. “The second part of that strategy is radical transparency, in terms of constantly explaining on the wire, in interviews live on election night, and to anyone who will listen to us, what we understand to be happening, why it's happening, and why it matters.”
Carovillano urged individuals to maintain a skeptical attitude toward people delegitimizing election analytics because they are released later than in previous presidential election cycles.
“I hope people are starting to understand that there will be people claiming that delays equal fraud, problems, and election malfeasance,” he said. “There is no equation between those two things.”
Todd said social media often advances the idea that whichever news source calls the election first is at an advantage.
“The fact that people have gotten drunk on social media has sobered up American journalists,” he said. “We all have gotten to be a bit more careful in how we debunk misinformation so that it isn't accidentally spreading it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Award-winning journalists James Goodman, David Von Drehle, and Nancy Kaffer discussed the challenges facing local newsrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic at a webinar Friday.
The webinar — hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and moderated by its director, Nancy Gibbs — featured current and past winners of its David Nyhan Prize for Political Journalism, which recognizes its namesake’s “commitment to challenging the powerful and acting as a voice for those whose voices are seldom heard.”
Goodman, a writer for the Progressive, said “the real challenge” local papers face is a “reduction in staff” and loss of specialized beats.
“You don’t have beats for a lot of important topics,” Goodman said. “When you cover a beat — like I did county government for six years and higher ed for eight years — you learn what’s going on.”
Those constraints have made it more difficult for reporters to get ahead of stories and fulfill their duty of informing the public, he explained.
“The public really depends on the local news and the reporters,” Goodman said. “And now a lot of times you find the papers, especially smaller ones, chasing stories rather than being in front of them.”
Kaffer, a columnist for the Detroit Free Press, added that basic reporting — though “not particularly glorious” — is “valuable” for reporters to learn the “nuts and bolts” of the job.
“I worry that, with the way local news has contracted, that basic beat training may be harder to come by,” Kaffer said.
Von Drehle, a columnist for the Washington Post, noted that covering local politics is an important training ground for reporters who aspire to cover national politics.
“The federal government is just too big to get your arms around and to get inside,” Von Drehle said. “There’s too many layers between you and the elected official or the appointed official. It’s very difficult. State legislature or a city council or a school board — you can actually figure out how it works.”
In an interview after the webinar, the panelists also spoke about how COVID-19 has compounded the existing challenges of local journalism.
Kaffer said that pandemic-related restrictions — like social distancing and stay-at-home orders — have limited her interactions with the people she covers, since she is no longer “talking to people, going to government meetings, or community meetings, or just being out.”
“I didn't really realize how much I relied on background information, stuff that you just pick up,” she said. “You pick up a lot of this sense of what's going on, just from what you're around. And it's much harder to create that intentionally. You can't really replicate casual encounters.”
Goodman shared a different perspective. He said, given how connected he was with his community before the pandemic, he has been able to find new methods to reach out to them and stay informed.
“You just develop a new way of doing things,” Goodman said. “In a local paper, you pretty much know the community, and it's different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Women’s Studies in Religion Program at the Harvard Divinity School began in 1973, the school’s tenured faculty did not include any women.
Constance Buchanan — who died Sept. 16 due to complications from Parkinson’s disease at 73 years old — would spend two decades working to change that.
The WSRP was founded “to explore the fundamental role played by religious traditions in defining roles for women and men.” Divinity School Dean Emeritus Krister O. Stendahl appointed Buchanan as director in 1977. She led the program for 20 years, while also serving as assistant dean of the school and later as special assistant to University President Derek C. Bok.
Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton praised Buchanan’s leadership in a press release announcing her death.
“Buchanan was an indefatigable supporter of the women and religion program at HDS for many decades,” he said.
Buchanan began her leadership during a wave of feminism in academic thought, according to Cheryl T. Gilkes, who was a visiting scholar at WSRP during Buchanan’s tenure there.
“She was part of a major transformation that was taking place in academia, but she helped move that transformation,” Gilkes said.
Ann D. Braude, current director of WSRP and director successor to Buchanan, agreed with Gilkes.
“This was the late 1970s, and it was just a ferment of feminism, creativity, challenging the exclusively male composition of theological education and religious thought and scholarship,” Braude said.
Braude said that even well into the 1970s, women had been excluded from rigorous study of religion, making it difficult for them to acquire necessary qualifications to join academic departments.
“Now, they were told they couldn't be on the faculty because they're not experts. What [Buchanan] saw is that we need to provide a program that will facilitate women becoming the qualified experts, facilitate women putting their own agenda into religious scholarship,” Braude said.
As the WSRP’s director, Buchanan was tasked with recruiting each year’s scholars, networking to gain faculty support, and procuring funding. That work paid dividends, particularly for the women Buchanan advanced, Gilkes said — including women of color.
“Constance Buchanan built a program that brought the presence of women to the faculty level,” Gilkes said.
Through WSRP, female scholars could visit HDS for a year and work on a book with Harvard’s funding and support, enabling them to gain qualifications for a full-time research or teaching position.
As a result of Buchanan’s work, more than 200 women have participated in the program.
“If you look at the leaders in the field of women's studies in religion, they're all influenced by the program. The WSRP was a catalyst for their groundbreaking work,” WSRP patron Michelle R. Clayman told the school in 2017.
In 1996, Buchanan published her own book, “Choosing to Lead: Women and the Crisis of American Values,” exploring the roots of religious ideas limiting women leadership.
Buchanan left HDS in 1997 to work for the Ford Foundation, where she became a senior program officer, exploring religion’s role in human rights and injustices.
In honor of the 50th anniversary of women’s admittance to the Divinity School, in 2005, Buchanan became the first woman whose portrait hung in the school’s Braun Room, where the walls are lined with paintings of former deans.
HDS alumni also named her a 2017 Peter J. Gomes STB ’68 Memorial Honoree to recognize her impact on WSRP, the Divinity School, and the field of religious studies.
Despite her not being “a very high-profile person” by Harvard standards, Braude said Buchanan had a far-reaching impact.
“She didn’t win a Nobel Prize or write the landmark book, but she was really an institution builder, and what she did had such an impact on so many different arenas of scholarship,” Braude said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School students say they are conflicted about spring plans following the school’s decision to offer in-person classes for international students in the spring.
The Kennedy School announced Wednesday that it plans to offer a hybrid of in-person and online classes for its students for the spring semester, prioritizing in-person class spots for students who do not currently hold U.S. visas. The plan marks a contrast to the Kennedy School’s fall format following the COVID-19 pandemic, which has consisted of an entirely online curriculum.
For certain degree programs, the school will modify course offerings to accommodate an in-person class schedule, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an email to HKS affiliates announcing the plan.
Some students have expressed mixed feelings about the announcement. Allan D. Franklin, an international student from Barbados in the Mid-Career Masters in Public Administration program, said while he is still processing the decision, he sees limitations on courses as the plan’s biggest drawback. For those in Franklin’s program cohort, the school announced it would only hold three specific courses in-person for non-U.S. students who “do not presently hold visas but are able to obtain them for the Spring term.”
“I had settled on the courses I want to do for spring and fall. I kind of made the choices together,” Franklin said. “For example, the courses that I want to specialize in, the area I want to specialize in, I was going to do the majority of those courses in fall. And with the on site coming to Cambridge in spring with the option that's being provided that wouldn't be possible. So for me, that's one of the biggest complications.”
Students who are seeking visas would need to take all three courses, and could take elective courses online, one of which can count toward graduation requirements.
Beatriz M.C. Alqueres, another international student, agreed that an option of only three courses would limit the learning experience.
“I was happy for so many colleagues who will be able to get their visas and establish themselves in better learning conditions in Cambridge. However, the obligation to take three predetermined courses, limited to international students, makes the whole decision questionable,” Alqueres wrote in an email.
“In a course (MC/MPA) where the main attractions are the cohort and the flexibility of the curriculum, forcing the choice of three specific courses is completely limiting and inconsistent. In addition, the impossibility of interacting with domestic students makes this whole interpersonal exchange completely superficial,” Alqueres added.
The process of obtaining visas forms another source of uncertainty for international students. While Elmendorf wrote in the spring announcement that students could reach out to the Harvard International Office for help with individual circumstances, he added that Harvard does not control visa issuance and admittance into the United States.
In many countries, U.S. embassies and consulates have been closed and visa appointments have been indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Alqueres’s case, the consulates in her country, Brazil, are still closed.
“The embassies in Brazil are still closed and not issuing student visas,” Alqueres wrote. “Before this scenario, when we were still unsure about the fall, my experience with the Harvard International Office was the best one. They were really fast in responding to my concerns, always trying to indicate and help with good solutions. I believe now it won't be different.”
Kennedy School students from the United States, meanwhile, will not receive the same in-person offerings — though the announcement notes that all students will be able to spend a “modest” amount of time on the Harvard campus.
The Kennedy School has also offered all students the unusual opportunity to take a leave of absence in the spring and return in spring 2022 while carrying over any financial aid and scholarships.
Though she hasn’t come to a decision yet, Allison M. Agsten, a U.S.-based student in the year-long Mid-Career MPA program, wrote in an email that distance learning has been challenging for her family, and she is considering the option of deferral.
“It is painful to even consider deferring but as a domestic student and a parent, I must acknowledge the toll distance learning has taken on my family. With three of us in school online full time, we are challenged to maintain good work, good health, and good spirits,” Agsten wrote.
But according to Alqueres, for many students, deferral is not a feasible option.
“As many of my colleagues, I'm not considering deferring,” Alqueres wrote. “It really doesn't make sense for many of us. We have organized our lives for this year. I believe if you are an independent worker or a business owner you could do it but for the vast majority this is not possible.”
Ultimately, Franklin and Alqueres expressed disillusion with their current options, mourning the loss of the typical Harvard “experience.”
“I was really hoping to get a full Harvard experience in 2021,” Franklin said. “I still haven’t made up my mind what normal would have looked like for me at Harvard or in Harvard. I know fast forwarding to this point in time, with what’s being offered, I guess my expectations would have been a bit unrealistic before.”
Alqueres agreed.
“For an international student, going to Harvard means not just a master program to make, but a lifetime experience. For me, it was 8 years of planning to apply, preparing for tests and building the relations that got me here. For others it was a whole life dedicated to it.” Alqueres wrote.
“We understand that COVID caught everyone off guard but there is an opportunity to show why Harvard is the most prestigious university in the world. We can think of so many alternatives for students not to feel so hurt during this year. Especially for those who are investing their own savings,” Alqueres added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed nearly every part of Harvard — perhaps nowhere more than Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals and research institutions.
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said in an interview Friday that the school devoted nearly all its resources to fighting COVID-19 this spring.
“The Harvard Medical System has evolved and innovated in remarkable ways to confront the COVID pandemic,” Daley said. “We came through this really challenging wave in the April, May, June time frame, where the hospitals reoriented, almost entirely, all of their medical services to care for the onslaught of COVID patients.”
The hospitals managed to reestablish most routine clinical care during the summer months, when case counts were well-contained in Massachusetts, Daley said. Harvard is affiliated with 19 hospitals and research institutes in the Boston area, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital.
In the recent weeks, however, those hospitals, like the rest of the United States, have experienced an uptick in cases.
Healthcare workers now have more experience handling COVID-19 cases after the first wave in late spring, but Daley said the virus remains a “threat.” With the rising numbers, he said regular mask-wearing, social and physical distancing, hand hygiene, and getting a flu vaccination remain key steps.
“What we've learned from the flu season in the southern hemisphere, which we've just come through, is that because of the public health measures in place to protect against COVID, there has fortunately been a mild flu season,” Daley said. “Yet, there are reports of individuals who are doubly infected with flu and COVID, who can develop very severe complications.”
Daley said faculty, researchers, and clinicians at Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals have played a major role nationally and internationally in fighting the virus, including establishing best practices for managing patients.
“Some of the leaders of our infectious disease community have served on the expert panels at the National Institutes of Health and the Infectious Diseases Society of America to establish the guidelines for clinical care,” Daley said.
“Because of improvements in clinical care, recognition of the inflammatory storm, recognition of the blood clotting complications, our patients who get into the hospital with severe disease are doing better and the fatality rates are dropping,” he added.
Daley said scientists and physicians at Harvard Medical School have also engaged in fruitful collaborations with local and international colleagues, including developing two candidate vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials.
A $115 million partnership with the Guangzhou Institute for Respiratory Diseases — a Chinese research institute — funded by Fortune Global 500 company China Evergrande Group has expanded in the last six months to include researchers from other Massachusetts medical schools, local biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and several other nations.
“We have had now several global public briefings, where we've talked about critical elements of the virus and the disease, where we've had talks from Guangzhou colleagues, colleagues in Italy, colleagues in Africa,” Daley said. “That has really highlighted the international nature of the cooperation and shared communication that has taught us all how to better confront the virus.”
Still, the threat of COVID-19 will not subside until populations achieve herd immunity or a vaccine is available to the public, though the former is increasingly unlikely, Daley said.
“Unfortunately, still, even in communities that have been ravaged by COVID, anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of those communities remain susceptible because they haven't seen the virus and they have no degree of immunity,” Daley said. “We're not going to be through this until we have a vaccine.”
The expertise of doctors and researchers at the Medical School has placed a “responsibility” on affiliates to communicate and keep the public informed, he said.
“I'm proud to say Harvard has been a voice of reason at a time when there's been a lot of chaotic communication,” Daley said. “I hope that means that in the future, our students, whether they're in medical school or graduate school, appreciate that part of their responsibility as doctors, scientists, clinicians, is to learn how to communicate with the public.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow launched a committee Monday to form “general principles” for renaming spaces, programs, and professorships at Harvard that are linked to “abhorrent” activities.
Former University President Drew G. Faust will chair the 16-person committee, which includes faculty, staff, students, and alumni.
In his charge to the committee, Bacow asked that they “articulate general principles to help determine when the names of such historical figures should or should not continue to be associated” with Harvard.
“I think Harvard is always better when we’re willing to be self-critical, or at least ask in a serious way, ‘How can we become a more enlightened institution?'’” Bacow said in a press release. “To do that, we need to engage people who have both the willingness to ask difficult questions and the courage to answer them in ways that may ultimately challenge us.”
He asked that members consider questions like how to take account not only the “failings and flaws” of various historical figures, but also their “positive contributions to the University and to society,” and how to “preserve, not simply erase,” an individual’s association with Harvard if their name is removed.
The committee includes several historians, including Faust, who is a historian of the Civil War and the American South.
Bacow said they will bring an “informed and nuanced understanding” of history and past decisions, but also how the perception of this history changed over time.
“We also have to be humble about our ability to judge the decisions of our predecessors,” he said.
Over the summer, students circulated a petition that called for the renaming of Mather House, which is named after Increase Mather, a former Harvard president and slave owner. Petition organizers wrote that other buildings named after white slaveholders include Lowell House, Wadsworth House, and Agassiz House.
Previously, students called for Harvard Law School to retire its seal due to ties to slavery; the school complied in 2016.
Several institutions across the country have also grappled with the issue of renaming on their campuses. In 2017, Yale University removed the name of John C. Calhoun, a staunch defender of slavery, from one of its residential colleges. In June, Princeton University cut former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson — who promoted racist views and policies — from its School of Public and International Affairs.
Bacow encouraged the committee to review reports from these institutions during their discussions.
He also asked them to consider an institution’s responsibility when they choose not to remove an individual’s name — such as how they “present a candid and balanced account” of their failings, in addition to their contribution.
Faust said issues of renaming have long been a concern to her, making her a “good match” to chair the committee.
“I think all the committee members recognize that this is a moment when our nation’s long-articulated commitments to justice and equality must at last be realized,” she said in a press release. “The time is here.”
Other members include Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston, Vice President for Campus Services Meredith Weenick ’90, former President of the Board of Overseers David W. Oxtoby ’72, Jin Park ’18, Elijah C. DeVaughn ’21, and numerous high profile professors, including Annette Gordon Reed, Philip J. Deloria, and David I. Liabson ’88.

From group discussions with guest politicians to relaxed virtual gatherings, student organizations celebrated Latinx Heritage Month between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15 by discussing Latinx perspectives, highlighting underrepresented voices, and facilitating community building,
One such organization, Latinas Unidas, hosted a screening and discussion on Oct. 15 with Chilean filmmaker and visiting lecturer Dominga Sotomayor. According to president Sammantha Garcia ’22, around 30 students attended the event to watch and discuss Sotomayor’s short films.
Throughout the month, Latinas Unidas also held a social media campaign over Instagram to spotlight different Latinx individuals’ achievements. The club also highlighted events from other Harvard cultural groups and promoted Latinx social issue campaigns and petitions.
“I think it's really powerful to have empowering board members plan events around other inspiring people outside the community, that may not be as recognized nationwide,” said Garcia.
On Oct. 23, Fuerza Latina hosted “Pintar Y Identidad,” a relaxed evening of painting via Zoom. Fuerza Latina co-president Luz Ramirez-Ramirez ’22 said she hoped the event would allow attendees to demonstrate pride in their Latinx heritage through art and learn more about the diversity and intersectional identities present across Latin American cultures.
In an effort to make the activity more accessible to participants, the club also mailed out free art kits to 20 students. Participants’ images were later collaged and posted on social media to celebrate the presence of the Latinx community at Harvard, according to Ramirez-Ramirez.
“Even though we’re not on campus, we’re still very much present, in that we are proud of who we are and the identities that we hold,” Ramirez-Ramirez said.
Co-president Sheila De La Cruz ’22 said the group hopes to continue many of the efforts it focused on over the past month into the future.
“One of the main things that we really just wanted to emphasize was having a space where students from a Latinx background can feel included, like they belong to a community,” De La Cruz said. “Even though we know that, officially, Hispanic Heritage Month has ended, we still want to continue our initiatives.”
The Institute of Politics also held a number of discussions in observance of Latinx Heritage Month. The IOP partnered with Latinas Unidas to hold a “Pizza and Politics” event on Sept. 23 with Maribel Hernandez Rivera, a district director for U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Hernandez Rivera stopped by the virtual event to answer questions about her time at Harvard, her experience in politics, and her path to her current leadership role.
On Oct. 16, the IOP partnered with the Harvard Undergraduate Brazilian Association to host “LatinX Month Pizza and Politics - Policy Making in Bolsonaro’s Brazil and Running for International Office” to discuss policymaking in Brazil with Brazilian politicians and education activists Tábata Amaral ’16 and Renan Ferreirinha ’17.
In addition to the two Pizza and Politics events, the IOP also held a larger panel on Oct. 7 titled “Election 2020: The Latinx Perspective on Political Journeys in the United States.” Moderated by IOP 2020 fellow Jorge L. Vasquez, the panel invited political leaders and advocates Melissa Mark-Viverito and Kenneth Romero to discuss their insights on Latinx people’s role in politics and history.

Four early-career scientists presented their research findings on water’s role in climate change, earth science, public health, and planet habitability at a Radcliffe Institute event Friday.
The event was part of the “Next in Science” series spotlighting the work of up-and-coming researchers.
Alyssa A. Goodman, the co-director of the science program at the Radcliffe Institute and a professor of astronomy at Harvard, opened the event by emphasizing the importance of water as a life force.
“The reason that we chose “Next in Water” as the theme for this event is because of water’s value — and I don’t mean the price per liter of water, I mean the value of water to life on Earth, to the survival of our planet, to life on other planets, and to many creatures that we don't even think about,” Goodman said.
Hilary I. Palevksy, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Boston College, began the event with a presentation on the ocean’s relationship with climate change.
Palevksy spoke extensively about the importance of the ocean in absorbing and regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide. At the conclusion of her talk, Palevksy emphasized that fighting climate change requires “courage,” despite ongoing environmental challenges.
“Every little bit of climate change that we can avoid is going to save lives, save suffering, save ecosystems. There's no point of no return in which we throw up our hands and give up on this problem,” Palevsky said in an interview after her presentation. “There's always more we can do, no matter how rosy or dire the particular moment is feeling.”
The event’s second speaker, Randi Rotjan, an assistant professor of biology at Boston University, presented her research on the negative impacts of microplastics on the environment. Rotjan emphasized the urgency of plastic overconsumption by stating that “we’re swimming in a mess of our own making.”
Xindi Hu, an alum of the School of Public Health and a data scientist at Mathematica, detailed how modeling and analysis can “fill the data gap” in federally-collected information on water contaminants and exposure to pollution.
Laura K. Schaefer, an assistant professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at Stanford University presented her work on water and planetary habitability. Schaefer said that scientists determine whether a planet has liquid water — a key indicator that it can support life — by examining a number of features, including the planet’s geology, size, and distance from a star.
Following the presentations, participants were invited to join a separate Zoom link, where they were placed into breakout rooms for discussion with the featured speakers.

First year students at Harvard Medical School will join upperclassmen on campus this spring, Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said in an interview Friday.
“We decided that we will bring the students back for the spring semester and have them return to some of these in-person, patient-oriented, clinical examination skill building,” he said.
Hands-on experience in the clinic working directly with patients is key to students’ training, according to Daley: after returning students restarted their clinical rotations in the summer, they have integrated as “essential members” of healthcare delivery teams at various hospitals affiliated with Harvard Medical School.
The decision to return all medical students to Longwood contrasts with recent moves at many of Harvard’s other professional schools. The Law School, School of Public Health, Divinity School, and Graduate School of Design each announced they had elected to continue virtual classes last week.
Daley said that split stems from the Medical School’s unique charge.
“In many ways, we have a different mission than a lot of other schools. Our mission of education also includes service — service to the patients that these students will ultimately be treating for their careers as physicians,” Daley said.
Several first-year students said they found classroom learning effective in a virtual format. They said the clinical courses Daley referenced, however, went less smoothly.
“[The instructors] are doing the best they can, and they've adopted well, but there are some things you truly can't learn online for medicine,” first-year Medical School student Abigail M. Kempf told The Crimson earlier this month.
Recognizing those challenges, Daley said the school made the decision to bring back additional students with care.
“We're doing it with a tremendous amount of forethought and planning,” he said. “This has required, again, a tremendous collaborative effort across our students and our staff and our faculty, in order to be sure that we can do this as safely as possible.”

UPDATED: Oct. 26, at 1:20 p.m. 
Young Americans are on track to turn out to vote in higher numbers than in the historic 2008 election, according to the Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll released Monday.
More young people voted in 2008 than in any election since 1984. This year, 63 percent of surveyed young people said they will “definitely be voting,” which the poll said indicated a similar level of turnout to 2008. Forty-seven percent of respondents said the same in 2016.
The IOP’s Youth Poll conducts biannual surveys of political trends amongst young Americans between the ages of 18 and 29.
Democratic presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden holds a 24 point lead in the youth vote over his opponent President Donald J. Trump, per the results. The poll found that Biden’s favorability among young voters increased by 13 percentage points since the spring version of the poll. 
Despite the favorable polls, Biden supporters are less confident that their candidate will win the election compared to Trump supporters. While 63 percent of Biden supporters said they believe he will win the presidential election, 74 percent of Trump supporters expect the president to win.
The poll also reflected the increased popularity of mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 50 percent of young Democrats are more likely to vote by mail this election, compared to just under 30 percent of young Republicans.
Still, not all young voters are confident their ballots will be counted. Nearly half of all young Black voters surveyed report they will be voting in person on election day. Meanwhile, seventy percent of young white, non-Hispanic voters indicated they are very confident their ballots would be counted, a marked difference from the 50 percent of young Black voters who said the same.
The poll found a general consensus among young Americans that the government should have an increased role in tackling issues of healthcare, particularly mental health accessibility. Young voters across racial demographics had “overwhelming support” for the government doing more to decrease systemic racism, according to the poll.
The election also comes as young Americans report they are experiencing less joy and more anxiety this fall compared to the spring. The poll noted young Americans are concerned about housing costs and debt, with 57 percent of respondents between 18 and 29 years old carrying debt. Black Americans, college graduates, likely voters, and those who live in urban areas are more likely to hold debt, per the poll’s results.
Young Americans are also evenly split between whether their chances at success are better than their parents’ generation, the same, or worse off.
Kate Gunderson ’23, a student leader of the IOP Youth Poll, spoke at a press call Monday about how young people “do not feel secure” in America during the press conference.
“We see that young people do not feel secure in America. They feel like they do not have opportunities — that this isn't a land of opportunities, but rather, it is a land of inadequacies,” she said. “People are looking for better health care and looking for better mental health services, looking for a better response to the coronavirus pandemic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School students praised incoming Dean Srikant M. Datar’s decades of experience at the school, but expressed concern that his appointment was a “missed opportunity” for ongoing diversity initiatives.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced earlier this month that Datar will serve as the next dean of the Business School, succeeding Nitin Nohria, who has held the position since 2010. Datar, the school’s current Senior Associate Dean for University Affairs, has been a member of the Business School faculty since 1996.
Burjis Godrej, a Master of Business Administration student, called Datar a “very good choice” for the position, citing his legacy of experience at the Business School and his efforts to establish the current “hybrid” learning environment for HBS students.
“I think, given that background, he is the best person at this time to steer the Business School in the right direction,” Godrej said.
MBA student Uwais Razack said he anticipates Datar’s legacy will be “to make HBS more focused toward technology.” Razack said Datar’s personal background could elevate the Business School’s educational offerings.
“I think that that might be part of a legacy that he needs to leave, where if you wanted to go into a career of technology entrepreneurship, HBS becomes the first thing that comes to mind,” Razack said.
Datar has launched a number of initiatives merging the Business School with science and technology programs at Harvard, including launching the school’s joint M.S.-MBA program in biotechnology and life sciences, as well as the M.S.-MBA in engineering sciences.
At a town hall on the day of his announcement, Datar said the pandemic has offered the school opportunities to expand its programs and take advantage of its technological resources.
“A key question for us is how best to exploit the many digital assets we have built, and how we can leverage the case method, the field method, and online learning, as well as virtual, hybrid, and in-person instruction, in all our educational programs, even as we leverage the gift of our extraordinary campus and strengthen the residential learning experience,” Datar said.
Bukie Adebo, an MBA candidate, called Datar a “natural choice” for the deanship.
“He seems like he has really solid credentials, a great background with the school and that he seems future-oriented in terms of the way he's thinking about the MBA program and the direction in which MBA education will move in the future,” Adebo said.
However, Adebo, a co-president of the school’s African American Student Union, also said she previously believed the Business School may “go with a slightly less traditional candidate,” given the school’s recent diversity and representation challenges.
The Business School has publicly grappled in recent months with a lack of diversity among its faculty and student body. In September, Nohria announced an “Action Plan for Racial Equity,” which established a new role for a diversity officer, as well as committees that will seek to recruit Black students and faculty and promote anti-racist research.
Razack called the appointment a potential “missed opportunity to diversify, at least on the dimension of gender” — a move that he felt could have been a strong signal from a “powerful institution” like Harvard. The Business School has never appointed a female dean.
“Given the atmosphere of all these discussions that we're having here at Harvard, but just in the broader discussion that we see on the media and the news, etc., discussions about equality and balancing the playing field, it almost feels like HBS misread the mood in the room, to some degree,” Razack said.
Adebo, who is a member of the student committee developing the newly launched action plan, said she was concerned about how Datar would execute the initiative.
“I was hoping for somebody who seemed to put more emphasis or priority on diversity, equity and inclusion, and from everything that I've read about him so far, I haven't really seen that,” Adebo said. “I haven't seen that that's an area that he puts a lot of energy and attention.”
Business School spokesperson Brian Kenny wrote in an emailed statement that students will feel “very optimistic about the future” of the school after they meet with Datar. He added that Datar has already met with a “range” of student groups.
“Those who are concerned about Srikant's commitment to diversity in all its dimensions and inclusion and racial and gender equity should take heart in the comments he made at his welcome address where he said, ‘We must adopt and act upon this plan with speed and urgency, striving to advance racial equity within HBS and to educate leaders who advance racial equity in their organizations and their communities," Kenny wrote. "This work will not be easy. But it is key to our mission of educating leaders who make a difference in the world.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council passed two pieces of legislation Sunday to endorse a letter condemning a proposed U.S. Department of Homeland Security rule that would impose new time limits on student visas.
The UC also approved legislation to gather student testimonials on the proposed rule; Quincy House representative Evangelos M. Kassos ’23 sponsored both pieces of legislation.
“What this legislation is trying to do is submit a formal, common letter at the Federal Registry,” Kassos said. “The agency will have to consider every comment that gets submitted.”
As of Sunday evening, more than 26,000 public comments concerning the rule change were published on the Federal Register website.
The proposed rule, published on the Federal Register website on Sept. 25, recommends that type F, J, and I visa holders be admitted into the United States for fixed periods of time. Currently, those who hold type F, J, and I visas may stay in the country as long as they are complying with the terms and conditions.
International students and exchange students fall under the F and J category.
The Department of Homeland Security argued in its proposal the current policy “creates a challenge” for its capacity to ensure that visa holders are not violating the terms and conditions of their visas. The UC, however, argued that the new rules will have negative consequences for international students.
“The proposed rule will increase the economic burden of international students in the U.S.,” the UC’s legislation reads.
The UC also argued the policy change would pose other challenges, such as forcing international students to reapply for visas after their fixed terms expire, introducing uncertainty about coursework, and only allowing students to take time off due to “compelling academic or medical reason[s].”
“I think it’s a great approach to this,” Ukrainian student Vladyslav “Vlad” Ivanchuk ’23 said of the UC’s letter. “I hope the authorities will consider the real life implications of their rules.”
The UC’s letter is addressed to DHS Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf and Sharon Hageman, acting regulatory unit chief of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and urges them to withdraw the proposed rule.
“The proposed rule is, in our opinion, part of a series of legislative actions that aim to unjustifiably restrict the number of visas issued to students, scholars, and highly skilled workers, with the most prominent example being the … thoughtless and finally withdrawn ICE July 6th directive reverting the temporary exceptions for nonimmigrant students taking online courses during the Fall 2020 semester,” the UC’s letter reads.
In July, ICE announced that it would reimplement a rule barring international students from residing in the United States while studying online after it had paused the rule in March. After Harvard and MIT filed a lawsuit against ICE and DHS, the policy change was rescinded, and international students were allowed to remain in the country. Harvard College announced that incoming international freshmen, however, would not be able to come to campus in the fall due to concerns about federal visa restrictions.
A DHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the UC’s legislation.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote a letter on Oct. 16 to Hageman about Harvard’s opposition to the proposed policy.
“By casting a wide net and arbitrarily bounding international students and scholars, the proposed rule would create negative and cascading consequences for US research, scholarship, and training; weaken our national recovery and future competitiveness; and undermine our national response to global challenges in science, security, and public health,” Bacow wrote.
Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott also denounced the proposed rule in an Oct. 15 interview with The Crimson.
It “seeks to fix a problem that doesn’t exist,” Elliott said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email the University had no comment concerning the UC's legislation.
The second piece of the UC’s legislation proposed that the Council create a survey to gauge student opinions on the proposed rule and gather the results into a report for the Council, which it would send to the Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs, the Harvard International Office, and the Office of International Education.
Some international students have already voiced concerns with the rule change.
“It’s been an emotional rollercoaster because we’re relying on our place here in Cambridge for a safe environment,” Ivanchuk said. “And if we were like, one day required to leave, for a lot of us there’s literally no place to go.”

You’re on campus now, eager to meet new people and kick off a great year. You run into people in the d-hall line, in your house courtyard, and in the hallway. But you’re bad enough with names already, how are you supposed to remember faces when they’re half-covered? Well, we’ve got you covered with the best tips to recognize people with their masks on while you’re strolling through campus.
Stare Longingly into Their Eyes
People have always said that eyes are the window to the soul, so it’s time to put that saying to use. This would also be a great exercise to maintain eye contact with the person you’re talking to, engaging in an active, socially-distant conversation with them. Study their eyes, stare longingly at them — but not for too long or they might get weirded out. If you want to maintain the six-feet distance, maybe you could look into investing in binoculars?
Eyebrows Are Your New Best Friend
Keeping with the eye theme, let’s talk about eyebrows. They’re a pretty distinctive feature of the face, expressive and perhaps great for recognizing faces. Color, shape, style — get to know your peers through their signature eyebrow look. Hey, maybe you can hit them up for a brow tutorial for your own eyebrows so that you can make a more put together look when you roll out of bed two minutes before your Zoom lecture. Can you use the Zoom eyebrows feature? Let us know if you figure that one out.
Vibe Check 
Are the brain waves immaculate with this one? This is perhaps the most socially distant way to recognize someone through a mask. Pick out something weird (I do the T-man pose) that you and your friend will recognize. If they reciprocate the action, they have passed the vibe check. Just make sure you both know what to do so that you don’t accidentally vibe check a random tourist in the Harvard Yard who just wanted you to take a picture of them by the statue.
Shoot Your Shot, Make A New Friend
At the end of the day, it wouldn’t hurt to just shoot your shot and approach the person, even if you’re not sure who they are. If they are the person you’re looking for, great! If not, you just met someone new on campus. You can laugh off the approach and then introduce yourself (maybe not the Harvard introduction though, we’ve all heard that one too many times). If it gets too awkward, that’s when you can use your own mask to hide.
It’s not the easiest time to make friends right now, but we’re all going to get through it together. Hopefully soon, we won’t need to wear masks and we’ll be able to fully see each other’s faces — until then, enjoy these tips!
