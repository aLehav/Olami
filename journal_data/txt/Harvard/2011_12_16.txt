After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Shakespeare wrote that “We are such stuff as dreams are made on,” he wrote not only of Prospero but also about theater itself. “The Tempest” plays with the idea of a dream world in which one character, much like an artist, can shape the entire world through his talent. In the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club's production of “The Tempest,” directed by Joshua R. McTaggart '13, a Crimson arts editor, and staged at the Agassiz Theatre from December 8 to December 11, took to this interpretation to heart. The result was a production that recast the artist as a magician, and explored a world where an obsessed director has the power to control the actions of everyone around him.
“The Tempest” follows Prospero (Peter K. Bestoso '14), a sorcerer and the usurped Duke of Milan, as he orchestrates the perfect revenge on the men who ousted him from his throne. He and his daughter Miranda (Anna A. Hagen '15) have been living on a deserted island for 12 years when Prospero’s brother Antonio (Felix L.J. Cook '13) and the King of Naples, Alonso (Matthew J. Bialo ’15), sail by the island. Prospero creates a tempest to strand them on the island, and as the play unfolds Prospero commands the behavior of the characters in much the same way that a director controls the action on stage.
The audience never saw the island in McTaggart’s vision. Instead, set designer Madelynne A. Hays '13 explored McTaggart’s theme of magic in art through the set. As opposed to an outdoor vista, the stage is a hauntingly accurate artist’s studio, complete with hundreds of books, paint sets, and other various curiosities. Through a simple yet effective use of lighting this same set also became the cave of Caliban (Darcy C. Donelan '14), Prospero’s slave, half man and half beast. At that moment, the stage became completely dark, and Bestoso and Hagen used flashlights to explore the dark, cavernous space as if spelunking. Even when the lights were up the stage was not exactly what it seemed. Large bookcases were used to create a leveled space, and the actors could climb on top of them to look down on the action below.
The acting was superb all around; the actors were able to remain true to their characters while still fitting their roles into this production's overarching theme. Bestoso turned Prospero into an obsessed, almost tyrannical father figure. The look on his face as he watched over his daughter’s betrothal can only be described as chilling. Teis D. Jorgensen '14 and Ruth Angus, a visiting student at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, were appropriately ridiculous as Trinculo and Stephano, a jester and a drunken butler who try to incite Caliban to rebel against his master. Donelan made the audience pity the plight of the disfigured Caliban while also reviling him for his venom and stupidity. Julian C. Lucas '15 was convincingly level-headed as Gonzalo, and Hagen and Bryan D. Kauder '14 were adorable as innocent lovers Miranda and Ferdinand. Some of the best performances came from Anthony J. Sterle '12 and Cook as Sebastian and Antonio. The two “evil” characters are rarely on stage, but Sterle’s confused conscience was the perfect foil for Antonio, who was transformed into a ruthless and sarcastic figure by Cook.
Mariel N. Pettee '14 stole the show as Ariel, a fairy who serves Prospero, with a performance full of levity and spirit. In addition to humanizing the character of Ariel, she spent much of the play dancing and playing the flute. Most impressive was her characterization of Ariel not only as Prospero’s slave, but also as his lover. In many of their interactions, Bestoso physically loomed over Pettee; this posture communicated both a physical attraction and a sense of dominance. Although McTaggart’s reading of Ariel and Prospero’s relationship was unconventional, it added a welcome modernity to their relationship.
Although McTaggart's cast produced an excellent show, his often heavy-handed attempts to convey his message about the magic of art sometimes disrupted its flow. At various points in the play, actors would dance on stage with masks and paintings in their hands to loud film soundtracks. Although the idea seemed to reinforce the concept of art as magic, these moments just distracted the audience from Shakespeare's plot and the actors' nuanced characterization. “The Tempest” was an incredibly funny and insightful version of one of Shakespeare’s more enigmatic plays, weakened only by a message.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s always been a little bizarre that on the last night of reading period, people with the most limited of Facebook profiles and most careful of ambitions run around naked in front of all their friends and their cameras. Yet no one regrets it—as boxers and robes are pulled on, you’re surrounded by a sea of flushed exhilarated faces saying, “I can’t believe I did that.”
It’s one of the few events that the entire campus unites around. Three years ago, on a much icier night than last Sunday, a male student tried biking as many laps as possible around the Yard in the same time that others ran one. The bike slipped, there was a moment of collective horror, and then he was back on the bike. In twenty years, people will still be saying, “remember when…?”
Primal Scream may also be one of the few events the entire campus actually attends, or close to it. If they sold tickets, they would go faster than those for the Five-House Formal and probably scalped at a higher rate, too. The attendance rate is rivaled only by that at the Office of Career Services’ introduction to recruiting, which is another thing no one thought they would do until they got here.
This year’s Scream seemed a little more female than in the past. Maybe it was the closure of the Yard gates to anyone without a Harvard ID, which made this year, even more than others, “the year to do it.” Whatever the reason, it was refreshing that Primal Scream wasn’t the usual sausage-fest, and women should keep encouraging each other to bite the bullet and participate. For this event is not about the people who watch but about the people who run. As Theodore Roosevelt, who would have run his own naked lap 130 years ago aptly put it, “the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena…his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” Harvard doesn’t give out many medals for participation, and indeed this would be an odd one on the wall, but it would still be a big one.
If only people would stop taking pictures.

Last week, Harvard’s Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp posted a statement online declaring that “the Harvard Management Company… will review HEI’s business practices and policies, including labor relations, and its compliance with industry standards, regulations and laws, prior to making any decision to re-invest in HEI-sponsored investment funds.”
As one of the largest investors in HEI Hotels and Resorts, Harvard has come under criticism for its connection to a company facing accusations of labor rights violations and operates four hotels under boycott. We are pleased that Harvard has finally agreed to launch an investigation into the ethics of its investment in HEI.
Students have demanded that Harvard not reinvest in HEI for almost three years. Last week’s announcement can be seen in the context not only of the recent advocacy of Occupy Harvard, which has focused on HEI after Harvard’s custodians settled their contract last month, but also of the Student Labor Action Movement and many other student groups that have been pushing for reevaluation of HEI as an investment. We, too, have advocated for this investigation. With such widespread student concern surrounding HEI specifically and ethical investing more generally, it is high time that Harvard began this re-evaluating this investment.
Certainly, a thorough investigation of allegations of labor rights abuses and mistreatment of workers is important before Harvard makes any decision about non-reinvestment. However, we presume that our peer institutions have also conducted investigations of HEI’s labor practices before issuing statements of intention not to reinvest. For example, Brown’s Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Policies noted that it “thoroughly and diligently considered pertinent materials” before making the decision that Brown would no longer put its money in a company that infringes upon workers’ rights. As such, we predict that the outcome of Harvard’s investigation will indeed find that HEI is indeed an unethical investment. If it does, Harvard should commit not to reinvest in HEI until its working conditions improve.
Interestingly, this announcement is the first time Harvard has made a public statement about the ethics of any investment since 2005. Then, the Harvard Management Company declared that it would divest from PetroChina, a company that worked with the Sudanese government complicit in the genocide in Darfur. As a non-profit, taxpayer-supported educational institution, Harvard should regularly engage in socially responsible investment with its $32 billion endowment. Thus, this kind of examination is necessary and important whenever the ethics of an investment come under serious critique. We hope that this type of investigation happens regularly as a first step for more ethical investment practices of Harvard’s endowment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a an article published last week in The Crimson, various professors commented on the divide between “ladder” and “non-ladder” faculty—those who are on track to receive tenure and those who aren’t. Because tenure requires professors to excel at both research and teaching, “ladder” faculty typically perform research and also teach classes, while “non-ladder” faculty often focus primarily on their teaching responsibilities. The article includes quotes from a number of professors and lecturers, noting that “some ask how the University can retain its best teachers without giving them tenure.” In a section entitled “Zero-Sum Game,” the authors claim that some professors have to make tradeoffs between effective research and high-quality teaching, which prevents them from excelling at both.
I believe that this emphasis on teaching and research as a “zero-sum game” is misplaced and greatly detracts from a forthright discussion of tenure practices on campus. Strong teaching and innovative research are not mutually exclusive goals, traded off and balanced against one another. In fact, professors who research may have certain experiences that can enhance, rather than detract from, their teaching ability. A professor performing research can convey the results of this research to his or her students, providing knowledge that no textbook will yet be able to offer. Ladder faculty members might also be well equipped to supervise students engaged in research of their own; for example, a professor who is known for his or her unique methodologies might make an excellent thesis advisor, providing students with creative ideas for research practices. In these ways, research can enhance a professor’s ability to teach, rather than detract from it.
Certainly, a non-researching professor might still possess many of these skills, but that is exactly the point: Being an effective teacher does not prevent one from acquiring the skills of strong research, just as being an effective researcher does not prevent one from learning the tools of strong teaching. Even if time constraints make it difficult for researchers to devote an equal amount of time to teaching, their research experiences may provide benefits to compensate for their limited time. Yes, non-ladder faculty may receive higher Q scores than their researching peers, but I doubt that these scores would be lowered if non-ladder faculty added research duties to their responsibilities. Research doesn’t take away from one’s teaching ability, and in fact, it might complement or enhance it.
As the tenure system at Harvard is currently structured, it rewards teachers for excelling in two areas: teaching and research. Emphasizing one of these areas at the expense of the other would take away from Harvard’s dual focus as a research university. In addition, one wonders why teaching is the element that deserves emphasis; if we were to begin granting tenure to professors who did not teach, why not exempt researching professors from their teaching responsibilities and grant them tenure as well? None of this is to detract from Harvard’s lecturers and non-tenure track faculty, who contribute to the university’s goals in unique ways and are valued for their teaching abilities. The point is to recognize that Harvard’s focus is a dual one to which both ladder and non-ladder faculty contribute—not in a zero-sum way, but in a complementary, mutually reinforcing manner. Harvard can still incentivize and promote effective teaching, and it should do whatever it can to retain its strongest instructors. But providing tenure on the basis of teaching ability alone would eliminate incentives for effective research, shifting Harvard’s dual focus to a one-tiered emphasis on teaching.
If we would like to change Harvard’s objectives—becoming a university focused on teaching rather than research—then tenure reform seems more feasible. However, such a university would be one in which we taught ideas developed by researchers at other colleges rather than exporting ideas of our own. Research is what makes Harvard innovative and unique, and sacrificing its quality in order to emphasize improved teaching is not only unnecessary but, more fundamentally, also undesirable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Were Josef Stalin a chess player, he would’ve looked a lot like Vladimir V. Putin. Just ask Garry Kasparov, the grandmaster-turned-oppositional-candidate who didn’t even make the 2008 ballot after somehow not being able to find one meeting hall in Moscow that would allow him to hold a constitutionally-required political rally.
For the past twelve years, Putin has kept the entire Russian political system in check by neutering the post-Soviet oligarchy, dominating media outlets, and cultivating his own brand of charismatic machismo. After an election two weeks ago that, despite significant evidence of tampering, still handed his United Russia party large parliamentary losses, Putin’s tight grasp on the country is for the first time wavering. But don’t look for the Teflon Tsar to go down easily: he personally remains quite popular and, provided he doesn’t overplay his position with physical repression, he can continue to reign for as long as he desires.
The evidence of electoral fraud in the recent Duma election is overwhelming. In some regions turnout was as high as 146 percent. Additionally, United Russia polled at 99.5 percent in Chechnya, astonishing due to the fact that Putin made his name as President during the violent repression of Chechen rebels a decade ago. Even Mikhail Gorbachev has demanded that the elections be held again in light of the evidence of tampering.
The most obvious sign of Putin’s confidence is the recently-announced candidacy of Mikhail Prokhorov in March’s upcoming presidential election. The vote was and is still expected to be Putin’s recoronation after allowing his proxy Dmitry Medvedev to hold the seat for one term so as to not explicitly violate the constitutional limit of two consecutive terms.
Basketball fans will recognize Prokhorov as the Russian billionaire who bought a majority stake in the New Jersey Nets two years ago. Russians will recognize him as one of the handful of Boris Yeltsin’s friends who, during the disintegration of the Soviet Union, acquired Russia’s natural resources for pennies on the dollar. In Prokhorov’s case, he used his political connections to acquire Norilsk Nickel, which owns the largest reserve of the metal in the world, as well as major stakes in gold and aluminum interests, and became the third-richest man in Russia.
One of the keys to Putin’s lasting success has been his tight control of this class of oligarchs, who are ultimately the only men with the resources truly to challenge his rule. Upon his rise to power in late 1999, Putin collected the oligarchs and issued a simple ultimatum: if they stay out of politics, their misbegotten wealth is safe. Those who violated this agreement have suffered the consequences. Media baron Boris Berezovsky remains in exile in Britain after speaking out against Putin’s proposed constitutional changes, and has since had two attempts on his life by suspected Russian agents. Similarly, media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky was forced into exile in Israel after clashing with Putin in 2001.
The most prominent example of this ongoing subjugation of the oligarchy was the 2003 arrest and conviction of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, then the richest man in Russia, of tax evasion after he began to finance opposition parties and hinted at contesting Putin in the 2004 presidential election. Khodorkovsky remains in jail to this day, though Prokhorov announced he would pardon him and Putin suggested that, if reelected, he too would free Khodorkovsky.
So why does the emergence of Prokhorov demonstrate Putin’s overarching calmness? Because it appears that he will actually be permitted to run. Prokhorov knows exactly what happens to those oligarchs who truly battle Putin. He knows that his wealth, power, and lack of incarceration rely on a good relationship with the Kremlin. In fact, the best possible scenario for the current administration is one in which Prokhorov becomes the main opposition figure and absorbs the anti-Putin popular anger. Most Russians resent the oligarchs for gobbling up public resources in the chaos of post-Soviet privatization, so Prokhorov would not be able to be the figurehead of the major wave of dissent that would be necessary for true change.
Putin needs a strong but beatable foil to avoid greater backlash after the March election. In chess terms, Putin’s battle with Prokhorov amounts to a feint, a way for him to distract the mounting opposition from the strategy that could actually beat him. And if Prokhorov does in fact attempt to become a serious rival in the vein of Vladimir Yushchenko, the Kremlin-opposed leader of the 2004 Ukranian Orange Revolution, he can expect the same counter moves Yushchenko endured. Bishop to Queen four? Dioxin poisoning to the face.
Putin is a cagy politician, and surely he has learned the lessons of the fallen Arab Spring dictators. Widespread violent repression leads to alienation and de-legitimization. Ignoring the opposition allows it to grow and reach critical mass. For the first time in his regime Putin is going to have to acknowledge and permit a dissenting voice, so he might as well hand-select a fool’s mate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I suppose I should have expected a backlash when I joined about twenty of my classmates in protesting Goldman Sachs’ summer internship info session on November 28th. Last year, more seniors who took jobs after graduation (16.5 percent) took them in finance than in any other sector of the economy; in 2010, the figure was 31 percent. Finance is popular (and at the salaries it pays, why wouldn’t it be?) and trying to make it more difficult—or at least more uncomfortable—to enter is sure to produce resentment.
And once Goldman announced that it would cancel similar events here and at Brown due to the protest, the mumbled misgivings got louder. “Occupy alienated a large portion of the student body that might have been persuaded to be sympathetic to their causes,” tut-tutted Katie R. Zavadski ’13 in the Crimson on Wednesday. The idea here, I guess, is that if Occupiers would just abandon the cause of fighting finance recruiting, people would get on board. And maybe that’s so. But abandoning the recruiting fight would mean ignoring the single biggest way that Harvard is contributing to economic inequality.
The story of inequality’s rise in America is not one of the 1 percent but of the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent. And despite Zavadski’s protestations to the contrary, the enormous increases in the share of national income going to the super-super-rich are due almost entirely to the increased earnings of, one, “superstars” like musicians, actors, and athletes and two, financiers and those in finance-related professions. As the economist Tyler Cowen has detailed, recent research indicates that hedge fund managers, Wall Street-affiliated lawyers, and bankers are a huge force behind top-end inequality. For example, the economists Steven N. Kaplan and Joshua D. Rauh found that the number of Wall Street investors making over $100 million in 2004 was more than nine times as many as the number of executives at public companies making that much.
Not every Harvard graduate who takes a job at Goldman Sachs is going to end up making that kind of cash. But most of the financial super-rich went to places like Harvard. Take Citigroup CEO and Columbia grad Vikram S. Pandit, or Goldman chief Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75, or Blackstone head and Yale alum Stephen A. Schwarzman. Some current Harvard seniors are going to take finance jobs, stick with them, and make tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year by the time they reach their forties.  Those students will be part of the problem. The many more students trying to get there and failing will be part of the problem.
This kind of inequality in and of itself is troublesome. Study after study has found that unequal societies are more likely to be politically polarized, experience slower growth than more equal societies, and even have higher divorce rates. But it is especially troublesome because it is ill-gotten. As Cowen explains, a major reason that finance went from the mundane business of making loans to the profit-producing behemoth it is today is that financiers have started to make huge, leveraged bets against improbable events. Usually, these bets pay off big and make the gamblers making them millions. Then 2008 happens, the bets fail, and the whole economy implodes. The bankers get bailed out and don’t suffer. The rest of us are screwed.
This sort of betting is of no social value. Bankers will tell you that it allows for more efficient pricing of assets, but if the last decade taught us anything, it’s that it actually leads to bubbles where assets aren’t priced accurately at all. It’s destructive, greedy behavior. It hurts real people. It puts people in poverty and throws families out on the street. Those who engage in it, from hedge fund managers to analysts just out of Harvard, are doing something gravely immoral.
And part of being a responsible member of a community is speaking up when something gravely immoral is going on. Part of being a good friend is telling your friends when they are doing something that is horribly wrong. The reason the Goldman protest hit a nerve, I think, is that people took it personally. The picketers seemed like they were calling those attending the info session bad people.
I can’t speak for the other protestors, but I for one hope the attendees took it personally. Taking a job at Goldman Sachs is immoral. To take a job in finance is to become complicit in a socially useless enterprise that ruins lives. You should feel bad about yourself if you do it. You will be a worse person if you do it. That sort of message may very well alienate a lot of Harvard students. But we need to hear it.

At the end of a speech about judicial reform last year in Memorial Church, former Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court Margaret H. Marshall asked her listeners, “Will you act on the ideas embodied in the Constitution—and teach them to others?” Starting next semester, Marshall will do just that. Harvard Law School announced Thursday that Marshall would join its faculty as a senior research fellow and lecturer.
“Chief Justice Marshall has demonstrated brilliance and courage throughout her career, leading anti-apartheid efforts in the 1960s; championing educational progress here at Harvard and elsewhere; and galvanizing ground-breaking reform to the Massachusetts judicial system in the past decade,” Law School Dean Martha Minow said in a press release. “We at Harvard Law School are so honored that she will share her talents, experiences, wisdom, and brilliance along with her enduring commitment to access to justice.”
Marshall, who grew up in apartheid-era South Africa, became the first woman to serve as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1999 and retired in 2010. During her 14 years on the Court, Marshall wrote over 200 opinions, including the majority opinion in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, the 2003 case that led to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts.
Marshall received a masters degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1969. She went on to attend Yale Law School. After practicing law in Boston for 16 years, she became general counsel of Harvard in 1992—the first woman to fill the position, according to the HLS press release.
Since then, Marshall has served as president of the Boston Bar Association, chair of the National Center for State Courts, and a fellow of the Yale Corporation, according to her biography on the state court system website. She served a one-year term as president of the Conference of Chief Justices.
In 1998, Marshall became the first recipient of the Harvard College Women’s Professional Achievement Award.
“Harvard Law School is one of the great centers of legal scholarship,” Marshall said in the HLS press release. “It is a privilege to be returning to a University that has been so important in my legal career, and to have the opportunity to teach and learn from a new generation of students who will in the future play such important roles in all parts of the legal profession.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When students harm themselves the marks often go unseen, but the percentage of undergraduates who have intentionally injured themselves in their lifetimes is stunning.
More than 15 percent of undergraduates nationwide have harmed themselves and 6.8 percent have done so in the past year, according to a study published in the Journal of American College Health in November.
Harvard’s Director of Behavioral Health and Counseling Paul Barreira said Harvard’s rate is slightly lower than the national average, but he declined to offer a more specific figure. Barreira served as a researcher on the study.
These national statistics are reflected in the lives of three Harvard undergraduates.
Interviews with these students, who have harmed themselves during their time at Harvard—two by cutting and another by inflicting non-scarring injuries—reveal that self-harm is a real phenomenon even within the ivory tower. They say that while Harvard offers a number of ways to seek help—whether professional, student-run, or simply social—often the fear of repercussions and an intense concern for privacy leave them to cope alone.
THE BEGINNINGS OF SELF-HARM
Now a senior in Eliot House, Anna started cutting at 13. She was one of three undergraduates interviewed for the story, all of whom have had their names changed in the story so they could speak comfortably about their experiences.
Anna said she learned about cutting on teen self-help forums.
“I remember thinking, ‘Why would anyone ever start doing that to themselves?’” she said. “But by the time I resorted to trying it, I was thinking that if it worked for somebody else, then it might work for me too.”
At 15, Anna “quit.” During high school, she relapsed occasionally, leaving behind scars on her wrists. In the years before college, she had it under control, she says. But at Harvard, it got worse.
“It was very stressful,” she said. “Not being a top, straight-A student took a toll on me, so back in freshman year, I didn’t hold back.”
Research shows that students harm themselves for a number of reasons. Some use it as a way to cope with negative emotions, others hurt themselves to gain a sense of control, and still others use it as a means of punishing themselves.
“I was always able to feel ... this impulse coming through my arm, but the pulse would stop when I finally did it,” Anna said, referring to her cutting. She says that she cuts as a method of coping. “I would try to postpone, postpone, and postpone, but it’s all I could ever think about.”
Elizabeth, a sophomore, didn’t start cutting until she arrived at Harvard.
“I guess it was a combination of transitioning and stress,” Elizabeth said. “It was something impulsive, to get off frustration. I found it did help, and so it became a habit. It became an addiction.”
For John, a senior, self-injury started long before his college years.
He traced his history of depression back to the age of 9, when he first vocalized suicidal intentions.
“I was 11 when I started cutting myself,” John said. “I didn’t know the exact motivation for what I was doing—I just think I knew that I wanted to hurt myself because I was sad, because I felt bad about myself.”
In an attempt to keep his self-harm secret, John began to grow cautious, making sure not to leave marks.
Cutting and scratching, while the most visible forms of self-injury, are not the only methods. Some use burning, biting, and punching to inflict pain.
“I stopped injuring myself for quite some time,” John said. But by sophomore year of college he had started again.
“I never engaged in cutting again, but I would stab myself with pens, run my hands through overly hot water, bite my fingers—nothing that left permanent marks,” he added. “But even with the intent of calming myself, I actively caused myself pain as self-punishment for expressing low-self esteem.”
PEERING EYES
Self-harm, a largely solitary act, often takes place hidden away in dorm rooms and other private spaces.
Each of the three self-injurers had vastly different encounters with their peers at Harvard, though they agreed that the high-pressure environment can be unsettling.
“My experience here is that, independent of resources through Harvard, students themselves can be incredibly callous,” John said. “There is a tendency to view other people’s problems first through the lens of how they impact you.”
The three students agreed that, particularly at Harvard, there is an expectation that they project an air of perfection.
“There are people here who are very mentally unhealthy but have good grades and great jobs,” John said. “People react to you or think there is a problem only when you stop succeeding.”
Anna said that she has seen her peers talk about self-harm in two ways: either they say they could never understand doing it themselves but express sympathy for those who are hurting, or they act flabbergasted at the idea of self-harm.
“These other people have no clue about it,” she said. “And there is this underlying assumption that because we’re in Harvard, we’re high-achieving, well-adjusted individuals—so why would we do something this stupid or this dangerous?”
After pausing a moment to reflect on her experience, she said, “I’ve gotten a lot of that.”
The three students said they have had different levels of success at hiding their behavior.
Many self-injurers face the task of hiding scars on a daily basis, taking care not to show a certain arm or to go out with long sleeves.
“A couple of people notice, but I just kind of made up an excuse for it,” Elizabeth said. “It’s something people don’t really talk about or want to know.”
While two of the self-injurers firmly stated that nobody notices, Anna said she thinks her peers have seen her scars.
“I noticed people never asked about them [the scars],” Anna said. “I just thought people were oblivious or stupid and didn’t notice—that was until I had someone ask a friend of mine about the scars.” She shifted back in her chair for a moment. “It’s not that people didn’t notice but that they were not comfortable asking.”
Nearly a quarter of self-injuring students stated in the November study that nobody knew of their behavior, with only about 17 percent of those in therapy disclosing their self-harm to a health practitioner.
GETTING HELP
The University tries to address the issue of self-injury in a number of ways, hosting freshman workshops focused on case studies and suicide prevention training for student groups. A number of peer counseling groups offer their services on campus, including Room 13. Next term, a member of Harvard’s Student Mental Health Liaisons hopes to begin an educational campaign on self-harm, according to Barreira. Furthermore, students can seek counseling from University Health Services or the Bureau of Study Council.
For a number of reasons, students can be reluctant to seek help.
“Students’ concerns about how their friends, roommates and others will react to knowing that they have engaged in self-injury does hinder students’ willingness to seek help,” Barreira wrote.
John went off campus for help, fearing that he might get asked to take a leave of absence if he spoke to Harvard officials.
“There is a lot of mystery to what degree of seeking help will result in being asked to leave campus,” John said.
Barreira wrote that the University does not have a blanket policy for students who come forward with self-harm related issues.
“Any decision about a student leaving campus is an individual decision based on unique circumstances of the student and is done in consultation between the students’ treaters (if there are any), the student, and the college,” Barreira wrote.
HEALING
All three students have stopped self-injuring.
For Anna, it took an epiphany during junior year. “It was a wake-up call,” she said. “I told myself, ‘I’m 21 years old, I’m a grown-up, and I’m going to graduate soon—but I’m dealing with things in a non-healthy way.’”
Wanting to learn how to cope the way “normal people do,” she said that began to visit UHS, complaining initially of suicidal thoughts and then addressing her self-harming.
She continues therapy once a month and has not hurt herself since last December.
“I give myself little goals,” she explained. “It used to be that I told myself ‘you can’t do it, you can’t do it,’ and that made me want it more. Now I don’t say no; I just give myself five more minutes to reevaluate and see where I am. Normally within five minutes, those intense waves of emotion usually have dampened.”
For Elizabeth, she said her friends have supported her through her self-injury. “Instead of internalizing it and taking it out on yourself, I tell a friend, take my frustration out in words, or listen to music, or dance to it,” she said, smiling. “You don’t normally think it helps, but it’s just trying to ease the need.”
As someone free from self-injury for two months, Elizabeth stressed building a community of supporters. “It’s important for them [self-injurers] to know there is a friend out there that they can trust,” she said.
Still, the urge to self-injure does not always go away permanently. “It’s easy to return to those behaviors after not doing it for some time,” said John, who has not injured himself since sophomore year. “Being vigilant is important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Barack Obama’s approval rating among 18- to 29-year-olds has dropped to an all-time low of 46 percent, according to a study by the Institute of Politics released Thursday.
The study, which surveyed 2,028 young people, found that only 12 percent of those asked believed that the U.S. is headed in the right direction, while 52 percent responded that the nation is on the wrong track.
“Young Americans are upset by the current political process at the moment,” said IOP Director of Polling John Della Volpe. “Young people want to help the country, but they don’t think that engaging in the current political system is the best way to do that. It looks a lot like the survey data from 2000.”
Overall, the polling data showed increased disappointment in Obama, particularly when it came to his handling of the economy. On the topic of jobs and the economy—the number one issue for 74 percent of those polled—Obama’s approval rating has dropped 12 points since 2009 and currently rests at 32 percent, according to the survey.
Yet the study found that increased negativity toward the President will not necessarily help the Republican nominee in November. Obama now leads a generic Republican candidate by six percent in the poll, after the IOP found that he was in a statistical dead heat with a generic option a year ago. And Obama does even better against specific candidates.
Among the youth surveyed, Obama leads Mitt Romney by 11 points, Newt Gingrich by 16, and Rick Perry by 16. But despite these numbers, 36 percent of the young voters believed that Obama will lose his re-election bid, compared to 30 percent who claimed that he would win.
“The fact that they are souring on the president doesn’t necessarily translate to good news for Republicans,” Della Volpe said. “It seems to us ... that they are almost in a punishment zone. It’s not that they are going to vote for Republicans in significant numbers, but just that they may not help organize or be enthusiastic come November. This may be a warning sign.”
The IOP poll also asked for young people’s opinions about the recent Occupy protests. It found that 21 percent of young Americans supported the movement, while 33 percent said they did not support it. Sixteen percent of respondents believe the movement will change economic policy in the United States.
Only two percent of respondents said they had personally participated in the protests.
“[Young people] might be disappointed in Obama or Congress, but maybe that disappointment isn’t deep enough to go down even an hour or two to these movements,” IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 said. “The survey shows disappointment, but I wouldn’t call it anger.”
Della Volpe added that two percent is actually a relatively high level of participation.
“You have to remember that less than 50 percent of young people vote. The fact that two percent are actively supporting this movement, that isn’t that small of a number.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As discussion of the 27-year-old Extension School student who was escorted from Weld Hall on Dec. 8 cools down on campus, freshmen have expressed concern about how the administration has handled informing students of the incident.
“I was a little bit struck by the fact that the only word we got was from our dean,” Zachary P. Fletcher ’15 said. “It seems, even though the administration knew what happened, they weren’t very quick to let us know.”
Administrators made their first official response on Wednesday with an email from Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, after The Harvard Independent and The Crimson published articles about Extension School student Abe Liu’s stay in Weld.
Throughout the fall semester, Liu had been a frequent visitor, telling other students that he was a College freshman.
Dingman’s email said that Liu has been instructed not to enter any College residential facilities.
Several freshmen said that they were unsatisfied with the email and wished the administration had been more forthcoming.
Jason A. Cernius ’15 said that the email from Dingman “didn’t really clarify anything.”
“I just wish they would be more open with what actually went on,” he added.
Dingman told The Crimson that as soon as the administration heard that students living in Weld had concerns, they sent out a broad communication to the freshmen class.
While freshmen criticized the College’s lack of transparency, few undergraduates saw any need for the College to adjust its security measures in light of Liu’s extended visit.
“I think it’s a breach of security, but it’s not one that worries me,” Caitlin S. Pendleton ’15 said. “It sounds like he had been invited.”
“It’s not something that keeps me up at night. I don’t walk into Matthews at night worrying about whether there’s a poser sleeping in  the dorms next to me,” Pendleton said.
Many noted that, due to Occupy Harvard’s presence in the Yard, security has already been heightened.
After Occupy set up camp last month, the University closed off many of the gates into the Yard and stationed security officers to check students’ identification cards at the gates remaining open.
“You already have guards at the gate. You already have to swipe into dorms. People are already told specifically not to let people piggyback,” Heather L. Pickerell ’15  said.
“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with security,” she said.
But some students argued that security should be heightened further.
“I feel like the administration should beef up security,” Matt O. Ricotta ’15 said. “It seems like a very strange and potentially dangerous situation to have someone who isn’t a freshman staying in a freshman dorm.”
Dingman said that Liu does not pose a threat to anyone in the College and therefore the administration will not address the issue further.
“My understanding is that he was the guest of some freshman. He didn’t live in the dorm; he stayed there overnight,” Dingman said, “We don’t do door knocks and intervene at night. But I think what we do need to do is instruct students to know who their guests are.”
Like Dingman, College spokesperson Jeff Neal suggested that some of the burden for ensuring safe freshman dormitories rests with the undergraduates who live in them.
“Ultimately, students have a duty not only to follow the rules, but also to make decisions in accordance with their own safety and the safety of those throughout the Harvard community,” he wrote in an emailed statement. “While the College works with officials throughout the University to enforce security rules and to safeguard the Harvard community, we must also rely on the good judgment of the students, faculty and staff who have access to residential and other facilities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Occupy Harvard supporters passed a proposal Monday to remove the tents from the Yard next week.
According to protesters, the decampment is the result of efforts to push the movement into “a new phase of activism,” according to Summer A. Shafer, an Occupy Harvard supporter.
Protesters will meet with University administrators on Monday morning to discuss opening the gates when the proposal to vacate the tents takes effect.
“Seeing the gates open is something many, many people in the movement want,” Shafer said. The University has closed the Yard to non-Harvard affiliates since Occupy pitched its tents on Nov. 9.
“Occupy Harvard 2.0,” as the reconfiguration is being called, will still maintain a presence in the Yard for an undetermined amount of time. While Occupy members will pack up their tents, the weatherized geodesic dome will remain.
The dome was donated by MIT supporters over Thanksgiving break and has been outfitted with a tarp to create a warm area for Occupy Harvard supporters.
Occupy members say they have not determined how they will use the dome, but they have floated ideas of using it as a movement hub, a space for the information desk, or even as a weatherized place to sleep.
During a general assembly Thursday, supporters explained that the agreement to get rid of the tents was not due to administrative pressure. They said the decision was made in the face of impending winter weather and the inconvenience many people said they have experienced as a result of the closed gates.
Shafer said some Occupy Harvard protesters hope that opening the gates will garner more undergraduate support, encouraging students to “see Occupy Harvard as a movement, not something that’s silly or ineffective.”
Cambridge resident Vince Dixon, who runs Cambridge Advantage Tours, attended the general assembly and said the closed gates have hurt his business.
“Nobody is going to make up my business losses,” Dixon said.
Many Occupy Harvard protesters said they sympathized with Dixon and invited him to join the meeting on Monday with administrators.
“Closing the gates is unprecedented in Harvard history,” said Occupy Harvard supporter Jeff K. Bridges. “There are alternatives the administration could have taken and didn’t.”
Bridges added that some protesters hope that the administration will open the gates as the movement transitions into Occupy Harvard 2.0.
Over winter break, an undetermined number of Occupy Harvard supporters will stay in the area to guard the remaining supplies and staff the information desk in the Yard.
Those who will remain said that keeping the movement’s momentum over the break is important to them.
Occupy Harvard supporter Maggie H. Gram said she believes that “it is important for us to have a physical presence that will be maintained throughout the winter break.”
The protesters have presented the University with a series of demands, including negotiating a just contract with the University’s custodial workers, withdrawing investments from corporations such as HEI Hotels & Resorts, and increasing diversity among graduate school faculty and students. Harvard has since renegotiated a contract with custodial workers, and University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced Friday that the Harvard Management Company is currently reviewing HEI’s business practices.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 9, Crossroads Grassroots Political Strategies, a political action committee founded by strategist Karl Rove, launched its first attack ad against Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, seeking to tie the senatorial candidate to the national Occupy movement.
“Instead of focusing on jobs, Elizabeth Warren sides with extreme left protests,” the ad said, simultaneously showing dramatic images of protesters carrying red banners.
The ad draws from a September story in The Daily Beast in which Warren said that she supported the movement and that she had “created much of the intellectual foundation for what they do.”
Warren made her career as a tough advocate for increasing regulation of Wall Street and financial instruments, a message that has dovetailed with the central concerns of the Occupy movement.
Nonetheless, Warren has walked a careful line with regard to the movement, taking care not to fully endorse the protesters while staying on message with a populist political rhetoric that rails against inequality, big banks, and the state of the economy.
Only a few weeks after The Daily Beast article, Warren refused to sign a pledge of support for Occupy Harvard. But when Crossroads released the ad seeking to tie Warren to Occupy, she fired back with a fiesty ad of her own that underlined her populist message while taking care to avoid mentioning Occupy.
“For years I worked to expose how Wall Street and the big banks are crushing middle class families,” she said in the ad.
But while some members of the Occupy movement say that they understand why Warren has not publicly embraced the movement, they argue Warren shares several significant goals with the movement.
The Occupy movement—at Harvard and nationwide—has no spokesperson or single message, but Ed Needham, a member of the Occupy Wall Street public relations team, called Warren one of the key “thought leaders” of the movement and explained that Warren and Occupy try to tackle the same problems in different ways.
“It’s a challenge that has to be approached from all sides,” Needham said. “Those who can work within the system and make change go with God’s blessing. We have to find our own way—this movement is an eruption of civic energy. Civic energy is going to mean what it means to each person.”
If she defeats incumbent Senator Scott Brown, Warren may come to represent a powerful voice in the Senate for the issues at the heart of the Occupy movement. But publicly embracing the movement carries political risks for Warren, who has been described by her Republican critics as an overly liberal, out-of-touch Harvard professor.
Summer A. Shafer, a Harvard graduate student and member of Occupy Harvard, acknowledged that tension and argued that Warren should distance herself from Occupy “because of the way popular movements are portrayed as cranks and dirty hippies without jobs.”
“Insofar as any of the Occupy movements can be characterized that way by your opponent, you are actually doing a disservice to that social movement if you’re going to stand by it and lose as a result,” Shafer says. “If she can distance herself now from Occupy and win, what she’s going to be doing is going to be representing everything we want.”
In her matchup against Brown during an election year that is likely to favor Republicans, Warren faces the challenge of reclaiming the moderate voters who punched their ballots for Brown in 2010 when he pulled off an upset victory against Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, which may make her less likely to tack to the left by publicly backing the Occupy movement.
Warren, who entered the race in September only nine points behind Brown, passed him in the polls last month. She now holds a seven-point lead, according to a poll conducted by the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and The Boston Herald from Dec. 1 to Dec. 6. State Rep. Thomas Conroy, Warren’s last major primary competitor, dropped out of the race on Monday, leaving Warren as the presumptive Democratic nominee.
Like the Tea Party movement, Occupy began as a leaderless, grass roots effort. But over time the Tea Party adopted a group of national leaders as the face of the movement, a decision that helped it convert public energy into tangible political gains during the 2010 midterm elections. Some now wonder whether the Occupy movement needs to take a similar turn, and Warren stands out among the movement’s potential leaders, a fact that has made her ambivalent stance toward the movement all the more poignant.
“I think change is possible from within the system,” Shafer said, “We see that with Tea Party candidates.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: Dec. 17, 2011.
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of the Dec. 16 article “Political Ads Highlight Warren's Ambivalent Relationship with Occupy” misstated the name of the political action committee that ran an ad attacking Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren. The ad was funded by Crossroads Grassroots Political Strategies, not American Crossroads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It normally takes just a few minutes. But last week’s approval of the Summer School course catalog—which still included controversial Indian politician Subramanian Swamy on the teaching roster when it first came up for a vote—launched a lengthy discussion that has since spawned a vocal debate in the international media.
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the largest school at Harvard, voted overwhelmingly at last Tuesday’s Faculty meeting to remove the two courses taught by Swamy at the Summer School.
The vote came in response to an article Swamy wrote in India in July, in which he advocated for the disenfranchisement of non-Hindus, destruction of hundreds of mosques in India, and the prohibition of conversion from Hinduism.
A majority of the Faculty at the meeting voted to remove Swamy’s classes, claiming that comments he made in the op-ed over the summer were an unacceptable incitement to violence against Muslims in India. But some professors are unsure what this decision might say about free expression at Harvard and question the precedent the decision sets for removing professors from the University based on their political views.
REMOVING SWAMY
Diana L. Eck, a professor of comparative religion and a scholar of Indian studies, led the decision to remove Swamy from the teaching roster, but she said she did not intend to become the face of a movement against him.
Eck was one of forty faculty members who signed a letter to University President Drew G. Faust and Summer School Dean Donald H. Pfister requesting that Harvard reconsider its appointment of teachers who “detract from the reputation of the university.” The letter was drafted by Ajantha Subramanian, an associate professor of anthropology and social studies, one month after Swamy’s op-ed was first published in the Indian newspaper Daily News and Analysis.
“We’re not in the business of trying to publicly shame or disparage Subramanian Swamy,” Eck said in an interview Sunday. “I think many of us imagined that this would be taken up by the Economics Department, and they would quietly drop these courses or find someone else to teach them.”
According to economics professor Claudia Goldin, an executive council of the Economics Department did broach the subject, which “received a lot of airtime.” But she said that after “a very open and frank discussion,” the members decided to include Swamy’s two courses in the 2012 summer course catalog sent to the Faculty Council.
The Faculty Council—which sets the agenda for the monthly FAS Faculty meetings—reviewed a copy of Swamy’s op-ed and Subramanian’s letter. After nearly half an hour of debate, the council voted unanimously to approve the catalog as it stood.
One week later, the Faculty met to discuss and officially approve the catalog at the December Faculty meeting, but, according to Eck, faculty members did not receive a copy of the course listings. Eck said she saw the meeting agenda the night before the meeting and realized that Swamy’s courses were still included in the Summer School catalog that would come up for approval the next day.
After contacting several other signatories of Subramanian’s letter—none of whom were aware that Swamy’s courses were still on the list—Eck drafted an amendment proposing that FAS approve the course catalog with the exception of Economics S-110 and Economics S-1136, Swamy’s two courses.
“It was really within an hour of the meeting,” she said, adding that she informed the secretary of the Faculty ahead of time of her intention to present the amendment.
AN ISSUE OF FREE SPEECH
Many publications in India and political supporters of Swamy—who leads India’s Janata party—have spoken out about Harvard’s reaction to Swamy’s op-ed in recent days. And in Cambridge, professors have expressed concern about the potential ramifications of the Faculty vote, worrying that it might set a precedent for censoring free speech at Harvard.
Swamy publicly responded to the vote last Thursday, condemning Harvard’s decision as a “dangerous one.”
“The article was written for a Mumbai newspaper, and I teach economics in Harvard. I would assume that they would have sent their petition to me asking for my comments, which is a normal procedure. But they have not done that,” Swamy was quoted as saying in the Indian press.
Days after the Faculty meeting, professors are still discussing not whether they should have contacted Swamy but what their decision says about tolerance for opinionated speech at Harvard.
“If there were any form of speech that might provide a rationale for this kind of exclusion, it should not be political speech,” said Harry R. Lewis ’68, a computer science professor and Faculty Council member. “Political speech should be the most protected.”
He added, “It’s lawful to make a general urging that at some point people should go do something illegal and violent.”
Lewis said he was concerned about the precedent the Faculty vote might establish, saying that he feared that tenured professors might feel the need to watch their tongues to retain the right to teach their courses.
“If you can make an eloquent argument to persuade more than half of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, or to be precise, more than half of the faculty who show up to the meeting at which the catalog is approved, you can not only silence [any professor], you can take their whole academic agenda out of the catalog,” Lewis said.
He called the Faculty’s vote an “ad hominem” amendment directed against an individual instructor and said that he found the Faculty meeting a regrettable forum for the decision.
“I wish that the onus had fallen on the Economics Department, whichever way it came out, and less on FAS or Harvard as a whole,” Lewis said.
But Eck emphasized that although individual departments are responsible for proposing and vetting the courses in the Summer School Catalog, FAS is ultimately responsible for overseeing the entire catalog.
In particular, she expressed concern over Swamy because of the implications of his comments given India’s history of religious tension.
“This falls in a context of religiously inflamed politics in India,” Eck said. “To deliberately call for the removal ofthe mosque adjacent to Kashi Vishvanath temple in Varanasi and 300 other mosques built at temple sites in India is an incendiary statement in the Indian context and constitutes what many faculty members saw as an incitement to violence.”
Philosophy Department Chair Sean D. Kelly, who serves as vice chair of the Faculty Docket Committee, initially defended the Faculty Council’s unanimous vote to approve the catalog, with Swamy’s courses in it. But he switched his opinion at the Faculty meeting, writing in an email to The Crimson last week that he had been persuaded that Swamy’s op-ed “amounted to incitement of violence,” thus meriting its writer’s exclusion from the Summer School teaching staff.
Eck drew a distinction between Swamy’s affiliation to the University and that of a tenured professor. “If he were already a professor here and had gone through the promotion and tenure process of being vetted by a department, there would be a faculty process for review,” she said to The Crimson.
Lewis agreed, “He’s not a Harvard professor—he was here last summer, but it’s not like Harvard owes him a position from which to speak.”
Regardless, he wrote on his blog that had he been at the meeting, “I would have voted against the amendment.”
More Faculty members agreed with Eck: “I don’t think it is appropriate for an employee of the University, charged with teaching our students, to openly advocate the suspension of the human rights of millions of Indian citizens,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It didn't take very long for former Harvard hockey star Louis Leblanc to make his mark in the NHL.
Eight games into his professional career with the Montreal Canadiens, Leblanc scored his first goal in hockey's top league in front of a supportive home crowd Thursday night. Montreal lost to the Flyers, 4-3.
Leblanc, who made his debut for the Canadiens Nov. 30, knocked in a deflection at 13:24 in the second period to tie the game at 2-2. Though the crowd of 21,273 proceeded to give him a standing ovation, the fourth-liner played only 49 seconds in the third period.
After starring for the Crimson with 11 goals in 2009-10, the 20-year-old Quebec native and 18th overall pick in the 2009 NHL Draft—held in Montreal that year—decided to forgo another season in Cambridge and turn professional.
Leblanc joined the Hamilton Bulldogs, the minor-league affiliate of his hometown team, earlier this season and was soon called up to the Canadiens after the suspension of Max Pacioretty. The 2009-10 Ivy League Rookie of the Year earned his first NHL point with an assist Dec. 3.
“I’m enjoying what I do,” Leblanc told The Crimson in November. “I love hockey, and I want to play hockey for the next 20 years.”
There is speculation that Leblanc may be sent back to Hamilton soon. He has four goals and six assists in 14 games for the Bulldogs this season.

At 5 p.m. yesterday evening, 4,231 high school seniors received an email from the Harvard College admissions office that may determine the next four years of their lives, or at least whether or not they have to spend their winter vacations frantically writing college essays.
Of these 4,231 applicants, 772 were accepted to Harvard under the newly reinstated early action program. A few of them took a break from their revelry to discuss their happy news.
It was 3 a.m. Eastern African Time, when Karim Pirbay of Antananarivo, Madagascar, and his father decided to call it quits for the night and go to bed. Pirbay had been refreshing his email since 1 a.m. EAT, or 5 p.m. EST, waiting for the email from Harvard. As soon as his father went to bed, Pirbay received the email. 
 
"I had to read the email four times because I didn't believe it," Pirbay said. 
 
Pirbay said he immediately rushed into his parent's bedroom and began calling friends and family, including his sister Leila L. Pirbay '14, a Crimson photo editor. "It was hectic at 4 a.m."
 Pirbay said he will not apply to other colleges. "Harvard has been my first choice since the beginning."
 
Pirbay is interested in studying computer science at Harvard. In fact, he has already created his own iPhone app, iLemur, an interactive encyclopedia of lemurs. 
 
William S. Xiao of Atlanta was alone in his apartment when he received the email promptly at 5 p.m. Xiao said he dashed up the stairs of the building to a friend's apartment for a big celebratory hug. He said he then called his parents and sister Karen F. Xiao '14.
Xiao said he has also applied to Duke and MIT and is not positive he will be attending Harvard next year.
Ted C. Ko of Laguna Niguel, California was waiting with his parents in anticipation for the email, which he said came promptly at 2 p.m. PST. Ko said he rushed to call his brother George C. Ko '15. "Emotions are running high," Ko said. 
Ko, who wants to be an engineer, said he was drawn to Harvard, as opposed to other colleges and universities with pre-professional engineering programs, because of Harvard's emphasis on collaboration and entrepreneurship. He plays alto saxophone and said he is also drawn to the music scene in Cambridge and Boston. 
Nicholas L. Rosamilia of Philadelphia was at squash practice when the admissions office sent out the emails. Rosamilia said he opened the email on his phone on the train ride home with a friend, whereby his friend proceeded to tell everyone in the train car that Rosamilia had been accepted to Harvard. However, Rosamilia left his parents in suspense until he arrived home. He said his mother cried upon hearing the news because she was sure he had been rejected. 
 
When asked why he decided to apply to Harvard early action, Rosamilia said he originally was against the idea, as his mother attended Harvard. However, he said he fell in love with the school upon visiting. "It felt like home."
That's all for now. Leave a comment with your own story, if you like. Oh, and congratulations, Early Action Class of 2016!
