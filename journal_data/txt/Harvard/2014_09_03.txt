After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brown v. Board was decided in 1954. A decade later, President Lyndon B. Johnson began implementation of his Great Society program to mitigate socioeconomic injustice. Part of that program was the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which started a half-century movement for equal access to quality education. Sixty years later, “separate but equal” may no longer be the law of the land—but at least in education, “separate and unequal” remains the reality. That cannot change until we’ve amended the practice of tying education to property taxes, a practice we can call total local control.
Broadly defined, “local control” is the doctrine that local governments should have maximum control over the education of students in their municipalities. Basically, Boston kids get educated in Boston, Brookline kids in Brookline, and never the twain shall meet. Furthermore, decisions about finances, staffing, and curriculum are made at the local level, with minimal input from state or federal governments. This system is popular in the United States—including Massachusetts, where municipalities have traditionally held high levels of power. There may be compelling arguments behind the idea, not least the contention that “neighborhood schools” make excellent community-building sites.
The problem with total local control is that it amplifies socioeconomic disparities across zip codes and municipalities. In 2005 Boston.com reported that median income varies widely by zip code in Massachusetts, and a November 2013 Washington Post feature reveals that some of the Commonwealth’s richer towns, like Brookline, border some of the poorest, like Boston. Educating Boston kids and Brookline kids separately effectively means segregating students based on class. As socioeconomic patterns of racial injustice are still alarmingly prevalent in America’s urban areas, class-based school segregation also means racial segregation.
Not surprisingly, the schools in Massachusetts’ high-income municipalities are overwhelmingly the Commonwealth’s top performers. In fact, according to Boston Magazine’s 2013 Mass. school rankings, graduation rates and standardized test scores are better correlated with a municipality’s average income than with per-pupil expenditures or even teacher pay.
As Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., points out in “The Two-Income Trap,” total local control causes a system of exclusionary schools, far from truly “public.”
Essentially, towns with good schools become desirable, and therefore can charge higher property taxes. Good schools draw an increasingly affluent population, meaning that municipalities have more resources available with which to educate a lower-need population. The schools that benefit from this system operate in high-tax districts inaccessible to low-income families—who are consigned to lower-performing schools that are under-resourced given their high-need populations.
In a system of total local control, there are no tuition-free public schools that do not limit admission based on zip code. Families in lower-performing districts are left with three choices: Enroll in private education, move to a town with better schools (and therefore higher taxes), or stick it out where they are. For those without means, only the last is feasible. Our high-performing, supposedly public schools are essentially private. They may not charge nominal tuition, but property taxes keep out poorer students—which has the same effect.
Solutions to this problem are not entirely clear. Back in the 1970s, Massachusetts’ attempts at court-enforced busing led to mixed results and outright public outrage, as J. Anthony Lukas’s “Common Ground” makes clear. An effective busing program—one that integrates based on class, rather than race alone—would be highly costly in most cases. True reform becomes especially difficult when busing is legally confined to single municipalities, as happened in Boston.
If we’re serious about mitigating opportunity gaps and increasing equity in public education, we have to think of ways to reduce the link between income level and educational quality. Any real effort to do so must divorce school assignment from property taxes.
And that probably means some reduction in local control—hard as that truth may be.

The ivory tower may soon become the ivory browser.
Online learning is growing, around the world and at Harvard. Harvard’s EdX program has provided free online education to students across the world, and HarvardX for Alumni has offered graduates the chance to attend lecture for life.
Recently, similar initiatives have found their way through Johnston Gate and onto the study cards of current Harvard students. Last spring, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences piloted a number of “blended” courses—ones that mix online learning with the traditional classroom variety. The four courses Harvard’s Bok Center for Teaching and Learning examined garnered lower student ratings than they did in their earlier forms, before the online transition. But that shouldn’t stop Harvard from experimenting.
On the one hand, Harvard has to embrace digital opportunities to stay ahead of the pack. It is almost certain that technology will dictate the future of learning, and in many ways it is for the better: Innovation helps spread knowledge beyond a campus and streamline knowledge within one. Online tools, for example, can supplement the classroom experience—clickable content on the web is likely to hold a student’s attention better than the same visual projected on a screen a hundred feet away.
At the same time, however, online learning inevitably takes away from time spent in the classroom. This deprives students of the interactions with peers and professors that define a college experience—hearing others voice their ideas out loud and engaging with them challenges our own viewpoints and helps us develop them more fully. Without the personal aspect that has helped Harvard shape scholars over hundreds of years, teaching and learning will not be the same, and it is possible neither will be as effective.
Harvard must strike a balance between taking advantage of cutting-edge technologies and preserving what already works well. Instead of jumping off the deep end with classes where the majority of the material appears online, Harvard should wade in the shallows and make sure students have the chance to see each other and their teachers. Some courses that last spring nixed those chances are already following such a path by reintroducing seminars and sections. These are the types of plans we hope to see in other blended courses across departments.
Blended courses are a peek into the future. To improve the years to come, Harvard should take care not to forget those that have already passed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the best of my knowledge, there are approximately zero people in our country today who hope to become nothing more than dedicated and dutiful civil servants. The brightest today who are at all interested in public policy would much more swiftly declare that activism of some sort, any sort, is a more noble and effective form of enacting change than is becoming a government cog.
Somewhere recently down the line, Americans decided that government is so defunct that the best and most moral among us should avoid it, if not actively oppose it. Activism is the prime civic engagement of the day.
Few things spur activism more quickly than seeing our First Amendment rights tampered with. These rights are lodged in our cerebellums, primed for deployment with equal force when faced with a brutalizing police squadron or when at a cocktail party.
The First Amendment rights supply virtually all the necessary elements for activism. We have developed new tools to facilitate activism, but we haven’t needed to create new constitutional provisions to protect activists in the modern era. The most important of protections are snuggled in that nugget of text, which stands like a sentinel at attention between angry mobs and governments that overstep their boundaries.
But in recent years, this model of the First Amendment as a protective element against tyrannical regimes has been eclipsed: We’ve started to treat it far more like a call to action than a safety net.
Exercising First Amendment rights ought to mean that in the face of opposition, one resorts to those unassailable safeguards. Instead, those rights have become the impetus for exercising them. In the same way that school boards and the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company must use every last drop of funding they are given, even if wastefully, just so that their budgets aren’t cut in the next quarter, simply because First Amendment rights exist, people believe they are obligated to demonstrate their use.
More importantly, a large number of activists today believe that exercising one’s First Amendment rights is in and of itself morally good. Before asking what the instrumental goal of an activist’s actions are, people give nods of approval to their activist colleagues simply for being against the system. I can see how counterculture for the sake of counterculture can be praised in a field like art, but when it comes to our peaceful coexistence, this mantra just seems counterintuitive.
Some argue that we live in a better society today because we praise individual protest as good in itself. But even if this could be proven true, it would convince me more of our fundamental inability to create stable governments than in our ability to enact change. Being an activist is not a badge of honor. It is a reminder that men and women, two hundred years after the Constitution of the United States, a thousand years after the Magna Carta, and four thousand years after Hammurabi’s code, still cannot manage to live together in peace.
James Wilson, my founding father heartthrob, originally argued in favor of a constitution that had no Bill of Rights, saying that, “it would have been superfluous and absurd” to note that “we should enjoy those privileges of which we are not divested.” He did not mean that he had helped create a government so infallible that it could not harm its citizens, but rather that a bill of rights, in delineating certain acceptable actions, might actually make people forget that the freedom of expression is a birthright and not an instruction manual. Today we are so obsessed with the instruction manual that we have forgotten the machine.
In the long run, it is not the support for particular causes, but adherence to a sustainable set of laws, which binds diverse populations together. So rather than eschew establishment because of its apparent dysfunction, perhaps we ought to stand with it now more than ever.

This year, the hundredth anniversary of the start of World War I, has seen a long parade of commemorations—a New York Times feature, a presidential visit to a Belgian cemetery, and even a few Buzzfeed listicles. But when compared to commemorations of the Second World War, memorials of this milestone anniversary have been muted in this country. While World War II battles like D-Day and Iwo Jima occupy hallowed ground in America’s collective memory, First World War campaigns like the Meuse-Argonne Offensive (the largest battle in American history) are scarcely remembered. This is a shame, because the First World War, not the Second, offers the most important lessons for America’s place in the world today.
Consider the causes of the two wars. World War II offered a clear moral justification for going to war. Although the Allies committed their share of atrocities, the world is unquestionably a better place without the genocidal dictatorships of Nazi Germany and Japan. Finding clear moral lessons in the causes of World War I is much more difficult. While President Wilson later tried to justify America’s entry into the war as making “the world… safe for democracy”,the Great War (as it was known at the time) was largely a struggle between two rival camps of colonial empires. Both sides made extensive use of colonial soldiers, and the ostensibly democratic Allies included Russia, a backwards autocracy. True, one of the chief causes of the war was Germany’s invasion of neutral Belgium, but it’s also worth noting that France’s long-discussed grand military strategy, Plan XVII, called for a counter-invasion of Germany.
The ethical ambiguities and diplomatic confusion of World War I are far more relevant to today’s world than World War II’s clear tale of good and evil. War is rarely a morality play, and seeing Nazi Germany in every potential threat can be counterproductive. In American politics, invocations of World War II have become something of a cognitive crutch to avoid nuanced debate—President Bush’s “Axis of Evil” speech is the most infamous offender. On the other hand, an appreciation of the contradictions and confusions of alliance building, à la World War I, provides ample lessons for navigating today’s emerging multipolar world.
Indeed, the geopolitical order that fought the Great War bears eerie resemblance to the world today. In 1914, Britain, the declining hegemon, a maritime and commercial power, tried to contain Germany, a rising economic power with imperial ambitions. Today, the United States, the world’s financial and military leader, faces China, an economic juggernaut with growing naval aspirations. Britain’s containment network of alliances and territorial guarantees eventually dragged it into war. It remains to be seen if America’s alliances will do the same.
There are also important lessons to be drawn from the disappointing conclusion to World War I. At Versailles, Wilson’s high-minded ideals were muscled aside by the ruthless pragmatism of France’s Clemenceau and Britain’s Lloyd George. Disillusioned, the United States, already the world’s largest economy and now its preeminent military power, chose to withdraw into isolationism. American nonparticipation made the League of Nations irrelevant from the start.
By contrast, after World War II the United States enthusiastically engaged with the world, creating a host of political and economic institutions to preserve the hard-won peace. Today, with the American public’s diminished appetite for global engagement, America’s mindset seems closer to 1918 than 1945. The disappointing conclusion of World War I offers a cautionary tale against disengagement—after all, the mistakes of Versailles made World War II possible.
One hundred years on, World War I remains one of America’s leastunderstood wars. Perhaps this is understandable; its muddled causes and disappointing conclusion offer little of the moral clarity of its successor. But it would be bring some small measure of closure if America learned from its Great War experience.

Owen A. Labrie, who was expected to be a member of the Class of 2018 before he was accused of sexual assault earlier this summer, is no longer enrolled in the College, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning confirmed on Tuesday.
Labrie was taken into custody on July 17 in Concord, N.H., and charged with three counts of felonious aggravated sexual assault, three counts of statutory sexual assault, and one count of using a computer to lure a victim to the scene of a crime, according to a press release by the Concord Police Department.
Labrie’s name was removed from the Harvard College Facebook—a student directory that includes the names of enrolled College students—several weeks ago and his Facebook profile can not be found on the Class of 2018’s Facebook page.
Manning declined to provide further comment on the case. Admission to the College can be revoked on several grounds. Director of Undergraduate Admissions Marlyn McGrath Lewis ’70-’73 told The Crimson in 2003 that these grounds include engaging “in behavior that brings into question your honesty, maturity, or moral character."
According to the police department, Labrie allegedly forced a 15-year-old freshman girl at St. Paul’s School, a prominent boarding school in Concord, to have sex with him in the school’s center for mathematics and science on May 30.
The incident began when Labrie sent the freshman a “senior salute,” a spring semester tradition at the school in which senior boys send younger girls emails to solicit a romantic encounter, just before graduation, according to the police affidavit. The female agreed to meet with Labrie after the email exchange, but told investigators that “her understanding was that it was ‘just a hook up,’ which to her meant kissing or making out.”
The affidavit characterized the tradition as a “competition” among senior boys to see how many girls they could “hook up” with before graduating.
A forensic examination on June 3 by a sexual assault nurse examiner found “a laceration that would be consistent with penetration having occurred,” according to the affidavit.
Labrie denied the accusations in an interview with police. The affidavit cites another student who told police that Labrie admitted he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the female student.
Founded in 1856, St. Paul’s School sits on a 2,000 acre campus and has an endowment reportedly valued at more than $500 million.
Labrie was a prefect at St. Paul’s, a position given to seniors to be “student leaders.” In that capacity, Labrie underwent training in statutory rape and consensual sex, according to the affidavit.
Labrie was also a candidate for the Presidential Scholars Program and served as a captain on St. Paul’s varsity soccer team, according to websites run by the Presidential Scholars Program and the school, respectively.
“Whatever further developments become known in this case, a serious breach of our standards of mutual trust and respect has occurred,” St. Paul’s Rector Michael G. Hirschfeld wrote in an email to parents and students. “I am determined to learn if this alleged violation is an aberration or represents a broader issue that our many School-wide conversations about a healthy community have not sufficiently addressed.”
A St. Paul’s spokesperson declined to comment further on the case to The Crimson.
Labrie was released on $15,000 personal recognizance bail and is scheduled to be arraigned on September 15 in the 6th Circuit District Division in Concord.

Hundreds of students pushed and crowded to fit into small, sweaty seminar classrooms on a sweltering first day of shopping week Tuesday, signaling that pre-term planning failed to accurately predict the number of students interested in enrolling in a number of courses once again.
Professor Caroline Light estimated that 150 students shopped her seminar class, Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality 1424: “American Fetish: Consumer Culture Encounters and the Other,” designed for 12 students.
“It was crazy,” Light said. “Originally my class was supposed to take place in a small seminar room in Boylston, so we moved upstairs to the Fong Auditorium, and it was packed.”
Light said that because the course is hands-on and intimate, she will have to implement a lottery, which means that the majority of students who shopped will not be able to enroll.
Though she said she was “delighted” to see so many people interested in her course, Light also noted that the often-great disparity between pre-term planning numbers and the actual number of people who shop courses points to larger issues in the shopping week system.
“It doesn’t really do anyone a great service to have these boom and bust cycles where classes can be really large or tiny,” she said.
Angela Lee ’14-’15, who shopped the course and hopes to enroll, said that it was “unfortunate” so many people wanted to take a course that could not accommodate them.
“I was shocked,” Lee said. “I got there ten minutes early and already the classroom was filled and people were loitering outside.”
Another course, Ethical Reasoning 30: “The Just World,” attracted around 140 students, according to professor Mathias Risse. Pre-term planning predicted only 59 students would take the course, Risse said.
“We also all know from experience that the number of people showing up on the first day is not a conclusive indicator of who will come back,” said Risse, who has been teaching at the University for 12 years. “I have given up making any predictions about enrollment,” he added.
Louis Menand, whose course, Humanities 10a: “The Humanities Colloquium: Essential Works 1,” saw 198 students apply for its lottery, said he had to cap his course at 90 even though he had only planned to enroll 75 students.
“Preterm planning has always been way off,” he said, adding that he plans to increase section sizes in the course.
Likewise, 75 students crowded their way into Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 11: “Poetry Without Borders,” which enrolled about fifteen students last year, according to professor Stephanie Sandler.
This increase in interest comes after UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 sent an email to undergraduates in May jokingly encouraging them to mark the course on their pre-term planning in response to the announcement that the Q Guide would no longer display difficulty ratings.
Although Goffard said he believes the email was sent as a joke, he did acknowledge that the email may have drawn more people to consider shopping the course.
“I think it’s most plausible to explain the large increase by the fact that we did increase attention and focus on that class,” Goffard said.
He added, “I think most people did see, including ourselves, [the email] was meant to be somewhat humorous…. In all seriousness, we did not want people to sign up for that class in large numbers as a protest.”

Romance Languages and Literatures professor Nicolau Sevcenko, a prominent specialist in Brazilian cultural history, died on Aug. 13 in São Paulo, Brazil. He was 61.
A public intellectual figure in Brazil, Sevcenko wrote for Brazilian newspapers and magazines and appeared on talk shows. Brazilian public figures often sought his expertise and he offered advice on a wide array of issues.
“He studied not only literary texts, but he studied film. He studied media. He studied the way Brazilians constructed their own modern cultural identity,” said Josiah Blackmore, a Romance Languages and Literatures professor.
Sevcenko was born in 1952 on the coastal city of São Vicente. His parents were Ukrainian immigrants fleeing the chaos following World War II. The family ultimately settled in São Paulo.
Trained in both history and anthropology, he received both his bachelor’s and doctorate degrees from the University of São Paulo.
Sevcenko’s love of Brazilian culture stemmed from the vitality he found in Brazil, according to Mary M. Gaylord, a professor of Romance Languages and Literatures.
Sevcenko looked at music and art as “an organic part of cultural history,” Gaylord said.
Sevcenko came to Harvard as a visiting professor in 2003 and secured a permanent position in 2009. He considered Harvard and Cambridge the intellectual crossroads of the world, according to Blackmore.
His colleagues remembered his talent of connecting with an audience, no matter the size or age group.
“From the very first time I heard Nicolau lecture during his initial interview here, I was struck by his unique combination of brilliance and humanity,” Gaylord wrote in a letter to Sevcenko’s wife, Cristina Carletti, Tuesday. “His imagination was matched only by his ability to connect with his audience.”
Gaylord provided a portion of the letter to The Crimson.
Blackmore and Gaylord recalled that Sevcenko could find something unique in everyone he met.
“For him, everyone had a very special talent or ability,” Blackmore said.
Sevcenko strived to live in the moment, said Virginie Greene, chair of the Romance Languages and Literatures Department, who is on leave for the fall term.
“He very much liked living in the present, both in his work and in his way of being, his way of looking at Harvard.” Greene said. “He was looking at how fast we were doing everything and thought we should take more time to do things here at Harvard. I think he was right.”
Sevcenko’s colleagues said he will be greatly missed.
“Thoughtful words from Nicolau always felt like a breath of fresh air,” Gaylord wrote. “He had a gentle but powerful way of cutting through jargon and stuffiness, a way of being real.”

Although Harvard’s new sexual assault policy lacks an explicit affirmative consent clause, Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX officer, argued Tuesday that Harvard’s definition of sexual harassment is broad enough to encompass the cases covered by affirmative consent policies at other schools and adequately protect victims.
Speaking to a crowd of roughly 90 administrators, staff members, and students at the first of several open meetings about the new policy, Karvonides took questions and addressed the concerns of advocates who have called for the University to define consent as an affirmative agreement. Under such a standard, both partners would need to actively communicate a willingness to participate in sexual activity.
Harvard’s new University-wide policy and procedures, which took effect at the start of the term and established a new office to investigate allegations of sexual harassment, do not explicitly define consent. Instead, the policy describes sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault, as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.” That wording has drawn criticism from some student leaders.
Multiple questions from audience members on Tuesday addressed affirmative consent, and after the meeting, Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, an organizer for the advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said the “unwelcome” definition is ambiguous and “doesn’t achieve the clarity that affirmative consent policies” should.
Still, Karvonides said that under Harvard’s sexual harassment definition, based in the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights’ past interpretations of Title IX, “the absence of a ‘no’ does not mean a ‘yes.’”
“Our language—it’s a little bit more complex, it’s a little bit more nuanced, but it gets us to the same place, and it brings us further,” said Karvonides, responding to an undergraduate’s concerns about the “unwelcome conduct” phrasing. “We’ve covered all of that with what we have here.”
She added that the policy, while generally based in the anti sex discrimination law Title IX, goes further than federal law requires because it covers harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity as well.
Other questions at the open meeting focused on how the accused, if determined to have violated the policy, will be disciplined. Under the revised procedures, the newly-created Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution—which administrators are calling the ODR—will determine if the policy was violated. Previously, administrators at individual schools carried out their own investigations. Under the new system, individual schools will still hand down sanctions through their own disciplinary processes, a fact that prompted concern from several people at the meeting.
Karvonides said the ODR will not prescribe a recommended set of disciplinary sanctions to the different schools, leading some to question how consistent punishments will be across the University.
Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 spoke up at the meeting to raise a perennial concern of student leaders. Mayopoulos complained that students were not adequately included in the policymaking process and expressed frustration with how Tuesday’s event was publicized.
Undergraduates received word of the meeting through emails from various College administrators on Tuesday, and Mayopoulos said he did not learn the meeting time until that morning.
“No student I spoke to today was aware that the meeting was happening before these emails were sent,” Mayopoulos said after the event. Pointing to the many administrators and faculty members present at the meeting, he added, “clearly, they were aware of it, while most students were not.”
The new policy comes into effect roughly a year and a half after Karvonides joined Harvard’s administration in March 2013. In May of that year, she convened a working group to examine the University’s existing sexual assault policies. No students sat on that group, whose work culminated in the policy and procedures that administrators unveiled this summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 3, 2014, at 2:00 p.m.
Part II of a five-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2018, based on data collected by The Crimson in an email survey conducted in the month of August. Part I ran on Tuesday.
Last February, the College reported a 38 percent increase in requests for application fee waivers by prospective members of the Class of 2018, suggesting “even more economic diversity for the incoming class than for previous ones.”
The Harvard Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2018, however, finds indication that the class is no less disproportionately wealthy than last year’s. Seventy-two percent of respondents reported that their annual family income exceeds $80,000. The median American household income is just over $51,000, according to U.S. Census data.
The survey also reveals several potential reasons for why this imbalance exists. Students whose annual family income exceeds $500,000, for example, on average score higher on their SATs and are more likely to hire private admissions counselors. They are also more likely to have a parent who attended the College and to be admitted early compared to their lower income peers.
The email survey, conducted by The Harvard Crimson, was sent to all incoming freshman on Aug. 6 and closed on Aug. 28. Of the 1,667 students in the incoming freshman class, 1,172 filled out the survey, representing around 70 percent of the class. The Crimson did not adjust the survey results for any possible selection bias.
The Thick Envelope
Reflecting the fact that very few applicants gain admission to the College, most respondents reported exceptional standardized test scores and grade point averages.
Respondents reported taking the SAT on average 2.14 times and scored an average composite score of 2237, a figure consistent with last year’s average and placing the average surveyed College student in the top 1 percent of all SAT test takers, according to CollegeBoard. Around 8 percent of respondents reported a perfect 2400 score on their SAT.
Surveyed students from Northeastern states tended to perform better on their SATs, with an average score of 2253. On the other hand, students hailing from outside of the United States averaged the lowest test scores based on reported data, obtaining an average of 2197 on their SAT exams.
Eighty-three percent of respondents said that Harvard was their top choice, and, on average, students applied to 6.7 schools and were accepted to 4.6 . Sixteen percent of surveyed students said they used a private admissions counselor.
Thirty percent of surveyed female students said that they considered the culture and policies surrounding sexual assault when deciding whether to go to Harvard, while only 8 percent of male respondents said the same.
The highest number of schools any respondent applied to was 35, and the highest number of acceptances was 30.
Fifty-six percent of respondents said they were admitted to Harvard early, a nearly six percentage point increase compared to last year’s survey.
About 74 percent of students who indicated that they are legacy students, meaning they have one or more parents who attended the College, were admitted through early admissions.
Legacy students on average reported higher test scores than their non-legacy peers. The average SAT for self-reported legacy students was 2296, while the average score for the rest of the survey’s respondents was 2237. The average GPA for legacy students was a 3.9, compared to a 3.93 average GPA for non-legacy respondents.
Average SAT scores, similar to last year, varied by ethnicity. Asian respondents reported the highest average SAT score of 2305, while black and Hispanic or Latino students reported the two lowest averages, at 2157 and 2201, respectively.
Based on the survey’s results, white students appear to enjoy key advantages when it comes to the admissions process. Eighty-eight percent of legacy students, for instance, reported their ethnicity as white. About 17 percent of white respondents reported that they hired private admissions counselors, a higher rate than all groups by Asians.
Money, Power, Admissions
Following a widely documented trend in college admissions, 67 percent of respondents who said their family makes more than $500,000 annually were accepted through early admissions, compared to just 35 percent of those students who said their family income is lower than $40,000.
Students whose families make more than $500,000 annually hired private admissions counselors nearly four times as much as those students whose families earn less than $40,000. Additionally, this year, 32 percent of those students in the highest income bracket hired private counselors, compared to 22.6 percent last year.  Students whose families make less than $40,000 per year attained, on average, SAT scores 80 points lower than those whose family income exceeded $500,000 per year.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview last October that part of the reason that an income gap exists in early admissions is that students from less privileged economic backgrounds generally do not have access to the same resources in the college admissions process as their more wealthy peers.
“What tends to happen with people of modest economic backgrounds is they tend to disproportionately attend schools where there are fewer counselors per student. Many also attend schools where there are fewer teachers per student,” Fitzsimmons said.
Bigger, Faster, Stronger
Eleven percent of respondents said that they are coming to Harvard as recruited athletes.
Non-athletes reported an average SAT composite score of 2256, while the average reported SAT score for athletes was 2068. Non-athletes estimated their IQs, on average, to be nearly five points higher than that of athletes.
Recruited athletes reported a higher family income, on average, than that of the total surveyed class, with only 1.6 percent of recruited athletes reporting that their families make less than $40,000 per year. Eighty-three percent of athletes identified as white or multi-racial.
Offsetting College Costs
Fifty-four percent of respondents said that they receive financial aid from the College, marking a slightly lower figure than the nearly 60 percent of students that the Admissions and Financial Aid office reports receive need-based aid.
Fifty-four percent of respondents who live in urban areas said they receive financial aid, while 52 percent of those who hail from suburban areas and 73 percent from rural areas reported the same.
Of those receiving financial aid, 29 percent of respondents said they attended private school, while 70 percent attended public school. Six tenths of a percent selected the home-schooled or “other” option. Eleven percent of the people who said that they receive financial aid also said they are recruited athletes, a figure that almost exactly matches the proportion of recruited athletes in the class overall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 3, 2014, at 8:50 p.m.
Acknowledging the burden of rising healthcare costs, the University announced Wednesday afternoon that it will significantly restructure the benefit plans it offers to non-union employees, cutting premiums but introducing, for the first time, a deductible at the point of care.
As required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the various health plans sponsored by the University will continue to cover 100 percent of costs associated with preventative care, such as regularly scheduled doctor visits, which will carry the same $20 co-payment they do now. Emergency room visits will now incur a copayment of $100, up from $75.
If required care extends beyond routine visits and tests, individuals insured by Harvard will now pay a $250 deductible out of pocket before their insurance kicks in. After the $250 threshold—or up to $750 for a family—the University benefit plans will shoulder 90 percent of the costs, and the patient 10 percent. This cost sharing, called coinsurance, is also new to the Harvard plans.
“The aim is to curb cost growth and, just as important, to improve our incentives for becoming better consumers of health care so that more significant changes can be averted in the longer term,” wrote Marilyn Hausammann, Harvard’s vice president for human resources, in a letter to those affected by the changes. She noted that health benefits account for about 12 percent of the University’s budget.
Though the introduction of a deductible is one of the most significant changes, the new plans feature a number of alterations that may benefit the insured. In materials distributed on Wednesday, the University said that it expects premiums across the board to be lower under the new plans. For lower salaried individuals, there were be a reimbursement program to cover some costs incurred at the point of care, and premiums will be tiered based on salary.
The out-of-pocket maximum—the most an insured patient or family will have to pay for care each year—will also be lowered, to $1,500 for individuals and up to $4,500 for an insured family. After this threshold is met, the University will pay 100 percent of further costs.
“This is a more generous plan than most employers offer,” read a selection in the materials discussing the out-of-pocket maximum. “It provides Harvard faculty and staff with a simpler way to understand which expenses count towards the maximum they will be expected to pay and provides an important financial safeguard.”
Additionally, the University will create a new high-deductible, low-premium plan for those who do not anticipate significant healthcare costs. That plan will include a health savings account to which the University will make an initial contribution—$500 for an individual or $1,000 for a family—as well as a deductible of $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for an insured family for in-network care. The out-of-pocket maximum for the high-deductible plan will be $3,000 annually for an individual and up to $6,000 for families for in-network care.
Another change comes in dental coverage, which will no longer end after a $3,000 annual threshold is met.
Michael E. Chernew, a professor at Harvard Medical School and a member of the University Benefits Committee, which was involved with the changes, praised the dental plan in a press release.
“The new dental plan still has cost sharing, but we’ve added a catastrophic component to provide additional coverage.”
To be eligible for a University health plan, employees must work at least 17.5 hours per week or earn at least $15,000 per year, with some exceptions. The plan includes faculty members.
As is typical of institutional insurance plans, the headline costs listed are for care received in the insurer’s network of providers. Harvard’s insurance plans support care at providers outside of the network, but at a higher deductible burden, greater out-of-pocket maximum, and lower coinsurance rate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the 2013 season, the Harvard men’s water polo team had a complete turnaround, going 3-8 during the first 11 games and 8-3 in the final 11, giving the Crimson its first winning season since 2004. This year, Harvard looks to capitalize on the momentum from the second half of the 2013 campaign.
Losing only two seniors and maintaining the team’s top scorers, the Crimson should have the firepower to uphold its offensive domination, while focusing on improving its defense and conditioning.
“We historically have had great offense, we’ve had great shooters with one of the best 2-meter men in the country, [junior] Ben Zepfel, and our drivers are top notch as well,” senior utility Max Murphy said. “So what we are really focusing on this year and what really makes us a championship team is our cohesive defense. We’re focusing on having a very hard press at the beginning and that other teams can’t get the ball around easily.”
New assistant coach Cassie Churnside, who helped lead Stanford women’s water polo to two national titles in 2011 and 2012, has led the charge in conditioning changes to make the team both faster and better able to put pressure on opponents. Churnside has introduced new swim sets to improve the team’s stamina so that Harvard can more effectively return the ball to its scorers on the other end of the pool.
Harvard once again has a very young team, with Murphy being the only senior on this year’s squad.
Leading the attack is junior co-captain Zepfel. The Newport Beach, Calif., native, who was an All-American Honorable Mention, finished with 52 goals, three assists, and 23 steals last season. Junior attacker Noah Harrison joins in the offensive barrage, chipping in a team-high 70 goals last season.
This year’s sophomore class will be an integral part to the Crimson’s success, with all three members of the Class of 2017 filling out the top five scorers on the team. Attacker Joey Colton dominated in assists, notching a team-best 57 while also scoring 46 goals. Viktor Wrobel and Dan Stevens joined Colton in tallying 30-plus goals last season, and each will look to make an even bigger impact, now with a year of collegiate water polo experience under his belt.
With many of the team’s top players returning, the newest members of the team—freshmen utility players Colin Chiapello and Harry Tafur and attacker Stephen Cho—will have a chance to adjust to the world of collegiate sports before being thrust into the spotlight.
“They can come in and be freshmen and kind of make their adjustments going from high school water polo to college water polo,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “They don’t have to come in and be impact players. They can spend some time to figure out what their role is because of the roster that we brought back from last year.”
Harvard will play six home matches this year, with four of them against conference opponents. The team has had success in front of its home fans, going 7-1 at Blodgett last season.
After ending on such a high note in 2013, the Crimson has even higher expectations for this year. For Minnis, every match is of equal importance, even the upcoming preseason games, as they will help the team improve before division play. The ultimate goal of the season, however, is to win at the CWPA Northerns at MIT and the CWPA Easterns at Navy in November.
“The Eastern championships, which is our final playoff tournament, is really our main goal this year,” Murphy said. “The winner of the Eastern Championships goes on to the NCAA tournament in California. That’s something we are definitely striving for and setting our eyes on this year.”
Harvard kicks off its season this weekend at the Princeton Invitational, where it will face Diablo Valley College and Bucknell on September 6, and Johns Hopkins on September 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quite a few Harvard students, both current and graduated, had busy summers in the sports world that exists outside of Cambridge, Mass. While Crimson athletes across many sports made news this summer, basketball, football, and crew all had multiple current and former athletes making headlines.
Three former stars of Lavietes Pavilion will be taking their talents to Europe next season to continue their basketball careers after graduation. Point guard Brandyn Curry ’13-’14 and forward Kyle Casey ’13-’14 of the men’s basketball team both signed with European teams this August, following in the footsteps of shooting guard Christine Clark ’14 who signed in early June.
Clark, who is fourth all-time on the scoring list for Harvard and led the Ivy League in points per game last season, has signed with Lavezzini Parma, which plays in Italy’s A1 league.
Casey, a four-time All-Ivy Selection who finished his career third on the all-time blocks list for the Crimson, will play for Helios Domzale, a member of the Premier A Slovenian League. Curry, meanwhile, has agreed to terms with SPM Shoeters Den Bosch. The two-time Bob Cousy Award Nominee will bring a steady hand to the point for the SPM Shoeters, which plays in the Dutch Basketball League.
While the Harvard men’s and women’s basketball teams watched some of their 2014 graduates go abroad, the football team saw some of last year’s seniors agree to contracts with teams closer to home. Three players—tight end Cameron Brate, defensive lineman Nnamdi Obukwelu, and long snapper/tight end Tyler Ott—were signed as undrafted free agents this summer. Undrafted free agents are able to compete during training camp in hopes of earning a roster or practice squad spot.
Brate finished his career with the Crimson with 18 touchdowns, an impressive number for a tight end and one that puts him at fourth all-time for Harvard. The tight end was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers earlier this summer, and has now earned a spot on the practice squad.
Obukwelu, a three-time All-Ivy selection, was signed by the Indianapolis Colts before also eventually earning a spot as a practice squad player. Ott, who served as Harvard’s long snapper for four years, was signed by the New England Patriots to compete with Danny Aiken at long snapper before being released on August 18th.
In current Crimson player news, linebacker Zach Hodges has racked up multiple preseason honors, including being named to the Butkus Award Watch List, which is given to the nation’s best college linebacker of any level. Senior offensive lineman Nick Easton joined Hodges in being named to the FCS preseason All-American team.
While summer may be considered the offseason for many football and basketball players, a few Harvard rowers spent their break competing for their countries in both the World Rowing Championships and the U23 World Rowing Championships.
10 current members and one graduate joined lightweight assistant coach Linda Muri at the U23 World Rowing Championships, with four competing for the US.
Andrew Campbell ’14 raced in the lightweight single sculls, while sophomore Chris Wales rowed in the lightweight double sculls. Fellow sophomore Chase Buchholz competed in a coxless four, and senior Alexander Bonorris was chosen in the lightweight four. Campbell won gold in the event for the second year in a row, backing up his gold in 2013 that made him the first ever American to win the event. Alexander Bonorris and the lightweight four won the B final at the U23 World Championships, good for seventh overall.
Though the US was the bestrepresented country by Harvard rowers at the U23 World Championships, a few Crimson athletes represented other nations. Senior Nicolai Astrup-Wiik
competed against Campbell in the lightweight single sculls, as Astrup-Wiik rowed for Norway for the third year in a row. Sophomore Juri-Miik Udam, meanwhile, competed in a single for Estonia.
Team Canada had two Crimson sophomores in its lightweight four, as Lucas Farewell and Samuel Frum both rowed against their teammate Bonorris in the race. Meanwhile, two senior heavyweight rowers, James Medway and Charlie Risby, competed together in the Australian men’s eight against a field that included sophomore James Johnston in the Great Britain eight.

A new year, a new dean, a new social media challenge! Dean Khurana, Harvard’s first instagramming dean, has challenged #Harvard2018 freshmen to an Instagram Scavenger Hunt. The dean has been posting photos with captioned clues on his 'gram (on which he has over 800 followers, and an impressive 93:1 follower: following ratio!), and is asking Harvard freshmen to take photos in front of the various spots. Participants can mark their responses to the challenge using the hashtag #HCSH2014.
With aesthetically pleasing shots of campus landmarks such as Annenberg, the Museum of Natural History, and the Quad, the challenge will hopefully help the lost and confused freshmen become a little less lost and confused. More likely, it will further bewilder the 2018ers who had yet to discover that there was a building on campus containing an installation known as the “Great Refractor,” (actually, we didn’t know that either) or that the Dean of Freshmen, Thomas A. Dingman ‘67, lives so close to them!
Good luck to all accepting the challenge and check out our Instagram advice if you need some help. We’ve seen your grams. You need it.

College students can barely take care of themselves, much less their pets. This hasn’t stopped a few brave souls though—read their horror stories, their delights, and that one time they brought their mouse to Lowell Lecture Hall in a Starbucks cup. Read the first post in this miniseries here:
Flyby: When or how did you first get your pet?Pet owner: I caught him outside of Annenberg. It was cold already. Football season. I was coming out of Annenberg at 7 p.m. and I saw him scurry by the bike racks out of corner of my eye and jumped at him. I’ve always had this predator instinct to chase things...and put them in a cage to keep them. It was me duking out a mouse for like ten minutes.
Eventually Dillan stopped. I had a greasy Ziploc bag that I had used to steal chicken from Annenberg. So I put my hand in it and I creeped over to him and I was a body’s length away. It was long enough so I could lunge. So I did that, real swift, then I did the pooper-scooper motion to get him inside of the bag.
I was headed to acapella rehearsal, it started at eight, it was 7:49 p.m. and I had the mouse in a Ziploc bag. I didn’t have time to go to my room before rehearsal and I was afraid he was going to chew through the bag, so I found a Starbucks cup in a trash can on the way to Lowell Lecture Hall and put him in there and took him to rehearsal.”
Flyby: How easy was it raising a pet? How did you find time to take care of them?Pet owner: He was really easy to take care of. I would take sunflower seeds and all the things that you put in your oatmeal at breakfast. Harvard actually paid for Dillan’s food.
When I brought him into the room my roommates were disgusted. I had to sit down and do a CDC search and figure out what diseases he could possibly carry. My roommates were like ‘Get this rat out of here,’ and I was like ‘You can pry this rat out of my cold dead fingers. I am keeping this mouse.’
 It was a big debate whether they had the right to tell me what I could have in my own personal space. I have a double, so in order to keep the mouse, my roommate had to agree to actually keep him. His girlfriend loved Dillan, so when she joined my side, he had to join my side, too. We bought him a cage, my roommate and his girlfriend went to Petco and bought a little cage and a little running wheel and some bedding. It was actually kind of scary because at night the only thing he would do was gnaw on the bars on the cage. He would always try to escape. Whenever he did anything, he was trying to escape.
Flyby: Was it hard keeping your pet a secret?Pet owner: I didn’t try. I told everyone. I told my proctor. I’m pretty sure my Dean knows, too.
Flyby: Who did you like more—your roommates or your pets?Pet owner: I liked my mouse better than the one roommate that didn’t like my mouse. Since he was the enemy of my friend, he was my enemy.
Flyby: How’d you lose your pet?Pet owner: He escaped. The first time he got loose—it happened twice—I  blamed my roommate. I made enemies in the entryway. My entryway-mates plotted to kill Dillan. It was me protecting my child at that point. Then, the night I was leaving for Thanksgiving break. I heard a noise near the heater. He was living inside the heater in my room. It took me 3 hours to get him. I chased that mouse all around that room. I got him the first time and put him back in the cage, but when I got back after Thanksgiving break, he was gone. I never saw him again.
Next up in this series: "It rolled over on its back and the hedgehog had eaten out its face and brains."

The best part of this year will not be Dean Khurana’s Instagrams, renovated Lev, or more bearable weather—if you haven’t checked out the HUDS grill yet, you should right now.
HUDS has definitely been listening “Fancy” by Iggy Azalea because their food is going gourmet. The new items include not one, but two vegan burger options that sound edible: a Ruby Beet and Kale Vegan Burger and a Sweet Potato and Black Bean Vegan. Other new items include a Vermont Cheddar Cheese Sandwich (we’re too good for plain grilled cheeses now), omelettes for dinner, and fries whenever you want. Finally, if you ever get bored, we now have a weekly special. Last week was a salmon burger, this week is bleu cheese burger with bacon. At this rate, we might even have lobster in a few months.
There are, of course, are some casualties in this new makeover. There are some items to which we say good riddance: The Chik’n Patty and the Boca burger—what was even in that? Some things we’ll miss more, like the bean burrito and the old turkey burgers—the new ones just don’t cut it.
Thank god that we have somewhere to turn to when our favorite swai runs out.
