After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four musicians formed a neat diamond, echoing the black-and-white harlequin floors of the Leverett House dining hall. Wordlessly, they took their places behind stands and were poised to play. Around them, students and professors, aglow from a festive dinner and lively conversation, set down their forks—the crumbs of spiced pumpkin tarts and dregs of wine could wait—and prepared to listen.
The evening of music and merriment, which took place on Nov. 21, featured an annual collaboration between the Blodgett Artist-in-Residence Program and Leverett House. The Parker Quartet, the string ensemble in residence since fall 2013, played three selections: the first movement of Joseph Haydn’s 1796-97 “Quartet in D,” Tan Dun’s 1986 “Eight Colors for String Quartet,” and several movements from Ludwig van Beethoven’s 1825 “String Quartet No. 13 in B-flat Major.” Throughout the evening, these pieces featured breezy and thought-provoking conversations among the violins, Daniel Chong and Ying Xue; the viola, Jessica Bodner; and the cello, Kee-Hyun Kim.
“Eight Colors for String Quartet” resounded in bursts of noise and moments of silence that left listeners abuzz at their tables. The piece played with a variety of themes and sounds, including melodies from Peking Opera, traditional Chinese instruments, and naturalistic clicks and clinks of sticks and rocks. During one section, notes fizzled from the strings like the skinny, squiggly fireworks that propel themselves, upward and upward until they dissipate into dust. During another, quite different, section, the quartet sounded like an indie bluegrass group, plucking the strings without using bows and punctuating the music with modern, folksy slaps on their instruments.
Ria P. Shah, a junior at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, described the piece as dark and eerie.
“It was unpredictable,” Shah added. “I couldn’t tell where the piece was going.”
Echoing Shah, Leverett resident Brad I. Riew ’18 said “Eight Colors for String Quartet” showcased the Parker Quartet’s versatility. “The second piece was awesome, really tactile,” Riew said.
The Parker Quartet’s rendition of Haydn’s piece built from a soft and slow introduction to mounting, sweeping classical tones. The sound thrummed around the dining hall, sometimes darting quickly like a hummingbird and at times careening gently like a paper airplane, fluctuating between tempos before landing with a resonant unity. Introducing the piece, Bodner, the violist, said the selection was full of wit and beauty. Violinist Xue agreed. “It’s always so nice to play in this hall, especially for Haydn,” Xue said to the audience after the number concluded.
The final piece of the evening, the Beethoven quartet, showcased the group’s ability to work with simultaneous, overlaid melodies and to create an intimate atmosphere that welcomed their listeners. The quartet’s rendition channeled the waltzy, very quaint pastoral sound of German dance music and delivered the intricacies of an upbeat piece whose grand-and-swooshing finish cloak more sorrowful undertones.
Manjinder S. Kandola, a resident tutor in Leverett, noted how conflicts do not seem to resolve in Beethoven’s pieces, while the Haydn selection ended on a happy note. “I was interested in the order of the pieces,” Kandola said.
“If we can create a good, balanced program, it gives people a lot to think about, hopefully,” Bodner said.
Kim, the cellist, said he appreciated the opportunity to act as music ambassadors, bringing music into the Houses for seasoned performers and non-musical peers alike. “Especially coming to your dining space, we can make it less formal and break down those barriers, and make you want to listen to more,” Kim said, adding that the Parker Quartet endeavors to cultivate that listening spirit. “We don’t try to play out,” he added. “It’s such an intimate genre. We challenge ourselves to play as soft as possible.”
The Blodgett Artist-in-Residence program, endowed by John W. Blodgett, Jr. ’23 and his second wife,  Edith Irwin Ferris, has been part of the Music department at Harvard since 1985. The Artists-in-Residence typically give a concert in Leverett House during the spring semester.
Prior to the concert, the evening’s festivities started in the Leverett House Faculty Deans’ residence. Students and professors mingled over plates of warm crab dip and skewered mini-meatballs, chattering about the end of the semester and the performance to come. In their hands, glasses of wine—and sparkling cider for the under-21 set—reflected the pinkish glow of tapered candles and the glint of a crystal chandelier.
Wearing his Leverett House “tuxedo” t-shirt, Faculty Dean and Physics professor Howard M. Georgi ’67 chatted with the guests and snapped photos of the reception. “This is one of our very favorite days,” Georgi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An overwhelming majority of Columbia’s graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants voted in favor of forming a union, making students at Columbia the first to successfully unionize at a private university following August’s National Labor Relations Board ruling.
Eligible Columbia students voted 1,602 to 623 in favor of unionization, according to the Facebook page of the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers. Per usual procedure, the National Labor Relations Board began the count quickly following the Dec. 7 and 8 election. Though there were some challenged ballots at Columbia—votes in which the eligibility of the voter was unclear—they did not delay the count as they have at Harvard, according to the Columbia Daily Spectator.
Harvard students voted Nov. 16 and 17, weeks before students at Columbia headed to voting booths, in the first union election since the August decision, which ruled that private universities must recognize graduate student unions. But ballot boxes have remained sealed since the election, as University officials and graduate student organizers work through an estimated nearly 1,000 challenge ballots.
Columbia will be the second-ever private university, after New York University, to have an authorized student union on campus. Columbia’s student union, the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers, will be the first academic union at a private university to include undergraduates. Union efforts at both Columbia and Harvard are affiliated with the UAW.
Graduate student organizers at Harvard celebrated Columbia’s vote as they wait to find out whether Harvard voters will also approve unionization.
Union organizer and Harvard Ph.D. student Sam Klug said he is “ecstatic” that the vote came down in the union’s favor by “an overwhelming margin.” Klug was an undergraduate at Columbia.
“Their petition to the NLRB made this possible for all of us, and I’m looking forward to joining them as a fellow member of the UAW to push this national movement in higher education forward once our votes are counted,” Klug said.
The count process at Harvard will begin Dec. 19 if there is enough time to finish the count that day, and if not, ballots will be counted on Dec. 22.
“Everyone’s certainly anxious to find out the results, but because of the larger number of challenge ballots in our election, we felt it was appropriate to resolve as many of these ballots as possible to ensure a fair process,” Klug said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 2017, for the 13th straight year, a defensive player will captain Harvard football.
At an end-of-season banquet, teammates voted junior linebacker Luke Hutton to be team leader for next season. Hutton will succeed cornerback and fifth-year senior Sean Ahern.
“I was a little overwhelmed at first,” Hutton said. “There’s so much history behind being captain…. I felt honored, more than anything.”
Hutton’s selection as the 144th captain marks the fifth year in the last seven in which a linebacker has led the Crimson. Most recently inside linebacker Matt Koran steered the 2015 squad to a 9-1 record and Ivy League title.
In 2016 Hutton topped Harvard with 56 tackles. Leading a depleted linebacker unit, he battled injuries himself early in the year but saw action in ever game. That performance landed Hutton on the All-Ivy second team.
“This year just magnified his passion,” said sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley. “He was hurt, and you couldn’t tell. He was always out there playing.”
Hutton’s finest game came in mid-October, when Harvard visited Princeton with first place on the line. The junior set a career high with 10 tackles, and on the first possession of overtime, he dove to break up a third-down pass.
That play, which forced the Tigers to kick a field goal, proved crucial. When the Crimson offense took the field, senior quarterback Joe Viviano marched to the two and plunged into the end zone for the Harvard win.
Hutton already has captain experience from his time at Lake Travis, a 2,400-person high school 20 miles outside Austin, Texas. As a senior, Hutton guided the football team to a 12-2 record.
“His love for the game is unmatched,” Shelton-Mosley said. “I’ve never met anyone who has the same passion that he does for the game. He’s able with that passion to keep us all accountable. It’s partly from being from Texas, I think.
Athleticism runs deep in the Hutton family. Hutton’s grandfather, Claude King, played football for the Houston Oilers, and Hutton’s uncle, Kelly Gruber, manned third base for the Toronto Blue Jays. In addition, the linebacker has an older brother, Jonathan, who played basketball at a pair of Texas colleges, Concordia Austin and Texas Lutheran University.
The banquet celebrated more than Hutton, however.
Teammates voted defensive lineman James Duberg as the most valuable player. A unanimous selection to the All-Ivy first team, the senior started every game and finished second on Harvard with four-and-a-half sacks. The 2016 season marked the third straight year in which Duberg has gained all-league recognition.
At the banquet, two other senior linemen grabbed awards, testifying to the upfront strength of the Crimson. Defensive end Langston Ward was recognized for his “dedication to the program,” and offensive lineman Max Rich earned the honor of “top interior lineman.”
Ward, a native of Spokane, Wash., tallied two sacks and 27 tackles. Meanwhile the 6’7” Rich led the offensive line, garnering attention from NFL scouts along the way.
“[The seniors] brought confidence and joy to the game of football and to our team that’s going to be hard to replace,” Hutton said. “But we have to have guys step up and accept the challenge.”
The final two prizes—the Joe Restic Award for “leadership, scholarship, and integrity” and the Robert F. Kennedy award for “desire and determination”—went to senior halfback Anthony Firkser and senior defensive back Sean Ahern, respectively.
For three seasons, Firkser tormented Ivy League defenses. As a sophomore and junior, he made the Ancient Eight second team despite playing behind NFL-bound tight end Ben Braunecker.
In 2016, as a senior, Firkser topped the program with seven receiving touchdowns. He went over 70 yards in six games and finished with 14 career scores, good for sixth in school history.
Ahern also saw serious action before 2016. As a sophomore, he emerged as one of the premier shutdown corners in the Ivy League and landed on the all-conference first team; as a junior, he repeated the feat.
Named the captain before the 2016 season, Ahern seemed poised for another dominant campaign. But an October shoulder injury ended his season. Even then, he ended with eight pass breakups—more than anyone else on the Crimson—and an All-Ivy honorable mention.
Next season, Hutton will replace Ahern as the official team leader. And if words mean anything, the junior linebacker seems ready to continue the values that previous captains have demonstrated.
“I looked up to Norman Hayes, Matt Koran and Sean Ahern, [the last three captains],” Hutton said. “I view them as leaders and incredible human being…. I know how much those three guys had an impact on me as a young player.”
