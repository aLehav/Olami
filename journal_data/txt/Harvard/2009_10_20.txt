After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent study conducted and released by Princeton sociology professor Thomas Espenshade has unearthed alarming racial disparities in the SAT scores of those admitted to elite American universities. Epsenshade’s research suggests that Asian Americans with perfect 1600s in 1997 were being accepted into top colleges at the same rate as whites scoring 1460 and African Americans scoring 1150—a disturbing 450-point discrepancy.
These statistics underline the outsized role that the color of one’s skin plays in the college admissions process and highlight the need for a fundamental transition of American affirmative-action policies toward a socioeconomically oriented program to supplant the race-based status quo.
Granted, due to the educational rewards of a culturally diverse learning environment in which students are forced to interact with students of different life experiences, there is still room for race to be a factor in the college admissions process. However, it should cease to hold the dominant place it currently enjoys. Universities should recognize that, while race-based admissions are an effective way to guarantee a certain measure of diversity, socioeconomic-based preference is a better way to guarantee fairness and a meaningful range of experiences among their student bodies.
It should be the goal of our nation’s universities to cultivate a society in which all are granted an equal opportunity to succeed, and there are few tools more potent with which to address inequality than higher education. And while race still plays a role in determining an individual’s prospects in current American society, socioeconomic status is an even more meaningful determinant.
President Obama’s daughters Sasha and Malia, for example, are far less in need of affirmative action than many white children living in poverty in the hills of Appalachia. The president himself has stated as much, declaring during the presidential campaign that affirmative action ought to operate “in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged aren’t getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more.”
Due to its role as a leader among universities, Harvard ought to take the initiative in refashioning affirmative action along the lines of Obama’s post-racial vision. Race-based affirmative action has played an important role over the course of its four-decade existence. But socioeconomic-based affirmative action is now the more effective way to fight for social justice.

Not all minorities are poor, and not all poor people are minorities. Proponents of socioeconomic affirmative action do not seem to give enough consideration to these two crucial facts in their well-meaning proposition that we transition to an admissions process that places greater emphasis on the socioeconomic background of candidates, while diminishing the importance of race.
Many will agree that, in its ideal form, the process by which a school admits students would be solely meritocratic. Schools today, however, are faced with the additional need to create a student body that is diverse in order to expose students to individuals that have had different but valuable intellectual and social experiences. In their desire to create an institution that is both meritocratic and diverse, some suggest that focusing on socioeconomic affirmative action is the best solution. In reality, though, this is far from the case.
The differences in the American life experienced between races are not simply the derivatives of wealth inequality. In fact, this wealth inequality is derivative to complex historical and social influences that cannot be corrected for simply with an evaluation of one’s social and economic status that devalues race. Socioeconomic affirmative action considers metrics that encapsulate only part of the experience of being a minority in America.
This fact is served by asking whether a minority and a white person of nearly identical social status and wealth are treated the same way by society. The answer to this question is seen all around us in very tangible forms, from reports of spikes in racial animus toward the president, as documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, to reports of continued racial discrimination in the workplace.
Certainly, racial equality has taken huge steps forward since half a century ago, when civil rights were not even constitutionally guaranteed for people of all ethnicities. But America is still not a post-racial society; the social networks of the majority are easily distinguishable from the networks that minorities have access to. Even everyday associations among individuals—or whom we associate with and why—are affected by a racial dynamic that cannot be ignored.
These racial and social forces influence the experience of minorities in an academic setting, and these different experiences have translated into academic achievement gaps that cannot be explained simply by applying a socioeconomic lens. Even the evaluative standards that we use for comparing different individuals, such as the SAT, offer insufficient metrics that may inherently discriminate against people of different races as well as socioeconomic backgrounds.
This is not to say that socioeconomic status has no value in the college admissions process. But the idea that it should be a substitute to or should be emphasized to the detriment of race-based affirmative action does little to solve the problem of maintaining diversity and meritocracy in schools–and may even aggravate it. Even in a society with no wealth inequality between races, the experiences between races will be different—how we perceive each other and various historical influences make that fact unavoidable.
The current system is by no means perfect, or even acceptable. But an admissions process with a reasonable level of racial affirmative action is desirable compared to a process that does not even attempt to correct for the fact that this is not a racially egalitarian society. A more race-blind affirmative action cannot be said to represent a truly just meritocracy; it does not fulfill the prerequisite that everyone, regardless of race, have access to the same resources and networks necessary to be an attractive applicant.
Of course, if we truly desire a college admissions process that does not fall victim to the inequalities of society, then we must make a concerted effort to mitigate this societal inequality. In achieving a society that is more egalitarian, we diminish or even eliminate the need for the current unsavory but necessary practices of discrimination in college admissions.

I don’t recall the exact moment that New York City became a part of my cultural consciousness, but for as long as I can remember, it’s existed there as a magical possibility. Growing up in Silicon Valley—where computer chips tend to garner far more excitement than “impractical” things like poetry—the idea of a place in which people gather round the ashtray Saturday nights to discuss Kafka’s lost manuscripts seemed incredible. Sure, that initial perception may have been laughably idealistic. And yet everything I watched, read, or heard about seemed to bolster it: Columbia-based Jewish literary criticism of the ’40s and ’50s, left-wing magazines like “Partisan Review” and “Commentary,” Strand Bookstore’s 18 miles of used and rare books, Beat memoirs of life on the Lower East Side, Woody Allen films like “Annie Hall” and “Manhattan.” Even now, movies like “Synecdoche, New York” tap into the mystique of the creative mind in a way that wouldn’t transfer if they were set elsewhere—Springfield, say, or Baton Rouge.
On deeper examination, that unshakable faith in New York’s cultural supremacy now seems to have had very little to support it. Most of these literary heroes are ghosts of the city’s past; no comparable, coherent intellectual movement or community of thinkers appears to exist in New York today. Publications are under threat, writers working in the city are paid little or nothing for their efforts, and the kind of lavish book-signing bashes that made Fitzgerald an alcoholic haven’t existed for decades. The question ought to be asked: Can New York still claim to be America’s intellectual hub at all?
The late Irving Kristol—intellectual godfather of modern neoconservatism and a pretty sharp cookie—didn’t think so. It’s why, after living in New York all his life, he decided in 1988 to jump ship. While the worlds of visual media, publishing, and finance were still thriving, he said, the “literary” intellectualism of the Trilling-Sontag variety (definition: “a dinner party can become acrimonious over such issues as Freudian analysis”) was extinct, or at least highly endangered. Kristol personally decided to head to Washington, D.C., the nation’s go-to location for public policy. But he argued that, “if you want an animated discussion of ‘large ideas’ about God, human destiny, Western civilization, modern art, the future of democracy, etc., you are better served in Cambridge, Massachusetts, or Chicago’s Hyde Park than in New York.”
Well, we’re here: And perhaps it’s true. The other week, I overheard two suits at 1369 Coffee House in Central frothing over their espressos about linguistics in the Basque region. (“You can’t just dismiss the Ligurian substrate hypothesis out of hand!”) Gentrification aside, the existence of world-class universities draws people unafraid to engage seriously with ideas large and small.
And yet that very university system may be part of the problem. Despite the city’s deep well of potential contributors, over half the pieces in the Nov. 2009 issue of the New York Review of Books are penned by professors, and several of the other writers are “scholars in residence” at colleges scattered across the U.S. The “New York” part of the publication’s title refers, I assume, merely to where it is edited, not to where it probes for material. New York-based careers sustained on writing alone—the path of independent-minded fellows like John Updike, Edmund Wilson, and John O’Hara gutsy enough to demand color pieces from magazine bigwigs and lucky enough to actually get them—have fallen off several levels in probability; many of America’s brightest minds are now holed up in grad programs, grading intro-level Expository Writing papers and picking away at theses on Milton in the hopes that tenure will nab them those same assignments.
Indeed, would-be writers have it particularly tough. One-time Greenwich studios now house upper-middle-class families; bohemian standby Village Voice has been bought out by New Times Media; college interns willing to work unpaid edge out older degree-holding peers insistent on a wage. Many successful journalists break into the business outside the Big Apple—either cub reporting at small-town papers or finding jobs abroad.
So if the “scene” is no longer in New York, where is it? Some argue that other cities like D.C. or Boston provide thriving alternative intellectual loci. (Legend has it that, challenged thusly in a newspaper editorial, one New Yorker fired off the epistolary missile: “May I suggest that the reason Boston is ‘overflowing’ with culture is the shallow vessel in which it is contained?”) Others propose that the very idea of an intellectual nucleus is outdated, with the collective energy of e-mail, blogs, and Twitter heralding a more diffuse power breakdown—in high-school-chemistry-speak, more plum pudding than Bohr model.
Yet NYC still exerts a pull. “I had a dim idea that if I walked the streets of New York by myself all night something of the city’s mystery and magnificence might rub off on to me at last,” wrote Sylvia Plath’s aspiring magazine assistant in “The Bell Jar”; for people passionate about reading and writing, New York is still the place to be. And if the statistics speak the truth, one-fifth of Harvard’s graduating seniors will end up there. They’ll have no trouble finding culture, from jazz bars to independent film screenings to a booming underground hip-hop scene. But the deeper theorizing about what that art means and why it matters is probably being done at places like Harvard—the place where they’ve come from, not the place they are now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the end of my first year here, I finally had some things figured out. The alphabet soup of campus acronyms had finally resolved into an intelligible language. I no longer got lost on my way to the Quad, and I knew exactly which dishes to avoid in Annenberg.
Nonetheless, as I returned for sophomore fall, one big question mark remained: my academic future. It was already time to pick a concentration, and it didn’t seem like Harvard offered one for me. I knew I wanted to study environmental issues—but not geology, plant biology, or the chemistry of the stratosphere. Rather, the questions that intrigued me were social and political, not scientific. I wanted to figure out how humanity’s philosophies, cultures, and political structures interact with the natural environment.
Environmental issues have both technical and sociopolitical dimensions. To be sure, we will need to develop new technologies and advance our scientific understanding of the natural world in order to tackle pressing concerns like climate change. Yet global warming arises not merely from chemical reactions and combustion engines, but also from the tangle of institutions, values, incentives, and social arrangements that give rise to these physical phenomena. For example, Americans drive so much not because driving is an inevitable aspect of human life, but because our particular market system prices oil a certain way, because our government favors highways over mass transit, because we inhabit a culture that views casual car use as morally acceptable, and so forth.
Addressing tricky environmental problems requires both scientific and sociopolitical innovation; we’re not just going to fix climate change (or any other major environmental issue) in a lab. Yet as I flipped through the Courses of Instruction that sophomore fall, I began to wonder whether I could pursue environmental studies here at all without spending the next few years in the Science Center. Harvard College’s environmental concentrations and courses were then, and still are, overwhelmingly scientific. Even this year, as “Green is the New Crimson” banners fly high, the University Center for the Environment’s guide to environmental studies lists fewer than 15 undergraduate courses that could be considered environmentally focused but not scientific. Equally significant is the lack of a relevant concentration, or of well-defined subfields and tracks within existing concentrations. In this and other ways, Harvard undergraduates intrigued by the social, cultural, political, and economic dimensions of environmental issues face steep odds.
As for me, after that demoralizing tour through the Courses of Instruction, I took a leap of faith and enrolled in Social Studies. Over the subsequent semesters, I’ve combined courses in social and political theory with the sporadic environmental offerings of other social science and humanities departments. In this way, I cobbled together a concentration that more or less worked for me. Now, looking back over my Harvard experience, I’m happy, but I fear I’m an exception. Without sufficient courses, or a clear track or concentration to follow, Harvard students with nonscientific environmental interests sometimes give up, study other issues, or (often unhappily) settle down in science-intensive concentrations like Earth and Planetary Sciences or Environmental Science and Public Policy.
For a school committed to environmental leadership, this is a big problem. Harvard’s commitment to institutional sustainability is second to none, and I’ve been privileged to take part in the university’s efforts to “green” our campus. But it’s long past time for time for Harvard to ensure that “Green is the New Crimson” rings true not only in its labs and dining halls, but also in Sever and Emerson. We need more relevant courses, better-defined environmental tracks within the social sciences and humanities, and perhaps even a nonscientific alternative concentration to ESPP. For guidance, we can look to programs at peer universities. UC Berkeley’s Society and Environment program, for example, offers well-defined focus fields in environmental policy and theory—and a wealth of relevant classes to match. And, of course, existing Harvard courses—like the excellent (if lonesome) environmental offerings in the history and anthropology departments and ESPP’s handful of nonscientific seminars—can help inspire the next generation of classes.
My vision of an environmentally friendly Harvard is of a school committed not only to reducing its ecological footprint, but also to producing the next generation of environmental leaders. This vision will never be a reality without big improvements to the College’s environmental curriculum. With these reforms, Harvard will not only better serve its discouraged nonscientists, but it will help answer what is perhaps the most pressing sociopolitical question of our time: how to build a more just and sustainable society in the years to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James Madison defined tyranny as the “accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands.”
Clearly, he was thinking of the Office of Student Life. It alone writes, enforces, and interprets rules for student clubs. And it uses these powers to bully clubs into visiting the Student Organization Center at Hilles. True, the SOCH has a noble purpose: to bring student organizations “into one space that can support their individual goals while sparking new channels of conversation and collaboration.” But this ideal is unattainable. You can’t force collaboration.
Yet bureaucrats try. Three years ago, David R. Friedrich, then the SOCH’s manager, vowed that Hilles would “become the place to be.” The SOCH boasted 40,000 square feet of space, including a cinema, a recording studio, and a coffee bar. Unfortunately, this fanfare was located 16 million square feet from Harvard Yard—a 15-minute walk. Despite Friedrich’s hopes, few students frequented Hilles.
So the SOCH tried to attract patrons. Sometimes, it dangled carrots. It broadcast shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” and screened films like “The Dark Knight.” In 2007, it offered an iPod to the student who created the best logo for the center. Unamused, one student suggested that the logo read: “SOCH: Miles away from anywhere.” Undeterred, the SOCH started a page on Facebook to incite enthusiasm. Today, it has 29 fans.
Other times, it wielded sticks. The SOCH tracks how often students swipe into their clubs’ offices and considers this data when reviewing applications for space each year. Two years ago, the SOCH, the jealous lover, felt vindictive. It refused to renew several clubs’ leases for lack of use, even though the spaces had no alternative occupants. “We’re not trying to fill up space if it’s going to be unused,” a student advisor to the SOCH told this newspaper.
Still, many students continue to ignore the SOCH, so the OSL now mandates that they trek to Hilles. To register on campus, clubs must attend “community meetings” and “workshops,” both of which take place in the SOCH. Maybe some students have formed friendships while watching slideshows in the penthouse, but many think these activities are a waste of time.
Consider the workshops. The intention is to build community, but the method is questionable. Club officers must attend two workshops among the several offered to register their organization. In one workshop, a moderator gave students Play-Doh because he didn’t expect them to pay attention for longer than 20 minutes—in a 90-minute class. During the program, students had to express three things about themselves without speaking or writing to imitate the barriers they face in forming a community. Really.
And that’s when you have options. Increasingly, the SOCH has restricted clubs’ flexibility. For instance, clubs used to list information about their meetings in the Calendar of Opening Days to attract freshmen. But this year, to be in the calendar, groups had to hold their events in the SOCH. It couldn’t accommodate all organizations at once, however, so clubs had to apply for rooms in groups of three. Many were turned down. The insistence that clubs use the SOCH inconveniences the students it is supposed to help.
Some requirements that the OSL places on clubs are reasonable. For example, groups must distribute to members information about laws against hazing. But, lately, the office’s grip on clubs has been too tight. The SOCH checks offices for decorations to ensure clubs are not using their offices solely for storage. And if a club disturbs the building’s feng shui—say, by putting a sticker on a wall—it pays a fine worth up to $70.
This campaign in behalf of the SOCH shows bureaucrats’ folly: Central planning would work if people didn’t muck things up. The OSL means well; it wants students to take advantage of the resources it spent much money preparing. But you can’t dictate that students create a community or teach leadership with Play-Doh. You can’t force people to live according to your plan, however well devised. Community forms organically.
The OSL should make community meetings and workshops voluntary for all clubs. And it should not require that groups hold events in the SOCH if they want their information in the Calendar of Opening Days. These requirements are obnoxious, and our bureaucrats should realize that, occasionally, the proactive approach is the wrong one. Sometimes, the right approach is minding your own business.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only five students showed up yesterday to voice their thoughts on life at Harvard at a meeting with the New England Association of Schools and Colleges reaccreditation committee, a group of officials from peer institutions conducting a holistic evaluation of the University.
While it is unlikely that the committee, led by Georgetown President John J. DeGioia, would deny Harvard reaccreditation, the process allows students to voice criticism and praise of the University. Philipp W. Grimm ’11, one of the four undergraduates—the fifth student was in graduate school—who attended the meeting, suggested that the low turnout was indicative of the Harvard administration’s inability to communicate successfully with the student body.
“The administration needs to rethink how it interacts with students,” Grimm said. “The dean sent out an e-mail to the student population, and only four of us showed up on our own free will.”
While attendees said they were not particularly upset by the elimination of hot breakfast on weekdays in the Houses—one of the more widely discussed budget cuts among students this year—they did express disappointment at the way the College administration handled budget cuts in the spring.
They criticized College officials for announcing the cuts during the May reading period and for notifying students of town hall meetings to discuss the cuts only minutes before they were scheduled to take place.
Other than their critique of the administration’s communication with students, however, the undergraduates who attended the reaccreditation meeting generally voiced positive feedback about life at Harvard.
The group unanimously supported the College’s House system and praised Harvard’s network of proctors, resident tutors, and peer advising fellows.
They also lauded the new General Education program, citing the new requirements’ simplicity and the improvement in the quality and relevancy of the courses.
“The things that people complain about seem very petty in perspective to the things that people complain about at other schools,” said Spencer B.L. Lenfield ’12 at the meeting.
Reaccreditation is a voluntary process that allows universities and colleges to show the public that they meet a variety of standards in areas ranging from academic programs to financial resources.
Many jobs and professional schools require applicants to have degrees from accredited institutions.
As part of the reaccreditation process, Harvard prepared a 141-page “self-study report” detailing the University’s structure, institutional history, recent changes, and current challenges.
The University was last reaccredited in 1997.
“I don’t think anyone in the process expects us to come back and say that Harvard shouldn’t be an accredited college,” said Yale Deputy Provost and committee member Charles H. Long. “We try to make it a constructive report rather than a report intended to find out huge gaps and places where the University has fallen apart.”
While no Undergraduate Council members attended the event, UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said that the Council provided student perspectives for Harvard’s reaccreditation report and sent officers to the reaccreditation committee’s opening dinner on Sunday.
The committee will remain on campus until Wednesday.

Harvard College Library—which administers Widener, Lamont, and Cabot Science Libraries—will keep standard business hours throughout the three-week January Term but will close most libraries during the preceding Winter Break due to staffing and budget constraints.
In the past, many of HCL’s libraries had stayed open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays during Winter Break, closing only for holidays.
Beth Brainard, an HCL spokeswoman, said that hours during J-Term will only be slightly reduced from those of past intersessions. Many senior thesis writers have traditionally stayed on campus to conduct research during intersession, and the College administration has said it will give those students preference to stay during this year’s J-Term as well.
Administrators have said that the number of students permitted to stay will be limited to roughly 1,000.
Harvard College Library has been forced to slash millions of dollars from its budget this past year, prompting the unit to reduce its workforce by roughly 100 employees and to consider drastic restructuring and consolidation of operations. The administration announced that the Quad Library would close for the coming year to cut costs this spring, and HCL has worked to centralize technical services and transition to greater use of digital materials as well.
In an Oct. 1 e-mail to staff in which she announced the J-Term hours, Nancy M. Cline, HCL’s chief librarian, wrote that the budget cutting process has left the library staff with “relatively little depth” and “less resilience for handling vacancies, absences, or unexpected volumes of work”—prompting the hours reductions this Winter Break.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Winter Break will run from Dec. 22 to Jan. 3 this year, and the J-Term will run from Jan. 4 to Jan. 24.
During the J-Term, all HCL libraries will stay open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, and Houghton Library and Widener Library will be kept open on weekends and certain weekday evenings as well. Brainard said that Houghton, which serves as Harvard’s primary repository for rare books and manuscripts, is often utilized by visiting scholars during academic breaks.
Brainard said that even though HCL hours are being reduced during January, all library staff will still be assigned the same number of hours during the J-Term as during the normal semester. Many staff members opt to take vacation days during January, she said, and others may be assigned to alternate shifts. Moreover, most student employees will not be working during that time, as they will not be on campus.
Cline, the HCL head librarian, noted in her e-mail that “January 2010 will not establish a firm pattern for all future years,” and that administrators would “evaluate the impact of the Library’s schedule on Harvard students, faculty and staff as well on outside researchers.”
Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer, who is heading up the College’s planning for the J-Term, said in an interview yesterday that she did not yet have concrete numbers on how many students applied for campus housing in January. The deadline for undergraduate applications was Oct. 15.
Ameer said that students would begin to find out whether they would be allowed to stay “by this week.”
“I think the faster the better, especially for people who have to make travel arrangements,” said Undergraduate Council President Andrea R. Flores ’10. “It is integral that they are notified soon.”

The College Events Board is scrapping the idea of headlining its Harvard-Yale pep rally with a star performer this year, saying that budget cuts and a desire to have a “more traditional” event have encouraged the CEB to highlight student organizations and the football team instead.
CEB Chair Kevin M. Mee ’10 and Vice-Chair James A. McFadden ’10 confirmed in interviews with The Crimson that the Nov. 19 pep rally would not feature a large performance as it did last year, when Girl Talk, a popular remix artist, took the stage—only to be prematurely forced off when a raucous crowd pushed against the stage, creating a safety hazard.
This year, the CEB is planning on holding several smaller events in the Yard that will last for a total of an hour, including an inter-House competition and performances from student dance clubs and the Harvard cheerleading team.
“It’s going to be a very fast-paced, one-after-the-other series of high-energy acts that’s going to serve in the place of one musical focus like we had last year,” said McFadden, noting that the CEB has not yet contacted student groups nor finalized the event schedule.
The changes to the pep rally come as the CEB—funded by the Office of Student Life—adjusts to College-wide budget cuts. But Mee said that while the reductions have limited the CEB’s ability to book big-name artists, the group would have chosen to have a scaled-down event regardless of financial concerns.
“I definitely think we would’ve moved in this direction, anyway, towards focusing back on the core focus of a pep rally, which was lost a little bit last year,” he said.
McFadden and Mee both said that a low-profile pep rally comes with its own unique challenges.
“The problem with the pep rally is that Harvard is not a school that’s big on school spirit, and many Harvard students are just not school spirit-type students,” said McFadden, who is also a Crimson editorial writer.
Nevertheless, he said that he is optimistic the event will have a good turnout.
“Even the average Harvard student who doesn’t care about Harvard football—who doesn’t care about Harvard sports, athletics, whatever—is still going to be excited,” McFadden said. “[They’ll] have a reason to be invested in the pep rally and want to come all the way from Mather, if you’re in Mather, to the Yard on a cold Thursday night. That’s our goal.”

Cambridge stylists, who say they already play a unique role in their clients’ lives, were honored at a reception last night in the Cambridge mayor’s office for being trained to respond to domestic abuse.
“Cut It Out Cambridge,” a program that trains stylists to be aware of signs of domestic violence in their clients, operates on the principle that victims of domestic abuse may feel more comfortable speaking to someone with whom they are already close than an authority figure.
The program began in five pilot salons in Cambridge earlier this spring.
“When you go to a hairdresser, it’s like going to a therapist,” said Alfred J. Mazzarelli, owner of one of the pilot sites, Alfred Harvard Square Salon.
“But you get your hair done, too,” he quipped to the audience at yesterday’s reception, which comprised city officials, salon owners, and public health workers.
Cut It Out Cambridge is a joint initiative of the Cambridge Women’s Commission and the Cambridge Public Health Department. According to Kimberly P. Sansoucy, the executive director of the Women’s Commission, the program was adapted from materials created by a national organization, Salons Against Domestic Violence.
“The salons were so hungry for information,” Sansoucy said. “Each of the five [pilot] salons we worked with...found a client who had experienced domestic violence.”
Salons that agree to participate in the program receive a free, hour-long training during which hair stylists learn how to recognize when a client has been abused.
The training—which is coordinated by employees of Transition House, a local women’s shelter, and The Guidance Center, which provides family support services in Cambridge—also informs stylists of available resources for abuse victims.
But agreeing to participate in the program does not obligate stylists to report suspected abuse to police or other authorities, Sansoucy added.
Instead, salon employees can help point clients to resources, Mazarelli said.
“Maybe if [a victim] isn’t ready to get help today, she’ll be ready to tell you tomorrow,” said Gail Council, who helps train salon workers for Cut It Out.
Mazzarelli, who has operated Alfred Harvard Square since 1983, said that his salon already has a close relationship with the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.
“People don’t know how to get out of certain things—they feel trapped,” he said.
Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons praised Cut it Out’s unconventional methodology, noting that the program could reach people who might not know where else to turn.
“Women in jeopardy get to a stylist more easily than another place that could offer help,” said Simmons, noting that getting haircuts is a part of many women’s routines.
Last night’s reception was one of several Cambridge events held during October in recognition of Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
The other events included an annual candlelight vigil for victims of domestic abuse earlier this month and a Domestic Violence Task Force presentation by the Cambridge Police Department last weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 75 years of family-run operation, Bob Slate, Stationer is seeking a buyer for its three stores in Cambridge—two in Harvard Square and one in Porter Square.
Founded by Robert Slate in the 1930s and handed over to his sons Justin and Mallory over 30 years later, Bob Slate has been a notable presence in Harvard Square, selling an eclectic mix of paper, cards, pens, and other stationery items.
As the Slate brothers prepare for retirement, they said they hope to find a new owner for the store who will continue in their footsteps.
“We are looking for a buyer who will honor the legacy, [and] respect the tradition of the stores,” said Mallory Slate.
As long-time members of the Rotary Club of Cambridge, the Slate brothers said they are also seeking a buyer who would continue to serve the needs of the Cambridge community.
“There are all kinds of stakeholders in Harvard Square,” said Justin Slate. “We want to make sure [the buyer] will maintain the independent character that Harvard Square should be.”
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, described the brothers as “incredibly generous.”
“They are very much involved in the community. They know their clientele and their clientele knows them,” she said.
“This has been a thoughtful consideration on their part as they transition into retirement,” she added.
In 2007, a Harvard University survey of Harvard affiliates voted Bob Slate the fourth most favorite retail establishment in the Square.
The brothers attribute the chain’s success to their hard work and focus on customer satisfaction.
“We’ve managed to reinvent the company three or four times,” said Mallory Slate.
“[We had] hard work and the capacity and ability to change when we needed to change,” he said.
Employees of the chain agreed, citing the customer loyalty of students and visitors who continued to order online after leaving the Square.
“We have customers come week in and week out,” said employee Caroline Roosevelt. “It’s about the human touch. It’s about the personality.”
The Slates are not the first business owners on Mass. Ave. to be selling their long-held family business of late.
Last year, bookseller Frank P. Kramer sold Harvard Book Store, which his father founded in the 1930s.

Secretary General of Amnesty International Irene Z. Khan said at the Harvard Book Store yesterday that poverty should be considered a serious human rights violation, rather than simply an economic status, a view that she said goes against traditional perceptions of poverty.
The Law School’s Human Rights Program brought in Khan, a 1979 Law School alum, to discuss her new book, “The Unheard Truth: Poverty and Human Rights.”
“We invited Irene because she is an incredibly influential member of the human rights field but also to celebrate the work of an alum in the field,” said Michael A. Jones, the communications director of the Program.
During her talk, Khan cited examples from around the world to support her main point—that economic and social rights are inextricably intertwined with political and civil ones.
Khan told the audience about Rosie, a South African woman who was beaten to death by her husband despite domestic violence safeguards in the country. Khan said that when she asked the police why Rosie did not get an order of protection from the courts, they responded that Rosie could not afford the bus fare to get to a court.
Khan said that people like Rosie “need a holistic and comprehensive view and approach to human rights. One right is not enough when their security and stability are threatened.”
In an effort to help those living in poverty, Khan said Amnesty International is broadening its scope to include prisoners of poverty and discrimination as well as “prisoners of conscience.” The organization just announced their “Demanding Dignity” campaign, which seeks to eradicate poverty by empowering people to reclaim their voice from those who repress them, Khan said.
Amnesty International USA’s Northeast Regional Director Joshua M. Rubenstein said that while the organization expects backlash in response to its new stance,  it is an important step in eradicating poverty.
“You need that civil and political right to defend the social and economic one. You need one to promote and defend the other,” Rubenstein said.
Both Khan and Rubenstein said they are also optimistic about the new political climate. Khan cited United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s endorsement of the Demanding Dignity campaign and his commitment to ending poverty by 2015 as a Millennium Development Goal.
“We now have an administration that is channeling the Roosevelt administration, which produced the belief that people have the rights to be free of fear and free of want. Fear and want stem from social and economic issues,” Rubenstein said. “It’s encouraging that there is this American tradition to draw from.”

Mark E. Richard—a tenured faculty member at Tufts University since 1984—has been named a professor of philosophy, effective July 1, 2010.
Richard specializes in the philosophy of language, philosophical logic, metaphysics, and epistemology.
Department Chair Sean D. Kelly said that Richard will join a department that includes faculty engaged in similar research, including Philosophy Professors Warren Goldfarb ’69, Bernhard Nickel, and Susanna Siegel.
“We’re expecting that Professor Richard will work together with others in the department, and in neighboring departments such as Linguistics, to bring Harvard to pre-eminence in philosophy of language,” Kelly said. “For at least the past 50 years, philosophy of language has been at the center of English speaking philosophy.”
Philosophy Professor Edward J. Hall said that hiring Richard may attract more graduate students studying Richard’s specialities to the school and could possibly expand the size of Harvard’s philosophy department, which Hall added is one of the smaller departments in the nation.
“His coming will make our department an even better place to forge ties with linguistics, which is something that Bernhard Nickel has already done,” Hall said. “If you reach a critical number of people specializing in an area, prospective graduate students start to take notice.”
Richard is perhaps best known for his work on the semantical analysis of propositional-attitude ascriptions—phrases such as “hope that” and “believe that”—and their connection to theories of direct reference, which posit that the meaning of a noun or noun phrase is that which it picks out in the world.
“Professor Richard is an original, rigorous, and creative scholar who has made important and impressive contributions to the philosophy of language,” said FAS Divisional Dean for the Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen in a press release yesterday. “His work ranks with the best being done in his field today.”
Given the University’s current fiscal situation, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has had to curb adding new faculty. Kelly said that even though it is “unusual” for academic departments to hire in this financial environment, he was “grateful” for the opportunity to bring Richard into the department.
“This was a search that had been going on for quite some time, though we recognize [that] that doesn’t distinguish it from some others that were canceled,” he said.
Richard is currently Lenore Stern Professor in the Humanities and Social Sciences at Tufts University. He received his B.A. from Hamilton College and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He is the author of three books, including his 2008 work entitled “When Truth Gives Out.”

Harvard men’s tennis had the spark necessary to get things started but didn’t have the deep reservoir necessary to win it all this weekend.
The Crimson traveled to Hanover, N.H. to attend the ITA Northeast Regional tournament, a competition featuring several fellow Ivy League opponents as well as other colleges from around the region. The team fared well in the opening rounds of the tournament, winning thrilling matches deftly.
“I thought we showed some really good promise,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “The freshman had performances that were really good, and we showed strength in different areas.”
Five players represented the Crimson at the tournament, and each one advanced past the two opening rounds of the singles tournament. The top performer overall for Harvard was junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans, who went as far as the quarterfinals but couldn’t muster another win to advance further.
Chijoff-Evans, ranked fifth in the competition, started out with a bye on Friday, and the extra rest translated to a comfortable win on Saturday over Princeton’s Chris Brosens, 6-4, 6-0. The rest would prove to be critical as the Crimson junior had a demanding tournament, also playing in the doubles bracket alongside freshman Christo Schultz. The pair made it as far as the semifinals but did not fair as well as their teammates, sophomore Alistair Felton and freshman Andy Nguyen, who won the doubles tournament yesterday afternoon after defeating Brown, 9-7.
“In the doubles tournament today, they really couldn’t play a much better, dominant tennis in the semifinal matches, but [Bosens] and [Chijoff-Evans] just faltered,” Fish said.
Chijoff-Evans’ fatigue could be attributed to the four singles matches he faced over the weekend. After beating Brosens, Chijoff-Evans faced stiff competition from Penn’s Adam Schwartz on Sunday morning, but ended up victorious after three sets, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.
Later that afternoon, the Plano, Texas native won another close contest against Cornell’s Jeff Fife, 7-6(13), 6-4. That earned him a chance to play in the quarterfinals­—­­the only Harvard player to make it that far.
The other four Crimson competitors had great starts but ended up bowing out early. Nguyen, Schultz, and Felton failed to make it past the round of 32, but freshman Joshua Tchan provided another highlight for Harvard as he reached the round of 16. On Sunday, Tchan lost to Marist’s Loic Sessagesimi, 6-3, 6-0. It was a short tournament for Felton, who was ranked 13, and for Nguyen, who fared well at last week’s tournament.
“Last weekend I won three straight matches, and I felt really good coming into this one,” Nguyen said. “The guy I played was really good, and even though I tried my best, I learned a lot.”
Yesterday morning, Chijoff-Evans faced Binghampton’s Sven Vloedgraven in a match where the Crimson junior came out with zeal but ran out of energy quick. Chijoff-Evans took the first set, 3-6, but failed to win the last two, 6-4,6-2.
“I don’t think anyone was playing a better set and half in the quarterfinals today than Alexei,” Fish said. “He got a little distracted however and showed signs of two grueling matches from [Sunday] that left him arms sore and felt that the tank was on empty. It’s a grueling tournament to win if you’re playing both singles and doubles.”
The team was without junior Aba Omodele-Lucien, who was sick and had to pull out of the tournament. Despite missing the veteran’s skills, Harvard came up with a solid performance at the tournament and has high hopes for the next one.
“We got a combination of a young and fairly experienced team,” Fish said. “The freshmen add new energy, and we reach a critical density where everyone wants to work at it, maintain good ability, and work well with each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Yale rivalry is about excellence. For all of their differences, the two schools share a commitment to being the best they can be and compete to be the best there is.
Perhaps a perfect example of this shared excellence comes from the two schools’ women’s soccer programs, which will meet again in New Haven at three today after their Oct. 3 match-up was postponed due to lightning. Harvard (6-5-1, 3-0 Ivy) and Yale (8-4, 3-0 ivy) are the only Ivy teams still unbeaten in league play.
“Their entire team is excellent,” Crimson Coach Ray Leone said of Yale. “They have great senior leadership and excellent forwards.”
Today’s game could eventually determine the Ivy title, which is Harvard’s only shot at making the NCAA tournament.
“It’s really going to come down to attitude and what we’re willing to bring to the table and what we’re willing to put on the line,” senior co-captain Lizzy Nichols said. “It’s going to come down to our need to win the game.”
That may be especially true given the similarities betweens the teams.
“We’re both kind of mirror images of each other,” Leone said.
For starters, both the Crimson and the Bulldogs withstood serious threats to their league record this weekend, as neither was able to finish off its Ivy opponent in regulation time. In Harvard’s win against Brown, junior Katherine Sheeleigh notched the only goal of the game at the 93rd minute to give the Crimson a win.
“We didn’t play our best,” Nichols said of the Brown game. “We know we have to play our absolute best [against Yale].”
Against Cornell last Saturday, Yale freshman Kristen Forster scored her first career goal seven seconds into overtime to give the Bulldogs a 2-1 win, over a Big Red squad that Harvard bested 2-0 on Oct. 10.
The Crimson also holds an edge against the teams’ only other shared opponent thus far, Holy Cross. Harvard beat the Crusaders 2-0 in September, two weeks before Holy Cross took a three-point advantage against Yale winning 4-1.
“Anything can happen on any given day,” junior co-captain Gina Wideroff said. “[That game is] not really a good indicator of how Yale is.”
But on Oct. 3, when both teams took the field before unfavorable weather prevented play, the Crimson and Bulldogs defended and attacked evenly.
The score remained 0-0 as both teams left the field.
“I don’t think either team played the best that we could,” Nichols said. “We both had a lot to bring in that second half.”
Leading the charge for both teams will be a strong contingent of forwards.
“They have a very strong attacking presence,” Nichols said. “Their attitude, in my opinion, is what wins them games. Their front three are very strong and very fast forwards.”
Becky Brown paces the Yale offense with 10 goals and four assists, but the Bulldogs have 11 players who have scored this season.
While Harvard doesn’t have any player with Brown’s numbers, it does have a more balanced attack.
“Our forwards do a really good job of pressuring our opponent’s defense,” Wideroff said. “It’s definitely an advantage.”
Sheeleigh leads the team in scoring with six goals and one assist. Nichols and classmate Christina Hagner are tied for second with two goals apiece. Setting them up has been sophomore Melanie Baskind, with one goal and five assists, and freshman Alexandra Conigliaro has four assists so far in her rookie season.
“It’s kind of funny, we’ve been joking about it,” Nichols said. “The strengths of the teams are very similar.”
Thanks to the postponement earlier this month, both teams have had more than a simple scouting report to help them prepare for today’s game. For the Crimson, dissatisfied with its first half, the rematch should prove more advantageous.
“We have gotten that [poor half] out of our system,” Nichols said. “It helps knowing what to expect. Obviously things change in two weeks. We’ve changed a lot too, but we have seen their strengths. It’s a lot about knowing what they have and preparing our response.”

CORRECTIONS APPENDED
Perseverance has defined much of the season for Harvard field hockey, and perhaps none have exemplified it more than freshman goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos. The rookie has stepped in to start all of the Crimson’s games this year, and with five contests remaining has already pushed Harvard (5-7, 2-2 Ivy League) to within one victory of its 2008 total. More impressively, though, has been the fashion in which Tassopoulos has led the squad, excelling in the face of strong competition.
“We’ve played a lot of good teams and [Tassopoulos] has had to make a lot of quick decisions under pressure,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “That’s huge for anyone, let alone a freshman goalie.”
“Every game [at this level], you have to come out strong,” Tassopoulos observed. “There is no easy opponent. You have to be on your game every single game. It’s definitely a different mentality.”
Tassopoulos’ early career has proven to be a trial by fire, with the Crimson taking on a number of talented non-conference teams, including UMass, Michigan, and BU in consecutive weeks. As expected, such talented opponents have created a barrage of shots, and Tassopoulos has been forced to respond. The rookie has amassed 99 saves for an average of 8.25 per game, up from Harvard’s 5.41 a year ago and good for 9th in the nation. Tassopoulos has even notched 23 saves in a single contest, at then-No.5 Connecticut on Sept. 23.
“I think we’re giving up too many shots and don’t want Cynthia to look that good. No more Ivy Rookie of the Week,” Caples joked, referring to the award given to Tassopoulos two weeks ago.
Yet, rather than wither in the face of an onslaught, the Crimson’s rookie netminder has shown dramatic improvement, marked by her first collegiate shutout last Saturday in a crucial Ivy contest against Cornell.
“It was so cool [to record the shutout],” said Tassopoulos in light of a narrow 1-0 victory. “I’ve been waiting for that shutout to come and it was a good game to have it. We went to Cornell and didn’t know what to expect…but it increased our chances for an Ivy Championship.”
The Dallas, Texas native and four-year standout at Hockaday High School has clearly come a long way, especially considering that Tassopoulos took up the goalie position as a high school freshman simply because it “seemed like fun.” But the Harvard rookie’s rapid improvement becomes even more striking given the fundamental changes from high school competition to collegiate field hockey. Despite Tassopoulos’ past success, it was difficult to predict at the outset of the season whether anyone could be prepared to assume the role as the Crimson’s lone goalie from day one.
“Going from high school to college is much faster and more physical, and [Tassopoloos] is facing a lot of higher quality shots,” co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon said. “She really had to rise to the college level immediately, but for someone who is so level-headed and motivated…she really stepped up and was playing at a Division I level in only two months.”
And beyond the typical trials of higher-level play, Tassopoulos had to adjust to Jordan Field, which promotes an entirely new game compared to the fields of Texas.
“In high school, we played on grass, which is a lot different from artificial turf,” Tassopoulos explained. “It’s a different game, but it’s more enjoyable to see how the game is supposed to look, instead of much slower.”
If the increased game speed bothers Tassopoulos, the freshman does not show it. Not only has the goalkeeper displayed her physical talent with a number of athletic kick saves throughout the year, but her teammates also credit Tassopoulos as an outstanding field general.
“[Tassopoulos] has stepped up with confidence,” Goodman-Bacon said. “She’s learned to be a good leader, and she is very directive, which has helped the defense to improve.”
Such adept game management will prove even more critical as Harvard completes its Ivy schedule. The squad has already logged the same number of conference wins as its 2008 counterpart, but every Ancient Eight team is proving competitive. In fact, while Tassopoulos’ .744 save percentage ranks her 29th in the nation, this mark proves only fourth best within the conference. Yet, given the rookie’s stellar play and tremendous improvement, Caples seems more than happy to work with the personnel she has.

CORRECTIONS
An earlier version of the Oct. 20 sports article "ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: Rookie Boosts D, Shuts Down Cornell" misspelled the last name of freshman goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos as Tassopoulus.
The original article also misspelled the name of the high school Tassopoulos attended. She went to Hockaday, not Hockaway.

Well, you can find out this Saturday, when the Harvard Shooting Club hosts its latest shotgun skeet and trap shooting outing.  Everyone—including you, even if you’ve never touched a gun before—is encouraged to attend. Need a reason? Here are a few offered by the club:
1. It's fun!
2. Prepare for a zombie apocalypse—shotgun experience will come in handy.
3. Meet awesome new people!
4. It's a chance to get off campus for a few hours.
5. Immense satisfaction in seeing the clay pigeon shatter into tiny pieces in every direction!
But...wait a second.  If you’re like us, you may be a little alarmed (especially by this last reason).  And you may be wondering just what “skeet and trap shooting” actually involves. Well, read on, because we’ve jumped the gun (ha!) and uncovered the answers for you after the jump.
Tian Wang ’11, co-president of the Harvard Shooting Club, gave us this explanation of skeet and trap shooting:
“The goal of skeet and trap shooting is to use a shotgun to hit clay pigeons thrown by an automatic thrower. In trap, shooters face a semicircular field and the pigeons are sent away from the shooter straight or angled toward the left or right. In skeet, shooters shift between seven positions on the semicircular field and targets are thrown to cross from a high house and a low house. Skeet is the more challenging of the two.”
Not being familiar with shooting as a sport, FlyBy’s first reaction was…well, unease.  (In fact, the first gunshot in this video, from the outing's Facebook event page, made us jump a little.)
But about 60 percent of the people who have RSVP’d for the event so far are newbies, Wang told us, and free coaching will be provided. “Guns can, of course, be very dangerous, but part of the sport is learning proper safety techniques, so being afraid of the equipment shouldn't be a reason for missing out on this wonderful sport,” he said.
Wang added that the current reincarnation of the club (it was originally founded in 1883 but has been sporadically active and inactive in the years since) has not yet faced any anti-gun protests.  In fact, he said, the club is “in the process of establishing a fund toward promoting firearm safety both on and outside of campus.”
That's good to know.  And we're relieved to find out that the Harvard Shooting Club isn’t full of gun-wielding crazies.  Whew!
Still, this faint-hearted FlyBy correspondent is probably going to pass on the outing.  We'll leave the bullets and loud noises to braver souls.

Apparently, snowplows and street salt just won’t cut it. Moscow’s mayor Yury Luzhkov is bringing out the big guns when it comes to fighting snow this year in Russia’s blizzard-prone capital. According an article in Time Magazine, Luzkhov’s new initiative–ringing in at just a few million dollars–will have the Russian Air Force spraying snow-bearing clouds with a fine chemical mist that will force clouds to dump out their wintry precipitation before reaching the city’s borders.
Sure, sure, Boston is no Moscow, but what do ya say, Harvard? Could this be the perfect remedy for the seemingly campus-wide epidemic that is our love-hate relationship with snow? With Cambridge getting its first dousing of the white stuff on Sunday–the third earliest date of measurable accumulation according to National Weather Service (October 10, 1979 takes the cake)–we asked students whether they welcomed the sign of an early winter with delight or vexation. Find out what they had to say after the jump.
“I love it!” said Rebecca Gruskin. “Maybe it’s because I am from Minnesota but snow is normal and comforting to me.”
“It’s exciting but only up to a certain point,” said Nicole Sliva. “The snow itself can be fun but the cold associated with it…not so much.”
“It’s just really early,” said Boston native Alex Zhu, referring to the weekend’s precipitation. “It’s not even Halloween yet.”
As far as responding to Moscow mayor’s innovative strategy, the overwhelming majority of students gave a thumbs-down to the idea, wishing to spare Boston skies of the misty chemical assault.
“I personally object to such an idea,” said Ivan Bochkov, who was born in Moscow. “Weather over there is brutal–it causes a huge mess for traffic and pedestrians–but it would be a huge waste of resources to implement in Cambridge.”
“Honestly, hearing about [the Moscow initiative] makes me really angry,” said Christine Reed, who said that we probably shouldn’t go around stopping things from precipitating naturally.
Flyby hears you, Christine. Perhaps the clouds should just be left to do their thing. After all, who are we to mess with four billion years of the water cycle?
