After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“If science teaches you one thing, it’s that everything and everyone is alive,” Quincy tells her class of rambunctious kids in “The Shape She Makes,” a dance-narrative production that opened Wednesday, April 9th, at the OBERON. Quincy (Finnerty Steeves) then proceeds to animate the very chairs and pencils in the children’s hands by describing tiny molecules in constant, imperceptible motion. The rest of the lively production is wrought with just as much fluidity; almost every prop in the production is composed of dancers, and often narrative scenes are conveyed only through dance. Indeed, movement is at the core of each theatrical intention. Each cast member emphasizes again and again the importance of movement and change in storytelling as they collectively unravel an emotional, precise tale of a woman who sees change everywhere and yet cannot change herself. “The Shape She Makes” is a world premiere that will play here in Cambridge until April 27. Its complicated narrative and performance structure succeeds because creative directors Jonathan Bernstein and Susan Misner ambitiously create moments of intrigue and emotion within each scene.
 
Along with his partner, choreographer, and performer Misner, director and writer Bernstein brings “The Shape She Makes” to life with incredible energy. Misner’s choreography feels honest and true to the characters who move through the story; repeated motions of the dancers at times anticipate and echo the movements of other characters onstage so that performers are united in conveying the story. Dancers alternate between sitting in the audience area that surrounds the stage on three sides and dancing and acting in the center floor space. The dancers’ flawless transitions between movements and scenes—even when the narrative jumps between characters and time periods—hold the storyline together. With such a complicated temporal arc, even the difference between a raspy voice for an older version of a character and a straight back for the younger version makes a scene comprehendible. The show takes place in three separate decades. It begins with Quincy as a 40-year-old substitute teacher and switches between Quincy as a nine-year-old genius (played by 13-year-old Sydney K. Penny) and several years before that, when her mother Louise (Misner) meets and conceives a child with Quincy’s father (Seán Martin Hingston).
 
In this type of experimental theater performance, the audience is often directly involved in the overall impression of the show. “The Shape She Makes” is no exception: upon entering the theater, audience members are asked to write their names on nametags. The production begins when one actress mounts a chair to speak. It is not yet clear where the scene takes place, but the audience’s participation in events onstage becomes urgent when characters thought to be audience members join fellow performers on stage at varying intervals. At each moment, we are  kept questioning the exact nature of our involvement in events playing out in front of us. Are we the students in class when Quincy teaches her class about molecules in motion? Are we innocent bystanders who watch Louise get picked up by guy after guy in the bar? Or are we members of the prestigious math conference who watch Quincy’s speech at the end of the production? Teacher Quincy’s assertion that all matter goes through constant change has been applied to the audience; we wait at each moment to be transformed by the performance to be notified of our role in the action on stage.
Indeed, the production gives a unique and at times painful glimpse into Quincy’s family drama. Two particularly emotional scenes stand out. The first, focused on Louise’s relationship with Quincy’s father, Bernard, and by extension her relationship with his alcoholism, is told entirely through dance. The two meet when Louise is young, optimistic, and she demonstrates her devotion to him with light-hearted and playful movement. The two laugh together and go through repeated motions of going to bed and playing. Though no words are exchanged, Misner’s and Hingston’s bodies are in continual conversation. Then alcohol enters their relationship, and Hingston, as Bernard, succumbs to drink, breaking his routine dance with Misner. Misner throws her body towards Hingston, completely focused on keeping him with her. She makes Louise’s desperation apparent, and when baby Quincy begins to cry and then scream, her emotional decision to comfort her daughter rather than save Bernard is incredibly powerful.
 
The second stand-out scene takes place four decades later, when Quincy is a substitute teacher still living with her mother. Steeves as Quincy is completely committed to her role, and from the moment she enters the performance space, she lumbers slowly, as if she means to apologize for each step. This older Quincy struggles with her weight, and director Bernstein depicts her complicated relationship with food in a moving scene with dancers acting as a refrigerator. As Steeves eats, the refrigerator comes alive, pulling at her back and eventually forcing the food into Quincy’s mouth. It is a hard scene to watch, but Bernstein makes this type of honesty prevalent throughout the production so that by the end—when Steeves speaks as Quincy in front of a crowd of math enthusiasts—her transformation feels genuine. Her final words define the motivation for telling this story and the importance of listening and watching her tale unfold. Humbly, and with much effort, she says, “I thank you for honoring me. For seeing me.”

Robust debate and freedom of speech are fundamental attributes of Harvard. At Harvard Management Company, we are proud to have responsibility for protecting and growing the endowment and supporting that freedom of thought and expression. We aim to invest responsibly in everything we do, but we understand and respect the right of people to challenge and question what that means in practice. 
Unfortunately, the latest campaign from Responsible Investment at Harvard falls well outside of a reasonable right to disagree.  Their claims in recent Crimson Op-Eds and in YouTube videos about our investments in pine forests in Argentina are full of factual errors.  More disturbingly, they show a clear pattern of deliberate misrepresentation.
EVASA and Las Misiones are companies that own land and grow pine plantation forests in the Corrientes province of Argentina. Both have third-party certification from the Forest Stewardship Council to ensure we remain aware of the social and environmental context in which our assets are managed. It also establishes a continuous improvement program that gives confidence that we can meet one of our primary goals: to leave our investments in better health and condition than when we bought them. EVASA sought certification by the independent Forest Stewardship Council under prior ownership in 2009. HMC completed that process as the new owner in 2011. Las Misiones was established later than EVASA and began preparing for the same FSC certification, which was granted just last month.
We like plantation forests. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations estimates that well over 30 percent of the world's industrial wood supply comes from plantations occupying less than seven percent of total forest area. The high productivity of plantations takes an enormous amount of pressure off of the world’s precious remaining natural forests, reducing over-harvesting and deforestation. Wood is one of the most remarkable and least appreciated natural resources we have. It provides the raw material for a wide array of industrial and consumer products, from construction materials and paper—to products such as films, thickeners and fabrics—to organic products that offer an alternative to those from fossil fuels. Wood is by far the most energy-efficient building material we have, both in its production and in its use. Sustainably managed forests are essentially carbon neutral, even while producing useful wood products. New plantations absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and then hold it for as long as they persist, which may be in perpetuity.
Well-managed forests, including plantations, also provide many services and benefits to the local environment: shade, shelter, scenic beauty, soil protection, regulation of water quality and yield, rich ecosystems supporting diverse flora and fauna, jobs for local people, recreational areas, and more. Plantations are also often far more bio-diverse than the modified grass pasture land on which they are commonly established. Though plantations can cause negative impacts in some cases if poorly developed or located, with care and attention to planning and management, benefits should far outweigh the costs.
In this context, we are dismayed at the claims made by Responsible Investment at Harvard.
They claim that Harvard's plantations are damaging the environment of the important Iberá wetland reserve by drying it up, contaminating it with chemicals and planting trees in areas designated for conservation, or that will spread into the wetlands themselves. Not so.
In fact we believe the opposite is true–our forests are likely better for the Iberá wetlands than the former use of the land which was large-scale cattle ranching. We aim to demonstrate that with long-term water quality monitoring that has been underway for some time. The Iberá wetland ecosystem is indeed a magnificent natural area of wild land and is worthy of all of the protection accorded to it by the Argentine authorities. It is a huge area, designated into preservation land, buffer areas to protect the core preservation areas and land designated for commercial production, to include cattle ranching and plantation forestry. All of our planted land is firmly and clearly within the commercial zones. Our properties also include buffer zone and preservation land, representing over 55 percent of our titled area, which we will faithfully manage within the rules established for such areas.
Herbicides and insecticides are used at establishment to protect young seedlings from being swamped by grass or eaten by ants, but for the following 15 to 20 years until harvesting and replanting, no chemicals of any kind are applied to the land. The chemicals that are applied at establishment (approved for use by the FSC) break down fast after doing their job and they do not spread into ground water or the wetlands.
The species of tree we have planted—loblolly pine—will not spread naturally into the wetlands. It is a species, unlike slash pine that some others have planted, that will not grow on wet ground and only survives, and in fact thrives, in the well-drained parts of the commercial zones.
With an annual rainfall of about 50 inches, the effect of our plantations will be to regulate (lower the volatility of) water flows, reducing flood run-off and sustaining dry season flows by acting as temporary storage of rainfall. Nevertheless, we are monitoring water flows in long-term studies that will test this thesis so that we can be sure our plantations are not negative and are in fact positive for the Iberá wetlands.
They claim that our plantations are responsible for drying up local residents’ wells.  Not so.
One such resident, Adrian Obregon, came from Corrientes to Boston to draw attention to this concern. We are sorry to hear that Mr. Obregon has had to deepen his well, but as discussed above, the possibility that Harvard's trees are responsible for that is effectively zero. Not only would it be highly improbable that pine trees on neighboring land would have such an effect on the water table at well-depth, but more importantly, the trees nearest to Mr. Obregon's house are owned by somebody else. That is easily determined by simple inspection of property boundaries and signage in the area.
They claim that we have never consulted with local inhabitants. Not so.
We would never obtain or retain FSC certification without a series of well-publicized public meetings with local residents. This is a key criterion of their audit process, which seeks to bring global principles into local focus through dialogue and interaction with adjoining communities. We have held public meetings numerous times and in each case specifically invited members of all stakeholder groups who have standing in the community. This includes two members of the local Small Producers Association (that Mr. Obregon identifies with), who were commended to us as the appropriate representatives of that organization.
They claim that our trucks destroy local roads and create a dust problem for local residents.
Of all of the claims made by Responsible Investment at Harvard, this is the only one in which there is even a grain of truth. Corrientes Route 22 and other local roads in the area are in many parts poorly formed and surfaced. In dry conditions passing vehicles create dust clouds and this is without doubt an irritant and possibly a potential health problem for some local residents.
It should be noted that we are one of many landowners and road users in the region and the problem has existed from a time long before our investment. Our local management has been diligently working to find solutions to this problem with the municipal authorities. The creation of a by-pass road around the center of the town of Chavarria was instigated at our request. We initiated, at our own cost, a regular road-watering program at the Taquaritas Colony to keep the surface damp and dust free. Our efforts in solving these problems were fully audited by the FSC.
Sections of road have been resurfaced and improved, but we would like to see more rapid progress to eliminate, or at least further mitigate road surface and dust issues. It is a municipal and provincial problem, needing a municipal or provincial solution. Unfortunately, like local authorities in many places, those in Corrientes have regional priorities and budget constraints.
They claim that we attempted to acquire land from small farmers by forging title documents so as to force them off their properties. Not so.
In some respects, this may be the most serious false allegation since Responsible Investment at Harvard is alleging criminal, fraudulent behavior. Harvard acquired its property in Corrientes through five separate transactions, all of them with large landowners. We have never attempted to buy land from small farmers and abhor any effort to coerce landowners into selling their land.
If the alleged incident did occur, then it was certainly not perpetrated by anyone connected with Harvard's holdings. In the Responsible Investment at Harvard video, a local official is filmed stating that he agrees that such things have happened. But the question to which he was responding is not shown, and we believe he was commenting on a different matter completely unrelated to Harvard’s investments. The attempt to portray this as official confirmation that we have fraudulently acquired land from small farmers is a gross breach of ethics.
They claim that we manage our property poorly, and house workers in substandard conditions. Not so.
How can anyone interested in honest debate take video footage of a run-down and untidy farm compound more than four miles from Harvard’s property and show that facility with a voice over claiming it is evidence of Harvard’s poor management and worker housing? How can any organization purporting to bring more responsible management to the endowment for the betterment of Harvard, publish such claims? This is exactly what Responsible Investment at Harvard has done.
I have worked for Harvard Management Company for over twelve years. I came to Harvard in 2001, drawn by a belief that Harvard's long-term, patient capital and high ethical standards would make it an ideal owner of forests with a similarly long horizon and needing careful, professional management. In my career, I have worked in Government-owned forests, where best practice is often compromised by the political realities of a short-term electoral cycle. I have worked for corporate forest owners, where the demands of Wall Street to meet next quarters' earnings release or the need to service too much debt, can result in a focus on how much cash the forest can generate in the short-term.
At Harvard, we have always focused on building wealth in the forest asset itself, in the broadest possible way. Wealth that is reflected in more living trees, longer rotation lengths between harvests, diligent replanting or regeneration of seedlings, richer and healthier ecosystems supporting the widest possible array of native plants and animals and safe and rewarding jobs for local people. Such people were my friends and neighbors for many years and I learned a lot from them.
The wealth we build never needs to be lost when we sell to others. The assets are perpetual and only require good management and another patient owner to ensure that commercial, environmental and social benefits continue to be enjoyed by local communities for generations, well after we leave.
In my career I have been engaged in native plant surveys, in field projects to protect critically endangered bird species, in restoration projects for land damaged by poor past practice. All of these experiences are brought to bear on what we do. The Natural Resources team at HMC brings their own rich array of experiences and the same dedication to making good investment decisions. I am proud of every one of them. None of them would knowingly engage in an investment project that they believed would harm the environment or hurt the interests of local residents. We seek to continuously learn from best practices and improve our approach. Doing real asset investments is hard, and on rare occasions, people we work with have let us down. But in the vast majority of situations, our local property management teams delight us with their commitment, energy, experience and dedication. Our local management in Argentina is composed of just such people.
The Responsible Investment at Harvard campaign falsely accuses us of serious offenses and failures in a way that damages Harvard's good name in Corrientes and in Cambridge. It raises unwarranted concern and doubt among the rest of the student body, faculty and alumni. We deny and refute their allegations.
I feel truly privileged to have this opportunity to play a small part in advancing the interests of such a great institution. Perhaps no symbol of the significance of Harvard's mission is greater than the crimson shield, proudly embossed with the word Veritas. We all know what that means. But Responsible Investment at Harvard seems to believe it doesn't apply to them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard administration announced last Thursday that the total cost of attendance for the College will increase next year by $2,200. The 3.9 percent increase, which is the highest in seven years, will bring the total cost of a Harvard education to $58,607 for the 2014-2015 academic year. As less than half of the student body pays entirely out of pocket, this change is expected to affect a minority of the student body.  
Although an added pressure for those not on financial aid, hopefully the tuition increase will correlate with an increase in aid money awarded to college students. Last year, Harvard increased its tuition rate by 3.5 percent, and this hike allowed for a $10 million increase in the financial aid budget, leaving the total at an all-time high of $182 million. Similarly, the upper limit for families awarded free tuition has increased in the past several years from $40,000 to $65,000, as tuition rose each year. The small price hike seems like a small sum to pay for a better financial aid program that will allow more students of diverse backgrounds to afford Harvard.
As an isolated instance, the increase in tuition will likely have a minimal effect on Harvard. While the price hike will certainly put pressure on some members of the college community, Harvard’s endowment is significantly large enough to support an increase in the number of students on financial aid, should the higher price tag force more families to consider that option. Although tuition increases are a principal means of funding the financial aid program, alumni donations—such as this past year’s record $125 million gift—play a significant part.
Although people often think of the Ivy League colleges when they think of tuition increases, public universities have also been increasing their tuitions in the past several years. In 2011, the increases by percentage in public schools were nearly double that of private schools.
Given that SAT scores and college enrolment is already so strongly linked with a family’s income, the long-term effect of this trend is highly problematic for students in the lower- and middle-income brackets. It’s great for the students from low-income families who are lucky enough to get into the need-blind (and highly selective) schools. But for many lower income students, who don’t consider applying to schools like Harvard, or aren’t able to provide the necessary SAT scores, the future is more bleak. The long-term consequences of this trend will ultimately fall on low-income students, who lack the wealth to pay for an SAT tutor or better primary education, and therefore cannot be accepted into elite institutions that offer the most generous financial aid packages.
Given that the greatest percent increases are coming from state schools, we hope that in certain cases the government will step in to increase education budgets. Politicians from Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren have publicly condemned what they see as the milking of college students for cash, and Warren has actively demanded greater loan forgiveness for college students. Continuing in this vein, it would be encouraging to see greater funding allocated to public universities.

The parents of newly admitted Harvard students have more than one reason to cheer. The Financial Aid Office claims that for 90 percent of American families, it would be the same or cheaper to attend Harvard than a state school. And for the median household, which has an income of about $51,000, the expected family contribution would likely be zero dollars.  
So what’s more expensive than a state school—or Harvard, accounting for financial aid? Apparently, child care, according to the Child Care Aware 2013 study. In more than thirty states, the average cost of center-based infant care is greater than the price of tuition and fees at a public university. In all fifty states, child care costs more than 25 percent of the median income of single parents.
Expenses are particularly high in Massachusetts, where the average annual cost for out-of-home infant care was $16,430. Even though older children are slightly cheaper to care for, the cost doesn’t fall by much—the average expense for out-of-home care for a four-year-old represents 44 percent of the income of the average Massachusetts single mother.
Families that earn below the federal poverty line ($23,850 for a family of four this year) are generally eligible for vouchers that partially subsidize care. However, it’s estimated that only one in six children eligible for childcare subsidies actually receive them, in part due to the waiting lists that exist in almost half of US states, including Massachusetts. In the Boston area, the wait time to receive a voucher is up to three years.
One of the women currently on this waiting list is Nicky, a woman I interviewed for this piece.  Nicky did not want her full name included in the article because she did not want her social security status to be publicized.  Nicky initially had a voucher, which allowed her to get care for her daughter, who is disabled. She was receiving about $250 monthly from Supplemental Security Income, but this was contingent on her working limited hours, and Nicky can’t afford not to work for a check of $250. Nicky also has a son who lives with her and takes care of her own mother, who has heart problems.
Nicky’s voucher was canceled because she was unsure how to accurately report her income, which is volatile, a common situation for those who work in low-wage, high- turnover jobs. And now, her daughter has to go to the back of the line. Without the voucher, Nicky can’t find high-quality childcare at levels that she can afford. This means that her daughter won’t get the specialized attention that she needs, and Nicky will have to turn down job offers because her daughter comes first.
  
There are millions of families stuck in the same trap; if they try to invest in their child’s future by giving them a leg up on educational achievement, they’ll wreck their own financial security and fall deeper into poverty. Perhaps that’s one of the contributing factors to the class distribution of Harvard students—after all, only a fifth of our students come from families in the bottom 60 percent of the income distribution.  
By now, there is robust evidence indicating that high quality, full-day early education programs can produce educational gains that are sustained for years, even when those same children are thrown into subpar education systems. It’s one of the reasons that Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York fought for funding to allow every child in the city universal access to pre-K, funded by a small tax on one-percenters, “less than three bucks a day—about the cost of a small soy latte at your local Starbucks,” in his own words. (While this dedicated tax didn’t pass, the state government found the money for pre-K elsewhere.)
If programs like this were expanded nationwide, the access would not only benefit the toddlers, but their parents too. While the kids are playing with blocks and reading books at school, their mothers and fathers can find work, advance their own education, or move out of the graveyard shift and into a position that offers career growth opportunities.
 
It’s important to restart the national conversation around enlarging Head Start and Early Head Start to every willing child in America. Congress also needs to reauthorize and increase the size of the Child Care and Development block grant, which funds most of these vouchers. But waiting for Washington to act would ensnare all of American in the same paralysis that has frozen the Beltway. Local policymakers who believe in the children of their cities and states, and think they have the potential to be the leaders, thinkers, and doers of the next generation, need to put down their soy lattes and start buying children’s books. If giving up coffee today allows us to wake up to a better tomorrow, the choice is clear.

The Crimson (10-6, 2-2 Ivy) lost to Princeton, 5-2, and beat Penn, 4-3, to split their matches on the weekend and stay at .500 in the Ivy League as the season comes to a close.
 
Harvard struggled in the doubles matches, usually a team strength, as the team dropped the doubles point to both the Tigers and the Quakers. While the Crimson could not come back against No. 69th Princeton, the Crimson fought back against the Quakers to take home the win on Sunday.
 
“We lost to Princeton, but we were able to end on a high note with a win over Penn,” freshman Spencer Liang said. “I think even though we had some tough matches in there everyone fought really hard, and that’s how we won today.”
 
HARVARD 4, PENN 3
 
With the match tied at 3-all, it was up to senior captain Hannah Morrill to clinch the victory for Harvard at Penn’s Hamlin Tennis Center. Morrill rose to the challenge and rallied in the third set to take down Quaker freshman Luba Vazhenina and win the match for the Crimson in a thrilling 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 decision at fifth singles.
 
“It was really suspenseful and made all of us pretty nervous, honestly,” freshman June Lee said. “She was up in the tiebreaker at first, but the other girl came back and tied it up, and it was a one point difference for a while. We just kept encouraging her on the sidelines, and she pulled it out.”
 
Morrill’s win followed an equally gritty comeback by her teammates, who battled back after a doubles point loss and Liang’s defeat at first singles put Harvard in a 2-0 hole early in the match. A win from Amanda Lin and Amy He at third doubles gave the Crimson the initial advantage but was followed by two quick defeats at the hands of the Quakers as Penn earned the doubles point.
 
The Harvard women rallied in the singles matches, coming out on top of several close matches to give Harvard the 4-3 win. He gave the Crimson its first win on the day with her 6-4, 6-4 win at fourth singles, while Lee earned a win of her own at the third position with an exciting 7-6, 7-5 defeat of Penn’s Sonya Latycheva.
 
“I was actually down the whole time in that match,” Lee said. “I was down 0-3, and then I was down 1-4 in the first set, and I came back and won 7-6, and then in the second set I was down 2-4 and I came back and won 7-5….At first I was a little bit flustered, and wasn’t sure how to play [Latycheva]. But I knew that my team needed me, and I just tried whatever I could to stay in the match and keep it going as long as possible.”
 
Sophomore Monica Lin continued to bounce back from her four-game losing streak, as she beat Kana Daniel in three sets at second singles and gave Harvard the 3-2 edge. After Lin was taken down in three sets, Morrill came out on top and grabbed the victory for the Crimson.
 
PRINCETON 5, HARVARD 2
 
On the first Ivy road trip of the season, 46th-ranked Harvard was bested by 69th-ranked Princeton. The Tigers started off strong, sweeping two doubles matches, to take the early lead and never looked back as they grabbed a 5-2 win off the Crimson.
 
Harvard’s two wins came from Monica Lin and her classmate He, who collected points at second and fourth singles, respectively. Lin broke a four-game losing streak to earn a 6-4, 6-4 win while He downed Caroline Joyce 6-0, 6-2.
 
Morrill was the only member of the Crimson to take her match to three sets, but was unable to outlast Princeton’s Katie Goepel at the fifth position. Amanda Lin finished off the match for the Crimson, dropping a 6-1, 6-3 decision at sixth singles to give Princeton the 5-2 victory.
 “We wanted to learn from what happened against Princeton,” Lee said. “We reflected on what we could have done better, what we did well, and what we could improve on when we played Penn. We just knew that we had to have a positive attitude and couldn’t be down because of the loss to Princeton; we kept reminding each other just to keep fighting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The numbers are staggering: 37 seasons, 608 wins, 273 conference victories, 21 Ivy League titles, and 15 wins in 22 NCAA Tournament appearances.
But for all of the accolades Harvard men’s tennis coach Dave Fish ’72 has accrued in his career, there is just one number that continues to motivate him after all these years: five.
“As a coach, my goal is to find five elusive points in a match that we can win that we’d otherwise lose,” Fish said. “If we find those five points, it can turn a 6-3, 6-3 loss into a 7-5, 6-4 win. So mine is a quest for those five points. It means that everything we do in practice matters. There’s always something every day you have to get your teeth into, and if you don’t bring that intensity every day, you don’t make any progress. You don’t find those five points.”
It is Fish’s commitment to excellence and drive to constantly improve that has contributed to the success of Harvard tennis over the past four decades. Fish may be the Crimson’s all-time leader in wins and has led the team to unparalleled heights, but his desire for even more still burns strong.
“Every year, I want to do something better than I did it before. If you love what you’re doing, then there’s no such thing as burnout,” Fish points out. “So I’ve never been burned out as a coach. To me, it’s a privilege to do it. So I can’t wait to come to work and strive to be better every day.”
STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM
Throughout his decorated career, Fish has seen the times and the game change. But 45 years after arriving at Harvard as a freshman, he remains at the place where it all began.
Fish came to Cambridge in the fall of 1968 to a campus torn apart by student protests over the Vietnam War, but quickly found a mentor in Jack Barnaby ’32, the legendary Crimson coach who coached Fish in both tennis and squash and whose Harvard records he has since surpassed.
“Part of the reason we were so fond of [Barnaby] is that he was the lighthouse while the rest of the world was spinning,” Fish recalled. “He didn’t care how long our hair was, how we felt about the war. He just gave us a set of values—to be a good person, to be honest—and didn’t worry about the peripherals.”
The young Fish excelled under Barnaby’s tutelage, becoming captain of both the tennis and squash teams. During his time as an undergraduate, he led the squash team to three national championships, and played for two tennis teams that took shares of Ivy League titles.
But more importantly, the more Fish learned from Barnaby and saw how he had built two squads into national powerhouses, the more Fish himself was intrigued by the idea of coaching.
“I realized there was a kernel of me that really loved coaching,” Fish said. “I would always ask, ‘Who’s going to take over after you, Jack? You’ve built a great program here, and someone’s got to care about it as much as you do.’ I wasn’t quite admitting to myself that I was the person who would do it.”
Directly after graduation, Fish did not initially stay on at Harvard to begin a coaching career. After spending a year traveling and coaching tennis, he came back to Cambridge and began his work as a pre-med student.
But as he embarked on even more schooling, he realized that he missed coaching.
Finally, over dinner one night, Barnaby asked Fish if he’d ever consider coming back and coaching the Crimson.
“I said, ‘Jack, I’m going to go to medical school, and there’s a need for doctors in rural Maine.’ And he said, ‘Dave, that’s very noble, but I’ve always thought that if you find something you really love, you’ll probably make a bigger contribution to it than if you do something where there’s a need. That doesn’t necessarily mean you’re the right person to fill the need,’” Fish recounted. “I think in my heart of hearts I knew I was dying for some excuse to do something that I really loved.”
And as Fish pondered his next move and thought about how much he valued his summers spent coaching tennis, he understood what he needed to do.
“I love teaching and had a chance to coach,” Fish reasoned. “I realized that when you coach, virtually everyone in your classroom wants to be there. How many teachers can say that?”
BUILDING THE MONSTER
After serving as an assistant coach for two years, Fish took over for his mentor Barnaby as head coach of both the tennis and squash teams. He had big shoes to fill.
“He was an iconic coach, and I was the young kid on the block with a lot to prove,” Fish explained. “If I couldn’t earn the respect of the kids on the team, I would fail.”
But within five years, the young coach was able to bring back both the tennis and squash teams to national prominence and Ivy League dominance. Princeton was a force in racquet sports during the 1970s, winning Ancient Eight titles in both tennis and squash in three years.
“It took a while to tilt this juggernaut [Princeton] and have people start to think about playing at Harvard,” he explained. “Eventually, we built great programs in both tennis and squash.”
In the 1980s, Fish led the squash team to eight Ivy crowns and six national titles and captured six Ivy tennis team titles. But after the 1989 season, Fish left the squash team to focus exclusively on the tennis team.
“Squash felt like a much smaller world,” he explained. “Part of me wanted a bigger stage to play on. I was so torn between tennis and squash, but it felt like squash was a part-time position and tennis was becoming a year-round position. It presented a better challenge, and I felt like it was the right way to go.”
Indeed, tennis had changed a lot since Fish’s playing days, and Ivy League tennis had risen to prominence on a more competitive national stage.
During the 1990s, the Crimson went to the NCAA Tournament for 10 straight years, including a 1997 appearance in the quarterfinals.
“The Ivy League is an entirely different league than it was years ago,” Fish explained. “If we are good enough to get to the top of that heap, we’re well-trained for any national competition we get into.”
And Harvard has been able to stay atop the Ancient Eight, even with the changes to the game. The past two years, the team has won the conference and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Championships.
“This is what I’d call the golden age of Ivy League tennis,” Fish said. “It’s so deep and intense. Every match is crazy close. You try to have a great developmental system, but everyone is so even. We’re trying to be even plus [a little more].”
And with the expansion of the game, Fish has been able to expand his reach beyond the Ivy League level and become a national presence.
“Dave is one of the real titans of Harvard coaching, but also a titan of coaching nationally in the tennis community,” said Andrew Rueb ’95, a former captain of the tennis team. “All the top coaches call Dave for a little perspective and wisdom because he’s so well-respected amongst other college coaches.”
MORE THAN A FOREHAND
But beyond Fish’s success on the court, his former players believe that his greatest asset is his skill as a teacher and mentor.
“Results on the court are one thing, but Dave’s legacy is also as a mentor,” Rueb said. “He has a knack for helping young boys grow up into men, and really enjoys that process of mentorship and personal growth. There’s a reason the alumni are so supportive; he played a large part in shaping their future paths.”
Peter Stovell ’93 echoed Rueb’s belief that Fish was focused on making his players into better young men.
“Dave is concerned about how to hit a forehand, but also with the character of his players,” Stovell remarked. “There are a lot of people who can teach a forehand, but he can teach that, but also how to grow and mature. The character piece of his teaching is really important, and lasts a lifetime. A great teacher will impact you not only in the classroom, but also in all facets of your life—on the human side, your character.”
Fish’s strategy is to instill self-reliance in his players so that they can improve.
“I’m a thoughtful coach,” Fish said. “I try to persuade by logic rather than getting into your face…. My quieter approach means that people have to take responsibility for themselves.”
Fish’s desire to find motivated and driven players materializes in recruiting, where he tries to find players who will understand his message.
“Good organizations are effective because they’re clear about their missions and goals,” Rueb said. “Dave is smart about finding the right kind of kids who are a good fit for Harvard. He doesn’t hide Harvard’s challenges. In recruiting, he sends the message that this will be an adventure, and will test all of your skills and abilities. Kids that are attracted to that message come here with that set of expectations, and those players are happier and more engaged on and off the court.”
Players that buy into the message and appreciate challenges help to create a strong, cohesive team.
“I can’t teach somebody something they don’t already have in them,” Fish said. “I can’t coach effort, for instance. If they don’t have that built in, we have the wrong guys…. I love using teamwork to reduce the parts of people that tend toward being selfish. We can’t be a team until you reduce the amount of ‘I’ in your approach.”
Stovell embodied the type of player that fit into Fish’s program. By committing to the team-first philosophy and by  giving maximum effort, Stovell transformed from a fringe player into a team leader.
“Pete came out for tennis, and wasn’t very good,” Fish recalled. “I used to joke that he was 15th on a squad of 12. But every day he’d work, suck up what I’d told him, and just kept creeping and getting better through sheer force of will. Finally, by senior year, he became captain.”
For his part, Stovell credits Fish with helping him to maximize his potential and become a smarter player.
“In life, you just hope you get a chance,” Stovell said. “If you can work really hard, maybe you get that chance. Dave gave me a chance, and really worked with me and anyone who showed the initiative to improve…. He gave me the belief that if you put in maximum effort, great things would happen. He didn’t give up on you.”
Stovell believes that it is Fish’s emphasis on hard work that has brought him such consistent success on the court over four decades.
“When we had a big match, Dave never told us that we had to go out and get a win,” Stovell recalled. “He always just said we needed to be prepared and work our hardest. He told me to be dangerous. He instilled in us his belief that if we put in the work, it would translate out there on the court.”
Fish’s focus on fostering his players’ personal growth and emphasis on hard work have reaped dividends, but what really sets him apart and has contributed to his lasting success is his desire to learn and change.
“Dave is an insatiable learner,” Rueb said. “He’s always adding to his toolkit, and that’s what keeps him so young and engaged. You would think as an older coach, you’d be set in your ways and have a formula.
But his method has always been to strive, and not to yield. He is always adding a new drill and trying new things to find an edge.”It is this will to improve, this passion for teaching the game, that keeps Fish going. After 37 seasons, he and his team are still national contenders. The Crimson, currently ranked just inside the top 50 programs in the country, has captured the last two Ivy crowns, and, after graduating only one senior in Andy Nguyen and bringing in a highly-touted crop of freshmen, is poised for more success.
“The danger of longevity is that you start repeating the same thing over and over again, and that’s not something I have an interest in doing,” Fish pointed out. “Any good coach is a good student of the game, and you have to keep up with that and try new things.”Fish has stayed ahead of the ball in collegiate tennis and remains at the top nearly 40 years later. He sees no reason to slow down now.
“I love the game,” Fish said. “If you find something you really love, why would you do something else?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting on the road, the Harvard men’s tennis team came home to the Murr Center Tennis Courts to take on No. 59 Princeton and Penn in Ivy League play.
Despite entering the weekend behind both teams in the Ancient Eight, the No. 31 Crimson (14-6, 3-1 Ivy) swept both the Quakers (6-11, 2-2) and Tigers (12-10, 2-3) by a score of 4-0.
The win moved Harvard into second in the Ivy League and puts pressure on first place Columbia as the Crimson looks to defend its Ivy League title.
HARVARD 4, PENN 0
A day after beating Princeton, Harvard continued its success by defeating Penn, handing the Quakers their seconds straight Ivy loss.
The Crimson claimed the doubles point for the third consecutive time, led by the tandem of sophomore Nicky Hu and freshman Brian Yueng, who claimed their third straight victory and eighth of the season by an 8-6 margin.
Penn put pressure on Harvard, as junior Denis Nguyen and senior Casey MacMaster, the 15th ranked duo in the nation, fell to Penn’s Nikola Kocovic and Matt Nardella in an 8-7 decision.
Harvard secured the 1-0 lead as freshman Sebastian Beltrame and Christo Schultz followed their teammates with an 8-4 triumph on court three.
“Getting the doubles point is big for us,” junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “When we get [the point] it really helps us out and builds some momentum.”
The Crimson carried the momentum of its doubles triumph into singles, with all six players taking the first set in their respective matches to make sure Harvard got out to a substantial advantage.
Yueng continued his hot streak by defeating Nardella on a 6-4, 6-2 decision to put the Crimson up, 2-0. It was Yueng’s third straight singles victory and 18th of the season.
Harvard would go up 3-0 on the Quakers as Shaun Chauduri defeated junior Jeremy Court, 6-2, 6-3, at the No. 3 position, before Nguyen, who entered the weekend ranked as the No. 39 singles player in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, closed the match with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Kocovic to avenge the doubles loss.
“It was really the first two matches of the season where everyone really played well from one to six,” Steinroeder said. “It was a big confidence [boost] for us, really dominating the two teams.”
HARVARD 4 PRINCETON 0
Harvard started its weekend slate by returning to Cambridge to play its first home Ivy League matches against Princeton.
Continuing on its early season success, the Crimson defeated the Tigers for the fourth straight time to break Princeton’s two game winning streak, with freshman Andrew Ball delivering a clutch, 6-4, 7-6 win to clinch the triumph for Harvard.
The day started with the Crimson taking advantage early in the doubles matches. The second doubles tandem of Hu and Yueng got the ball rolling with an 8-5 victory, to give Harvard an early edge in the doubles race.
The lead was doubled when the third string team pair, composed of Schultz and Beltrame, followed suit by winning their match, 8-5, to claim the doubles point and stake a 1-0 lead, a point which Harvard coach Dave Fish claims to be a huge game changer for the Crimson.
“Having the doubles point in your pocket means [the opponent] has to win 4 out of 6 matches in singles,” Fish said. “The doubles point is always critical, and if we get the doubles point we turn into a very hard team to beat.”
The singles play saw the Crimson continue its hot start as Yueng continued a successful day by cruising to a 6-2, 6-0 victory, which saw him break all of Princeton freshman Josh Yablon’s serves in the second set and put the Crimson ahead, 2-0.
Steinroder continued the success by putting Harvard on the brink of a second straight victory, winning his singles match by a 6-2, 6-3 margin over freshman Alex Day on court three.
Harvard looked to close out the match on court six as Hu took the first set, 6-2, but Princeton senior Dan Davies would battle back to win the second set, 6-4, setting up freshman Andrew Ball to attempt to close out the match.
Ball took the first set, 6-4, over his opponent, senior Augie Bloom, before going up, 3-0, in the second set with the help of a break. Bloom stormed back to level the set at 4-4 with two breaks of his own.
Ball would hold strong and close out the match, 6-4, with two straight points to claim victory for the Crimson. According to Steinroeder, the victory mirrored the advice which Coach Fish gave to his players going into the weekend.
“Coach has been telling us to go after it a little more,” Steinroeder said. “We’ve been playing down to our opponents level a lot of the times, but our guys were aggressive and committed to their games, and when we have all three doubles team and six singles players doing that, we’re a really tough team.”

 Happy Wednesday (or at least as happy as Wednesdays can ever be)! We all know that hump day means “unlimited freedom to complain about anything I want until my friends get sick of me” day, so here are a few you can use this week:
1) Why is the word “finals” very scary all of a sudden, and yet the urge to start catching up on a semester’s worth of readings still hasn’t kicked in?
 
2) Why was yesterday’s weather closer to one of those portentous signs before an apocalyptic disaster in sci-fi movies rather than reality?
 
3) Why is everyone counting down to reading period and yet it feels so far away? 
 IN THE ATMOSPHERESo the windy and rainy mess from yesterday is gone, and it will be sunny all day today! Unfortunately, the high will only be 45 degrees, so goodbye to summer clothes (again).

As the school year winds down and college application season draws near, so comes to mind one of life’s most central questions: Oh, crap, what do I do with my Facebook account?
Urban legend has long been that, as part of the application process, college admissions officers take a peek at prospective students’ social media profiles. You might have heard as much from your high school guidance counselors or even from current college students themselves, but before you go scurrying to delete that Facebook video of you and your friends having a 3AM dance-off at your sleepover last weekend, hear me out.
As a college applicant, I pulled out all the stops to hose down my social media presence. I deactivated my Facebook, deleted my Twitter account and (empty) YouTube channel, and combed my blog for expletives, painstakingly removing each one. I was convinced—or at least my over-supportive and over-anxious mother was convinced—that each instance of rebellious behavior would assure admissions officers of my poor moral character.
So, I wiped the slate clean. I would be the most un-Googleable high school senior ever to embark upon the college admissions journey.
But after the fact, what I found out was that it didn’t matter. Admissions officers are swamped enough as it is with the piles upon piles of applications they have to power through before admissions decisions are released. They have little to no interest in your (probably mundane) social life and are fairly unlikely to spend their time sifting through your endless Tumblr photos of your cat sleeping. Unless the kind of cooking you do in your mom’s kitchen is of the Breaking Bad variety, admissions officers won’t take a second look at what’s on your Facebook profile.
And you know what? It turns out that Harvard students, and occasionally professors, curse. It turns out that Harvard students party, and sometimes those parties involve the same defiances that your helicopter parents are telling you to delete photo evidence of on Facebook. And it turns out that everyone here has a bit of a rebellious streak—and to be honest, it might be part of what got them here.
Because leaving that profile, that blog, that channel, is a show not only of personality, but also of courage. Letting admissions officers see the series of #nofilter selfies you took during your misguided Instagram phase is, as odd as it seems, analogous to saying, This is who I am. This is who I am when I’m not putting my cleanly scrubbed best face forward. By going all out, guts out, you’re telling them, I want you to accept me. I want you to accept all of me.
I personally respect that. And I imagine the admissions officers do too.
