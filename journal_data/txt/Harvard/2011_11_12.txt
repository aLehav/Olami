After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University’s directly held U.S.-traded securities decreased in value last quarter by 24 percent, falling from $1.2 billion to $921 million, one of the largest drops in recent history.
 
The drop in value comes during a time of increased volatility on domestic and international markets as investors have grappled with a widening European debt crisis. During this time period—June 30 to Sept. 30—the S&P 500 tumbled nearly 14 percent. The Dow lost 11 percent of its value.
 
At this time last year, Harvard’s U.S.-traded securities were valued at $1.54 billion. In the last few years the total value has fluctuated around $1.4 billion. It is unclear whether last quarter's decrease in value was the result of market contractions or the selling of equities.
 
This most recent filing includes only those stocks that are directly managed by the University and does not include externally managed equities. These funds represent the portion of the Harvard endowment that is directly managed by the Harvard Management Company. HMC contracts with outside money managers for the remainder of its equity investments.
 
In the last year, the University has made significant investments in emerging markets—a strategy that remained in place during this most recent quarter.
 
The filing shows that Harvard’s largest stock holdings are in developing countries. The University currently holds $257 million in exchange-traded funds in Brazil, $68 million in China, and $42 million in South Korea.
 
The University’s investments in Brazil represent its single largest holding reported on last week’s filing, dwarfing the next largest investment by a nearly 4 to 1 ratio.
 
Holdings in emerging markets have been particularly volatile over the last several months as instability in Europe has dragged down markets. As of June 30, Harvard Management Company had about 12 percent of its portfolio invested in foreign equities, according its annual report.
 
The University has invested in India in particular during the last year, including $6 million in WisdomTree Trust and $45 million in a Barclays India exchange-traded note.
 
Recently, the University has also built ties with Indian business giants. The University announced last week an $11 million gift from Siddhartha Yog, the founder of The Xander Group Inc., an investment firm. Last year the Business School received $50 million from the Tata Foundation and $25 million from Anand Mahindra of Mahindra Motors. University President Drew G. Faust plans to visit India this January.
 
But according to the filing, the University unloaded most of its investments in the Indian conglomerate Tata Motors since last quarter. The previous quarter’s filings indicated that the University held 80,000 shares in Tata valued at $1.8 million. Now the University has only 10,000 shares, valued at  $154,000.
 
Harvard continues to hold the same number of shares in real estate group Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, though the value of the shares dropped from $52.4 million to $41 million this quarter.
 
The University also has invested $67 million in Goodrich Corporation, an aerospace manufacturing company that supplies the defense industry. Previous filings indicate that the University purchased these stocks in the last quarter.
 
HMC announced in June that Harvard’s endowment saw a 21.4 percent return in fiscal year 2011. This increase represents the first major gains after the financial crisis caused the value of the endowment to plunge nearly 30 percent.
 
The University’s holdings were reported last week in a mandatory quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing disclosing Harvard’s direct holdings of U.S.-listed securities.

This story has been revised to reflect the following clarification.
CLARIFICATION: NOV. 13, 2011
The Nov. 12 story "Harvard’s Equity Holdings Drop by 24 Percent in Last Quarter" did not make clear whether the decrease in value was the result of market losses or the selling of equities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking through the bars of the locked Johnston Gate, Egyptian activists Ahmed Maher and Esraa Abdel Fattah, two organizers of the recent protest movement in Egypt, addressed the protesters at Occupy Harvard Friday and sought to link the Occupy movement to the Arab Spring.
“We are suffering against our regime,” said Maher, who was introduced as the “Che Guevara of Egypt.” “We believe in people. People can do many things. People can do real change.”
“I am very proud to be here,” he said. “We are youth like you, searching for democracy.”
Although he acknowledged the differences between Egypt and the United States, he encouraged the Occupy movement to believe in themselves.
“You must believe in yourselves to reach real democracy,” he said.
“We are here to express our solidarity with you, and with all the youth in all the squares,” added Abdel Fattah. “We are activists from Egypt supporting all activists for freedom.”
About 130 students and community members gathered on both sides of Johnston Gate to hear from the Egyptian activists.
“Congratulate yourselves on supporting this movement, on keeping it alive, despite the University’s attempt to close it off to the general public,” said Jocelyn R. Eastman '13, one of the night’s facilitators.
Activists chanted “We are the 99 percent” as they marched across the Yard, altering the chant to “You are the 99 percent” when passing HUPD officers, who were stationed by Massachusetts Hall and Johnston Gate in preparation for the rally.
At the gate, protesters slammed the University for closing the Yard and preventing individuals without a Harvard ID from entering.
“The University has decided for us that our protest will be exclusive,” Eastman said.
During their address, the two Egyptian activists urged participants at Occupy Harvard to stay committed to non-violent tactics, calling on them to reinvent what they called an “age-old science” in response to a question from one student about when violent tactics can become justifiable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One down, 29 to go.
In its season opener, the Harvard men’s basketball team downed cross-town rival MIT, 76-49, in front of a sold-out crowd at Lavietes Pavilion on Friday night.
Co-captains Oliver McNally and Keith Wright led the Crimson to victory, notching a combined 18 first-half points to help Harvard grab a commanding 15-point halftime lead.
Despite strong second-half post play from Engineer (0-1) forward Will Tashman, who finished with a team-high 16 points, the Crimson’s lead was never threatened, as Harvard (1-0) cruised to the 27-point win—its largest margin of victory since besting Columbia by 29 on Jan. 29, 2010.
“I was really, really pleased and impressed with the effort our kids brought this evening,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think our bench and our balance can be two key areas for us this year.”
Four Crimson players—Wright, McNally, junior Kyle Casey, and sophomore Laurent Rivard—scored in double figures. Rivard, who notched four second-half three-pointers, finished with a team-high 16 points.
But it was the Crimson’s defense that truly got the job done, forcing 19 turnovers and giving up just 49 points, its stingiest performance since topping Holy Cross, 72-49, last November.
“We showed that we’re going to be a tough, tough team to score on,” said Wright, who finished with 13 points on six-of-eight shooting.
Despite the lopsided outcome, the Engineers kept pace with the Crimson in the early going. Relying on a pair of early three-pointers, MIT trailed by just one, 13-12, midway through the first half.
But behind nine points from McNally, Harvard went on a 20-4 run over the next 7:59 to take a commanding 33-16 advantage.
Wright ignited the run, answering an Engineer three with a put-back layup.
After checking in for the first time with 9:55 to play, freshman Wes Saunders wasted no time getting in on the action, taking it to the basket off an up-fake and finishing an and-one layup on his first collegiate possession.
“I thought Wes Saunders gave us some really good minutes—how he can put the ball on the floor and make a play for himself and others,” said Amaker of the highly-touted rookie, who finished with two points, three rebounds, and three assists in 10 minutes.
On MIT’s next trip down the court, junior point guard Brandyn Curry came up with a steal and tossed the ball ahead to Wright, who finished the play with a two-handed slam to put the Crimson ahead, 17-12.
The Engineers coughed it up again on their next possession, allowing the Crimson to get back out in transition. This time it was McNally who finished at the rim, giving Harvard the 19-12 lead and forcing MIT coach Larry Anderson to burn a timeout.
Coming out of the timeout, Tashman answered with a layup, but the Crimson continued to increase its lead.
Rookie Steve Moundou-Missi made his presence felt, swatting a layup attempt from MIT forward Noel Hollingsworth and then finishing an up-and-under layup on the other end to put the Crimson up by nine.
“Steve’s block really ignited us,” Wright said. “That really set the tone for the rest of the game.”
The Crimson’s lead never dipped below 10 for the rest of the game.
In the second half, Rivard put on a shooting clinic, knocking down three treys and a mid-range jumper late in the game to lead Harvard on a personal 11-0 run.
“I almost air-balled my third [three-point attempt], but I just forgot about it, and I kept shooting it, and guys kept finding me,” said Rivard who went 4-of-6 from beyond the arc.
“He’s the best shooter on the team—one of the best shooters in the nation,” Wright said. “When he’s open, we expect him to shoot. We weren’t really surprised. We were kind of laughing, smiling, enjoying it.”
But the Crimson players weren’t smiling midway through the second half, when the Engineers’ frontcourt duo of Tashman and Hollingsworth started to have its way in the post, combining for 16 second-half points.
“I think we have to do a better job up front in our post defense,” Amaker said. “Give them credit for what they were able to do and how they got the ball in the interior, but we have to be better up front with the people we’re going to face.”
Despite MIT’s success in the post, the Crimson’s lead was never threatened, as Harvard went up by as many as 31 with under six minutes to play.
With the win, the Crimson extended its winning streak at Lavietes Pavilion to 18 games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As  Yale freshman Mollie Rogers’ perfectly placed final kill landed in the  middle of four Harvard players to seal a convincing victory over the Crimson (11-12, 4-9 Ivy), the Bulldogs (18-5, 12-1) began celebrating  not only a 3-0 win over an archrival, but also an Ivy League championship.
The Bulldogs were presented with their second consecutive Ancient Eight  championship trophy—their third in four years—at the Malkin Athletic Center after taking down Harvard, 25-20, 25-18, 25-13.
After a back-and-forth first set, Yale controlled the play for  the rest of the game, winning the next two sets handily.
“You just can’t make that one mistake in such a game of momentum,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said.
While it initially seemed like it would be a closely contested match,  as Harvard traded points with the Bulldogs, a few missed kill  opportunities and consistent Yale outside hitting proved to be too much  for the Crimson.
Rogers and freshman Allie Frappier led Yale with 17 and 11 kills, respectively.
There were bright spots for the Crimson, as freshman Kristen  Casey recorded  seven kills and 13 digs, and captain Christine Wu tallied 16 digs.
“We passed very well, our defense was very good," Weiss said. "We had a lot of high percentages, they just beat us."

Despite the absence of three of its players and Harvard coach Katey Stone, the Crimson women's hockey team (3-0, 3-0 ECAC) continued its winning ways Friday night, taking down ECAC rival Colgate (4-6-1, 1-2-1), 2-0, at Starr Rink.
Junior goaltender Laura Bellamy stole the show for Harvard, recording 20 saves on the way to her first shutout of the season.
The Crimson got the scoring started off early, as sophomore forward Elizabeth Parker netted a pass from classmate Gina McDonald in the first minute of play.
Down a goal in the final minutes of the third period, the Raiders pulled goaltender Kimberly Sass, and Harvard was able to capitalize on the empty net. Sophomore forward Lyndsey Fry tallied the assurance goal at 19:09 in the final frame on a pass from a junior forward Kaitlin Spurling.
Junior defenseman Josephine Pucci, freshman defenseman Michelle Picard, junior forward Jillian Dempsey, and Stone will return to action for the Crimson after finishing up competition for Team USA in this weekend's Four Nations Cup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third game in a row, the Harvard men’s hockey team found itself in a hole early on. And in its biggest contest of the season so far, the Crimson was in its biggest hole yet, down by three goals at the end of the first period.
But like in its first two contests, Harvard (0-2-1, 0-2-1 ECAC) battled back, whittling the Big Red (2-2-0, 2-1-0) lead to one. That’s as close as Harvard would get, as a late Cornell goal gave the visiting Big Red a 4-2 victory Friday night in front of a packed Bright Hockey Center.
“Our guys worked really hard and stayed with a tough situation early and really battled back and made it a game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “It’s disappointing to lose, but I’m proud of the way we responded.”
“For the first five minutes and the last 40 minutes, we played our hearts out,” Donato added.
The scoring began just five minutes into the contest. Sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard blocked a long-range shot from Cornell’s Jacob MacDonald, but Girard couldn’t hang on to the puck, and Big Red forward Cole Bardreau knocked the rebound past the sophomore to give Cornell the early advantage.
Tensions ran high the whole contest, and just a minute later, junior forward David Valek laid a vicious check on a Big Red forward. A scrum ensued, during which junior forward Alex Killorn grabbed an opposing player’s facemask. Charged with a game misconduct and a facemask infraction, Killorn gave Cornell a five-minute power play and was ejected from the contest.
The penalty proved to be a critical blunder, and the visitors capitalized. Scoring twice in the next five minutes, the Big Red opened up a commanding 3-0 lead by the end of the period. Overall, Cornell dominated the frame, outshooting Harvard, 18-3.
Thanks to Killorn’s penalty, Harvard also lost one of its most dangerous forwards. The junior currently leads the Crimson in goals, and last year his 15 goals paced the team.
“[Killorn] is a key guy in our power play, and probably up front is our leading ice time guy,” Donato said. “[Losing him] hurt.”
In the second period, Harvard rebounded sharply. Freshman Stephen Michalek replaced Girard in goal, and the defense settled down, limiting the Big Red to just four shots on goal.
And finally, despite the loss of its stalwart, the Harvard offense found its groove.
On a power play 6:16 into the second frame, junior defenseman Danny Biega fired a shot from the point towards the left side of the goal.  Junior forward Marshall Everson redirected Biega’s attempt past Cornell goaltender Andy Iles and into the back of the net, putting the Crimson on the board.
“It kind of feels like a broken play,” Everson said of the goal. “[Because] of all the confusion, I was a little open in front, and Danny threw one on and I was able to get a pretty good piece of it. I think with the screen involved, I don’t think the goalie ever saw it.”
Thirteen minutes later, Harvard took advantage of the power play once again. With just 11 seconds left on the clock in the period, junior forward Alex Fallstrom knocked another rebounded shot past the Big Red netminder.
But after clawing back to within one goal of the Big Red, Harvard would get no closer. Despite controlling possession and outshooting its opponents, 7-4, in the final frame, the Crimson couldn’t get the puck past Iles, who made a number of impressive stops on the night.
“[Iles] played well tonight,” Everson said. “There’s countless times when he…made some really big saves.”
One of Iles’ biggest saves came late in the third period on a shot by freshman forward Colin Blackwell. With less than four minutes left on the clock, Blackwell attacked from Iles’ right, lobbing the puck to himself to avoid a Cornell defender and then skillfully hitting the puck towards the Big Red goaltender.
But Iles blocked the shot, and the Big Red attack responded quickly. Just a few moments later, Cornell’s Brian Ferlin found John Esposito in front of goal, and Esposito knocked it past Michalek to give the visitors the commanding 4-2 lead with just 3:30 left to go.
Some final Crimson attempts at goal proved fruitless, giving Cornell its sixth victory over Harvard in its past seven tries.
“Going into the third period, we were [feeling] positive,” Everson said. “It’s tough not to get all the way back into the game and tie it up and win it later.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 59 minutes, Harvard and No. 18 Colgate were evenly matched at Bright Hockey Center, and neither side dominated the tightly contested game.
But in a stretch of just 41 seconds in the second period, the Crimson (1-2-1, 1-2-1 ECAC) men’s hockey team did more than enough to make up for a stalemate in the rest of the game, beating Colgate (6-4-1, 2-2-0), 4-2.
With under four minutes left in the second period and down by one, freshman defenseman Patrick McNally knocked one past the Raiders defense and into the net to tie the game at two.
And only seconds later, senior center Alex Killorn took a shot from a tough angle along the side of the goal, sneaking it just past Colgate goalie Eric Mihalek to give Harvard a 3-2 lead, its first of the night.
The Crimson added another score in the third period—a powerful strike from freshman left wing Colin Blackwell—to push Harvard’s lead to two, and the Raiders never recovered.
After coming in as a substitute against Colgate on Friday, freshman goalkeeper Steve Michalek had another solid game in the net, surrendering a goal early in the first period and again in the second, but shutting the Raiders down in the final period.
Both sides were penalized heavily all night, but neither team could capitalize on its power play chances until the second period. Late in that frame, Colgate right wing Nick Prockow was hit with a major penalty for grasping the facemask, a five minute infraction that gave Harvard a man up for the final minutes of the period.
Up to that point, the Crimson struggled all night on the power play. But down by one, Harvard scored two with the one-man advantage en route to its first win of the year.

Occupy Harvard's Media and Outreach team has launched a website intended to facilitate communication between occupiers and the rest of Harvard community. The website includes a statement of purpose, a frequently asked questions section, and an online forum meant to function as an "electronic general assembly."
In addition to the site, Occupy Harvard maintains a frequently-updated Twitter feed.
The website and the Twitter feed are meant to clarify the occupation's goals and to enable a dialogue between participants and students for whom the occupation's message is unclear.
"We want to give people the ability to access basic information about us and find a way of interacting with us," said Nathaniel W. Donahue '15, a member of the Media and Outreach team. "The goal is to give people a way of understanding what we're about and what's going on with us."
In addition to online platforms, Occupy Harvard recently set up an information desk just outside the tent city and encourages people with questions to stop by.
