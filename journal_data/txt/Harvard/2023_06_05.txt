Mary Louise Kelly ’93, a journalist and co-host of NPR’s flagship news program All Things Considered, defended the value of journalism during her keynote speech at the Harvard Alumni Day on Friday.
Kelly’s remarks concluded the second annual Harvard Alumni Day, an event that replaced the annual meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association, which was traditionally held on the afternoon of Commencement. The ceremony also included speeches from outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow and HAA President Allyson C. Mendenhall ’90.
Kelly opened her keynote speech by describing her own graduation with the Class of 1993 in detail and discussing the protests that surrounded that year’s Commencement speaker, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin L. Powell.
Kelly, however, then admitted she could not “recall a single word” from Powell’s speech and that the details she described about the Commencement ceremony were her own firsthand memories.
“I was focused on packing up and moving out of Eliot House, and also on this cute boy who I had kissed the night before,” she said.
“I can relate details of Colin Powell’s speech to you today because The Crimson and other news organizations were there to document it,” she added.
Kelly then described her career as an international correspondent and the importance of bearing witness.
Kelly recounted that during a recent reporting trip to Iran, she was working in a hotel room as a firework display commemorated the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, typically a pro-regime celebration. But, as the fireworks were going off, Kelly said she and her colleagues opened their hotel window to loud anti-government chants from civilians outside.
“That moment revealed a narrative very different from what the government wanted us to see and hear, and we would have missed it had we not gotten on a plane and witnessed it firsthand,” she said.”
“My takeaway is there remains a role — indeed a requirement — in my profession to show up and bear witness,” Kelly added.
She also called for more journalism that simply seeks to report the facts.
“Dean Baquet, the former executive editor of the New York Times has called for reporting — not pontificating, not grandstanding, not analyzing — reporting to be restored to the center of journalism,” she said. “I agree.”
Kelly, however, acknowledged that journalism is “imperfect.”
“You strive for plumb, level, square — you’re never gonna get there,” she said. “You’ll always be off by a sliver of a fraction of an inch, but there is value in the effort.”
“The striving is the point — to bear witness, to record what we see and hear accurately, honestly, to try to capture the world not as we wish it were but as it is,” she added.
Kelly concluded the address by paying tribute to her late father — a graduate of the Class of 1968 — and calling on her fellow alumni to “recall the sense of possibility” offered by the Harvard campus.
“What would our lives look like if we lived them as if there were nothing left to lose?” Kelly asked her fellow alumni. “What would we still want to do with our time on this earth?”
“Friends, whether we are back today for our fifth reunion, our 30th, our 55th, our 75th, and beyond — who says we’re done?” she said. “Who says we’re done?”

As it Happened: Harvard Commencement 2023
The Harvard Alumni Association surprised outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow with the Harvard Medal during the second annual Harvard Alumni Day on Friday.
Bacow became the fifth person to receive the medal this year. The four other recipients of the award, which honors “extraordinary service” to the University, were announced in April.
After Bacow awarded the four medals and returned to his seat, William F. Lee ’72, a former senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — took to the podium as Bacow looked on in bewilderment.
“Larry has no idea what I’m doing here,” Lee said.
Lee then explained that he was at the podium to “return the favor,” after Bacow surprised him as a Harvard Medal recipient last year by inviting Lee’s granddaughters on stage to present him with the award.
Lee began his tribute to Bacow by reflecting on the search that led to Bacow’s selection as the 29th president of Harvard, a process Lee led as senior fellow of the Corporation.
Lee recalled asking Bacow to step down from the search committee to become a candidate in the search process — which Bacow only agreed to do under two conditions.
“First, he asked if he’d be recused from the search committee,” Lee said. “Second, he asked me to promise that if there was a better candidate, we would select the better candidate.”
“We made the first happen,” he added. “But the second was never a question. There was no better candidate.”
Lee concluded his speech by praising Bacow for his service in the years since his appointment to the University’s top post.
“The entire Harvard community specifically — and higher education more generally — has now had the gift of his wisdom, his leadership, and his integrity for five years,” Lee said.
Bacow joined Wellesley College President Paula A. Johnson ’80, former HAA Director Philip W. Lovejoy, businessman Antonio Madero, and federal judge Rya W. Zobel ’53 as the final recipient of the 2023 Harvard Medal.
During the ceremony, Bacow also said goodbye to the alumni. Over the past few weeks, Bacow has taken the podium at various events to bid farewell to Harvard students, faculty, and affiliates as he prepares to depart office at the end of June.
Prior to receiving the Harvard Medal, Bacow addressed the alumni audience and began his speech with a quip that compared Harvard to Disney.
“Some say that Disney World is actually the most magical place on the earth. I actually beg to differ,” he said. “Children may enjoy the rides more at Disney World, but Harvard actually has shorter lines — except if you’re applying for admission.”
Bacow expressed gratitude for the support he received over the years from his wife, Adele F. Bacow, and offered some insight into his life post-presidency.
“As for what is my future, I’m trying to figure that out as well,” he said. “But I suspect it will entail some writing, some lecturing, more time with Adele, more time with our children, our grandchildren.”
He also reflected on his tenure at the helm of the University.
“Being president of Harvard is really a job like no other,” Bacow said. “While these past five years have, candidly, not been easy, they’ve also been richly rewarding.”
“It’s been an extraordinary privilege to be your president,” Bacow concluded. “Thank you for the opportunity to do this amazing job.”
