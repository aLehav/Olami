After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Americans, we constantly congratulate ourselves on our spirit of innovation. Yet, we give our government no incentive to be forward thinking about important long-term problems like climate change. Obama and Romney aren’t talking about the environment because we haven’t really asked them to do so.
This contradiction isn’t our fault—democracy just doesn’t always reward anticipation. Politicians are accountable to voters whose main concerns generally include how to feed their families and keep their jobs and houses. And it is this combination of preoccupied voters and cowardly lawmakers that has kept the U.S. from tackling climate change in any sort of comprehensive way.
It’s no surprise that a recent Gallup poll showed 72 percent of Americans thought the economy was today’s most important problem. A mere two percent saw pollution and the environment as the most important problem. Yet, the two problems are undoubtedly connected. MIT economist Henry Jacoby predicts, “People will pay...[for inaction on climate change] in taxes, energy prices, insurance premiums, disaster relief, food prices, water bills and changes to our environment that are hard to put a price tag on.”
We’re constantly flooded with startling facts about rising ocean levels and shrinking rainforests. To those who pay attention, climate change is clearly imminent, and it’s approaching the brink of irreversibility. Scientists predict a nearly complete lack of wild fish in oceans by 2050. At the beginning of his numerical rundown of the current state of the climate, activist and writer William E. McKibben '82 grimly states, “I can say with some confidence that we're losing the fight, badly and quickly—losing it because, most of all, we remain in denial about the peril that human civilization is in.”
Denial isn’t the only reason that the situation is stagnant—for those who are thinking short-term, there is a valid economic argument against cutting emissions. The fossil fuel sector certainly isn’t a small deal, and the world economy is invested in the future of drilling. Construction of the southern part of Keystone XL is already underway.
While economic hurdles block a smooth transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, the carbon tax represents a potent economic solution. The Kennedy School’s Joseph Aldy showed his support for the carbon tax in his talk at Harvard Thinks Green 2 last week. A tax on carbon would de-incentivize the purchase of carbon and naturally force investment in alternative energies. It would provide the economic impetus currently lacking from the green movement.
Even conservative economist and policy advisor Greg Mankiw expressed his support of a world carbon tax in a 2007 New York Times op-ed, but he doubted that a carbon tax would make it through Washington. Mankiw wrote, “Republican consultants advise using the word ‘tax’ only if followed immediately by the word ‘cut.’ Democratic consultants recommend the word ‘tax’ be followed by ‘on the rich.’”
It would simply be political suicide for a Republican to support a new tax of any kind, and Democrats are too busy trying to get rid of tax breaks for the rich that suggesting a carbon tax right now might very well be too much. Yet, logical thinking would demand that our lawmakers push aside all of those political fears for the sake of doing something that makes pure and total sense.
China’s Communist Party recently released its new five-year plan, a strategic move that will end up investing $315 billion in measures for energy efficiency. And because of the one-party system, China can afford to be aggressive in the way it pursues its alternative energy goals. The National Energy Commission has asked each province in China to provide a plan for increased solar energy use by October 15. China remains the world’s largest coal consumer, but these steps represent a significant effort to reduce emissions. The United States is the world’s largest consumer of oil, but political polarization and corporate influence would block any clean energy initiatives of a similar scale.
So while China’s alternative energy plans charge forward, the US is stuck with little to no political or economic push for sustainability.
This problem is not unique to the U.S., and it’s why very little has been done in the way of large international agreements. Recent climate discussions have all failed miserably—it’s as if every time someone mentions the words Kyoto, Cop10, or Rio+20, the environmental community emits a collective sigh of frustration.
Our markets are so interdependent that changes in energy consumption have global effects, and therefore countries must tackle the issue through a combination of domestic policies and international cooperation. The U.S. could help shape the international debate on climate change, but it chooses not to because U.S. citizens have yet to demand the discussion.
Our government spends billions of dollars each year on defense. We stockpile more weapons than we will ever use. But the prospect of entire countries being submerged under water as a result of large scale flooding is in many ways equally as scary as a nuclear Iran. And just like our founding fathers were worried about the political freedoms of every generation to come, should we not be intensely concerned about the safety and welfare of our future generations? And should we not demand from our representatives that same view?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to travel back to the moment I found out I had been accepted to Harvard. I felt unsurpassable and overwhelming feelings of belonging and reassurance. This time, however, I was a Harvard freshman. And even though I was standing in in the middle of the Science Center mailroom, people on all sides, I was not able to hold back my tears. The letter I had received came from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. It was a notification that my application for Obama’s new immigration initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, had been successfully processed.
The tear-inducing feelings I experienced that day did not stem from the weight of the promises contained in the letter. The promises of DACA are subject to the outcome of the Presidential race, and are only as guaranteed as Obama’s re-election. Unfortunately, if Romney is elected, there will be virtually no promise that the 1.2 million young people eligible for this brave new incentive, including me, will benefit.
Although there have been other instances in my life in which I have felt this keen acceptance, the feeling has always been temporary, always driven out mercilessly by an ever-present reality. Ironically, some of my most enduring feelings of pertinence have come through my affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Growing up in the Mormon Church, I have seen its efforts to promote family life and family unity, even in undocumented families. Last year, for example, the church had an influential hand in backing legislation that stood against the separation of families of illegal immigrants by deportation processes. But regardless of my church’s friendliness towards illegals, reality has struck, because now that there is a fellow Mormon running for office, I often catch myself praying that he does not get elected.
Despite sympathy from my church, I can’t help but recognize the increasing disparity between my life and the lives of my peers. Without documentation, the list of things I have been ineligible for seems to grow. It’s a pretty long list, filled with things that may seem mundane to any other Harvard freshman, but remain strictly dream material for me: a driver’s license, any form of temporary employment, eligibility for major scholarships, federal financial aid, paid or unpaid internships, and even the ability to enter any federal building. Even during my short time at Harvard, I have come to find that because of my immigration status, I am ineligible for any on-campus job or study abroad opportunity. For other undocumented students I know, not having these opportunities has translated to not deserving them. DACA has changed this, as it will grant many privileges we have been missing out on: Namely, a driver’s license, a social security number, a permit for work, and the possibility of studying abroad.
Counting the freedoms I lack now helps me appreciate the freedoms I have and helps me direct my decisions. Instead of dreaming of one day being assigned by my church to a mission in a foreign country (Mitt Romney served his mission in France), I have enrolled in a foreign language class here at Harvard. And although I cannot cast a vote of my own this November, I have taken to canvassing in New Hampshire with the Harvard Democrats. But volunteering for Obama is something that I do out of more than just free will. In reality, this election may be the last chance for me to secure permission to work in the United States before I graduate Harvard in 2016.
I’m tired of being counted among the millions of qualified undocumented students who have been let down again and again by the DREAM Act. For years, we have watched the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act stagnate in Congress, rising time and time again only to be shoved to the side by senatorial Republicans. But looking back on the history of the DREAM Act makes it clear why, on June 15, when President Obama announced implementation of his deferred action program, DACA immediately became a new hope for me and millions of other undocumented students.
DACA was created simply as a result of a Presidential request to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Taking this into account, DACA is not a long-term solution to the fragmented immigration system. DACA will actually just place me and other applicants into a sort of limbo state, where we will have to keep applying for work permits every two years and never achieve any sort of naturalization. Even though it is far from comprehensive, DACA is significant step forward in terms of consideration. For the first time, many of my undocumented friends can begin to imagine life beyond the fear of deportation. We feel that, for the first time, the country we love loves us back.
Throughout his campaign, Governor Romney has displayed unwavering opposition to the DREAM act and any benefits for students like me. Fortunately, Romney has not had the opportunity to act on his positions. And as Election Day approaches, it falls to voters to make sure such injustice does not occur.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coming weeks will mark the exciting conclusion of an American tradition: pitting two ideals against each other in a timeless competition of endurance and will. Both sides have prepared all year with campaigns in every corner of the country in front of millions of Americans. With preliminary contests now over, the final two contenders vie once more to be crowned the leaders of the free world. One side draws much of its support from the Midwest, has recently seen a surge in success, and has a solid chance at winning for the first time in more than half a decade. Their opponents are recently victorious, enjoy a youthful base of support on the coast, and thrive off of hope and grit in the face of daunting odds. While there are significant differences between the two, when the dust settles in two weeks’ time, we will still be Americans, standing proudly with a bright future ahead, and united together in that, whether the Detroit Tigers or the San Francisco Giants win the World Series, at least it won’t be the Yankees.
A number of statistical tools have gained popularity in recent years to better understand the chances of both baseball teams and political candidates. There are few subjects in North America more prone to numerical over-analysis than are politics and baseball, and I’ll try to shed light on a few of the more useful tools. There are even those that allege a covariance between the two: Since the first World Series held in an election year in 1908, in 15 of 26 elections, a Democrat has been elected if the National League won the World Series, and a Republican has been elected if the American League won. It’s a nice superstition, but there’s a 56 percent chance that the correlation would be at least fifteen games just at random (though I suppose you could attribute the difference to Republicans lowering the top marginal tax rate on designated hitters).
Wins Above Replacement, another baseball metric, has received a considerable amount of attention this year, but what is it good for? Simply put, each player’s WAR measures the number of games their team would have won compared to a scenario in which they were replaced by an average player. There are a few different ways of computing WAR, but the theory behind them is the same. While traditional metrics like batting average, strikeouts, and homeruns are familiar and easy to calculate, WAR has the added benefit of allowing pitchers and batters to be compared on a single scale, generating more nuanced calculations of how to best win games.
Metrics like WAR were popularized by the 2003 book “Moneyball” and are playing a significant role in the debate over the American League’s 2012 Most Valuable Player. While Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera led the league in batting average, runs batted in, and home runs, recently earning him the first batting Triple Crown since 1967, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim’s rookie Mike Trout led the league in runs and stolen bases with a WAR of 10.7 (an all-time record for a rookie), earning his team almost four more wins than Cabrera did. While it’s difficult to say who was truly “most valuable” for their team, having a single scale on which to compare players certainly adds clarity.
And while political figures are analyzed ad nauseam, there’s one statistic in particular that demands further analysis. Lackluster voter turnout, particularly among young people, considerably skews how representative our democracy can really be. In presidential elections since 1972 (when 18-year-olds earned the right to vote), average voter turnout for people aged 18-29 has been 47.7 percent on average, while turnout for eligible voters aged 30 and over has been 68.2 percent. Midterm elections have been even starker, with 18-29-year-olds turning out merely 26.6 percent of the time compared to 54.9 percent of voters aged 30 and over.
It takes no stretch of the imagination to suspect that the vast difference in results in the 2008 and 2010 elections can largely be explained by the demographics of the voters in each election. One could easily construct a political WAR defined by the odds that a particular constituency’s support would help a politician win an election. Since the WAR in this case is chiefly determined by voter turnout, smart politicians will work harder to represent constituencies that vote.
Even if no presidential or congressional candidate suits your tastes, voting for someone (vote for Big Bird if you must; he’s had a rough year) sends the message that your demographic is engaged with the government, and your voice will matter a little more for the next two years. America was built on the principle that everyone deserves a voice in shaping his or her future. Whether it’s going to watch the Red Sox in hopes that they may one day prevail again or voting so that your voice may be heard, simply showing up is half the fight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sunday saw the kick-off of Harvard’s second annual Sex Week, a tradition started last March after we saw the rise of sex weeks at several peer institutions such as Yale, Brown, and Northeastern. Sex Week is a step in the right direction toward creating a more open dialogue around issues that affect all of us, but that are often swept under the rug due to social taboos and lack of knowledge. Many students at Harvard were not provided with basic comprehensive sexual education in high school, and even those who were are often left with a great deal of questions and a lack of sexual agency that they don’t know how to answer or fix. Furthermore, most high schools do not promote open dialogue about sexual issues, and many parents do not want to discuss these issues either, so many students are left with a sense of embarrassment around issues that are very important to discuss openly.
The programming for Sex Week serves to address both of these issues, offering events that promote literacy and provide information about sex-related topics as well as events that are more focused on de-stigmatization and engendering discussion. Furthermore, sexual literacy can also play an enormous role in reducing sexual violence. The more that people know about consent and the importance of respect in sexual relationships, and the more that sex is seen as a positive, affirming thing, the more likely people are to practice consent and respect.
Moreover, we are glad that Sex Week is happening in the fall rather than the spring this year. Last year, Sex Week was scheduled just two weeks apart from Women’s Week, which caused the two separate events to seem less distinct and served to reduce the energy surrounding each week.
Furthermore, planning Sex Week for earlier in the year means that first-year students will have a chance to begin this important dialogue earlier in their college careers, as well as fill some of the gaps in their sexual education right off the bat. The only attempt that Harvard makes to provide sexual assault education during freshman orientation is through Sex Signals, a presentation that some have criticized for not appropriately addressing the issues it claims to confront. Sex Week can serve to fill some of the gaps that Harvard does not, and is a laudable student-run program that serves Harvard’s undergraduate population well.

Harvard Human Resources announced certain benefit increases Monday afternoon for members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, despite stalled contract negotiations between the University and union. In a letter sent to administrators and posted to Harvard’s labor relations website, Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote that the University has informed HUCTW that “joint funds”—which include benefits for some employees’ child care, transportation, and education—will increase by ten percent for the 2013 fiscal year.
In the letter, Hausammann wrote that administrators “intend to do all we can to ensure pay and benefits continuity for our employees represented by the union,” referencing the “spirit of our long and mutually-productive relationship [with HUCTW].”
The contract that currently governs the relationship between Harvard and HUCTW, which represents more than 4,600 of Harvard’s non-faculty staff, was scheduled to expire by July 1st. Negotiators began meeting in early April but still have not agreed on a new contract, largely due to disagreements over salary increases, health care, and the makeup of the collective bargaining unit.
According to Hausammann’s letter, funding for child care in particular has been running out since the contract’s expiration date passed.
“While details have still to be finalized, we expect that the majority of the funding increase announced today will go toward child care scholarships for HUCTW members, ensuring this important benefit is fully funded for this academic year,” the letter stated.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin declined to comment on the letter.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that the announcement was “not really a breakthrough,” since the University and union had already agreed to extend the terms of the existing contract until a new one was ratified.
He did say that the increase, while “fairly routine,” is important for many HUCTW members who use the “joint funds.”
“These programs are extremely important to the people who participate in them, and it’s very much the right thing that we should keep these programs going even while we’re having a negotiating dispute,” Jaeger said. “[The Joint Funds increase] is a good approach to this very minor question.”

Warm deliciousness will be coming to your door in two ways in the next few weeks as two cookie-delivery-services expand their operations to Harvard students. Insomnia Cookies and Have a Sweet Idea cater to a very similar crowd—college students looking for a convenient late-night sugar fix—and soon, both will be available to the Harvard community.
TWO FLAVORS OF BUSINESS
Insomnia Cookies is well-established near college campuses around the country, including at Ivy-League schools Yale, Penn, and Cornell. Have a Sweet Idea is a local cookie bike-delivery company started by Somerville resident John Piermarini that serves Boston University, Tufts University, and Northeastern University. He is planning to expand delivery to Harvard Square next Thursday.
Insomnia Cookies, a late-night cookie delivery chain, will be opening in the next few weeks, according to the company’s marketing manager, Renee Sarnecky.
The 600-square-foot location, at 65 Mount Auburn St.—under Quincy Swing Space—has been under construction since the summer and is now in the final stages of preparations. 65 Mount Auburn St. previously housed Harvard Square Optical.
Insomnia Cookies will be open daily from 1 p.m. to 3 a.m. for retail hours. Delivery service begins at 6 p.m. and is available until closing. The new Square eatery will deliver for a $6.00 minimum order and a $0.99 additional fee.
Delivery orders can be made over the phone or on the website. Customers can pre-order for a specific time or make an “ASAP order”—the typical delivery time of which is 30 minutes.
All of Insomnia Cookies’ stores offer a standardized menu which includes regular cookies, deluxe cookies, brownies, and ice cream.
Each store has a staff of about 20 people and the Harvard Square location is currently accepting applications.
During the grand opening week, which is yet to be announced, Insomnia Cookies plans to have a celebration with free cookies.
Have A Sweet Idea has been looking to serve Harvard Square for a while. Piermarini plans to start off making deliveries around Harvard Square himself on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, but intends to hire workers for the area. Delivery people on other local campuses don orange jumpsuits and bike from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. delivering pre-packaged cookies. They charge $5 for five cookies, and delivery is free.
Piermarini, who started selling cookies while a student at Rochester Institute of Technology, said he always had a passion for baking. He founded the cookie delivery company in January 2011, the year after he graduated. He added that he is no stranger to Insomnia Cookies.
“Basically the reason I decided ‘Hey maybe this isn’t crazy’ is because I read about Insomnia Cookies,” Piermarini said.
His company bakes out of a facility in Jamaica Plain and offers a few standard cookies including chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and tazadoodle—a snickerdoodle-like cookie made with local Taza chocolate. Additionally, they rotate new cookie flavors each week and plan to offer other goods, such as cookie sandwiches and cinnamon rolls.
MORE LATE-NIGHT TO SQUARE
“We knew that college campuses were where we wanted to get into,” Piermarini said.
Insomnia Cookies was started by a University of Pennsylvania student in 2002 and has since expanded to 22 locations across cities and college campuses from its flagship store at Penn.
“I would say that they’re really great, the delivery is pretty reliable,” said Charles Bagley, a student at Penn. “I also think the cost per cookie is pretty low.”
Both companies have been looking to expand operations to Harvard Square for a long time.
“It’s one of those spaces we really wanted to get into, but it’s all about finding the right space for the store. It’s always been on our watch list,” said Sarnecky of Insomnia Cookies.
The increased presence of late-night businesses has brought excitement, rather than worry, to longtime Harvard Square business owners.
“It will certainly drive a lot of traffic and late-night business to the Square,” said Thomas J. Brush, co-owner of Felipe’s and Nochs. “I think there’s a lot of people out looking for different options. As more options for late night places open, it attracts people from more than just the immediate neighborhood.”
Brush sees promise in a new late-night scene of Harvard Square, citing the opening of a new concert venue on Church Street and its potential to bring more vibrancy to the Square’s nightlife.
Brush added that his business has considered delivery but has chosen not to engage yet.
“We thought about it, but we do deliveries only for catering, not on an individual meal basis. You have to make a commitment and dedicate staff to the service,” Brush said.
Delivery options for cookies have also excited students, who expressed an interest in having more late-night delivery options in the Square.
“I think it’s amazing. Having junk food in my insomniac hours would be amazing,” said Grayson C. Fuller ’15.
“Our rooms are going to smell really nice now,” said Paul Wei ’15, who lives in Quincy Swing Housing above the location on Mount Auburn Street.
“I’m so excited. They’re delicious,” said Meher Iqbal ’13, who has sampled the cookies at Insomnia Cookies’ New York City branch. “Because they deliver late at night, they’re popular among college students.”
When the cold winter months strike the Square, students will not have to leave their dorms to get fresh-baked treats.
“It makes student life a little easier a little more convenient,” said Robert C. Julien ’14.

Students gathered to discuss issues about sex and relationships in a workshop titled “Unsupervised” on Tuesday night as part of the second annual Sex Week at Harvard. The workshop was meant to provide a safe environment to talk about sex as a small group.
“We, as a culture, are not comfortable about sex,” said Shira Cahn-Lipman, the manager of youth education at the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, who led the workshop. “We are sexual beings; it’s part of our nature.”
Cahn-Lipman kicked off the workshop by outlining the rights of students during the discussion, such as the ability to ask questions and to have fun. She then motioned to the signs that she had hung up around the Sever Hall classroom that read “Agree,” “Disagree,” and “It depends.”
She said several statements such as “My values have changed since coming to college” and “College should be a time for sexual exploration and a relationship limits that,” and asked students to move around the room to the signs that indicated their amount of agreement.
Some students responded to these statements by saying that their values about sex had changed because they had more access to sex in colSome said that relationships can facilitate sexual exploration if there is communication between partners.
“Sex is not bad, it’s not evil, it’s just risky,” Cahn-Lipman said after demonstrating the correct way to put on a condom using a wooden penis. She explained to the group that there are 21 steps in correctly using a condom, including asking for your partner for consent and checking the expiration date on the condom’s package.
Cahn-Lipman discussed the pros and cons of using condoms—namely, the reduced risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and becoming pregnant versus the reduced sensitivity during sex.
“Trojan and Durex spend about a billion dollars a year making their condoms sound the best,” she said, but added that all brands of condoms will change the experience of sex.
Cahn-Lipman spoke about various STIs such as chlamydia and herpes, in a response to an anonymous question about the possibility of contracting STIs through oral sex.
“One out of four sexually active people in our country have an STI,” Cahn-Lipman said.
“I don’t think people know how to talk about sex without feeling uncomfortable,” Sally M. Castillo ’14 said, adding that while she grew up with a great sexual education, the workshop answered some of the questions she had about STIs.
At the end of the workshop, the students running Sex Week at Harvard raffled off vibrators, lube, and books about sex.
Ben T. Martin ’15, the director of social media for the week’s events, said that he believed the workshop was useful. He added that the focus on STIs and the basics of proper condom use may have been especially helpful for freshmen who may not have had prior sexual eduation.
“I think this was a great introduction for people who may not have gotten the best sexual education in high school,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part II of a four-part series analyzing how successful the 2009-2010 reforms have been in making the Administrative Board’s disciplinary process more educational, transparent, and empowering for accused students. Part I, Part III, and Part IV were published Oct. 23, 25, and 26.
When Daniel learned that he was among dozens of students being investigated for cheating in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress,” he set up meetings with five attorneys in the Boston area. All of them told him the same thing—do not talk to your resident dean.
Daniel’s resident dean will not vote on his case, but he is not his advocate, and nothing Daniel says to him will be kept confidential. In fact, Daniel’s resident dean, who like all other resident deans sits on the Ad Board, is required to relay anything Daniel says that is relevant to the case to the other Board members responsible for deciding his fate.
Now, as he drafts his statement and awaits his hearing before the subcommittee, Daniel, who requested that his name be changed because he does not want others to know that he is accused of cheating, refuses to communicate directly with his resident dean.
Daniel’s concerns about his resident dean’s conflicted interests are nothing new. In 2009, responding to a “perceived ‘dual role’” of resident deans, the committee charged with reforming the Ad Board recommended a changed role for the resident dean in the process.
Their recommendations, which have since been implemented, called for the Secretary of the Ad Board, John “Jay” L. Ellison, to deliver Ad Board cases to the accused student, a role that was previously held by the resident dean.
The Committee to Review the Administrative Board also advocated for a “more robust” role for personal advisers—typically a coach, faculty member, tutor, or proctor—whom a student can select to advise them in addition to their resident dean.
But today, with personal advisers rarely used, critics say that these reforms have had little impact in remedying what they describe as a deeply inadequate advising process for students facing disciplinary proceedings.
And this fall, as the massive Government 1310 scandal places unprecedented demands on the resident deans who are responsible for guiding their own students through the process and deliberating on the fates of dozens of others, critics say that the resident dean’s contradictory role is brought into even sharper focus.
THE PERSONAL ADVISER
Matthew L. Sundquist ’09, a former Undergraduate Council president who served on the reform committee, said that the committee’s recommendations came in a climate in which many perceived that the resident dean was pulled in multiple directions.
“There was a general impression among some people that resident deans had slipped into the role of serving as prosecution, defender, and jury for students,” Sundquist said.
Sundquist said that in conversations with committee members, students had expressed a “deep interest” in a greater role for personal advisers, who at that time could only offer moral support in hearings.
“We thought, if that’s what students want, and that’s what makes students comfortable, then let’s get that person in the room with the student” in a more empowered role, Sundquist said.
Today, personal advisers, whom accused students can select from among officers of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, enjoy greatly enhanced privileges. Personal advisers are now permitted to access all relevant documents pertaining to a case, accompany a student into the room of the proceedings, call recesses on behalf of the student, and address the Board if the student forgets to bring up relevant information.
However, these advisers are rarely used by students. Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for FAS, confirmed that “only a small percentage” of students make use of the option.
Biology professor Richard M. Losick, who has served as a personal adviser for students before the Ad Board, said he thinks freshmen are at a particular disadvantage in the Ad Board’s advisory system because they have had less time to develop close bonds with possible advisers.
But although current UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 acknowledged that freshmen face a slight inherent disadvantage in the advisory process, he said he thinks individual initiative often plays a larger role than class year in determining access to advising.
“You can’t necessarily say that time will make stronger relationships—a freshman may be able to establish the same strength of a relationship as a senior,” Bicknell said.
But Michael R. Schneider, a lawyer who has advised undergraduates facing the Ad Board, argued that even when personal advisers are used, they lack the training necessary to truly serve a student’s needs during the Ad Board process.
According to Neal, personal advisers do receive some training. Neal, who declined to speak in person or by phone about the Ad Board, wrote in an emailed statement that Ellison offers information to every adviser assigned to a case.
Still, the efficacy of this adviser briefing is unclear.
Natasha, a student who went before the Ad Board for a non-academic disciplinary case, chose her resident tutor as her personal adviser. However, Natasha’s personal adviser, a first-year tutor who had never been before the Ad Board during his time as an undergraduate at the College, admitted that he knew little about the Board’s processes.
Before he accompanied Natasha to her subcommittee hearing, he told her he didn’t know how to help her and could only offer moral support, recalled Natasha, who requested that her name be changed because she did not want it known that she has gone before Ad Board.
THE RESIDENT DEAN
Today, with few accused students taking advantage of the option to have a personal adviser in the Ad Board process, critics say that the flaws of the resident dean’s role in the process remain.
The Ad Board’s website states that the role of the student’s official Board representative—typically the resident dean—is that of a liaison: “He or she will be present at all meetings and will make certain that you are kept informed throughout the process. Your Board Representative also will present to the Board a full summary of the facts of the case in which you are involved; he or she will not advocate for you but will make certain that your perspective is clearly presented.”
But nowhere on the website is it explicitly stated that unlike certified mental health practitioners and lawyers, the confidentiality of a student’s conversations with his or her resident dean is not protected under the law.
In practice, Losick said, accused students often expect that their resident dean will act as their advocate and will respect the confidentiality of their communications.
“They’re assuming the resident dean is someone who they can confide in,” Losick said. ”I’ve seen time and again this is not the case—the resident dean is beholden to the Ad Board and not to the student.”
While Schneider said he always tells the students who consult him for advice to be completely honest with their resident dean, he also cautions them to be “extremely guarded” in these conversations.
“The resident deans are essentially conveyor belts of everything that you say back to the Ad Board,” Schneider said. “And so if you say something that depicts you in an improperly bad light, that’s going to get back to the Ad Board.”
And for some, the resident dean’s role as a “conveyor belt” is particularly troublesome in light of the current cheating scandal.
While administrators have said that they are reviewing each of the roughly 125 cases on an individual basis, Daniel said that the sharing of information among resident deans necessarily links what are supposed to be seen as unique cases.
“What I tell them could ultimately influence how they vote on other people’s cases,” Daniel said.
But some say that these criticisms miss the fact that resident deans do help students weather a difficult process.
Arthur, a student who was required to withdraw following a different disciplinary case, said his resident dean was nothing but supportive throughout the process.
“My dean was very patient with me and listened to all my ideas and brought all my proposals to the Ad Board, even though he knew they were unrealistic,” said Arthur, who requested that his name be changed because he did not want it to be known that he was forced to leave school.
Every current resident dean declined or did not return requests for comment on this article. But Paulette G. Curtis ’92, who served as resident dean of Dunster House from 2002 to 2008, said that while she was not an advocate for her students, she did not view her role as contradictory.
“Students were always told that we didn’t vote on their cases, and that I would do my best to represent their side of the story,” Curtis said. “We were as transparent as we could possibly be about the process.”
THE LAWYER
Schneider said that the College’s inadequate advising for students going through the Ad Board process undermines the credibility of the Board’s decisions.
“The lack of an real advocate inside the room with a student has really condemned the process to a farce,” he said. “Not allowing an experienced advocate for them really makes it very difficult for them to present a full-throated defense, and I think they really get hurt by it.” In Schneider’s opinion, this “experienced advocate” should be a lawyer.
However, the College has resisted allowing lawyers into the process, fearing that the addition of attorneys would detract from the educational value of the Ad Board by making it more legalistic.
Sundquist said the reform committee discussed the possibility of including lawyers in the process but was also wary of bringing people with a profit motive into the room.
Currently, lawyers are not allowed to be present at Ad Board proceedings, nor are they allowed to advocate on behalf of a student to Board members. Students are allowed to consult with lawyers, and they have certainly been doing so in the Government 1310—a number of students facing punishment have said they may sue Harvard if they feel they have not been treated fairly.
Schneider compared Harvard’s arrangement unfavorably to the disciplinary board at Boston University, where lawyers are allowed to perform the same roles of personal advisers at Harvard.
“The idea is not to get a bunch of lawyers in to help students lie or fib or cheat their way around the system,” Schneider said. “It’s to help students figure out how to frame their arguments, help students recognize what the most favorable evidence is for them, and to help them put their best foot forward.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, identified a newly “burgeoning legalism” in other universities that places pressure on Harvard to modernize its disciplinary system.
At Rutgers University, lawyers are permitted to advise accused students during hearings; lawyers are also allowed to appear in proceedings at Stanford University, although students must represent themselves.
“Harvard’s system is a charming throwback to another era, and it will certainly be tested in what I think is a culture war,” Lake said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst pottery demonstrations, make-your-own-parachute stations, and the strains of a jazz quartet, Harvard students and faculty and parents and children from the Allston community gathered to celebrate the recent addition of an annex that tripled the size of the four-year-old Harvard Allston Education Portal.
Although not necessarily well known among Harvard students, the center is a key component of the University’s outreach to a neighborhood that has not always been happy with Harvard’s involvement in the area. The Ed Portal offers academic mentoring to local children as well as educational and recreational events.
The center was created by molecular and cellular biology professor Robert A. Lue. “The principle here is instead of just sharing buildings, to share people with Allston. These are the things that really make Harvard special,” he said.
The new annex will help the Ed Portal expand from academic programming into recreational activities as well. “The opportunity to bring people together around fun is deeply important, and now we have a space where recreation—and meaningful recreation—can integrate with education,” Lue said. The expanded program will include events hosted by the Office for the Arts and the American Repertory Theater.
University President Drew G. Faust delivered a speech that drew a comparison between the four-year trajectory of a Harvard undergraduate, with myriad moments of growth and change, and the process of development that the center has undergone in the same period of time.
She expressed excitement at the addition of the arts program. “I think that having them here will bring a sort of energy and magnetism to this facility that will only build and enhance the very important work that it’s done so far,” she said.
Rita Vaidya, a local parent who serves on the Portal’s advisory board, recounted in a speech the profound effect that the mentoring at the center has had on her two sons. The younger, in second grade, was recently given a school assignment to draw a scientist he admired. “He drew his mentor, Teddy, looking through a microscope, and wrote: ‘My scientist is a student at Harvard,’” she said.
While some came to show support for the center, others came to learn more about it. Tom Lally, a resident who went to the same Allston elementary school that his grandchildren now attend, said, “I’m here to find out what’s going on.”
Tyreke T. White ’15, a mentor at the center, started volunteering there after receiving an email about it over his Expos list. “I’ve tutored before, but really enjoyed how the mentoring combined academic as well as social growth. I feel like I’m actually a part of the community,” said White, who is also a Crimson designer.
As part of a showcase of the Portal’s programming, which includes a faculty speaking series, prominent ethicist and government professor Michael J. Sandel gave an interactive talk that engaged the audience in discussion on the issue of commoditization, the topic of his new book.
Summarizing the prevailing sentiment of the evening, Faust said of the Ed Portal, “This is an expression of our highest hopes for a shared commitment with the Allston community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Addressing the upcoming presidential election from two different standpoints—that of race and of the contest’s global impact—two speakers at the Harvard College Democrats meeting agreed on one conclusion: Voter turnout matters.
African and African American studies and sociology professor Lawrence D. Bobo first talked about the role of race in the election, saying that incumbent President Barack Obama uses extreme caution when calling attention to problems of race. He cited Obama’s comments about his former minister, the controversial Reverend Jeremiah Wright, and his response to the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in 2009 as examples of the political maneuvering Obama, the first black president, has employed to maintain an image of even-handedness when it comes to race.
“Often the elephant in the room is the problem of race,” he said. Yet even as Bobo named moments when Obama minimized race, he said that race should not be overlooked at the polls. In the 2008 election, he said, Obama received overwhelming majorities of African-American, Asian, and Latino votes.
Hailing from the English Parliament, the Right Honourable Douglas G. Alexander, Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, offered an outside perspective on the 2012 election. He cited the rise of China, the precarious governments of the Middle East, and climate change as issues that make the election not only important in the United States, but also crucial to global politics.
Both speakers stressed the importance of voting. “This is going to be a turnout election,” Alexander said. “Politics is a contact sport and participation sport, not a spectator sport. If ever there was a time that the phrase ‘fierce urgency of now’ was written, it is now. Millions of people in the world are urging you on in the work you are doing.”
As the election draws near, the Harvard College Democrats have amped up their meetings, phone banks, canvassing trips, and awareness events all geared toward campaigning for Obama and for U.S. Senate candidate and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren.
The speaker event on Tuesday, Harvard College Democrats president Adan Acevedo ’13 said, was an effort to help members understand the issues that they discuss on the campaign trail. “It’s easier to campaign for someone when you know what they’re fighting for,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than two weeks after a strong offensive performance catapulted Harvard women’s soccer over Brown, the Crimson will face the Bears once more, this time at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
On Wednesday, Harvard (7-4-3, 2-2-1 Ivy) will take on Brown (7-6-0, 1-4-0 Ivy) in its first non-conference Ivy League game in program history.
Having faced the same Bears team earlier in the season allows the Crimson to anticipate the competition and correct errors made in the previous game, according to junior co-captain Peyton Johnson.
“I think having played them before definitely gives us some things to work on,” Johnson said. ”They have the same advantage having played us—it’ll be interesting to see what happens.”
Harvard is looking to rebound off of a tough loss, 3-1, to Princeton on Saturday that knocked it out of Ivy League title contention.
Prior to the loss to the Tigers, the Crimson had outscored its last two opponents, 12-3, to capture four wins in five games. But against Princeton, Harvard offense struggled to find its footing.
The lone Crimson goal by freshman forward Lauren Varela 69 minutes into the game tied the match at 1-1, but the Tigers struck back twice in the final ten minutes to claim the victory.
Harvard looks to regain its offensive firepower by fixing those key mistakes.
“I think it’s going to be important for us to kind of get back into a rhythm,” sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten said. “It’s going to be important for our confidence to start to get back into rhythm as a team and start playing good soccer and scoring goals again.”
The loss to Princeton was the first for the Crimson in nearly a month, which last saw defeat on Sept. 21 in its conference opener at Penn.
“It’s about starting over because we had a huge setback against Princeton,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We just have to kind of regroup and focus on playing and having fun and improving.”
Although a championship is no longer in the picture, Johnson recognizes the importance of her team’s last non-conference game of the year.
“I think it’ll be a defining moment for us, how we respond to being out of the Ivy League title race,” Johnson said. “The season still matters a lot for our program and for our team going forward, so responding to that loss [to the Tigers] will be huge.”
The Bears fared better than the Crimson last weekend as they put up a strong defensive showing on Sunday, narrowly defeating Cornell, 1-0, to break a five-game losing streak.
Junior forward Louisa Pitney scored Brown’s only goal less than ten minutes into the game, lofting the ball over Big Red goalkeeper Tori Christ into the left corner of the net. Goalkeeper Amber Bledsoe, ensured that the Bears were the only team on the scoreboard, tallying three saves.
In Brown’s earlier meeting with Harvard, Bledsoe was less successful at preventing goals as the Crimson defeated the Bears, 4-1. Led by sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby, who scored two goals and notched two assists in the match, Harvard’s offense dominated in Providence, recording nine shots on target while Brown managed only one.
Neither team found its stride in the first half, but within a period of 17 minutes near the start of the second half, the Crimson found the back of the net four times to grab a commanding lead that it would not relinquish for the remainder of the game.
If Harvard wins against the Bears on Wednesday, Leone will reach his 250th career victory. But despite his team’s dominant play in its first game against Brown, Leone is not taking the rematch lightly.
“They’re very good, very athletic. They work hard [and] never quit, so I expect a very good game,” Leone said. “It gives Brown an advantage [having played Harvard before]. They have extra motivation.”
In order to score against a Bears defense that has recorded seven shutouts on the season, the Crimson will have to find the same momentum as before
“We just need to relax and play how we did last time we played Brown,” Kanten explained. “That worked for us last time, when we didn’t think about what was riding on the game and what it meant for our team to win or to lose. When we go out and play soccer like we know how to and like we love to do, I think that works the best for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team squared off against the top players drawn from 45 collegiate programs in the Army-hosted USA/ITA Division I Women’s Northeast Regional Championships. The five-day tournament concluded Tuesday.
Co-captain Hideko Tachibana, the tournament’s fifteenth seed, headlined the Crimson’s efforts at West Point, winning three matches before falling to sixth-seeded Kanika Vaidya of Columbia, 6-2, 6-4, in the quarterfinals. Tachibana, Harvard’s 2011-12 MVP, is now 4-2 in singles matches this year.
“[Tachibana] is just a really exciting player to watch. She’s fast and also amazing when she’s playing well,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “She had a very solid tournament.”
After receiving a bye in the first round of the main draw, Tachibana defeated Boston College’s Julia Cassellbury, 6-4, 6-1, on Saturday.  The Harvard senior followed that up with Sunday wins over Stony Brook’s Polina Movchan, 7-5, 7-5, and Dartmouth’s Akiko Okuda, 6-2, 6-3, to advance to Monday’s round of eight against Vaidya.
“I felt like I was just on that day [Sunday],” Tachibana said. “Everything just kind of fell into place, and I executed what I’d been practicing.”
Freshmen Amanda Lin, Hai-Li Kong, Crystal Yen, sophomore Sylvia Li, and junior Natalie Blosser also represented the Crimson in singles competition.
Lin advanced to the round of 32, defeating Alexandra Livingston of St. Peters, 6-0, 6-0, and Alex Kelleher of Boston College, 6-4, 6-3, before losing to Brown’s Misia Krasowski, 6-3, 6-2.
Tachibana was impressed with Lin’s performance.
“I think that [making it to the round of 32] was a good breakthrough for [Lin]. She had a really competitive match with [Krasowski],” Tachibana said.
Kong fell in the round of 64 to Dartmouth’s Katherine Yau, 6-2, 6-4. In the previous round, Kong won the first set, 6-0, before Rutgers’ Stef Balasa retired due to injury.
Yen won two matches to qualify for the main draw, defeating UConn’s Srna Stoslyjevic, 6-1, 6-2, and Stony Brook’s Becky Shtilkind, 6-3, 6-4, before losing to Gina Li of Rutgers, 6-2, 6-0, in the round of 128.
Sylvia Li was also eliminated in the round of 128, losing to Long Island’s Sanne Louwers, 6-2, 6-4, and Blosser failed to advance past the qualifying rounds, beating Delaware’s Carmen Lai, 7-5, 6-2, before losing to Drexel’s Marcela Rosales, 6-4, 7-6.
The coach and team veterans feel that Harvard’s freshmen have been adjusting well to the collegiate game.
“I’m proud of our freshmen,” Green said. “It was their first taste of Regionals, and hopefully they’re going to grow from this.”
In addition to the six singles entrants, the Crimson fielded three entries in the doubles bracket.
Freshman Amy He and junior Hannah Morrill won two matches on Friday to advance to Saturday’s round of 16. The pair lost to Lindsay Graff and Amanda Muliawan of Princeton, 8-2, after defeating Cornell’s Laila Judeh and Ryann Young, 8-5, and Farleigh Dickinson’s Dina Guzairova and Anna Rapoport, 8-4.
In addition, Li and Lin teamed up to advance past the round of 64, defeating Seton Hall’s Chloe Sher and Rocio Portela-Berriors, 8-3, before losing to Boston College’s Olga Khmylev and Jessica Wacnik, 8-6. Blosser and Kong dropped their first match to Nicole Bartnik and Crystal Leung of Columbia, 8-6.
“The Ivy League as well as the Northeastern region is very competitive this year and is getting tougher and tougher,” Green said. “We’ve got to just hunker down and work on doubles as much as possible so that we can be ready, not just for these weeks in October, but also for the spring season.”
On Tuesday, Princeton’s Muliawan defeated Columbia’s Vaidya, 6-4, 6-4, for the singles title, and Sol Eskenazi and Sonya Latyecheva of Penn defeated Columbia’s Bianca Sanson and Tiana Takenaga in the doubles final. The wins qualify Muliawan, Eskenazi, and Latyecheva for the Columbia-hosted USA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships, which will be held Nov. 8-11 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.
The Crimson, meanwhile, will now get back to work to prepare to host the Nov. 9-11 Harvard Invitational—its fall season finale.
“Overall, I’m pleased with our performance, but I think there’s definitely room for improvement. Hopefully, this next tournament will be the peak,” Tachibana said.
“I’m hoping that the team can be a little more consistent [in] the next couple of weeks. Our fitness is there, and our doubles have been improving each week as well,” Green added. “If we can improve in our shot selection and consistency, we should be fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend the Harvard men’s tennis team traveled to New Haven, Conn., to face rivals from all around the Northeast and the Ivy League at the Division I USTA/ITA Northeast Regional.
The tournament, hosted by Yale, was the third outing for the team this season and the first in nearly a month. Crimson players faced a tough slate in both singles and doubles, but managed to have one entry in the quarterfinals of both divisions.
Both sophomore Denis Nguyen and the doubles team of freshman Nicky Hu and co-captain Andy Nguyen bested the competition through the preliminary rounds but faltered before the semifinals.
Denis Nguyen, seeded sixth in singles, received a bye in the first round of play. He swept local foe Michael McGinnis of Boston College with straight sets, 6-4, 6-2, in the second round. In the third and fourth rounds, he took down Ivy rivals from Princeton and Columbia, respectively. Nguyen then blew away Augie Bloom, 6-3, 6-1, before being stretched to three sets against the Lions’ Dragos Ignat, whom he eventually defeated, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1.
The sophomore wasn’t quite as successful against Vasko Mladenov of St. John’s, who is currently ranked No. 38 in the nation and claimed the singles title at the ITA tournament last fall.
Nguyen began strong, but narrowly dropped the first set, 7-6. He was unable to contend with his opponent again in the second, falling 6-2.
“I had some really tough matches, and I didn’t play my best today,” Nguyen said after his faceoff with Mladenov. “I wasn’t able to win today.”
In doubles, Hu and Andy Nguyen took a bye through the Round of 64 before defeating their next two sets of opponents. The team bested Erik Kremheller and Cameron Amyot of Fairfield University, 8-3, and dismantled Dartmouth pair Xander Centernari and Cameron Ghorbani, 8-2.
“Overall, in doubles especially, I felt really confident about where we were,” Hu said. “We matched up well together. We covered each other’s weaknesses [and] played off each other’s strengths.”
The quarterfinals saw more stumbling from Harvard, as Hu and Nguyen were overpowered by the Yale duo of Marc Powers and Daniel Hoffman in an 8-6 match.
“We were really able to play some great matches together, especially against Dartmouth and even in the quarterfinals where we lost to Yale,” Hu explained. “We played a very strong team. It was a two point difference in that match and could have gone either way.”
Nguyen had encountered Powers earlier in the fourth round of singles play. After a bye round and victories over opponents from Binghamton and Cornell, Nguyen was upended by the Bulldog, who won, 6-2, 6-3.
“In regards to my singles, Powers was just better at knowing which balls to attack,” Nguyen said. “I need to work on creating these opportunities instead of sitting back on the baseline.”
The tournament was the second collegiate showing for Hu and two other freshmen, Nicholas Mahlangu and Kelvin Lam.
“I think as a team we did really well in competing our freshmen,” Denis Nguyen said. “Our three freshmen that played won a couple of rounds and showed that they were able to compete with the top guys.”
But Hu struggled to find success in the first round of singles competition, losing to St. John’s veteran ace Valentin Mihai in a 7-6, 4-6, 6-2 three set marathon.
Mahlangu passed the first round with a 6-3, 6-7, 6-2 effort over Sam Todd of Dartmouth. In his second test, the freshman initially challenged Cornell’s Sam Fleck with a 6-7 victory in the first set. Fleck swept Mahlangu in the next set, 6-0, and fought to win the third set, 7-6, clinching the match.
Lam made it the furthest of the three rookies in singles. He received a bye through the first round and railed Marist’s Joris Van Eck, 6-2, 6-2, in the second. Centenari from the Big Green broke Lam in the third round, 6-4, 6-2.
The tournament also featured sophomore Shaun Chaudhari, who breezed by second and third round opponents Dalen Klassen of Marist and Venkat Iyer of Cornell, with 6-4, 6-1 and 6-3, 6-1 wins, respectively.
Chaudhari was eventually edged by Brown’s William Spector in a 1-6, 6-2, 7-6 three-setter.
The young team, composed of nine sophomores and freshmen and just three juniors and seniors, has two more tournaments on its slate this fall before play resumes in the spring.
“I think the tournament was a preview of the Ivy League this year,” Denis Nguyen said. “The teams were strong and maybe even stronger than they were last year. We’re going to have a lot of work to do if we want to win the championship again.”

With the Harvard men’s basketball team’s season opener less than a month away, The Back Page is breaking down the Crimson’s non-conference opponents. Each week, we will take a look at two new foes. On Thursday we profiled Manhattan. Next up is St. Joseph's.
In a rematch of last year’s closely contested contest, Harvard will travel to Philadelphia on Nov. 20 to take on a talented Saint Joseph’s team picked to finish first in the Atlantic 10.
When the teams last met on Dec. 31, 2011, the Crimson stormed back from a 14-point deficit to claim a 74-69 victory over the Hawks. Although St. Joe’s held the lead for most of the game, Harvard took control for good with two minutes remaining to preserve its No. 23 national ranking.
While Harvard’s top four scorers from last year’s contest are no longer with the team, St. Joe’s returns every player who took the floor against the Crimson. Indeed, all of the Hawks' major contributors from a season ago are back.
Guards Carl Jones and Langston Galloway, who contributed 22 and 15 points, respectively, against the Crimson, are again expected to lead St. Joe’s offensively.
Now a junior, Galloway will look to improve upon a standout sophomore season in which he was was named to the 2011-12 Atlantic 10 All-Conference Second Team and the Hawks’ MVP for the second straight season.
C.J. Aiken and Ronald Roberts, both of whom averaged 10.9 points per game last season, are also returning scoring threats.
The Hawks, who finished 20-14 last season, lost to St. Bonaventure in the Atlantic 10 quarterfinals and were ousted by Northern Iowa in the first round of the NIT.
But with the team’s core returning, the Hawks could very well go deeper in postseason play this coming winter.

After leading for the entire fourth quarter, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and the Buffalo Bills fell Sunday to the Tennessee Titans when Matt Hasselbeck and Nate Washington connected on a 15-yard strike on fourth down with just over a minute to go.
On the ensuing drive, the Amish Rifle went two for four but was unable to connect with Steve Johnson on fourth down on a day when he threw for 225 yards and three more touchdowns (his twelve TDs on the season are tied for fifth in the NFL).
The loss dropped the Bills a game back of the Patriots and with the next two games on the road in Houston and Foxborough, Buffalo’s road will only get tougher.
In his first couple preseason games as a Rocket, Jeremy Lin ’10 has struggled from the field, shooting the ball at a clip of 25 percent and averaging a shade under six points per game. But the former Harvard co-captain is rehabbing from a knee injury that may be limiting his explosiveness and is adjusting to playing with a number of NBA newcomers. Lin has also made adjustments off the court, recently starring in his first commercial with Volvo.
Although he is on the couch preparing to watch the World Series, former Harvard pitcher Frank Herrmann ’06 quietly had the best season of his career in 2012 for the Cleveland Indians. Herrmann was drafted by the Cleveland Indians after his junior year at Harvard but returned to school during the offseason to get his degree in economics.
Herrmann was called up for the first time on June 4, 2010 and has a career ERA of 4.26. This year, Herrmann posted a 2.33 ERA in 19.1 innings on a one-year, $480,000 contract. He had a 1.38 ERA in ten September appearances and averaged 8.3 strikeouts per nine innings—more than Matt Cain, C.J. Wilson, and Johnny Cueto. Herrmann is a free agent this offseason.

Since this is just about the only thing that prospective students don’t read, we can be honest.  Life is a bit more challenging than it was a month ago.
The glamor of September has worn off and the fall has brought time to a screeching halt. Even though we are seeing less of the sun, each day definitely feels a little longer. This might have to do with the fact that work is getting more difficult.
Oh, but the leaves look prettier?  Sorry to point this out, but that’s because they are dying.  And keep telling yourself that Thanksgiving is right around the corner. That doesn’t change the fact that you’re still procrastinating by reading The Back Page.
Lucky for us, Harvard’s athletes continue to write tweets. Here are a few of our favorites in hopes that it breaks that painfully slow the fall grind.
1. John Rose is puzzled. The sophomore defenseman on the men’s lacrosse team recently asked his followers this question:
“Is a red headed baker also known as a ginger bread man?”
The Science and Cooking professors just called to thank John for their newest lecture joke.
2. In case you missed it, a bunch of rowers competed in the Head of the Charles Regatta this past weekend.  The banks of the Charles teemed with spectators from around the world, but Rose doesn’t understand why everyone got so excited:
“I don't get this Head of the Charles thing. Where's the scoreboard? Who's winning?”
Crew doesn’t exactly work like that.
3. Jimmy Vesey, a freshman forward on the hockey team, is also not a big fan of the Regatta:
“The Head of the Charles is 0% cool”
It’s not all bad, Jimmy. The free five-hour energy bottles are 100 percent cool, as are the free samples from the delicious food stands.
Unfortunately, the “not cool” list is much longer. The actual prices for food, clothing, and other memorabilia are 100 percent overpriced and 0 percent cool. The locked gates along the river are also 0 percent cool.
4. On Saturday, the football team had its winning streak snapped in a heartbreaking loss to Princeton. Treavor Scales addressed Crimson Nation following his team’s first loss of the season:
“I apologize for that one. You won't see a team more determined for the remainder of the season. #GoCrimson”
Turning a loss into motivation and putting the team on your back?  100 percent cool.  We can’t help but think of Tim Tebow’s famous speech following a loss to Ole Miss.  Maybe the Harvard athletic department will immortalize this tweet with a sign outside Soldier’s Field.
Those are your tweets of the week.  When facing the next challenge of the fall, just remember that it could be worse: you could be a Yale linebacker trying to stand in Treavor Scales’ path.

Mid-October means the end of warm weather and the start of midterm season for most Harvard students—but that's no reason for distress. With Halloween right around the corner, now's the time take a break from studying or despairing about the cold to come up with the perfect costume idea. With that in mind, here are ten suggestions for Harvard-themed costumes that will help you showcase your school spirit.
1. John Adams, Class of 1755
 If you have an old white wig lying around, now is the time to dust it off.
 
2. John Harvard's Boot
Exactly like what it sounds like. Golden sheen is optional.
 
3. Jeremy Lin '10
Acquire a trio of Lin jerseys from his days with the Harvard Crimson, the New York Knicks, and the Houston Rockets, and go with a couple friends as the past, present, and future of Harvard's biggest sports star. Be sure to make jokes about taking your talents to Harvard Square.

 
4. Harvard Law School's Six Sitting Supreme Court Justices
Go with your blockmates as Chief Justice John G. Roberts '76, Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin G. Scalia, and Elena Kagan.
 
5. The Cast of "The Departed" 
Since you're just across the river from the setting of the classic film "The Departed," why not dress up as your favorite character? Bonus school spirit points for dressing up as Matt Damon (formerly '92).
 
6. CS50 Student
Wear your CS50 t-shirt and bring your laptop to go as a member of Harvard's biggest cult.
 
7. Natalie Portman '03
More original Harvard students may choose to go as a black swan. 
 
 
8. Drew Faust on Colbert
Like, literally, on Colbert. As in on the show. Get you head out of the gutters.
 
9. The Legendary Lamonster
Be sure to bring coffee, stacks of textbooks, and a handful of highlighters. Tell everyone you see that you're too busy to talk.
 
10. The Harvard Undead
What better way to show that you truly bleed Crimson?

Midterm season is upon us. As students are forced to run on two hours of sleep a night, proofreading papers and reviewing lecture notes, it's not news that many of us turn to caffeine for that extra boost. And we've gotten really creative when it comes to our favorite recreational drug, pounding back coffees, slurping energy drinks, and even popping the occasional caffeine pill. But even if 5-hour ENERGY does get our hearts racing, few students venture to assume that our caffeine intake could seriously harm us.
As it turns out, the FDA is reportedly investigating five deaths linked to Monster energy drinks.
A notable case is that of a 14-year-old girl who died after drinking two 24oz. Monsters in 24 hours (although it was noted that she also had a disorder that weakens blood vessels). While it has not been proven that the energy drinks were the primary cause of the reported deaths, it is worth noting that although there is a cap on the amount of caffeine allowed in sodas, there is no FDA caffeine limit for energy drinks. And because there are no warning labels and no specified number of calories on Monster's supplement label, it's possible that by regularly consuming such products, we might be harming ourselves a little more than we thought. So think twice before you crack open your next can of Monster, and maybe head to the nearest Starbucks instead, at least until the FDA issues a final report.

Last week's earthquake marked the start of tectonic changes in the Cambridge area—U.S. News and World Report just released their 2012 "World's Best Universities" rankings and MIT has leapfrogged over both Cambridge and Harvard to claim glory in the form of a #1 ranking.
In the name of all that is good and veritaffle-ly, how did MIT sneak by? The rankings take into account six factors: academic reputation, faculty-student ratio, citations per faculty, employer reputation, proportion of international faculty, and percentage of international students. But rather than delving into the exact methodology of the rankings, Flyby decided to investigate some more sensible explanations.
John Harvard's wardrobe malfunction. In an act of great kindness, Drew Faust dressed the beloved John Harvard in MIT gear, snapped a pic, and framed the photo for MIT's new president, L. Rafael Reif. Did the editors of U.S. News take note of this incident as a sign of Ivy League weakness?
Spikeball backlash. Recently, the Crimson attacked the sport of spikeball, sparking a vitriolic response from the community. The probability that the editors of the U.S. News are fans of the sport? Low. The probability of at least one editor that is fan? Fair. The probability that said editor managed to manipulate the rankings? Guaranteed. Herein lies the explanation.
Blessings from the Dalai Lama. While Harvard can manage only to persuade such guest speakers as the President of Argentina and Aung Suu Kyi to come to our campus, MIT somehow finagled the Dalai Lama. Having His Holiness on campus must have given the university great karma.
 
MIT makeovers. MIT recently announced that it was gifting the Great Dome with a skylight. Most often used as a site for pranks—a police cruiser and airplanes have perched atop the Dome—perhaps this is a sign that MIT is getting serious about its image.
If Harvard's drop to third is rattling your hopes and dreams, don't fear! We remain #1 in the national rankings, which are most definitely scientifically precise and of the utmost legitimacy.
