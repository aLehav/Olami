It is hard to make it through four years of college without stopping by Widener or Lamont, two of the most frequented libraries on Harvard Yard. Yet although they are some of the most frequently visited spots on campus, few, if any students, become familiar with the specifics of the buildings' architecture. Of several dozen students asked about the number of columns in front of Widener's facade, only a small portion could answer the correct number: 12.
It is easy for the campus to fade into the background, but Harvard is packed with varied and vibrant architecture, and the college’s campus certainly has an impact on its students. Maxwell N. Benegas ’19 said the campus appealed to him when he first visited Harvard. “The architecture here has a very cozy, old-fashioned feeling to me,” he said.
Zak Gingo, Harvard’s Senior Director of Building Operations, believes that campus architecture impacts students, whether they are conscious of it or not. “I think when students are considering going to college, they care about the built environment,” Gingo said. But he also says that students are not aware of how much goes into maintaining that environment for them. “When I was a student, I had absolutely no idea of the massive amount of mechanical equipment, and building control systems that run that equipment, and what it takes to keep those up and running in order to keep the buildings going,” Gingo said.
According to Stephen Kieran, a partner at Philadelphia-based architecture firm KieranTimberlake and one of the primary architects working on Harvard’s House Renewal Program, constructing a university is far from simple. “They are collections of not just buildings, but also landscapes and urban relationships that are built across time and have layers of history to them,” he said.
Harvard’s campus is ever-changing. Right now, resources are being pumped into the House Renewal Program, plans are underway for the construction of a new campus at Allston, and the Smith Campus Center and the Sackler Center are both under renovation.

In fact, according to Alex Krieger, a professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, the university is changing more quickly than ever. “Buildings used to be built for hundreds of years and somehow the assumption was that they’d always stay the same and operate the same way. It’s much more dynamic now,” Krieger said. As the rates of change in education, pedagogy and technology speed up, buildings are expected to keep up. Krieger explained that this means building must be built to be more multipurpose and flexible.
Krieger previously served as the senior planning advisor for the design of the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus in Allston, a long-term project which, though slowed by the recession, is now scheduled to be completed by 2020. Krieger says that planning for Allston involved a debate between continuing historical trends and pursuing innovation. In the quest to find an architect for the new campus, the committee ultimately needed to choose between two firms, one of which presented an innovative building, while the other presented a more traditional red-brick edifice. The professors who would work in the building favored the former, but the committee and President Lawrence Summers supported the latter. “It was a classic case of yin yang, and the committee struggled mightily over the decision,” Krieger said.
In the end, the innovative design prevailed, and that, according to Krieger, is as it should be. “The fact that the people who were going to be in the building seemed to be more interested in the more innovative structure won the day,” Krieger said. But Krieger also feels that as Allston is separated spatially from the rest of the campus, it is well suited to foster innovation.
“It was going to be a major building for a innovative high-technology set of users in its own location, quite a bit far from the rest of campus, and so I felt that it should establish a new tradition,” he said. “I might have felt quite differently if it was being built closer to the proverbial Yard.”
The House Renewal Program has almost directly opposite considerations. The project aims to restore the undergraduate Houses, beginning with the eight river Houses. The renovated Winthrop House was recently reopened and Lowell House is now under construction. With this project, preservation is high on the list of priorities. “Since it is a national registered historic district, everything that is related to the exterior of the buildings really is subject to very, very high preservation standards,” said Kieran, one of the main architects working on the project. According to Kieran, the Cambridge Historical Commission monitors work on the facades, and Harvard has its own list of historically notable interiors. But some creative freedom still remains. “Within the buildings there are places where contemporary insertions can be appropriate, provided they are skillfully designed in a kind of historical dialogue with the old work,” said Kieran.
Meg G. Panetta ’17, who was on the House Renewal Committee as a student in Winthrop, said she noticed the attention allocated to matching colors and wood tones well. “I’m not really an architect so I don’t think a lot about that, but I do think there are some nice smaller features of Winthrop that have been kept, like the stairwells with the big skylights that are just pleasant for people to be in generally,” Panetta said.
While preserving history can be beneficial, it also poses challenges, as old buildings need to be brought up to modern codes of safety and accessibility. “Some of it is the challenge of taking old buildings and trying to figure out how to use them in new ways,” said Elizabeth R. Leber, a partner at Beyer Blinder Belle and another senior architect on the project. Each part of the building must be considered differently. “We’re trying to make new spaces feel new and have old spaces retain their sense of history,” Leber said.
Given the campus’s historical significance, maintaining and updating its buildings comes with many responsibilities. “When you’re designing a campus such as Harvard, which has centuries of tradition and centuries of existing context, you have to be very attentive to that,” Krieger said. “That does not mean that you say, ‘My God, I can only use red brick,’ or, ‘I have to plant ivy around all of the exterior walls.’ It doesn’t have to be quite that literal, but you have to develop a sensitivity to all that has happened before.”
In the end, every construction project, from the Allston expansion to the House Renewal Program, must consider how to marry past and future. “That’s the sort of dilemma or that’s the kind of dialectic relationship,” Krieger said. “When, in designing at Harvard, do you want to be most faithful to all the traditions and expectations that come with the campus, and when can you introduce something new?”
In some sense, however, these decisions are already made for Harvard, by the Cambridge Historical Commission. Many buildings at Harvard are designated as historically significant in one way or another. The undergraduate Houses, for example, are all on the National Register of Historic Places. Other edifices are simply part of Cambridge’s historic districts. “I’ve dealt with the university dozens, if not hundreds, of times on buildings and projects that are as large as the restoration of Memorial Hall, the Fogg Museum, or as small as repointing a brick wall, or replacing a handrail or a line of steps on buildings throughout the campus,” said Charles M. Sullivan, Executive Director of the Commission.
Sullivan explained that Harvard has not always been as cognizant of history as it is now. In the 1970s, the Cambridge Historical Commission surveyed the city with the aim of creating a list of buildings for the National Register of Historic Places. Harvard was at first reluctant, but by 1986, after much discussion, the University and the Commission agreed on a list of buildings and on a set of rules for how to approach construction and renovation of those buildings.
Sullivan acknowledges that historical preservation does place some limitations on the college.  He explained that Harvard expanded rapidly after World War II, but eventually was forced to stop. “The city built up a resistence to university expansion and ultimately around 2010 or a little before, I think the university realized that the limits of expansion in Cambridge had been reached,” Sullivan said.
Given that resistance and the limitations of building in a historic district, Harvard must be very intentional with its renovations and expansions. “The constraints on development in Cambridge now, I think, mean that Harvard has to use its own campus more intensively. But there are constraints to doing that in line with historic preservation,” Sullivan said. “It limits the freedom of the university to expand perhaps as much as they would like in Cambridge.”
In the end, however, Sullivan said that he believes history is worth sacrificing for. “Buildings typically that universities have put up in every era have been intended to represent the best or most evocative architecture of the era or of the university’s mission,” Sullivan said.
Gingo also appreciates the strict rules surrounding historical preservation. “I think preserving historic character is extremely valuable, particularly for a campus like Harvard’s where you have buildings that predate the American Revolution,” Gingo said. “Having a process by which significant changes are reviewed helps keep you from giving into the fad of a given day.”
According to Gingo, Harvard’s commitment to history does not interfere with operational efficiency. “When you think of efficiency, oftentimes you are thinking about equipment like motors and fans and electrical transformers and things like that—kind of the guts of the building, and they are usually hidden away in a mechanical room, like in the attic or in the basement, where working on them does not impact the historical fabric of the building. So there’s usually, at least in my experience, not a lot of conflict there,” he said.
Since 1636, Harvard’s campus has gone through lulls and surges of architectural expansion. Its development has been characterized by distinct periods of construction, each with its own character. “Harvard has a longer history than most and has a very eclectic collection of buildings from every period of American architecture. And those together make an environment that has enormous cultural significance for the country, as well as for Cambridge and for the university,” Sullivan said.

Expansions are often associated with the presidents who oversee them, but according to Krieger power has historically lain just as often in the hands of the deans. With this in mind, University President Drew G. Faust recently instituted design review committees, composed of architects and other professionals. The motivation was a “fear that the university has sort of lost control over its own future relative to its physical environment,” Krieger said.
While they don’t have absolute power, the presidents still exert some influence. “President Neil Rudenstine was interested in promoting contemporary architecture and supported the hiring of the cutting edge modernist architects,” Sullivan said. According to Krieger, who worked with the former president on the Allston expansion, Summers was a self-described “red brick guy.” President Nathan Pusey, for his part, oversaw an expansion in the 1960s that very intentionally embraced modernist architecture, yielding buildings like Mather and the Carpenter Center. “[Pusey] came from Ohio...and he felt a little bit out of sorts with the rest of the kind of long traditions of New England Brahmin leadership of Harvard,” Krieger said.
Faust too is in the process of leaving her fingerprints on campus. According to Krieger, while she has perhaps a less specific stylistic vision than past presidents, Faust does seem to have a specific set of goals, goals that are in line with the changing nature of education in the twenty-first century. “Drew Faust has been kind of brilliant. She maybe thinks less about buildings or edifices and thinks more about how to animate the common areas of the campus,” Krieger said.
Faust supported the placement of chairs in Harvard Yard, transforming it into usable space. “It used to be kind of empty quite frankly, because all you would do was walk through there,” said Krieger. Faust spearheaded the initiative to create the Science Center Plaza, simultaneously creating a new space for casual interaction and joining the Yard to the Science Center. She also decided to renovate the Smith Campus Center. “Drew has focused a lot of her attention on the campus of late, in creating places for students to hang out and interact with each other and enjoy each other’s company and so forth. So it’s not as much about the buildings themselves,” Krieger said.
Farshid Moussavi, Professor in Practice in the Department of Architecture at the GSD, is working to rethink campus architecture in a 21st-century environment. According to Moussavi, learning has moved outside the classroom, become more informal, and become more focused on peer-to-peer interaction. “With our new tools, the classroom extends beyond the interior environment,” Moussavi said. “All of the spaces of a school, including its corridors, have the potential for the kind of interaction that leads to knowledge crossover and therefore the production of new ideas.”
In a world of fast-paced change and fluid professions, colleges across the country have put emphasis on interdisciplinary learning, but this shift poses logistical problems.“The university is structured...into faculties that separate knowledge and don’t really allow for those crossovers,” Moussavi said. “It’s a dilemma and I think that we do need to specialize, but we also need to allow for cross-fertilization and the production of new areas of knowledge.”
Moussavi believes that there is value to interdisciplinary interacting in physical space. “When you communicate on the web, there is a kind of delay between one person writing, the other person writing back, etcetera, etcetera. In physical space everything is much more instant, and I think ideas can flow in a less structured way,” she said.
Moussavi draws inspiration for her model of a college campus from Gund Hall at the GSD. “Under the word design there are three different departments: landscape, urban design, and architecture,” Moussavi said. “They deal with design at different scales and each one of them has their own history and instruments.” But where the school administratively separates the departments, Gund Hall physically combines them.“The school environment puts them in one single space with no hierarchy,” Moussavi said. “As you’re moving through the school, it’s a little bit like you’re surfing through different scales of design. And consciously or unconsciously, I think it raises a certain awareness of the relationship between the different scales.” This model, Moussavi believes, could be extended to the rest of campus as well.

Moussavi is not alone in her conviction. “There is a desire to encourage interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary work,” said Leber, speaking about her work on the House Renewal Program. “More exposure by more people to more fields just makes for a richer educational experience. So even if you have a science building, if it has something in it that attracts people to hang out there, say it’s a great cafe at the base of the buildings, or good study rooms that people have access to. Even a building that might be particular in what it is teaching can still play a role in the greater university community.”
Krieger agrees. “Whether it happens in a classroom or in a lounge or a cafeteria, you should encounter people unlike yourselves,” he said.
In the end, Moussavi says, the key is just giving serious consideration to the physical campus. “I think it’s about having aspirations…and setting your goal at the very, very highest level, just like we try to do with our pedagogy…I think that we need to extend that level of ambition everywhere,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst an ongoing effort in Washington to shrink existing National Monuments and restrict the creation of new ones, the deceptively titled “National Monument Creation and Protection Act” recently passed the House Natural Resources Committee. This follows the Trump administration’s review of 27 National Monuments, which drove many of Americans to argue for the cultural, historical, and economic value of these monuments in public comments.
In our own comment, co-written with Jess Gersony and Amos Meeks, we reviewed over 200 scientific papers and documents to show that these targeted monuments are rich sources of biodiversity, habitat for endangered species, and scientific research. Despite this, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called for President Trump to shrink at least four monument lands and open up 10 to formerly restricted activities such as coal mining. Zinke’s memo and the NMCPA barely mention biodiversity but could have significant, damaging effects on ecosystem health and all of the associated human benefits.
Biodiversity is essential for human health and survival. Stable, diverse ecosystems provide pollination services, water purification, and disease prevention among humans, livestock, and crops. Altogether, these global ecosystem services, which depend on the maintenance of biodiversity, are valued at $4 to 5 trillion. Further, the 22 monuments under review are quantitatively exceptional sources of biodiversity and ecosystem services compared to other land areas. Ongoing research in the monument lands shows their value.
For example, the Grand Staircase Escalante—one of the four monuments specifically targeted for reduction by Zinke—is the most scientifically productive of the monuments we reviewed. Over 50 papers have been published on work done within its territory, leading to advancements in fields as diverse as forestry, geology, and paleontology. Further, this tract of desert and piñon-juniper forest is critical habitat for many important conservation efforts, such as the well-known California Condor Recovery Program.
Thanks largely to protected lands and concentrated scientific efforts, the California Condor is one of the greatest conservation success stories of the past century. The largest bird in North America, the Condor was extinct in the wild in 1987. But through years of captive breeding and re-release, the condors have recovered significantly; now, lucky visitors can see these magnificent birds in the Grand Staircase Escalante. But condors are not just tourist attractions: Successful reintroduction programs like this one improve ecosystem health and have very real impacts on human lives.
The condor, as a scavenger, feeds on dead animals—and plays a key role in stopping the spread of infectious disease. When avian scavengers like the condor are absent, the corpses are likely to remain in the open for longer; other animals such as rats and feral dogs move in to scavenge the corpses, which increases their populations and heightens the transmission of diseases like rabies and bubonic plague to humans. By providing a safe habitat for the condor, places like Grand Staircase Escalante help reduce the spread of disease in surrounding human habitats (and reduce the need for ranchers to manually dispose of livestock corpses, an expensive process). Yet valuable services like these are generally not considered when determining the economic value of protected lands—and certainly not in Secretary Zinke’s memorandum.
The California Condor is just one particularly charismatic example. But these monuments are unusually biodiverse, with hundreds of important species under threat. Rose Atoll and Pacific Remote Islands alone house at least 30 endangered and threatened species; Secretary Zinke recommends that we cut the size of these marine monuments and open them up to fishing.
The Cascade Siskiyou, another of the four targeted monuments, is home to an endemic fish with a poignant name: the “Lost River Sucker.” This endangered fish, known as “C’waam” by the Klamath Tribes, plays a key role in water purification and healthy wetland maintenance. A diverse array of species buffers water systems against nutrient pollution. Without key species like the Lost River Sucker filling their niche in the food chain, massive algal blooms can deplete oxygen, lead to massive die-offs, and cause poor water quality.
The gigantic Desert Tortoise, which depends on habitat in Grand Staircase Escalante, is a ponderous beast which can live to be 80 years old. Because they are large and long-lived, Desert Tortoises are an “umbrella species.” This means that their protected habitat also protects hundreds of other plants and animals—many endangered themselves—including the adorable San Joaquin kit fox and the Burrowing Owl, the Internet’s favorite bird. Thus, conservation programs for the Desert Tortoise in protected monument lands lead to massive, spiraling ecosystem benefits.
Recent movements in Washington systematically undervalue the immense scientific and ecological worth of National Monument lands. When humans simplify ecosystems to“optimize” them for farming, raising cattle, or mining, we produce major losses in biodiversity; this carries negative impact comparable in scale to drought, global warming, and ocean acidification.  We must remember the scientific value of these national monument lands—and the fundamental interconnectedness of ecosystem health and human well-being.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When my mother taught second grade, she would regularly return home around 8:30 p.m., working late hours as part of an afterschool program designed to provide underprivileged children with additional writing instruction. As she worked the nights away, my father and I were usually tasked with fetching dinner from a local pupusería. My father is a tall white man boasting subpar social skills and an expressionless face that mistakenly comes across as angry. Although he understands Spanish—the result of his marriage—his accent renders him all but incomprehensible. My task during our regular dinner trips was to serve as his translator, given that most of the employees at the local pupusería could not understand my father’s broken Spanish (or his English, for that matter).
Our interactions with the pupusería were comical, to say the least. My father would enter donning his stoic face and silently direct me to the cashier. Casually, I would approach the register and order the usual with my pubescent voice: “dos con loroco, dos de chicharrón, dos de queso, y una bolsa de curtido, por favor.” The restaurant would fall silent for a moment as everyone wondered what a man as white as sour cream and his pale son were doing in a tiny pupusería, but eventually the sounds and smells of fresh food and good company refocused everyone’s attention. Minutes later we’d happily walk away, pupusas in hand (and sometimes an horchata or two), eagerly awaiting my mother’s return from work.
From an early age I understood that my identity was odd. Although my mom is your typical short Salvadoran woman, I inherited virtually none of her physical attributes. The closest anyone has ever come to identifying me as Hispanic was when my mother commented that my military haircut reminded her of MS-13. My father disagreed, arguing that my hair (or lack of) gave off “white supremacist vibes.”
My younger brother, on the other hand, closely resembles my mother’s family in terms of figure and skin tone. Oddly enough, my mother agreed with my father’s condition that their first child be granted an “Anglo” name, so long as their second child would bear a “standard” Hispanic name. As such, my parents forewent a major opportunity to mess with the world order by boringly naming their white son Nathan and their darker son Diego.
Nevertheless, my mother was adamant that neither Diego nor I would lose touch with our roots. When we first got cable, my mother ensured that all the channels were broadcast in Spanish. My brother and I were forced to watch poorly dubbed Spanish renditions of Star Wars and “Ed, Edd, n Eddy,” the latter proving especially disturbing in Spanish. My mother went as far as to set our video games in Spanish. Hence why Diego and I took over two hours to beat the first level of Lego Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 2; neither of us understood what the goddamn game was trying to communicate when our avatar kept prompting us to use our “llave inglesa” (Spanish for “wrench”).
At my mother’s insistence, Diego and I attended a K-8 bilingual school. Half my classes were taught in Spanish, and my mother did her best to ensure that we spent as much time as possible with her friends from the “motherland.” Consequently, the birthday parties we attended largely consisted of bounce house wrestling, piñatas filled with poorly labeled Mexican candy that unnerved my father, and singing “las mañanitas” at some random park.
These festivities quickly established that Diego and I were different, despite our shared bloodline. People typically assumed that my brother spoke Spanish, whilst generally placing me in the “gringo” category. Whereas whites never asked where I was from, Diego’s heritage was frequently a topic of conversation. As we grew older, Diego and I learned that the Hispanic identity had not been conferred equally upon us. Diego proudly shared his Salvadoran roots with his friends, taking stronger stances on issues of identity and social justice. I, on the other hand, disliked attending Hispanic heritage events; I always felt like an impostor of sorts. After all, my name is Nathan Luke Williams; you can’t get much whiter than that.
Every so often Diego and I discuss whether it’s wrong to claim our mother’s identity for ourselves. What does that even mean, to “claim the Hispanic identity”? To speak Spanish fluently? To be dark skinned and trace one’s roots south of the border? I didn’t witness the Salvadoran Civil War like my mother. I didn’t have to cross a border or start from scratch in an alien nation. Am I somehow cheating if I claim the Hispanic identity without having shared in its suffering?
Since my mom switched schools, my father and I no longer frequent the old pupusería. To the disappointment of many Salvadorans, my family now almost exclusively consumes Mexican tamales, given the dearth of Salvadoran tamales in my neighborhood. Personally, I feel no need to rank tamales; each kind has its respective home in my stomach. However, my family’s shift in taste marked the end of my brief career as a translator; the tamelería we now order from boasts pretty pictures of delicious tamales for my father to point at. This past summer, I accompanied my father on his weekly tamale run and was surprised to find a cream cheese strawberry tamale on display. After all, it’s not every day that I find food that accurately describes me: strangely gringo, oddly Hispanic, and 100% American.
P.S. For those interested in acquiring a cream cheese strawberry tamale, simply stop by the California Tamales House in North Hills.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, University President Drew G. Faust gave her support to Boston’s bid to host Amazon’s second headquarters. The bid joins over 200 others, each vying for the 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment Amazon plans to bring to its new site. We also support Boston’s bid, and we believe that the Greater Boston area has substantial benefits to offer to Amazon that it would not be able to find elsewhere.
As Faust’s spelled out in her letter, rather than providing massive tax breaks or absurd incentives, Boston’s appeal lies in its thriving intellectual culture. Boston’s first-rate teaching and research facilities, including those here at Harvard, make it home to highly educated students, researchers, professors, and experts. This makes Boston a center for academic collaboration, innovation, and the exchange of knowledge.
Moreover, Boston offers a promising pipeline of young, knowledgeable, and motivated students from a variety of disciplines. As Faust rightfully asserts, not only are Boston’s science, applied science, and engineering students strong assets for companies like Amazon, but so too are its students in the social sciences and humanities. Should Amazon decide to come here, it would greatly benefit from the area’s intellectual resources, culture, and diversity.
The potential move is an exciting prospect for Boston as well. Beyond the economic benefits, although Boston has had success in industries like biotech, Amazon’s headquarters would help Boston develop as a city with stronger connections between the technology industry and academia. Stanford’s long-standing association with Silicon Valley, for instance, has helped them draw students and talent, and both have greatly benefited from the relationship. Amazon’s move would be an opportunity for Boston and the East Coast to gain traction in attracting more big tech corporations and leveling the playing field.
Of course, should Amazon decide to come to Boston, it ought to be considerate of the surrounding community. Bringing in an influx of highly paid workers and a massive office space would inevitably affect the area. We acknowledge that Amazon’s move to the bid’s proposed site, Suffolk Downs and East Boston, would lead to gentrification and affect the demographics of the region. Thus, Amazon ought to limit its impact when possible and avoid imposing itself or its brand too heavily on the region.
Furthermore, the delays in the construction of General Electric’s Boston headquarters should serve as a cautionary tale, given the obstacles that an Amazon headquarters could face in setting up here. We appreciate that the Boston bid has not promised too much as part of its incentive package for Amazon. At the end of the day, however, Boston is a great city, and we encourage Amazon to join our community and call this area home.

UPDATED: October 27, 2017 at 2:55 p.m.
With Halloween just four days away, Harvard students and administrators alike are preparing for a weekend of festivities and events, ranging from the freshmen-only Fright Night dance to Currier House’s annual "Heaven and Hell" party.
These activities, organized by the Office of Student Life and the Undergraduate Council, aim to provide students with an opportunity to take part in festivities free of charge.
The First Year Social Committee will host "Fright Night" on Friday night in Annenberg Dining Hall for freshmen students. The event is modeled after previous years’ Haunted Hall event, which was open to all undergraduates. According to FYSC member Jackson C. Walker ’21, who helped plan the dance, Fright Night is “not quite a rave, but a large-style dance that will hopefully draw as much of the freshman class as we can.”
“As the FYSC, we decided to continue the tradition of a large Halloween event, but we wanted to make it just freshmen because... we are the First Year Social Committee, but also, we feel it’s the first time to come together since Opening Days,” Walker said. “It’s a good chance for us to be a community, as a class.”
Heaven and Hell, an event sponsored by Currier’s House Council and open to all undergraduates, will also take place on Friday night.
“Given that the College Events Board decided to restrict the Haunted Hall event only to first-year students, we believe that there should be some inclusive and accessible social space for people to celebrate Halloweekend,” the UC’s Student Life Committee Chair Arnav Agrawal ’20 said.
Although there was previously a fee of $3 for non-Currier residents, the SLC’s funding has made the event free for all Harvard undergraduates.
Students can also take part in various events sponsored by the Office of Student Life, which include a trip to a local farm and trick-or-treating on Halloween Day. Despite Halloween weekend coinciding with Freshman Family Weekend this year, Associate Dean for Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller says that there are still many activities planned for the holiday.
These events, Miller explained, are designed to appeal to different tastes, in support of the OSL’s mission of cultivating an inclusive student experience.
“We are providing a variety of events for students to participate in,” Miller said. “There are things for people who want a more relaxed environment, there are things for students who want more of a lively environment, so I think just within those events alone, we can support that.”
Although none of the events require costumes, students can express their creativity by dressing up.
“I’m gonna be a Lamonster for Halloween this year,” Agrawal said. “I plan to dress up as a monster and have a big placard on my chest that says Lamont.”

CORRECTION: October 27, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the First Year Social Committee is part of the Undergraduate Council. In fact, it is under the Freshman Dean's Office.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s first-ever Worldwide Week brought together hundreds of students, faculty, and staff in a weeklong series showcasing the University’s impact across the globe.
The Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs worked with Harvard schools, research centers, academic departments, and student organizations to host various events throughout the week, all highlighting scholarship spanning several continents.
The week kicked off on Sunday with an international festival at the Science Center Plaza, where Harvard affiliates gathered to enjoy a sampling of international food, dance, and music.
Mark C. Elliott, Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs, said he hopes that this week will start conversations about the importance of partnering with scholars outside the Boston area.
“Harvard’s stated mission is to educate global citizens,” Elliott said. “I can say pretty confidently that there is no university in North America that has a greater reach around the world than does our fair institution.”
At a panel discussion on Monday called “Are You a Global Citizen?” Harvard professors debated the meaning of global citizenship. Some, like Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, said they see global citizenship as rooted in economics and trade, while English professor Homi Bhabha explained it in terms of morals and ethics.
At a Worldwide Week event on Wednesday, called “The Future of Cities,” urban planning experts gathered at the Graduate School of Education to discuss issues of intensified urban growth and rapid technological change in a globalized world.
The panelists drew on their experiences in Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the U.S. to share their views on urban sprawl, climate change, and socio-spatial inequality.
University President Drew G. Faust, in her opening remarks at the event, said that Harvard’s mission has always been global, but it is crucial now more than ever that the University work to advance its global outreach, given the popularity of isolationist rhetoric in the United States.
“Harvard’s robust commitment to internationalism is not an incidental or dispensable accessory, but integral to all that the University does in the laboratory, classroom, and in the world,” Faust said.
Todd Washburn, Harvard’s senior assistant provost for international affairs, said that because Harvard is a decentralized institution with many schools, the provost’s office is always looking for opportunities, such as the Worldwide Week events, to build bridges across schools and disciplines.
“I’d like to provide a space for people at the University to make connections that may lead to interesting collaborations, and I hope to encourage them to think about working globally or how their work might impact the wider world,” Washburn said.
The next Worldwide Week event, an Askwith Forum event on Friday called “Learning to Change the World,” will feature faculty members from the Graduate School of Education who will present their research and discuss the ways in which it advances the school’s global mission.
Worldwide Week will continue on Saturday at a reception called “Internationals of Harvard,” featuring refreshments and photography, and conclude on Sunday with “In Between,” a one-man show written and performed by Israeli-Palestinian playwright Ibrahim Miari.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 29, 2017 at 8:43 p.m.
Harvard marked down nearly $10 billion in domestic fixed income assets and nearly $1 billion in natural resource assets during fiscal year 2017, according to the University’s annual financial report, which was released Thursday.
The report contained the first indication of Harvard’s investment portfolio at year’s end. It depicts a University investment strategy in flux and an administration that is cautiously eyeing future financial uncertainties. The endowment returned 8.1 percent on its investments overall in fiscal year 2017, a “disappointing” result that trails the returns of every other Ivy League school.
“The new CEO at Harvard Management Company, Narv Narvekar, is implementing an ambitious and far-reaching plan to improve endowment returns, and prudent financial management has the University positioned to weather future uncertainties,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in a statement accompanying the report.
In a year when poor endowment returns and “ongoing financial challenges across higher education” pressured budgets at Harvard, the University reported Thursday that, for fiscal year 2017, it had a surplus of $114 million.  That’s about $37 million more than Harvard’s surplus the year prior and continues a now-four-year trend of netting an operating surplus.
But University administrators cautioned in the report not to expect as high a number in future years.
“This year’s operating surplus of $114 million may represent a high water mark for the foreseeable future, however, due to the broad and ongoing revenue pressures in higher education,” the report, authored by Harvard’s vice president for finance Thomas J. Hollister and its treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75, reads.
Its investments, however, are far from a high water mark. In a letter earlier this fall, Narvekar, the CEO of Harvard’s investment arm, attributed Harvard’s lagging performance for the fiscal year to a combination of “deep structural problems at HMC” and markdowns on natural resource assets the firm took during the year.  Narvekar has launched an ambitious restructuring of Harvard’s strategy since taking over the firm in December.
Nevertheless, the University showed growth in some areas. According to the report, its net assets increased by $1.7 billion, buoyed by Harvard Management Company’s 8.1 percent investment returns “as well as new gifts to the endowment and to capital projects.” Harvard’s interest expense—the percentage it pays on any borrowings—also slightly decreased this year, contributing to the surplus.
For the second year since 2011, the University saw a slight increase in the amount of federal research funding it received. For fiscal year 2017, it received $618 million from the federal government, with the Department of Health and Human Services remaining “the most significant contributor of the University’s federal funding.”
But in several places in the report, Harvard’s financial officers warned that growth in federal funding is not expected to continue. In its place, Harvard faculty have sought relationships with non-federal sponsors like corporations and foundations. In the past year, funding from those sources increased by 8 percent to $267 million.
In a trend that some experts say portends problems, Harvard again saw an increase in its annual endowment payout rate, which was up to 5.4 percent compared to 5.1 the year prior. Similarly, its endowment distribution rate increased 5 percent to $1.8 billion, the result of new gifts and a “collar” for endowment distribution the Corporation recently set.
Expenses across the University increased 4 percent to $4.9 billion, again driven primarily by increases to employee salaries and benefits. Harvard also significantly increased its investments in “capital projects and acquisitions,” boosting the number to $906 million from $597 million the year prior. That money supported construction projects like Winthrop and Lowell House renewal and ongoing efforts to revitalize the Smith Campus Center.

British coin expert Roger F. Bland—stopping through the United States to accept a prestigious award for his study of coins—visited campus Thursday evening to detail the history of ancient coin-finding to a group of roughly 40 University affiliates at the Harvard Art Museums.
Bland, who once served as the Keeper of Coins at the British Museum, spoke for about an hour, taking attendees through the history of the discipline: from simple digging in the 1500s to the modern-day method of using metal detectors to excavate coins.
Carmen Arnold-Biucchi, Curator of Ancient Coins at the Harvard Art Museums, said that she paid for Bland’s visit using money drawn from Harvard’s Ilse and Leo Mildenberg fund, a fund intended to promote the study of coins—called numismatics—at the University. She said she hopes Bland’s visit taught Harvard affiliates the importance of the field.
“Numismatics in this country is still considered sort of an antiquarian discipline. In Europe, it is really part of academia,” Arnold-Biucchi said. “But here, it remains a hobby for collectors, so we are trying here at Harvard to emphasize that it is a very important historical discipline because coins are documents of ancient history.”
Bland stopped by campus just days after receiving the prestigious Huntington Medal Award at an Oct. 20 ceremony in New York City. The medal, according to the American Numismatic Society, is given in “recognition of outstanding career contributions to numismatic scholarship.” Arnold-Biucchi said the award is the “highest honor you can get” in the discipline.
In addition to discussing the history of coin-finding Thursday, Bland also spoke about his own history in the field. He said he first became interested in coin-finding because of his grandfather.
“I had a grandfather who was a big collector of coins, and he got me interested,” Bland said. “He collected English coins. But he said he didn’t want a rival collector, so he got me interested in Roman coins, which are much more common and cheaper to buy.”
Bland said he began his career in numismatic research at the British Museum as an intern—and remained there for the next 36 years. He said he worked his way up the chain, first serving as a curator in the Department of Coins and Medals before later moving to the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport.
“I was very lucky eventually to get a position there,” Bland said of his time at the museum.
Bland left the Museum in 2003 to found the Portable Antiquities Scheme, a project intended to establish a digital database of all ancient artifacts found in England and Wales. Bland said the goal of the initiative is to make this kind of information easily accessible to all archaeologists.
Since its founding over a decade ago, the database has accumulated more than 1.3 million artifacts, Bland said Thursday.
One attendee, Julia Judge, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences studying Classics, said she decided to go to Bland’s speech because of its relevance to her field of study at Harvard.
“I have a personal interest in heritage studies, how different countries manage their culture, their past,” she said. “You get a lot of issues like this where you have people stumbling upon antiquities, [so] what do you do to protect those finds, make sure they are being properly recorded and then reported to those who can handle them properly?”
Judge added she is fascinated by Bland’s Antiquities Scheme. She said she loves the idea of using modern technology to learn about ancient objects.
“It’s cool that this project is using this crowdsourcing information to learn about Roman coins,” she said.

Kennedy School professor Kathryn Sikkink argued Thursday that pessimism about modern human rights is misguided.
Scholars and activists convened at the panel that used Sikkink’s new book, called “Evidence for Hope: Making Human Rights Work in the 21st Century,” as a source to engage in a broader debate about perceptions of human rights around the world.
Sikkink began the discussion by acknowledging pessimistic global attitudes about human rights.  She referenced former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon’s recent contention that 2016 saw “more human suffering...than at any point since [1945].”
Panelists spoke at length about the possible causes of this increase in pessimism, especially in the media. Sikkink pointed to the inherent nature of human rights work as a possible cause for pessimism.
“For most human rights activists, any rights violation is one too many,” she noted.  “So it’s hard when you share that to talk about progress.”
Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker said a psychological concept called the “negativity bias” is partly to blame. According to this theory, the human brain is more sensitive to unpleasant than positive news.
“Bad is stronger than good,” Pinker said.
But Pinker wasn’t convinced that the pessimistic media coverage of human rights is indicative of a decline in the success of human rights work. Rather, he said media outlets tend to dedicate more coverage to human rights violations than successes.
“News is about stuff that happens, not stuff that doesn’t happen.  If you think about what is progress in human rights, it’s stuff not happening,” Pinker said.
During the question and answer portion of the event, an audience member, Kennedy School professor Scott Mainwaring, pushed back against panelists’ argument that respect for human rights has improved around the world.
Mainwaring cited “erosions” of democracy in Turkey, Hungary, and Poland, as well as the United States’ silence on human rights issues during the new administration as reason for “some measure of pessimism.”
Sikkink said she agreed with Mainwaring’s belief that the spread of democracy has “plateaued” in recent years. She acknowledged the United States’ torture program, in which the Central Intelligence Agency used harsh techniques to extract information from foreigners, was a step backward.
But she refused to accept Mainwaring’s belief that scholars should approach human rights trends with negative attitudes.  Outside of the United States, she argued, cooperation among Western nations to preserve human rights has not decreased.
“I’m afraid that pessimism is not going to help us,” she said.
“The stakes of this debate are high,” Sikkink added.  “Progress is not at all inevitable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council released a survey Thursday afternoon asking College students to weigh in on their preferences for the variety of social club penalties that professors and University President Drew G. Faust are now considering.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, who oppose certain social group penalties, sent the survey asking about three different options—eliminating all social group penalties, banning membership in social groups, and keeping the College’s original penalties on unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Under the current policy, which went into effect with the Class of 2021, members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations will be barred from holding campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships.
University President Drew G. Faust will make a final decision on whether Harvard will abandon the current policy or take a different approach. She will select one of three options proposed by a faculty committee in September: banning membership in single-gender groups, maintaining the current sanctions, or opting for an alternative.
In the email to College students, Sachee and Khansarinia urged students to make their voices heard.
“We recently spoke to the Faculty at their monthly meeting, and promised to return in November with an updated pulse on what students want with regard to social groups and the future of social life at Harvard,” Sachee and Khansarinia wrote.
Indeed, Sachee, a member of the Bee Club, voiced her opposition to a ban on social clubs at the most recent Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting on Oct. 3, prompting criticism from some members of the UC who said she should have consulted them before speaking. During her speech, she contended that returning to the status quo was untenable, arguing that “change is necessary both among the USGSOs and outside of them.”
The survey itself has also become the subject of criticism from some who worry it will not be an accurate representation of student views. Jack W. Deschler ’19, a Cabot House Committee co-chair, said that he worries surveys which do not employ random sampling are open to selection bias.
“What I worry about with a survey like this is that only people who care very deeply about it, such as the members of the single-gender organizations, will fill out the survey,” Deschler said. “If I saw this survey and I was the president of [a sorority], I would hold a chapter meeting and require everyone to fill this out.”
Sachee and Khansarinia said that they anticipated criticisms about the statistical validity of the survey and acknowledged that they had opted for the survey to be sent to all students over a random sampling.
“We would likely not get full participation either way, [and] erred on the side of providing each and every student with the opportunity to respond and share their thoughts,” Sachee and Khansarinia wrote.
The survey does not ask students whether they are members of an unrecognized single-gender social organization, though administrators on the Committee on Student Life had proposed the addition as early as Oct. 19. Instead, the survey will only ask two demographic questions: gender and class year.
“We decided to just have two demographic questions, gender and class year, and not to have students indicate USGSO status, because the first two are more relevant in terms of breaking it down,” Khansarinia said in an interview. “We tried to get as much demographic information without putting bias into it, and we thought that this was a way we could do this.”
It has been almost a year since the Undergraduate Council polled all College students on the social club penalties. In a November 2016 UC ballot referenda, 60 percent of student voters—1,820 students—opposed the College’s original sanctions, first proposed in May 2016.

Sitting in the common room of Harvard’s Center for the Study of World Religions, Hindu monk Swami Tyagananda compared “modern monasticism” to standing on a threshold.
“If you’re inside the room, you know exactly what is happening in the room, but…you may not know what’s happening outside,” he said. “But if you’re standing right at the threshold, near the door perhaps, you can look at what’s happening inside and what’s outside, even though you are not part of either.”
Tyagananda has been a Hindu monk for 41 years. During his talk, called “Encountering Modernity — Being ‘In,’ Being ‘Out’,” which was part of a Divinity School series on modern monasticism, he explained the central tenets and current trends of a contemporary commitment to the monastic life.
Traditionally, Tyagananda said, monasticism has focused on “not being a part of society at all.” Modern monastics, by contrast, maintain some societal engagement, according to Tyagananda.
“That’s where I locate myself, and also where other modern monatisticists who are more or less in the same situation that I’m in,” said Tyagananda. “I’m still a part of society — I drove to come here, I use a computer.”
Hal Edmonson, host of the talk and a student at the Harvard Divinity School, said the monasticism series aims “to show the diversity of contemplative practices that exists in Boston and around the world, and what that wisdom has to offer to a very complex moment in our history.”
Tyagananda spoke of the Hindu concept of karma, arguing that though some have called karma “controversial,” it is not a disempowering idea.
“We reap what we sow. If we have done something good, well, we have done something to deserve it, and if we experience something bad, we have contributed in some way to the feeling and suffering we have to see,” he said. “But karma is not fatalism or just depending on our destiny, karma is taking our lives in our own hands.”
Tyagananda also talked about interfaith dialogues, criticizing a hesitance to address difficult topics.
“Everybody is so careful to be politically correct and not to offend other people...But when we all go home, we do so with all of our biases and prejudices intact,” he said.
K.C. Mcconnell, also a Harvard Divinity School student, said that she found Tyagananda’s talk illuminating.
“I think it's really important we have these events at Harvard Divinity School, because we talk about interfaith, and yet we don't always see that played out,” McConnell said. “We see certain groups of people not getting as much representation in an academic sense. So, I think it is really important to have someone come and talk about it, because there are so many questions and misconceptions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six members of the Supreme Court—one former and five current Justices—kicked off a marquee event of the Law School’s year-long bicentennial celebrations Thursday in Sanders Theatre.
The Justices, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76 and former Law School dean Elena Kagan, all attended the Law School as students and returned for the evening.
The event, billed “HLS in the World,” featured remarks and a question and answer session between the Justices and current Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82. Manning, who introduced the Justices, spoke about the school’s outsized presence on the Court and in other high-profile institutions.
“Our alumni are leaders in area after area, field after field, year after year, and now we can say century after century,” Manning said. “What’s so cool about all of this is, if you step back, you will quickly see that Harvard lawyers are often the leading voice on all sides of the important issues that society and the world face.”
The Justices discussed the experiences that prepared them best for serving on the bench, listed former Justices they’d most like to have a meal with, and recounted memories of their days at Harvard Law School.
Discussing the more technical aspects of her job, Kagan compared her approach in writing decisions for the Court to her time as a professor at the Law School.
“What we’re trying to do is explain really complicated things to people who are interested, who want to understand them, but don’t necessarily have that knowledge right then and there,” Kagan said. “I think it’s a lot like what I would do when I would think about preparing for class.”
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy followed, expanding on the Court’s intentions with each of its rulings.
“We write in order to inspire allegiance to the result,” Kennedy said.
The Justices also brought their sense of humor to the conversation—Roberts opened by remarking that “a minority of my colleagues send their regrets,” referring to the four current Justices without Harvard Law School degrees. David H. Souter ’61, a former Justice, told a story about ending up in University Health services after staging a fake sword duel during his days as a Freshman Proctor. Kagan revealed that she doesn’t use contractions when writing majority opinions, only in dissenting opinions where “you can let go a little bit more.”
The Justices also offered advice to current students and alumni. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that he most respects lawyers who contribute to society.
“You step back a little, and those I admire particularly, [lawyers who] spent part of their career...in public service, not entirely private,” Breyer said. “They were part of the community. There are so many ways to be part of the community.”
Justice Neil M.T. Gorsuch, the Court’s newest addition, emphasized the importance of hard work in pursuing a legal profession.
“It’s tough to be a lawyer. Those nights in Langdell, they pay off. They’re worth it,” Gorsuch said. “To know the law, to be able to serve your client well, requires a certain amount of hard work.”
The summit’s events continue Friday and feature more than 60 sessions with speakers, including current senators, federal judges, academics, and alumni from a variety of legal backgrounds.

This is part V in a six-part series on Harvard's next president. Part I can be read here, part II can be read here, part III can be read here, part IV can be read here, and part VI can be read here.
Princeton may be more highly ranked, and Stanford more selective, but Harvard has long held tight to the one title that some say matters most: world’s wealthiest university.
Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment is larger than half the world’s economies. If Harvard were a person, it would be the world’s fifteenth richest.
With its assets comes more than just bragging rights: Harvard uses its endowment to attract the world’s best scholars, fund cutting-edge research, and support all the vital functions of the university, from libraries to financial aid. In many ways, according to longtime donor Paul J. Zofnass ’69, Harvard is able to remain on top in the increasingly crowded higher education market because of its unparalleled wealth.
“The prestige doesn’t last forever. Fortunately, the prestige of Harvard has been lasting 350 or 380 years, but it’s not guaranteed,” Zofnass said. “You can’t maintain the number one position without being financially successful.”
In short, Zofnass said, “Money does talk.”
The University grows its wealth in two main ways. First, it solicits donations from alumni and other philanthropists across the globe. Then, it invests those gifts in a variety of financial markets to further build the endowment.
On the first point, Harvard has long excelled. The University bears the name of donor John Harvard, who gave 779 pounds and his book collection to the fledgling school back in 1638. And over the intervening centuries, the donations haven’t stopped: University President Drew G. Faust has overseen Harvard’s most successful capital campaign to date, taking in over $8 billion and smashing higher education records. 
But on the second point, Harvard has floundered, turning in consistently “disappointing” endowment returns with material consequences across the University. Harvard Management Company, the University’s investment arm tasked with growing the endowment, has been forced to undergo some institutional soul-searching after years of falling behind peer institutions: This year, the gap between Harvard’s and Yale’s endowments narrowed to within $10 billion.
On top of it all, threats to federal funding, sometimes-fraught alumni relations, and mushrooming costs have led some to worry that Harvard’s financial dominance may be on increasingly fragile ground.
As Faust’s tenure draws to a close and the University looks to choose its next president, some donors, alumni, and industry experts say Harvard should choose a leader with a healthy Rolodex and financial acumen.
“Things change very fast in the world today, and not that money absolutely can buy everything and solve all problems, but I can say that without capital, you’ve got a real tough challenge,” Zofnass said.
Former University President Derek C. Bok never saw himself as a fundraiser.
Bok, who was Harvard's president from 1971 until 1991 and once again on an interim basis in 2006 and 2007, was initially reluctant to accept the presidency—“I don’t like fundraising and wouldn’t be any good at it,” he recalled saying. But the reply came: “If you lead Harvard properly, the fundraising will take care of itself.”
“That was a bit of an exaggeration then, but no one with a straight face would dream of making a statement like that to any college president today,” Bok said. “Fundraising—not just at Harvard but everywhere—has become a major preoccupation of time, and an absolute necessity in order to keep universities operating and functioning well.”
The immense infrastructure devoted to fundraising at Harvard today is reflected in the University’s yearly financials. According to Bok, when he took office in 1971, Harvard brought in about $50 million at most in annual donations. This past fiscal year alone, the University collected $1.3 billion in total gifts. Over the course of the campaign, the University has also started renaming schools in the honor of mammoth donations, most recently after John A. Paulson donated $400 million to rename the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in 2015.
To raise billions in the “One Harvard” campaign, Faust travelled the globe, hobnobbing with alumni and courting donors to fund projects like the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus in Allston and undergraduate House renewal. With the campaign drawing to a close and those buckets still unfilled, donors and experts say fundraising will not—and cannot—stop after Faust’s departure.
“The University has an insatiable appetite for money,” said frequent donor Mitchell L. Dong ’75. “They could raise ten times more and still put it to good use. So they shouldn’t stop.”
Beyond unfinished projects, some donors also said they were concerned about the federal funding cuts proposed by President Donald Trump’s administration—Trump has suggested significant cuts to the National Institutes of Health and proposed to eliminate funding for for the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities altogether.
“As you know, we have a lot of turmoil in the relationship between the government and education,” said Anthony M. Lamport ’57, a longstanding donor. “That’s a real challenge.”
To keep the donations rolling in, some say soliciting gifts will constitute a significant part of the next University president’s day-to-day. Philippe G. Hills, president of financial consulting firm Marts & Lundy, said Harvard’s next leader would need experience in fundraising—“the more the better.”
“If we look around the country right now, university presidents are spending 25, 30 percent of their time doing fundraising,” Hills said. “They need to feel comfortable doing it, and they need to be able to talk about what the vision and future of the institution is going to be so people will make those gifts.”
More broadly, many experts and donors also cited the importance of alumni relations to the University’s fundraising efforts. Lamport, who has given to House renewal and financial aid, agreed that fundraising is now “part of the job.”
“Meeting with fundraisers is something that makes [donors] feel secure and wanted and desirous of giving funds to Harvard,” Lamport said.
“You need to have somebody who’s very good at working with alumni, government funders, foundations, and so forth,” agreed David L. Yermack ’85, a finance professor at New York University. “Whoever becomes the new president is going to spend most of their time raising money and cultivating donor relationships.”
But Tim J. Keating ’85, president of Keating Wealth Management, said that the University’s next president could face an “alienated” alumni base after the College’s crackdown on single-gender final clubs, to which some alumni belonged and fondly remember.
“The position on final clubs is considered to be outrageous by many older alumni, an attack on something that was near and dear to them,” Keating said. “These are the people who actually write the checks to Harvard, the alumni.”
Still, while most agreed that fundraising will be an important responsibility for the incoming president, many said it wasn’t the most important quality they’d like to see in the next leader of the University.
“Presidents aren’t selected under fundraising ability, they’re selected under their ability to lead the best university in the world,” Dong said.
Raising the money is one matter. But investing it to fund the University in perpetuity, experts say, is entirely another.
Even as the University continues to rake in donations from alumni, Harvard’s investment arm has struggled to make those gifts multiply. This fiscal year, Harvard’s endowment returns were the worst in the Ivy League; the year before, they hit their lowest level since the nadir of the financial crisis. Some experts even fear that the gains University has made in its capital campaign have been swallowed by investment losses.
“The unfortunate thing is that the money being raised in the latest campaign is basically making up for the shortfall in investment performance in the endowment,” Yermack said. “It’s not the way they’re making the pitch in the campaign, but that’s clearly what is going on here.”
Because Harvard’s schools are all, to an extent, dependent on the endowment for their operating costs, meager returns mean budget constraints. Though Faust has said that endowment payouts will be stabilized for the next few years to provide a cushion for her successor, some say Harvard’s next leader should have the skills to lead the University to a healthier financial state.
But according to some financial experts, that doesn’t necessarily mean a president in the mold of former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who preceded Faust in the role.
The next University President will enter the role in the midst of a transitional period for HMC. Last year, the firm hired its fourth CEO in a decade, former Columbia endowment head N.P. “Narv” Narvekar. So far, Narvekar has already initiated drastic changes at HMC, moving to lay off a majority of its employees and outsource its traditionally in-house investment team.
As HMC begins this transition, Yermack and Brad R. Balter, managing partner of Balter Capital Management, said the best thing for Harvard’s next leader to do may simply be to give Narvekar some space.
“I’d like to think that given the amount of effort it takes to change out the [CEO of HMC] at an institution like Harvard… that the new president would say, ‘Look, I know you’re relatively new too. Do your thing.’ That would be the logical move,” Balter said.
In any case, between fundraising and overseeing the financials, Bok said the role of the Harvard president has come to resemble more that of a corporate executive than an academic leader.
“The administrative part of the job has become vastly greater, and it’s become harder then to pay attention to the educational side, because there’s so much administration and fundraising that has to be done,” he said. “It’s just an immense difference—the scale of the whole operation.”

Take one look at the most recent USCHO Division I poll, and something will stand out: the Harvard men’s hockey team sits at No. 3, but the team has yet to play a single game. The 0-0-0 record looks out of place among all the other normal records.
This is because, for the last three weeks, the Crimson and its fellow Ivy Leaguers have watched the rest of the league dive into regular season action. Now, with Dartmouth coming to Cambridge in a matter of days, the wait is finally over.
Harvard will kick off its regular season with a rare Sunday night matchup against the Big Green at 7:00 p.m. Due to Ivy League restrictions on season start dates, both teams launch their 2017-2018 campaigns weeks after the majority of their Division I peers.
By the time the Crimson takes the ice on Sunday, all 19 of the other programs in the latest USCHO top-20 poll will have played at least five contests. Fully energized for the 29 games ahead, and surely a bit restless, the team is chomping at the bit.
“We’re so excited to get the season started,” tri-captain Merrick Madsen said. “These three games [before the long road trip] are going to be a culmination of the two months we’ve been putting in so far.”
Harvard is hoping for a better result against the Big Green than last season’s first bout between the two teams. In an uncharacteristic blip, the Crimson fell on the road, 8-4. This rout concluded three-game losing skid, which proved to be a pivotal moment in Harvard’s Frozen Four journey.
After returning from the Dartmouth trip frustrated and humbled, the 2016-2017 Crimson icemen recommitted themselves to their game and remained unbeaten for 18 games until being bounced in the national semifinals by Minnesota-Duluth.
This year’s Harvard squad remembers that turning point, although the players won’t dwell on it.
“We’re keeping that [game] in the back of our minds,” Madsen acknowledged. “Obviously, we’re focusing on ourselves.”
In a season defined early on by roster turnover and uncertainty in the forward ranks, the Big Green can still expect a great deal on Sunday. Junior forward Ryan Donato will dazzle with his stick skills; sophomore blue-liner Adam Fox will facilitate both on the power play and 5v5; the top defensive pairing of senior Wiley Sherman and sophomore John Marino will aim to lock down Dartmouth’s top line; and Madsen will do his best brick wall impression as he mans the cage.
Meanwhile, with players filling vacancies left by last year’s senior class, the 2017-2018 Crimson will have plenty to prove. Freshman forwards Jack Badini and Henry Bowlby have skated abreast on the third line in the team’s two exhibitions. Together with last year’s Beanpot MVP, sophomore Nathan Krusko, the two rookies will provide ample speed and skill in Harvard’s bottom six, which should give the Dartmouth defense plenty of additional trouble.
“We have very balanced talent up front,” said Madsen’s fellow tri-captain Jake Horton. “We have a great back-end this year. This is going to be the strong point of our team this year, and we’re really going to look to not only shut teams down with that, but [the defense is] going to be creating a lot of offense for us.”
In Sunday’s tilt, the shutdown task for this experienced defensive corps will revolve around Dartmouth senior forward Corey Kalk and his sophomore linemates, Will Graber and Cam Strong. The three combined for 55 points last season, good for a quarter of the team’s scoring.
The Crimson will employ a more balanced strategy this year, as opposed to last season’s offense-first mentality. Still, the Big Green should struggle to match Harvard’s scoring capabilities.
Just two of this year’s top-liners, Donato and junior Lewis Zerter-Gossage, combined for 65 points in the 2016-2017 campaign, surpassing Dartmouth’s entire top line for this season. From a team-wide perspective, the Crimson’s 4.06 goals per game average ranked second among the 60 teams in Division I. The Big Green, on the other hand, placed 40th in team scoring.
“We’ve played the two scrimmages and…we’ve had a lot of success with [the offense], especially with our freshmen stepping up,” Madsen said.
Considering Harvard’s significant forward turnover this season, a fairer comparison of the two teams lies between the pipes. Madsen’s numbers last season were stellar: a .923 save percentage and 2.11 goals against average culminated in a .806 win percentage, good for second-best in the NCAA.
“Merrick is obviously an all-college goalie,” Donato said. “He’s going to be great for us again this year, and hopefully we can rely upon our defense a little bit more this year.”
With his blue line relatively intact after the departure of only Clay Anderson ’17, Madsen could conceivably post comparable metrics in his senior campaign. Meanwhile, Dartmouth netminder Devin Buffalo finished last year with a sub-.900 save percentage and a goals against average of 3.29.
The disparity in these numbers is the difference between a league-best 28 wins for Madsen—including a program record 16-game win streak—and a meager 10 for Buffalo.
While the statistical comparisons do paint a decent picture, Harvard is simply a different team than it was last season, as the squad returns only 51 percent of its scoring. Last year, the seniors alone came just 15 points shy of outscoring opposing teams.
With this dynamic class moving on, the new-look Crimson will have to let its play this season speak for itself. Last year’s campaign was an exhilarating ride, but the team knows it’s time to put that to bed.
“Last year was last year,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ‘91. “We have to find an identity as a group…. I think we’ve tucked [last season] away.”
Hence, the Crimson’s mantra for the 2017-2018 campaign, “Earned, Not Given,” centers around establishing a unique identity.
Over the first three home contests, the Crimson will prioritize solidifying lines, executing in its systems, and getting back its game legs. Then, the team hits the road for nine consecutive away contests featuring its most difficult opponents of the year, who will certainly be gunning for highly ranked Harvard.
“[We] don’t get anything for what we did last year,” said Horton, before elaborating on last week’s No. 2 USCHO ranking. “Some guys will say, ‘I wish we were ranked 58th right now’ because that kind of complacency can start to creep in…. All being ranked second does for you is put a big target on your back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We ran into a legitimate offensive buzz saw.”
That was how Tim Murphy, Harvard football coach, described last Friday’s drubbing at the hands of Princeton. The Tigers carved up the Crimson for 423 passing yards, including over 300 before halftime, en route to an 52-17 victory.
Now, holding a 3-3 record for the first time since 2005, Harvard must find some way to piece together the splinters.
The reckoning process began on Sunday, when the team held an aberrant practice. Next came film study, meaning the merciless watching and re-watching of game-day mistakes.
“[It was] quiet,” Murphy said. “Anytime you lose against a rival in general, and lose in the fashion that we lost the game, there’s that much more focus on, ‘Wow, how did this happen?’”
As Murphy emphasized, though, the Crimson can fixate on Princeton for only so long. This week, Harvard faces a similarly staunch test against a new opponent—Dartmouth (5-1, 3-1 Ivy), which has already topped Yale and Penn.
The Big Green will visit Cambridge for the first time since Oct. 30, 2015, when Harvard and Dartmouth slugged out one of the most epic fights in recent memory.
That Friday night, both teams entered with a 6-0 record. Preseason pundits had picked the Crimson and the Big Green to finish one-two. Effectively, the matchup loomed as the Ancient Eight championship.
Dartmouth took a 13-0 lead into the final seven minutes of play, but Harvard responded with a wild sequence of plays—a school-yard touchdown on fourth-and-12, a forced fumble with under three minutes left, and a go-ahead score two minutes later.
The madness didn’t end until the last second, when Crimson linemen Richie Ryan and Stone Hart blocked a Big Green field goal. Harvard 14, Dartmouth 13.
“That [Crimson] team had an amazing amount of grit,” Murphy said. “It was a game we’ll always remember. I think it’ll be considered as one of the best games in Harvard history.”
Murphy made a comparison to the 2015 Crimson when previewing the 2017 Big Green. This year, Dartmouth has demonstrated a knack for the dramatic. Two of the Big Green’s last four wins came on the last play—an overtime stop against Holy Cross and a fourth-quarter score against Penn. Another victory came when Dartmouth erased the largest deficit in program history (21 points) to shock the Bulldogs.
Even the Big Green’s lone loss came in exciting fashion. Facing undefeated Columbia, Dartmouth marched back from a 22-7 third-quarter deficit to get within five. Twice in the last five minutes, the Big Green earned a first-and-goal. Twice, the Lions repelled the attack.
This was what Murphy meant when he said that only one play separated Dartmouth from a 6-0 record.
“They’re playing with a lot of confidence,” Murphy said. “They don’t get rattled when they’re behind. They seem to believe that they’re a team of destiny, the way they’ve played.”
The Crimson defense will hope to prevent another dramatic moment for Dartmouth. That unit, however, is reeling from the Princeton rout.
“We looked at the film, and we were playing tentative,” senior safety Tim Haehl said. “That’s not how we should play. DBs have never played that way here.”
Harvard needs a turnaround to happen quickly because the team faces a stacked schedule over the final weeks. After Dartmouth, the Crimson still must play the unbeaten Lions, the defending-champion Quakers, and the high-scoring Bulldogs.
Still, Crimson players have reason for slight hope. If Harvard wins out, Yale beats Columbia, and a few other matchups fall into place, the Crimson can still claim a share of the championship. The path is unlikely, especially given the success of the Lions, but still possible.
“You start looking down the road, and it’s easy to lose focus,” Murphy said. “All that matters right now is Dartmouth.”
The 2017 season is at a real crossroads. Look down one path, and you can see a Harvard team with a 1-6 Ivy record. Look down another, and you can envision an Ancient Eight title.
Historic defeat or historic comeback—either road starts this Saturday at Harvard Stadium. Given the stakes, can fans expect a rerun of the 2015 classic?
Offensive lineman Tim O’Brien chuckled when asked that question.
“I would not like it to be so close,” the junior said. “I’d like to win by more, obviously. But it’s going to be a battle.”
