Attempts to evoke the sounds of outer space number as many as its mysteries, and Coldplay’s Oct. 15 release of “Music of the Spheres” places the British rock band among the stars. Their ninth studio album embarks on a soaring exploration of the universe’s potential as a source of boundless hope — and even love.
“When you set something in another place, there’s a freedom to say what you really feel,” Coldplay’s lead singer Chris Martin told Zane Lowe in an Apple Music interview. “So there’s a lot of love in there.”
And there’s a lot to love about “Music of the Spheres.” The album’s impressive production coats the band’s classic guitar riffs in a futuristic shimmer. For all their celestial allusions, the heartfelt lyrics never succumb to the cold of deep space — and Martin knows exactly when to sing them with arena-worthy grandeur or in his signature falsetto. These elements complement each other on each track as if in mutual orbit, welcoming listeners into Coldplay’s cosmos.
The album’s titular opener marks the first of four instrumental pieces, each intensifying relative to the last. Across these tracks, nebulous synth warbles crystallize into patterns while retaining an expansive resonance, like a distant object gradually coming into focus through a telescope.
Then comes lead single “Higher Power,” whose title reflects Martin’s unabashed reverence for such an idea. Instead of trying to rationalize his overwhelming feelings, he happily concedes “That you’ve got a higher power / Got me singin’ every second, dancin’ every hour.” His sweetest declaration of love, though, operates on nowhere near as lofty a scale — and its simplicity only strengthens the impact of its arrival at the end of the second verse. “I’m so happy that I’m alive / Happy I’m alive at the same time as you,” Martin sings on one note. The band achieves a similar confluence of lyrics and melody in the exuberant outro by setting the phrase “I’d been down on my knees” to a descending scale that pivots upward just in time for a more hopeful ending: “’Til your love song floats me on.”
On “Let Somebody Go,” Selena Gomez joins Martin for a bittersweet duet that can’t help but elicit comparisons to “The Scientist,” the quintessential Coldplay ballad. Both songs seek to explain the irrationality of how relationships form and dissolve, but the uncanny polish of “Let Somebody Go” prevents it from achieving its predecessor’s heart-wrenching pathos. That artifice of perfection reveals itself through crisp, almost brittle, synths, and thoughts that wrap up neatly in clichés. “When I called the mathematicians and / I asked them to explain,” he begins, only to finish the rhyme with “They said love is only equal to the pain,” as if such succinct and absolute answers were never more than a phone call away. Despite the songs’ similar subject matter, numbers offer no such consolation in “The Scientist,” where Martin admits that “Questions of science, science and progress / Do not speak as loud as my heart” over an out-of-tune piano. Sometimes, though, “Let Somebody Go” harnesses its own familiarity to devastating effect, as when Martin’s heartbroken plea to “turn off all the stars” echoes a line from W. H. Auden’s “Funeral Blues”: “The stars are not wanted now; put out every one.”
The stars align and shine brightest on “My Universe,” a collaboration with BTS. “You are my universe / and I just want to put you first,” Martin begins with enough flair to match the magnitude of his words, ending the sentence on the pointed twist of a minor third. The jubilant synth-pop anthem, with songwriting credits from BTS rappers J-Hope, RM, and Suga, celebrates the kind of love that can withstand any hardship to transcend boundaries as beautifully as do BTS and Coldplay themselves. In just under four minutes, the two groups unearth joy that somehow feels “never ending forever,” as Jungkook and Martin conclude the first pre-chorus.
“Coloratura,” the album’s ten-minute finale, takes listeners on one last interstellar adventure. At first, the song’s music-box piano motifs and slow melody seem to lack the virtuosity of its namesake opera style. But after the second refrain of “And in this crazy world, I do / I just want you,” the cascade of a harp solo introduces an extensive instrumental bridge that takes the track to new heights. A section in quintuple meter suddenly emerges from scattered glockenspiel notes, building momentum for an epic coda sustained by sweeping guitars and strings.
While the ancient Greek philosophical concept of the “music of the spheres” refers to celestial bodies’ inaudible movements, Coldplay’s latest work gives the phrase a tangible form with universal appeal.

For anyone craving a reintroduction to live theater after its long, pandemic-induced hiatus, the “RENT” 25th Anniversary “Farewell Season of Love” Tour is the perfect place to start. Since its premiere in 1996, the Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning musical has become a source of joy and strength for millions. From Oct. 12 to 17, the touring production took the stage at the Boch Center’s Shubert Theater, giving Bostonians one final opportunity to experience the celebrated touring production.
“RENT” follows a group of artists and friends in New York City as they navigate struggles with drug addiction, sexuality, HIV/AIDS, and — as the title implies — paying their rent. Way ahead of its time, the musical has always insisted on a diverse cast, and this tour’s production is no exception. The past year has brought increased attention to the lack of diversity on Broadway, with performers, creative teams, and audiences insisting that productions reopen with strengthened diversity practices. In August, some of Broadway’s most powerful figures, including the owners and operators of 39 Broadway theaters, signed Black Theater United’s “A New Deal for Broadway,” pledging to make the industry more inclusive. Among these movements to diversify Broadway, the representation of different races, body types, sexualities, and genders in “RENT” is refreshing — an example of what theater desperately needs right now.
The musical styles in “RENT” are equally diverse. The score spans a range of genres including rock, pop, gospel, tango, and more. This eclecticism allows cast members to show off their stylistic range and creates a more captivating listening experience. When the cast unites for group numbers like “La Vie Bohème” and “Seasons of Love,” they produce triumphant, goosebump-raising harmonies. And when each cast member has the chance to sing solo, their exceptional performance is proof that they deserve their iconic role. Filling the shoes of Broadway legends like Idina Menzel, Anthony Rapp, and Jesse L. Martin might sound like an impossible task, but these performers stepped up to the plate. A few, however, stole the stage with outstanding vocals and choreography: Javon King as Angel Schunard, Aiyana Smash as Mimi Marquez, and Rayla Garske as Joanne Jefferson.
King can best be described as a vocally talented Simone Biles in 5-inch heels. When he takes the stage, paying attention to anyone else is nearly impossible — not just due to the dazzling costumes for which Angel is known, but also because of his impressive acrobatic abilities and vocal range. In “Today 4 U,” King showcases a sequence of spins, jumps, and leaps from great heights, made death-defying by his footwear. He sticks every landing, all while staying on pitch.
Similarly, Smash expertly embraces Mimi’s bold personality. In her electrifying performance of “Out Tonight,” Smash struts across the balcony, hangs from the railing, and releases glitter from her long locks in an epic hair flip. She nails even the most difficult transitions to high notes, seducing both Roger Davis (Coleman Cummings) and the audience along the way.
Garske effortlessly displays her vocal range with challenging songs like “Take Me or Leave Me” and “Tango: Maureen.” She belts with power, and her tango with Cody Jenkins as Mark Cohen is both hilarious and choreographically impressive. Following a tense argument over Maureen Johnson (Lyndie Moe), her current lover and his ex, the two abruptly start dancing a technical tango that somehow fits perfectly into the rock-based musical.
The creative team for this adaptation of “RENT” includes some of the artists behind the original Broadway show, such as choreographer Marlies Yearby and costume designer Angela Wendt. As a result, the touring production stays true to its roots, reproducing the formula that has kept “RENT” culturally significant for 25 years. The sets are simple yet effective, with pared-back metal structures providing the foundation for street corners, apartment interiors, and restaurants. The use of props is clever but not excessive, like the arrangement of folding chairs in a circle to create the room of the HIV/AIDS support group — just enough to set the scene. Costumes capture the essence of each character as well as the grungy angst that underscores the entirety of the production. Roger, for instance, dons a leather biker jacket and combat boots, while Mimi rocks fishnet tights and a vintage slip dress.
But while the production’s design harkens back to the ‘90s, one of the most striking things about seeing “RENT” in 2021 is the contrast it illuminates between the height of the AIDS crisis and the treatment of HIV/AIDS today. The diagnosis that used to be a death sentence is now a condition that can be lived with for decades. The initial treatment of AZT every few hours is now a once-daily pill, and preventative measures like PrEP are used widely. Today, celebrities like Jonathan Van Ness, Billy Porter, and Magic Johnson are open about their HIV diagnosis, working to dismantle stigma. Yet the theme of coming together in the face of an illness remains incredibly relevant. Navigating the Covid-19 pandemic requires the same carpe diem attitude and appreciation of friendship that define “RENT.”
Listening to the soundtrack or watching the film adaptation can never replace the experience of seeing “RENT” live, especially when it comes to audience participation. A full theater mooing along with Maureen in “Over the Moon,” for example, is transcendental and surprisingly cathartic. And joining the cast to clap through “Seasons of Love” creates an atmosphere of pure joy. “RENT” builds a sense of community, not just onstage but among the audience and beyond. Any feelings of isolation brought about by the pandemic are instantly shattered by the euphoria of being an integral part of the audience. The repetition of “no day but today” in the finale, accompanied by touching videos of the cast projected around the theater, is a fitting sendoff for those leaving the theater bubble and returning to the real world.
This show is a must-see. Although its run in Boston has come to an end, you can catch the critically acclaimed musical in another city before the tour concludes in April 2022.

On Sept. 24, viewers from around the country gathered in a virtual space with Anderson Cooper and novelist Katherine Howe to discuss their co-written new book, “Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty.” Organized by the Miami Book Fair and bringing together 22 independent bookstores across the United States (including our very own Harvard Book Store), the hour-long Zoom event gave attendees the chance to hear from the authors themselves and ask questions.
The book tells the tale of Cooper’s heritage, tracing back to his great-great-great grandfather, American railroad baron Cornelius Vanderbilt (also known as “the Commodore”). The Vanderbilt name is now synonymous with high society, and in “Vanderbilt” Cooper and Howe explore the story of how the Vanderbilts became one of America’s most iconic families. Details are divulged about generations of lavish wealth, eccentric aunts and grandfathers, and the life of the “last Vanderbilt,” heiress and fashion designer Gloria Vanderbilt — Cooper’s late mother.
In talking about their motivations for working on this novel, Howe and Cooper both shared the preconceptions they had about the life of Cornelius Vanderbilt and the legacy of his family.
“As a historian and a novelist, I spend a lot of time thinking my way into other people’s experiences and specifically people’s experiences in the past,” Howe said. “I was drawn to the opportunity to try to think our way into the lived experiences of some of these people, because I feel like a lot of them recede behind the myth.”
Cooper spoke to how his impressions of Cornelius Vanderbilt changed before and after writing the book.
“I knew the Commodore only cared about money, I knew [that] he had been terrible to his family members, that he seemed disconnected from those around him in many regards,” he said. “But once I saw how the others dealt with the money, I came to at least appreciate his work ethic.”
Cristina Nosti is the Events and Marketing Director for Books and Books, a chain of independent bookstores in Florida. Nosti, along with a team from bookstores all across the United States, joined forces over the pandemic to bring these virtual book events to readers across the world. As with many other industries, the pandemic forced bookstores to adapt to a virtual space and to figure out how to bring their customers with them. However, with the barrier of physical travel removed for both authors and attendees, new possibilities opened up.
“What the virtual world did was make things a lot easier for people to say ‘yes’ from all over the world,” Nosti said. She also credits the pandemic for the partnerships that arose amongst independent bookstores.
With the event’s virtual format, attendees benefited from the accessibility.
Jennifer E. Lawyer Wilson attended the event from Temple, Texas. “Obviously being from a fairly small community, I don't have as much access to a lot of the book events or authors speaking so it was nice to be able to see something like [this book event] and not have to travel to a big city,” she said.
The event’s chat box was filled with one-liners from an engaged audience. Some attendees were there based on their own familial connection to the Vanderbilts. Ariel C. S. H. Ehrlich, a 15-year-old student from the Upper West Side of Manhattan, found out that he was a descendant of the Vanderbilt family through genealogical research.
“It was really interesting to hear this different narrative [of] the Vanderbilt dynasty: how Cornelius ‘the Commodore’ really rose to power, how brilliantly he did that, and the eventual collapse of Gilded Age wealth,” Ehrlich said.
He was excited to attend an event hosted by Cooper, who Ehrlich looks up to as a role model for young gay men.
“I think it’s really monumental that the true story of the Vanderbilt family is being rewritten by a gay man, a single father,” he said.
Many audience members were interested in Cooper and his role as a major figure in American media, while others were drawn in by the life and character of his mother.
“I think the thing that fascinated me the most was [Cooper’s] discussion on these individuals who were affluent yet had squandered their lives,” Josephine A. Bulkley, a psychotherapist based in Washington, D.C., said. “And I think that was telling for Anderson who by all accounts has done everything to help people in spite of his wealth and [personal] tragedies.”
Another attendee found Cooper’s openness to criticism unique. “He mentioned that he received responses that poked at his rich privilege in inspecting his ancestry at a time where people are dying of Covid, losing their jobs, and are struggling to make ends meet,” said Manveer Dulay, a content writer based in British Columbia, Canada.
Cooper’s takeaway on the Commodore after working on the book?
“I certainly wouldn't want [Cornelius Vanderbilt] to be my dad, and I certainly wouldn't want to have been one of his kids, but it'd be interesting to have lunch with him, or maybe just a drink, ” he said.

Gervais Hagerty wholeheartedly embraces her Charleston roots in her debut novel, “In Polite Company.” If you’ve never been to South Carolina, Hagerty’s novel offers a firsthand exposé of the city, its inhabitants, and the outdated social practices of its high society. Hagerty throws readers into a dazzling world of country clubs, debutante balls, and family politics. By the narrative’s conclusion, readers are well-acquainted with local Charleston culture and lingo like “from off,” Lowcountry summer supper,” or “Charleston single.”
The novel follows Simons, a young woman concerned with her fading romance, stagnant career as a news producer, and her grandmother’s declining health. Her experience is shaped by the restrictions of living among upper-class Charlestonians who value civility and conformity above all else. Always “in polite company,” Simons is forced to suppress her personality and uphold her elite family’s reputation.
Hagerty is able to create an intimate experience with language that appeals to the senses and cinematically crafts Simons’ surroundings. Readers can feel the chilled water of the ocean when Simons goes surfing, marvel at the glow of bioluminescent algae, and watch the fog rise over the shoreline at sunrise.
Sometimes, however, the book reads more like a travel guide than a novel. Chapters often begin with lists of the best beaches for surfing, the many islands that border Edisto, or the busiest streets in downtown Charleston. These lists don’t do much to advance the narrative or set the scene, unlike the more nuanced details that Hagerty incorporates about everyday living in South Carolina.
The most powerful and well-written moments of “In Polite Company” are its depictions of grief. Anyone who’s lost a friend, family member, or beloved pet, can empathize with the narrator’s struggle to cope with the loss of her grandmother, Laudie. Hagerty’s funeral and burial scenes are heartbreakingly vivid, from the sight of an embalmed corpse in an open casket to the sound of dirt being shoveled over a fresh grave.
As tragic as these losses are, Hagerty also reminds us of the organic and peaceful nature of the life cycle. She cleverly parallels the declining health of Laudie with the decay of her garden. At every visit, Simons finds that more flowers have died until the plot is left empty. And yet, there is beauty and consolation in this natural process, a reminder that some things are simply out of our control.
Where the novel falls short is in its feminist message. The narrator had the potential to be an empowered icon. Through Simons’ internal and external dialogue, Hagerty raises important questions about the persistence of gender inequality in the household, the workplace, and in boys’ clubs like Battery Hall, an exclusive country club. Simons is resistant to the traditional roles of mother and housewife, and she voices her desires to pave a path away from outdated expectations.
Unfortunately, Hagerty steers Simons away from these feminist ideals by making her boy crazy. Simons is perpetually concerned with finding a romantic partner, never given a moment to exist on her own. Most of her conversations and conflicts with friends and family revolve around the men in her life. The novel fares poorly on the Bechdel Test — a measure of the representation of women in fiction that asks whether a work features at least two women talking each other about something other than a man.
Every time Simons resolves to venture off on her own, the next page introduces a new love interest. Any excitement raised about Simons finally finding herself disappears when she is sent into the arms of a new lover. Romance should not be the end-all be-all of a successful character arc. To quote from Louisa May Alcott’s “Rose in Bloom,” “I’m sick of being told that [love] is all a woman is fit for!”
Hagerty’s debut excels in some areas and disappoints in others. Her portrayal of grief is relatable and poetic, and her intricate accounts of life in Charleston can make anyone feel like a local. If only her main character were not so obsessed with finding a partner, the narrative would better convey the feminist sentiments that Hagerty tries to get across. At the end of the day, Hagerty’s first novel is an entertaining read, underscored by a heartwarming piece of advice from Laudie that frequently resurfaces: “Be brave.”

Riding the waves of his Grammy-nominated debut EP “Take Time,” LA-based R&B artist Giveon dropped a new single for the first time since his song “Peaches” with Justin Bieber topped the Billboard charts over the summer. His new track, “For Tonight,” is the first single off of his upcoming debut album. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really deliver.
Structurally, the song is boilerplate pop. Its two verses and chorus form a basic but reliable structure, one that Giveon has deployed in much of his music. The instrumentation consists of simple but longing piano chords, with Giveon delivering a decent vocal performance in his characteristically rich baritone. Thematically, however, the track is trite, recycling material from his previous song “Favorite Mistake” about infidelity and the ensuing guilt. In the earlier track, Giveon included lyrics such as, “Is my secret safe? / Safe with just you and me,” “We both know it's wrong,” and, “Look in my eyes / Can you find the lies?” Now, in “For Tonight,” he declares, “And secret, secret, both gotta keep it,” “Even though it's wrong to lie with you,” and, “'Cause all I wanna do is lie, with you.”
Admittedly, these are common tropes in heartbreak and love songs. But Giveon has specifically referenced these exact ideas in past records, making their recurrence feel lazy and uninspired.
This song’s most egregious offense, however, is probably its striking similarity to Sam Smith’s 2014 hit single “Stay with Me.” The records are similar in composition; for example, both employ emotional singing over poignant piano accompaniment. Beyond the superficial, however, the chorus of “For Tonight” is borrowed almost note-for-note directly from Sam Smith. Compare the first line of the chorus from “Stay with Me” to the third line of the chorus from “For Tonight.” Both passages start off with the same broken major triad in eighth notes, followed by the same exact three-note progression. With the exception of some ornamentation at the end of the bar in “For Tonight,” the melodies are almost identical.
Despite his recent blowup on TikTok and resulting mainstream success, Giveon’s new single is an unwelcome turn towards pop mimicry and a disappointingly bland rehashing of worn-out ideas. While fans may find comfort in a song with all the tried-and-true elements of a Giveon record, “For Tonight” sadly does not stand out or contribute anything meaningful to his discography.

Southern California rap trio Swilmot demands to be taken seriously.
Composed of rappers Garnett March and P.J. Smith and producer Will Newhart, the group formed during the spring of their senior year of high school in Studio City.
March and Smith first started rapping for fun, freestyling after school while playing Xbox. Big fans of Playboi Carti, the friends tried their best to imitate the Atlanta rapper by finding “Playboi Carti type beats” online, according to Smith.
“We would get beats off of YouTube and just rap,” March said. “We realized we were kind of nice at it and from there we decided to actually record something.”
After deciding to earnestly pursue rap, the next step for March and Smith was to find a producer that could make them original, copyright-free beats.
Through a mutual friend, the pair tracked down Newhart, who had been making music since he was 10 years old.
“I started producing in fourth grade because my elementary school and middle school had a recording lab where they taught you GarageBand and Logic Pro,” Newhart said. “I just kind of stuck with it and built up more gear and more expertise.”
Once March and Smith connected with Newhart, the trio immediately got to work, forming a group chat where Newhart could send the rappers beats.
“I sent them a beat that I was calling ‘Arabian Nights’ at the time and told them that it was a throwaway,” Newhart said. “And then PJ and Garnett were like, ‘Dude this is the throwaway?’ which made me realize that maybe it was actually pretty good.”
After receiving the “Arabian Nights” beat from Newhart, March and Smith started to craft lyrics to it. March remembers writing raps in his high school dean’s office in preparation for an afterschool recording session.
The trio recorded over the “Arabian Nights” beat at Newhart’s house, subsequently releasing the track as a single called “Tender Greens.”
Within a few weeks, “Tender Greens” had garnered over 50,000 streams on SoundCloud, eventually topping the number out at 79,000.
Although the trio had recorded the track with the primary objective of having fun, the SoundCloud response was an affirmation of the group’s musical compatibility.
“It definitely felt like a bit of a breakthrough for me, honestly, because I had been producing for a while,” Newhart said. “It wasn’t a totally serious song, but that was the first release where it felt like I was starting to approach something that looks like real music.”
Over the next two months following “Tender Greens,” the trio gathered to record at Newhart’s house almost every weekend. Smith says the group’s recording pace was organic and motivated by the success of their first single.
“We just really liked making music together,” Smith said. “We knew we had a bunch of songs that we wanted to make and they kind of just came together.”
Smith added that the trio functions best when all three members equally contribute to make a track.
However, March and Smith admitted that they have an ongoing friendly competition as the two rappers in the group to see who writes the better verse on each song.
“I mean you start off with whatever you think sounds good,” Smith said. “Then you hear the other person's verse and you're like, ‘Damn he kind of shitted on me, like he really stepped it up.’”
Beyond Playboi Carti, the group takes inspiration from a wide array of influences, from Texas-born collective Brockhampton to the genre of House music, according to Newhart.
“In terms of production I've been super influenced by artists like Disclosure and Kaytranada and trying to put rap on top of that sound,” Newhart said. “I think House is awesome and there needs to be more of that.”
After graduating high school in 2019 and weathering the onset of the pandemic in 2020, Swilmot took a brief hiatus from making music before returningthis past June with the single “212.”
Still full-time students, the trio remains committed to the dream of a career in music.
“I would love to be a part of something, musically, where my creativity allows me to make a career off it,” Smith said. “I would also like to finish college, but if we were to really, really blow up, I would have some thinking to do at least.”
On Sept. 10, the trio released their second single of the year “Losing My Mind,” now streaming on all platforms.

Six years have passed since Adele left listeners distraught yet yearning for more with her third studio album, “25.” Fans of the British singer-songwriter’s tear-jerking tunes no longer have to wait for their next dose of heartache. On Oct. 15, Adele released “Easy On Me,” the first single off of her upcoming album, “30,” set to be released on Nov. 19. As to be expected from Adele, “Easy On Me” can best be described as devastatingly beautiful.
No artist can wrap heartbreak and sorrow in a stunning package as expertly as Adele. Reminiscent of previous hits like “Make You Feel My Love” or “Someone Like You,” “Easy On Me” begins with a piano melody that is unmistakably Adele. It is obvious from just the first few bars of the song that Adele is about to rip the listener’s heart out. And she does just that.
Sonically, “Easy On Me” is not far off from Adele’s other works. As expected, Adele’s vocals soar, the accompanying piano melody is melancholic, and the tempo is steady. Thematically, however, the single is unlike anything she has ever released before. What makes “Easy On Me” stand out from Adele’s repertoire is that the singer is no longer pointing fingers at anyone but herself. In an interview with Vogue, Adele explains that her upcoming album has become a way for her to explain her divorce to her nine-year old son. In writing the album and coming to terms with its subject matter, Adele made a realization that distinguishes the upcoming LP and “Easy On Me” from her other music: Adele realized that maybe she was the problem, the running theme in all of her past relationships that did not work out. It’s a realization that no one ever wants to make about themselves, let alone share with the world.
This epiphany comes out loud and clear in “Easy on Me,” making this song possibly Adele’s most personal and vulnerable to date. This is best illustrated in the song’s powerful chorus: “Go easy on me, baby / I was still a child / Didn't get the chance to / Feel the world around me / I had no time to choose what I chose to do / So go easy on me.” The bridge, “I had good intentions / And the highest hopes / But I know right now / It probably doesn't even show,” demonstrates not only defeat but also a new kind of self-acceptance from Adele. She grapples with the reality that intentions do not outweigh impact and now she has some soul-searching to do. Adele’s ability to not only pinpoint her pitfalls but also clearly convey them to listeners without self-pity is awe-inspiring. Her capacity to be brutally honest without any self-righteousness for doing so is a feat that all songwriters should aspire to.
It was once impossible to imagine that Adele, the artist who wrote “Chasing Pavements” at only 19 years old, could become any more mature than she already was. Yet “Easy On Me” exemplifies Adele’s growth as both an artist and a person. She is opening up to the listeners in a way that she has never before, letting them see her flaws and downfalls rather than showing those of her past lovers. Adele’s vulnerability is aspirational, a lesson in what it is like to be human — imperfect and ever-growing. This admission of imperfection is simultaneously hard to swallow yet refreshing in a world where no one ever wants to display their flaws.
If “Easy On Me” is exemplary of what audiences can expect of “30,” it is safe to say that the album will be as heartbreaking as it is beautiful. It will also be exactly what the world needs to hear after a year that was not easy on anyone.

On Aug. 3, KINDA BLUE — an anonymous artist that hails from South Korea — debuted with “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” a soulful R&B song of his own composition. The new release garnered great attention after Hwasa, a member of the popular K-pop girl group Mamamoo, requested to collaborate with him after hearing his demo by chance. Inspired by the groundbreaking jazz composer Miles Davis’ melancholic studio album “Kind of Blue,” KINDA BLUE is a new singer-songwriter with a distinct flair reminiscent of Davis’ stylistic innovations. Despite posting covers of John Lennon, El DeBarge, and Chet Baker on YouTube, “I Can’t Make You Love Me” marks his first original song.
The song is structured by the separate monologues of two lovers, each monologue its own verse. As the lyrics (“You’re my horizon / Forever”) show, the two lovers are trapped in an elliptical relationship, orbiting one another without ever making their feelings known.
While the song lasts just under three minutes, it is saturated with heavy emotions that KINDA BLUE carefully captures with an emotive voice. From shrill falsetto octaves to tentative vibratos that trail off into a whimper, his vocal techniques give the song an organic and raw quality. As soon as KINDA BLUE’s voice fades out, Hwasa immediately enters with the second verse, a monologue from the other lover’s perspective. Although Hwasa sings in the same register as KINDA BLUE, her husky and ethereal voice as well as her signature vocal licks give this verse a distinct color.
The song starts with echoes of the chorus that sound muted and underwater, as if emanating from an old cassette. When KINDA BLUE’s full-fledged voice kicks in, it wakes the listeners up from the hazy memory of the first few seconds, accompanied by warm drums. Because the song starts from the highlight chorus, listeners may wonder if they have been spoiled already. However, KINDA BLUE’s mesmerizing vocal texture, as well as Hwasa’s later appearance, are more than enough promise for the audience to stay and indulge.
While the title has an undeniably defeated ring to it, the song actually proves the usefulness of such feelings of resignation and rejection. Rather than playing nonchalant or turning vengeful like most breakup anthems, the song takes a path of passive nonresistance, fully acknowledging the unreciprocated and unconditional nature of one’s love. Without delivering easy closure, the song allows listeners to relate realistically and heal on their own rather than incubating an illusion of being okay. The closure feels more like a petrichor than the rainstorm itself, or the catharsis that follows a crying bout. This is precisely what makes “I Can’t Make You Love Me” more than just another mawkish run-of-the-mill love song.
As a new artist, KINDA BLUE has yet to reveal himself — quite literally. Currently, his pseudonym and voice are the only known information about the artist (hence the blank polaroid on his single cover). KINDA BLUE’s anonymity makes him all the more intimate and relatable because he is a placeholder — his story can be anyone’s. With just his music available to the public, listeners are able to appreciate him solely for his artistry, a rare and refreshing breather. Perhaps his facelessness is why listeners can comfortably ascribe their emotions to him. But regardless of romantic status, “I Can’t Make You Love Me” is a perfect listen for the fall. It will leave an afterglow of throbbing sincerity and empathy for anyone who’s feeling a little blue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, Oct. 8, a crowd of eager fans and wayfaring clubbers alike flooded in to see the English musician Alexander Kotz — also known as Elderbook — take the stage at The Sinclair. Together with Kotz, they danced the night away at an EDM concert like no other.
Sporting a man bun and a simple black tee, Kotz looked to be swallowed up by the lights and spacious stage at a first glance. The deep bass thrummed below the feet of the anticipating crowd, high hopes for this overseas performance building up pressure. However, as soon as he got his hands on his DJ set, Kotz’s stage presence grew three-fold, getting the crowd instantly warmed up by the first beat drop. Kotz fearlessly belted the impressively high notes in “Old Friend” and the melodic ad-libs in “Talking,” and then flawlessly transitioned into jumping along with the crowd to the more upbeat rhythm in “Something About You.” Quite the multitasker, he squatted low and jumped high with the change of tempo, all while controlling different FX stations and pounding at the electronic drum set. The setlist got progressively more upbeat and had both Kotz and the crowd working up a sweat to the funky tempo of songs like “Body,” and “Why Do We Shake in the Cold?”. Soon enough, he dialed it back to more lowkey feel-good vibes with some of his most popular hits like “Numb” and “Never Gonna Forget,” with Diplo. He also shouted out some OG fans in the crowd as they joined him in singing the old but gold gem, “Cola.”
There’s something so magically simplistic about Kotz. The melodic ad-libs perfectly harmonized with his low-fi beats, steering clear of the trademark reworked dissonance of heavier dance music altogether. The predictable chord progressions and melodies that sound familiar made it easy to interact with the first-time listeners and groupies alike. His emotional lyrics complemented the melody, setting an aspirational mood as he sang about following one’s “Inner Light,” self-plugging his newly-released EP, “Innerlight.”
But what really worked for Kotz wasn’t just his thematic setlist — it was his larger-than-life charisma that stole the show.
Instead of cruising through the lofi composition of his songs, Kotz worked up a sweat to put on a show. He took to the synth vocalizer, showcasing his mastery of the sound system, all without missing a beat of his belts and complex vocalizations. One hand on his drum stick, the other on the DJ set, Kotz also had time to flirt with the audience, stealing occasional glances with the finesse and confidence of a seasoned performer and then some. That impressive stage presence was felt when the buzz of lively conversations out on the floor died down soon after he took the stage, the audience quickly becoming enraptured by his performance. His unrelenting energy was a force to be reckoned with as he burst into dance at the sound of every beat drop, the red, blue, and green hues of the stage effects amplifying his charisma.
It is truly commendable how hyped up Kotz got the crowd with just his impressive work ethic. He belted the soulful lyrics until his voice went rasp, ending the night with a soulful message about the joys of making it out on the other side of quarantine and finally being able to perform again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the 2019 release of his record-smashing debut track “Old Town Road,” Lil Nas X has cemented himself as a pop culture mainstay thanks to his bold red carpet looks, creative music videos, humorous personality, and more. However, his rise to fame has not been an easy one. Since coming out as gay around the release of his first EP, Lil Nas X has faced persistent backlash from those who take offense to a confident queer Black man exhibiting pride in his sexuality. Unfortunately, it seemed as though the fear of persecution that prevented Lil Nas X from coming out for so long was being realized in a truly upsetting manner. The time for Lil Nas X’s bold response was imminent. Enter “MONTERO,” Lil Nas X’s debut album of reclamation, released Sept. 17. After spending recent years dealing with homophobic attacks, Lil Nas X finally takes back all the power society has stripped from him, a mission that is evident in the album’s meaningful lyrics, inventive sonic composition, and overall aesthetic.
The first track of the album, “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name),” is the song with which listeners are likely the most familiar. By choosing to start his record with this controversial Billboard number one hit, Lil Nas X sends a clear message: If this song makes you uncomfortable, then you should leave before the album gets started. Lil Nas X refuses to cater to his critics, a theme which he establishes early and continues throughout the album. Sonically, this song’s steady clapping beat and melodic guitar are infectious, hooking listeners from the very opening seconds of this album. Moreover, the centrality of the word “name” to the song’s lyrics calls attention to the fact that by using his birth name as the title for the album and this song, Lil Nas X is even going as far as to reclaim the power in his own name. This simple show of confident autonomy is a rather inspiring dimension of the work.
After this bold, unabashed introduction, Lil Nas X shifts gears to include songs that examine the deeper emotions that are not necessarily apparent in the artist’s often light-hearted exterior. For instance, in “THATS WHAT I WANT,” Lil Nas X confesses that “These days, I’m way too lonely/ I’m missing out, I know/ These days, I’m way too alone.” Such stark honesty about his isolated mental state and ardent desire to be involved in a healthy, loving relationship is a welcome change from the lighter fare that Lil Nas X usually sings about in songs like “Old Town Road.” However, Lil Nas X does not content himself with simply wallowing in self-pity, instead using his forceful, almost shouting voice to simply tell us, “I want someone to love, that’s what I fucking want.” Let there be no mistake, this album is all about what Lil Nas X wants, not what his fans or haters may demand.
This motif of deeply personal lyricism continues throughout the work, but is nowhere more noticeable than in “SUN GOES DOWN,” a song about Lil Nas X’s suicidal thoughts. While discussing his struggle to come to terms with his intersectional identity as a Black gay man, Lil Nas X lets listeners know just how severe his pain was, saying, “I wanna run away/ Don’t wanna lie, I don’t want a life/Send me a gun and I’ll see the sun.” The brave choice to speak on these serious matters allows Lil Nas X to gain some retroactive control over such a troubling time in his life, also allowing listeners to connect with the artist on a deeper level that makes the album all the more impactful. As opposed to his usual focus on beat-heavy production, this stripped-down song focuses heavily on Lil Nas X’s surprisingly smooth and moving vocals.
“Montero”’s aforementioned departure from Lil Nas X’s typical subject material is punctuated by many surprising choices he makes with regards to the work’s auditory composition. While most may think of Lil Nas X as just a pop rapper, this simplistic outlook is quickly contradicted by the angsty, punk rock sound of “LIFE AFTER SALEM.” On this track, Lil Nas X shouts out lyrics while backed by a vivid electric guitar and the clash of drums. And as if this song wasn’t enough to convince listeners of his versatility, Lil Nas X immediately follows it with “AM I DREAMING (feat. Miley Cyrus),” a much slower tune featuring beautifully airy vocals and an intimate acoustic guitar backing. By deftly navigating between seemingly unrelated styles of music, Lil Nas X is practically bragging to the audience about his artistic range, and every second is highly enjoyable.
Beyond its inspiring theme of one person’s artistic reclamation of power, “MONTERO” is just plain fun. The collaborations with Miley Cyrus, Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion, and Jack Harlow are too good to pass up on. Try listening to the booming brass instrument opening of “INDUSTRY BABY (feat. Jack Harlow),” the album’s crown jewel, without instantly feeling your spirits lift. It’s impossible. Similarly, “SCOOP (feat. Doja Cat)” is one of the strongest songs on the album due to its incredibly catchy beat.
Ultimately, the only thing that this album fails to accomplish is provide an answer to this crucial question: Now that he has successfully won back all the power he once lost, what will Montero do next?

Questions you may ask yourself while in the audience of a Brooklyn Rider performance may include: Is that really a violin? Are you sure there are only four people on stage? Can a cello make that noise? Is that whirring coming from the stage or from an essence deep within me? And perhaps to your disbelief, the answers are yes, yes, yes, and believe it or not, the stage! The fluency of extended technique and expert navigation of labyrinthine arrangements defined the first performance of Brooklyn Rider’s Celebrity Series residency at GBH’s Calderwood Studio on Oct. 7, 2021. Over the course of the night, the quartet took the audience on an intimate exploration of five compositions, including two world premieres. Almost every piece was specifically commissioned for the group and boldly showcased their provocative and experimental playing styles. Between songs, the artists welcomed the audience into the thoughtful frameworks of each piece and invited composer Osvaldo Golijov to do the same before the world premiere of his piece “Um Día Bom (A Good Day).” Through music and conversation, Brooklyn Rider began their three-performance series with a meditative and engaging night of music.
Violinist Colin Jacobsen reared back his bow with the might of his whole body before the opening notes of Kinan Azmeh’s composition “Dabke on Martense Street” broke the anticipatory silence of the night. Cameras aimed at the towering stage protruding from the bare floor across metal risers gave the show an exclusive feeling, like a backstage pass to a broadcasted event. As the piece matured into chaotic grandeur, the melody jumped from one instrument to the next amidst cryptic harmonies. As Violist Nicholas Cords explained afterwards, the work was composed at the height of lockdown and represented a dance in the streets of Brooklyn as imagined by Azmeh, the composer. In its eerie crescendo of complexity, the composition captured, perhaps, the hesitancy and strain of celebration when the end of the pandemic seemed far from near. Even now, as performers take the stage in front of a masked live audience, we strain to imagine the celebration of normalcy in the future. The power of this music to evoke critical meditations on contemporary life from the audience was made possible by the thoughtful discussion in between performances.
“Borderlands” was composed in “graphic score” by Matana Roberts for interpretation by Brooklyn Rider. Cords explained that the quartet wouldn’t be looking at notes for the next piece, but instead at artwork, words from research on the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, various time signatures, and “rules of engagement” as outlined by Roberts. The result was a percussive, asymmetrical, ominous display of passion with jarring slides and plucks of the strings and incessant chanting of headlines and catchphrases such as “we hold these truths to be self evident.” It was in this piece where audiences were left to question whether the moans and whirs and beeps emanating from the stage really came from cellist Michael Nicolas’ bow.
In the following piece, “Aroma a Distancia,” violinist Johnny Gandelsman similarly joined a series of other cacophonous sounds. At times, the music felt as if it were resonating from the body of a single instrument. In other portions, bright plucking and percussive taps, flicks, and slashes with the bow interrupted the wavelike flow of sound.
The show reached its peak with the exposition and execution of Osvaldo Golijov’s “Um Día Bom (A Good Day).” Golijov described what it was like writing for Brooklyn Rider, saying to the group “I can not only see how you are playing but feel how you bow,” recognizing how incredible it was that the same four instruments could sound so different in different hands. He then laid out the inspiration from his composition, from imagining the endless potentiality of a baby, hazy-eyed in its cradle to personal memorials to lost friends. The composition followed five acts that addressed death, loss, love, birth, and the warmth of good company with shocking immediacy. Jacobsen said at the end of the piece, “I wish I could keep playing it for a very long time,” as the pervasive melody of the final act surely resonated in the audience’s memory.
The finale was arranged by violinist Jacobsen himself, adapted from bossa nova artist João Gilberto’s song “Undiú.” As the quartet dropped their instruments for a vocal interlude with the singular lyric “Undiú,” the concert seemed to complete itself. It felt necessary for Brooklyn Rider to write their own “rules for engagement” as the music throughout the night warranted more than quiet observation. This provocative group will return to the Calderwood Studio GBH this year on Nov. 12 and again in 2022 on Mar. 18.

Last week, Netflix gave viewers a glimpse at the highly anticipated second season of their hit show “Bridgerton,” with a short but juicy scene that raised numerous questions about characters, plot, and drama for the upcoming season.
“Bridgerton” is a shining example of the romantic period drama genre: an entertaining, not-quite historically accurate spectacle full of Regency-era gowns, glittering ballrooms, and romantic escapades. The TV show is based on the popular eight-novel series of the same name, authored by Harvard graduate Julia Quinn ‘92. The storyline of the show’s first season was largely taken from the first book “The Duke and I,” which features eldest daughter Daphne Bridgerton (played by Phoebe H. Dynevor) as its main protagonist and her turbulent romance with Duke of Hastings Simon Bassett (Regé-Jean Page) as the center of its plot. The show, produced by Shonda Rhimes, attracted a whopping 82 million viewers after the first month of its airing, leading Netflix to swiftly confirm a second, third and fourth season.
Following the pattern of the novels, which each focus on a different sibling of the Bridgerton clan, the second season of “Bridgerton” centers around eldest son Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan S. Bailey), the dashing, duty-driven eldest brother and viscount of the Bridgerton family. While his character’s handsome charm and Bailey’s onscreen charisma would seem to denote a beloved character, Anthony’s reckless behavior and meddlesome actions in the name of misguided protection left a bad taste in many viewers’ mouths. If Season One demonstrated the need for his character’s future growth, then Season Two may be an important moment in Anthony’s story arc as he learns to take responsibility for his actions and the people he has promised to protect.
By the end of Season One, Anthony seems to have matured a bit, resolving to quit chasing the romantic dalliances that led him astray in favor of seeking out a suitable partner to head the Bridgerton family. This exciting first look revealed that he has decided to pursue Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran), a young lady eagerly seeking her love match as she debuts in London society. However, the actual released scene features another new character and potential romantic interest: the whip-smart, headstrong noblewoman Kate Sharma, played by Simone Ashley of “Sex Education.” While her novel counterpart Kate Sheffield is Anthony’s primary love interest, there seems to be no love lost between the two of them here. Kate believes Anthony to be unworthy of her younger sister Edwina, and his shallow criteria for a wife have ruffled her feathers.
In the clip, Anthony finds Kate on the balcony at an evening ball, where she proceeds to tell him off for his ridiculously high standards for his marriage match. Anthony willfully ignores Kate’s biting remarks and fixates on her comment about hiding his poor character with a pleasing smile: “So you find my smile pleasing,” he says, in a failed attempt at flirtation that leaves Kate indignant. After she delivers a satisfying final blow and storms off, leaving Anthony thoroughly surprised, the viewer can only hope Kate’s words made a lasting impression.
In a special interview hosted for a Netflix fan event, costars Simone Ashley and Jonathan Bailey spoke to the fulfilling experience of collaborating on set for the second season of “Bridgerton.” The actors’ chemistry was palpable even through the screen, which has excited viewers for their potential enemies-to-lovers plotline this season. Perhaps Kate’s defiant wit and stubborn rejection of Anthony’s unreasonable expectations will force him to re-evaluate his mindset and mature as a person, though hopefully Kate is also given her own space to grow as a character rather than simply serving Anthony’s story and character arc.
Kate is being introduced along with a slew of new characters and faces, among them the rest of the Sharma family. This inclusion of Indian nobility continues the show’s tradition of casting diverse actors for their characters, a departure from the typically all-white casts of most period dramas that has generated relevant discussion and criticism on the show’s handling of race-sensitive issues.
While images and clips of the actors on set have excited fans of the show, many viewers were disappointed to learn that Regé-Jean Page would not be reprising his role as the Duke of Hastings this season. Daphne and Simon’s story came to a relative close at the end of season one, and since the writing is largely staying true to the books, viewers will be seeing a lot less of Page’s smouldering gaze this season. Fortunately, Phoebe Dynevor will be making an appearance, though the absence of her handsome romantic counterpart may turn some viewers away from the show.
With production having resumed in mid-August of this year after pausing due to the pandemic, Season Two will likely premiere in mid to late 2022. Viewers can only hope that Anthony Bridgerton will receive the character development he needs this season as he searches for a romantic partner and learns to temper his recklessness in pursuit of responsibility, as befitting his position as heir to the Bridgerton family legacy.

What immediately stands out about Disney+’s new “Star Wars: Visions” are the stories it chooses not to tell.
Released Sept. 22, “Star Wars: Visions” is an animated miniseries set in the “Star Wars” universe. The new series consists of nine shorts from seven different anime studios, with each episode featuring different art styles, characters, and settings. The result is a unique, exciting new take on “Star Wars,” one that blends the classic iconography of the franchise with various iterations of Japanese culture and anime storytelling, and, perhaps most strikingly, one without a single mention of a Skywalker, Kenobi, Palpatine, Solo, or Organa. The series instead concerns itself with those on the margins of the galaxy, whose stories didn’t change the history of their universe but which matter all the same. “Star Wars: Visions” proves what many “Star Wars” fans have known all along — that the strength of the franchise lies not in leaning on recognizable bloodlines but in the breadth and depth of the “Star Wars” universe.
As each creator wrestles with the project itself, this diversity of storylines within the universe emerges. At its most basic level, “Star Wars: Visions” is just ‘anime Star Wars. The variety, then, comes from the ways in which each creator interprets what that means.
“The Ninth Jedi” serves as both one of the standouts of the series and as an example of one interpretation that emphasized the Star Wars canonical story. Produced by vaunted anime studio Production I.G, the episode tells the story of Kara, the daughter of a lightsaber smith who must deliver her father’s lightsabers to a new group of aspiring jedi warriors in the hope of restoring the long-dead Jedi Order. At just under 22 minutes long, the episode gets the closest to a traditional “Star Wars” cinematic experience, featuring incredible lightsaber duels, a rousing speeder chase, and a strong, plucky protagonist. “The Ninth Jedi” is a fantastic Star Wars story that happens to be an anime.
“Tatooine Rhapsody” is a lower-key hidden gem which takes the opposite approach. Produced by the much newer Studio Colorido, the story centers around a small rock band who is targeted by Boba Fett because their bass guitarist is the son of Jabba the Hutt. Whereas “The Ninth Jedi” showcases how well anime can be used to tell a Star Wars story, “Tatooine Rhapsody” takes the iconography and style of Star Wars to tell a story far more in line with a traditional TV anime. Its rock music, desert-punk aesthetic, and the earnest coming-of-age story at its heart evokes mid 2000s anime classics like “Eureka Seven” and “Gurren Lagann.” The climax is particularly effective: A rousing performance that inspires the youth of Tatooine and saves the band from execution, the ending exemplifies the classic anime theme that the passionate feelings of youth can be more powerful than any force in the universe. “Tatooine Rhapsody” is a great anime set in the Star Wars universe.
There is also a third option, demonstrated by Studio Trigger’s "THE TWINS." Directed by iconic director Hiroyuki Imaishi, who is known best for directing “Gurren Lagann”, "THE TWINS" sees ‘anime “Star Wars”’ and takes that to mean ANIME STAR WARS. The ‘anime-ness’ is cranked up to 11 in a dramatic story of twins, one brother and one sister created by the Sith, passionately dueling over their clashing ideals. The episode is filled with insanely over-the-top battles, crazy powers, dramatic on-the-nose speeches, and the main hero using a hyperdrive booster lightsaber to cut a Star Destroyer in half. The action is stellar in every episode of the series, but "THE TWINS" takes the cake for its sheer bombast, energy, and creativity. "THE TWINS" breathes anime storytelling conventions, with the power of youth and love literally breaking the laws of reality. But it also breathes “Star Wars.” The episode opens with an ominous shot of a Star Destroyer, panning to reveal itself to be two Star Destroyers combined, a nod to the iconic opening of “A New Hope.” Soon after, we see the Sith sister standing on the bridge of the ship, arms back. The ending sees the brother sitting atop his destroyed starship looking out at a binary sunset, the music swelling. In the hands of a lesser creator, these obvious visual references would read as cheesy, hackneyed, and silly. But by embracing an over-the-top simplicity filled with burning passion and an overflow of emotion, "THE TWINS" succeeds with aplomb.
Not all of the episodes succeed quite as much as these three. “The Elder,” the other Studio Trigger episode, is an entertaining enough narrative, but weaker animation, too much similarity to other episodes, and a story that lacks scope make it a low point in the series. Too many episodes, including “The Elder,” “The Duel,” “Akakiri,” and “The Village Bride,” had the structure of an outsider Jedi arriving at some small town and solving their problem, although “Akakiri” differs pretty substantially from the other examples elsewhere. The main characters’ status as visitors on foreign soil distances the audience from them and flattens their characterization, as their background information and motivation gets lost. Then again, this may come down to personal preference, as these stories come from another way of imagining ‘anime Star Wars’ — that is, as classic Japan-inspired “Star Wars,” borrowing heavily from traditional wandering samurai stories. “Lop and Echo” has a surprisingly unique problem given the nature of the series. With an ambitious, dramatic story and challenging themes of colonialism and tradition, the story needed more time for the excellent ending to have the impact it should have, even if it still was a personal favorite. Finally, “TO-B1” is another excellently crafted episode that takes a similar approach to “Tatooine Rhapsody.” The episode peeks in on another small, strange slice of the Star Wars galaxy through a distinctly anime-esque story and aesthetic, this one clearly inspired by older super robot shows, particularly “Astro Boy.”
Ultimately, “Star Wars: Visions” celebrates diversity, both the diversity of anime and the diversity of the “Star Wars” canon. That commitment to and celebration of diversity means that any “Star Wars” fan, anime fan, or fan of good storytelling will find something that fits their tastes, especially since each episode is exceptionally well made from a technical level and looks gorgeous. “Star Wars: Visions” is “Star Wars” at its best: bold, ambitious, creative, and, most importantly, innovative. Hopefully, this signals a positive change in the franchise for years to come.

The world looks very different now than it did in August of 2015, the last time a TV audience saw Jon Stewart behind a desk as the host of acclaimed news-comedy hybrid show “The Daily Show.” Watching his newest project “The Problem With Jon Stewart,” produced in association with Apple TV+, it is hard not to feel as though Stewart can’t quite keep up with the times.
“The Daily Show,” which has been hosted by South African comedian Trevor Noah since Stewart’s departure, has always had a strong social justice angle. Unlike other comedic news programs such as SNL’s “Weekend Update,” “The Daily Show” did not position itself as simply a satire of the news but rather as a show that, through satirically examining corruption and political malfeasance, attempted to speak truth to power.
When Donald Trump came on the scene around the time Stewart left television, “The Daily Show,” “Last Week Tonight,” and other clip shows reacted to him just as they had reacted to other conservative politicians: by laughing at him. But, as Dan Brooks writes in his New York Times Piece “How President Trump Ruined Late Night,” Trump himself so capitalized on his own inherent ridiculousness that this approach became untenable, with Trump himself saying things so incredibly incendiary that it was impossible to tell if he was joking or not. According to Brooks, irony has become a tool of the right, “a means to advance joke versions of its actual agenda, in ways that make it hard to distinguish between the two.” It became impossible for comedians to satirize Trump in a vacuum, as his satirical quality was part of his power.
Now, under Biden, it's unclear if comedy can once again be used as a tool of political accountability. This is the central question plaguing “The Problem with Jon Stewart,” and, at least in the first episode, Stewart and his team never quite settle on an answer.
The first episode, titled “War,” deals with a rather abstruse issue — burn pits. Utilized by the U.S. army in War Zones, burn pits are large piles of medical waste, human excrement, and other trash that are burned as a method of disposal. After spending a large amount of time in contact with the highly carcinogenic products of these fires, veterans often develop cancer and other life-threatening disabilities.
The most compelling part of the show is Stewart’s interview with a panel of veterans and their spouses who describe the difficulty of finding medical help for these ailments, as the Department of Veterans Affairs does not cover burn pit-related conditions. Stewart handles these conversations with incredible empathy, but his care is undermined when the interview cuts to a comedy skit about how to make a burn pit at home. Like most of the jokes in the show, instead of seeming funny, the bit comes off as insensitive and awkward.
There does not seem to be a clear villain in the burn pit story, even after Stewart interviews the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, Denis Richard McDonough. McDonough seems like the obvious candidate for this role as he, more than anyone else, has the ability to help the victims of burn pits. When Stewart pushes him and questions him on why the VA refuses to change its coverage policy, McDonough is unable to give a clear answer. However, this lack of clarity does not come off as malicious. The conclusion, instead, seems to be that bureaucracy, not McDonough individually, is holding back necessary change.
Under Trump, the political enemy could not be taken down by comedy. Under Biden, the political enemy is embodied less by individuals and more by a system, which is hard to imagine comedy effectively changing. As a result, the jokes in Stewart’s show have none of the same cutting-edge resonance that they did in Stewart’s “Daily Show” era. Instead, they come off as cries of desperation. Maybe, then, the problem with “The Problem with Jon Stewart” is not Jon Stewart — maybe it's that in the current political moment, the comedy-news hybrid show, or at least Stewart’s familiar version of it, no longer works.

“To me, leadership has always meant service,” said singer, actor, and writer Ruva Chigwedere ‘21. In her four years at Harvard, she honed her craft and created spaces for Black artists on campus.
Chigwedere immigrated to the United States from Zimbabwe at age four. When she moved from New Jersey to Cambridge for college, she planned to study economics in the hopes of securing a stable job; a career in the arts didn’t guarantee that. However, she soon realized that her true passion was acting, and so decided to gain as much experience in Harvard theater productions as possible. Chigwedere eventually chose to concentrate jointly in Theater, Dance, and Media and History and Literature.
Chigwedere attended the Shakespeare Summer School Program at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts and played Kate in “Taming of the Shrew.” Then, in the fall of 2018, Chigwedere auditioned for the Harvard College Opera production of “Cendrillon.” Though initially cast in a featured ensemble role, the directors promoted her to the principal role of Dorothée. Chigwedere emphasized how the production allowed her to gain much more experience in a short amount of time.
Chigwedere also joined the Kuumba Singers, which was founded in 1970 in the midst of the political turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement, two years after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. “They were one of the spaces in the Black community that I felt most at home in,” Ruva says. She also stressed the importance of the group’s continuing legacy of Black community organizing. “The spirit of [the Kuumba Singers] really mimics some of the Black community organizations that were fighting for justice during the time,” she said.
Chigwedere’s contributions to the Harvard community don’t stop there: She also expanded the reach of the Harvard Black Community & Student Theater Group, or BlackC.A.S.T., a student-run organization that supports Black student theater artists. When Chigwedere arrived at Harvard, the organization had taken a long hiatus, and its reputation was less than stellar. “The stereotype that BlackC.A.S.T. had in the Harvard theater community at the time was that they couldn’t put together a good show,” Chigwedere says. Hoping to reinvigorate the group, she joined the board, serving as secretary and then co-president.
One of her goals was addressing the organization’s lack of institutional memory and creating mechanisms for passing down knowledge about theater to younger students. “There are people who know how to do things, individual people have their connections to different groups. That has been one of BlackC.A.S.T.’s strengths, but also its greatest fault: that things end with people,” Chigwedere says. “Once a person graduates, a connection is lost.”
Her other accomplishments with BlackC.A.S.T. include solidifying the group’s relationship with other Harvard theater institutions — such as the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and the American Repertory Theater — and reaffirming its connections with other Black student organizations.
As a sophomore, Chigwedere directed the Black Playwrights Festival, an annual showcase of student works. The 2021 Festival, which took place virtually in March, focused on the theme “Some Kind of Tomorrow,” featuring readings from five student playwrights and a conversation with playwrights Lydia R. Diamond and Michael R. Jackson.
Chigwedere’s desire to cultivate a space for the Black artistic community at Harvard came out of her appreciation for Black students before her who created safer spaces. “Yes, this is a white supremacist institution. And there's so many different things that have happened that have been traumatizing, or that have been painful for me to experience as a Black person,” she said. “But I'm able to take up space and to be seen as [making] valuable contributions on this campus because of those people.”
Still, Chigwedere has long been frustrated by the treatment of Black women in Harvard theater. “It made me really sad to see ... how Black women were systematically kept out of different places,” she said.
And the problem isn’t unique to Harvard. Chigwedere realized while reading her program at a West End production of “Dreamgirls” that there is a dearth of roles for Black women in theater. “In every one of those actors’ resumes, they were either Deena or Effie in “Dreamgirls” and they were either Celie or Nettie in “The Color Purple,” she says. “There are just two roles out there.” Her desire to change that narrative motivated her to write her senior thesis, a play titled “For Daughters of Ezili; or, How to be a Black Girl and Find Love and Survive 101.”
“I'm going to need to create something for me in order to be able to work,” Chigwedere says. The result was a celebration of Black women’s complexity and joy. After graduation, Ruva continued to develop her thesis play for production, and is planning to possibly audition for conservatory and write her own music.
Her advice to current students? Prioritize. “I wish I could shake every single Harvard student,” she said. “The more you stretch yourself thin, the more you will hate all the things that you actually love doing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the sweeping sand dunes of Arrakis to the towering concrete bunkers of Caladan, nothing can prepare audiences for the raw spectacle that is Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune.” The Academy-Award-nominated director (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”) has crafted an anomalous film in today’s blockbuster era. Whatever “Dune” lacks in original storytelling, it more than makes up for with its methodical pace, awe-inspiring cinematography, and powerful sound design. In short, “Dune” is sci-fi storytelling on an epic scale — a completely transportive experience that audiences rarely get in cinemas anymore.
Villeneuve’s film is an adaptation of the first half of Frank Herbert’s eponymous novel. It follows Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), heir to Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and son of the Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Everything starts to unravel when the emperor gifts House Atreides with the resource-rich planet Arrakis, formerly bequeathed to the tyrannical House Harkonnen. It’s a thinly-veiled power play: soon, House Atreides is at the mercy of House Harkonnen, who return with reinforcements in a crusade against the Duke. Meanwhile, Paul makes inroads with the native Fremen tribe, hoping to build an alliance to stop House Harkonnen.
While “Dune” is wrapped in intricate layers of intriguing world building, from the magical Bene Gesserit sisterhood to the gargantuan 400-foot sandworm, it’s a pretty simple story at its core. Paul is the “chosen-one,” a space messiah prophesied to save the Fremen and end the war on Arrakis. Audiences have seen the “chosen-one” archetype recapitulated again and again, from “Star Wars” to “Harry Potter” to “Superman.” Though there’s nothing wrong with revisiting tried-and-tested territory, it’s not handled with much subtlety in “Dune.”
Perhaps the film feels hollow because Paul is a blank protagonist. “Dune” is a story about Paul’s exploration of self-identity as he follows in the footsteps of his father. But that journey is largely emotionless. Villeneuve actually executes this theme with far more poignancy in “Blade Runner 2049,” where he resists the urge to spoon-feed audiences, and forces them to sieve through clues about the protagonist, K. “Blade Runner 2049” asked audiences thoughtful questions: How do memories shape our identity? And if our memories are artificial, does that make us any less human? But what was careful and nuanced in “2049” is ham-handed in “Dune” as Paul is imbued with mostly forgettable characteristics. Perhaps Villeneuve wanted to leave Paul as a blank canvas for audiences to project their own emotions onto. But audiences aren’t automatically going to be invested in a character just because he asks “Am I the messiah?” every few minutes.
Just as his previous sci-fi films “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049,” Villeneuve paces “Dune” methodically. This gives time for audiences to soak in the gargantuan scope of the film: it allows the film’s A-list ensemble cast to give weighty performances, and it lends more gravity to the film’s thrilling action scenes. It also means that Arrakis feels like a fully realized, lived-in world, with its unique brand of politics, religions, architecture, and monsters.
Put simply, “Dune” excels at being big. From shots of the sandcrawler-esque spice-mining machines to ones of a giant sandworm, Villeneuve frames the film’s many compelling action scenes in gorgeous wides. Cinematographer Greig Fraser’s desaturated colors might feel muted compared to the sharp contrast and neon backdrop of “Blade Runner 2049,” but it adds character to the desert and mood to the stunningly detailed, formalist production designs. Fraser mentioned in an interview that he filmed “Dune” in digital before converting it to 35mm, and the resulting grain adds a hallucinatory quality to the sand. Fraser also changes the color grading during Paul’s visions — turning the once dark, mysterious desert into an overexposed, trance-like realm.
What’s remarkable about the scope in “Dune” is that it feels so tactile, and that’s in large part due to careful attention to sound design. The theater quite literally shakes whenever the sandworm approaches, and there’s a soft, tense hum whenever characters activate their body shields, ready for combat. In particular, a score from Hans Zimmer (“Inception,” “Gladiator”) dominates “Dune.” It’s haunting, chilling, and plays up the mystical elements of the vast world building in the film. The awe-inspiring sound and visuals cocoon viewers in a barrage of sensory stimuli that makes for a visceral viewing experience.
Villeneuve once quipped that his live-action adaptation of “Dune” was going to be “Star Wars” for adults. While his film doesn’t quite have the emotion and heart to earn that moniker, “Dune” is a masterful technical display of what more blockbuster films should be.

If you’re at all acquainted with Instagram or Twitter, you’ve likely stumbled across the image of a contemplative Grimes, in a getup straight out of “Dune,” leaning against a street sign and reading “The Communist Manifesto.” The pictures began circulating after Grimes, born Claire Elise Boucher, “semi-separated” from Tesla founder Elon Musk, with whom she had been in a three-year romantic partnership until September. They also welcomed a son together in 2020 with a name so absurd it violated California state law.
The “semi-separation,” which one would be hard-pressed to call a formal break-up considering the two are on good terms and still live together, was confirmed by Musk to Page Six and comes after copious trolling and several public disputes between the pair, including a heavily meme-ified Twitter exchange between the two regarding pronouns. It’s amid the chaos surrounding this split that these pictures of Grimes’ acquaintance with Marx and Engels surfaced.
Unfortunately for some, the stunt was not the hilarious double back on Musk that stan Twitter hoped it would be: On Oct. 3rd, Grimes revealed on Twitter that she had posed with the book to troll paparazzi, and on Instagram affirmed that she is not a communist while stating, “I’m more interested in a radical decentralized ubi [sic] that I think could potentially be achieved [through] crypto and gaming but I haven’t ironed that idea out enough yet to explain it.”
Despite the claim that she does not identify as a communist, she published a TikTok seemingly aligned with communist beliefs just 4 months ago on June 6, captioned “A.I. Is the fastest path to communism.” In the video, she issued a vague and sometimes laughable rant arguing tha A.I. could essentially weed out political corruption and ensure the general population’s basic needs are met. Many celebrities claim to abstain from participating in any political discourse so as not to unfairly influence or misguide fans, but Grimes’ inability to commit or articulate any concrete political stance is not due to her humility. It’s also important to note that despite her alternative style and music releases, Grimes is apparently a product of circumstance: a woman born to wealthy parents who, even without being attached to the richest man in the world, has a net worth of about $3 million from her career. Her privilege allows her to don socialism at will to appeal to her target demographic — a primarily young, democratic, and LGBTQ-identifying fanbase — and discard those ideas when accused of hypocrisy because of her choice in exorbitantly wealthy, occasionally transphobic partners.
At the end of the day, Grimes is a pop culture figure first, and a political philosopher somewhere around twelfth or thirteenth. No matter how much incoherent theory Grimes deploys via various social media platforms, the reception on social media appears to range from amusement to exasperation, scarcely touching serious consideration of her ideas. It’s a potentially worrying trend to see unqualified celebrities dishing out unsolicited advice on policy, but if all the people trolling her are any indication, we have nothing to worry about.

After a year and a half of isolation, great uncertainties, and political turmoil, being back on tour for different artists can feel equally anxiety-inducing and exciting. For Sam Nelson Harris, frontman of Ithaca-based pop-rock band X Ambassadors, being back on the road for the first time in two years has been, above all, a relief.
“Excited and happy are just not descriptive enough words to describe how I feel to be back out on tour right now,” Harris said in a phone call with The Crimson. “It feels like a relief. I’ve been in such turmoil over ‘Who am I again?’ ‘What do I do?’ And this is just an affirmation. This is what I do.”
It makes sense that being back on the stage is best described as a relief for Harris, who grew up doing musical theater. In anticipation of returning to the stage and wanting to hone in on a new skill, Harris picked up dancing late last year. Originally an undertaking for the music video for X Ambassadors’ single “My Own Monster,” dancing has become a way for Harris to become in tune with his body as well as enhance his performance skills.
“I’ve always loved dancing. Growing up, I had so many friends who were dancers. I smoked cigarettes with the ballerinas after they were done dancing,” Harris said, laughing. “I was always really envious of them. I loved ballet and I loved dancing. I did a lot of musical theater growing up so I ended up doing a lot of dancing through that. But this is the first time I’ve dedicated time to it.”
Harris is open and honest about his work, his skills, his imperfections, and his artistry. His authenticity shines through in the way he talks about himself and his music. He has nothing to hide in conversation or in his art.
Even when talking about dancing, Harris is brutally honest.
“It’s hard as fuck and could be so frustrating when you’re a neurotic perfectionist like I am and are working with an incredible dancer — my movement coach is an incredible dancer. She’s been doing it her whole life. So when she touches her toes, it looks like poetry. And when I touch my toes, it looks like… I don’t know. I look like a lump,” he said.
Despite the challenges of dancing and training with a professional, his love of the art form shines through.
“It can be frustrating but it’s been the most rewarding thing. I really love it. It’s been such a great way to get to know myself and to know my body. And I think it’s really upped my performance game a lot.”
Harris’ optimism, love of art and life, and bright-eyed thinking are key to his character. Even when things are tough and seem bleak, Harris finds ways to look at the bright side. These dynamics between recognizing that things are hard while still holding on to hope shine through on X Ambassadors’ third studio album, “The Beautiful Liar,” released on Sept. 24.
“The Beautiful Liar” is unlike any other work X Ambassadors have released before. The album unfolds as if it were a radio show reading of a children’s book called “The Beautiful Liar.” The opening track “CHAPTER ONE: The Sleeping Giant” acts as an introduction to the book and the story the album is going to take listeners through. Adding to the public book-reading structure of the album, other tracks include “CHAPTER TWO: Enter the Shadow,” skits like “A BRIEF WORD FROM OUR SPONSORS,” and the finale “AUTHOR’S NOTE.”
Harris describes the unconventional structure of the album best.
“This whole album is a whackadoo, fucking, acid trip through a Warner Brothers cartoon. That’s what it feels like and that was the goal,” Harris said.
“The Beautiful Liar” shows a new side of the band’s artistry. The LP is personal to Harris in a way the band’s previous ones, “VHS” and “Orion,” have not been. Its genre-bending musicality further exemplifies this, as it reflects Harris’ mindset while writing.
“The Beautiful Liar” is an amalgamation of genres like punk (on tracks like “Conversations With My Friends”), musical theater (“Theater of War”), pop-rock (“My Own Monster”), and more. In an Instagram post about the album, Harris described it as “an album that felt as unhinged as [he] did, and as the whole world felt around [him].”
When it came to breaking down the themes of the album, including mental health, politics, war, love, and self-contradictions, Harris had a lot to share. As is true to who he is, he was honest in his description of the overall album, its individual songs, and what he was thinking about while writing.
“[There are also] songs that struggle with topics of mental health. That’s always been a struggle for me. Searching for the contradictions in ourselves, that’s what makes us so human,” Harris said, reflecting on all of the different elements of the album. “[There’s] still a little bit of that dumb optimism that probably doesn’t make sense in the world as it is. I still have a bit of it, no matter what. I’m always going to have a bit of this blind faith in something; I don’t know if it’s in humanity or the world or the spirits. But I have this dumb optimism, I like to call it. It’s still there but I found on this record I let myself move away from it more than I have in the past.”
While the album is entitled “The Beautiful Liar,” to Harris, it is anything but false.
“The whole record has been the truest expression of my brain and the way that I am as a person.”
You can catch Harris and X Ambassadors bringing “The Beautiful Liar” to life at Big Night Live in Boston on Thursday, Oct 28.

On Sept. 17, The Harvard Art Museums opened its doors to the new “Devour the Land” photography exhibition. The showing is divided into three rooms and travels through the ramifications of nuclear war, environmental poisoning, and urbanization in six parts titled: “Arming America” Part 1 and Part 2, “Slow Violence,” “Regeneration,” “Other Battlefields,” and “Resistance.”
According to curator Makeda Best, “Devour the Land” originates from General William Tecumseh Sherman’s description of a devastated and desolate land following the Union Army’s “scorched earth” policy during the Civil War. Images captured by photographer George Barnard, who accompanied General Sherman on this campaign, depicted “destruction with a certain beauty,” according to Best. This tragic beauty is a thread throughout the three rooms — and a sentiment shared by attendees.
“It’s quite deep, and unfortunately, sad, but there’s also a beauty,” said security guard Patricia A. Daly while standing in front of a series of photos by influential photographer Richard Misrach. In the center of a sun bleached landscape stands a yellow school bus ravaged by nuclear weapons and rot; the photograph is labeled “School Bus Target.”
Disparities within the artwork scenes were picked up by other onlookers as well. Visitor Michael E. Halwes said “The pieces that have really contrasted the war on terror aspects of the Gulf War were pretty compelling and then also the ones where you get a good juxtaposition of the industrial masking [of] the audience's view of the nature behind it.”
This contrast is most prominent in Frederica Armstrong’s photo series “In Plain Site.” Armstrong captures suburban areas of Silicon Valley in her series, areas which have an aura of the mundane: and parking lot, a street corner at sunset. Below each image is the corresponding EPA classification number that identifies it as a superfund site. “The National Priorities List creates lists of sites that are so toxic as to need a superfund [which is] a fusion of federal dollars to clean up and kind of get it under control,” says Best, waving finger quotations in the air around the words “clean up.” Below two images read “Site ready for use: No.”
In a glass box in the center of one of the rooms of the exhibit lies a card titled “Nuclear Mail” with the date August, 1982 in the top left corner. The card reads: “WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Postal Service officials revealed plans to assure mail delivery in the event of nuclear war. … Should Washington D.C. be destroyed, the national postal service will be run from Memphis, Tenn. If Memphis is also devastated, San Bruno Calif. will take over.” Best touches on these effects, saying that “the military is the number one polluter in the country.” Best spoke to the exhaustion of resources done by the scorched earth policy. “We’re still doing that, we’re using up our land, but we’re only poisoning ourselves. We’re only destroying ourselves this time.”
The exhibit stands out from most atomic photography presentations in that it addresses the long term effects of this war on land. Best credits “Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor” by Rob Nixon as her inspiration for the third section of the exhibit “Slow Violence.” Best says the book makes “recognition of violence as attritional versus spectacular.” A series of photographs depict an area in Louisiana known as Cancer Alley, which has one of the largest concentrations of petrochemical plants and refineries in the nation. Most citizens of the area are descendants of slaves. Best addresses the question of geographical racism thoroughly throughout the exhibit. One frame depicts the bright lights of a penitentiary — whose prisoners are disproportionately black — against a pitch black sky. In response, Best says “Many prisons in the country are superfund sites, so what does that mean?”
This exhibition, as much great art does, asks the question: “What’s next?” Attendee Micheal E. Hawles admits that he feels pessimism about the future but says, “People have a responsibility to bear witness to what’s going on in the world around them. … There’s always the chance that someone is going to be exposed to new information and I think it's just about the constant drumming of building public sentiment against these sorts of practices that, ideally, get reflected in policy changes.”
Attendee Ashley M. Kelley was also emotionally impacted by the exhibit. “It's important to take note, [that] even though you aren’t able to see what’s around you, and if you’re privileged enough, know that this is still going on and health hazards have large effects on families and generations,” says Kelley.
It’s clear that the issue of nuclear warfare is not a linear one, but one with many starting points and stories that run parallel to each other throughout history. This exhibition stands as a testament to these parallel stories and, hopefully, points towards an end to such damaging practices.

What would a Monday on Twitter be without the announcement of another worthless remake? This time it’s the 1999 cult classic “Cruel Intentions,” starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon, and Ryan Phillippe. The movie features two step-siblings at an elite prep school who make a wager involving seducing the headmaster’s daughter. Callous, dramatic and violent, it’s an enduring classic that embodies the dark teen drama that epitomized the late ’90s.
Unfortunately, a reboot is in the works with IMDb TV — following the source material of the original, an epistolary novel called “Les Liaisons dangereuses” by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, it will instead be set at a college in Washington, D.C. The increased age can only be a good move considering the subject matter — violence, sex and deception — and while the changed setting could provide some new avenues for exploration, it is unclear whether this justifies the completely new incarnation.
This is also not the first attempt at a “Cruel Intentions” reboot. In 2016, NBC ordered a pilot starring Sarah Michelle Gellar reprising her role as Kathryn Merteuil, but it was not picked up. The reasons for this are unclear, though it is interesting to consider why there has been so much behind-the-scenes interest in the revival in recent years.
This latest reboot will be written and executive produced by Phoebe Fisher (a producer of the stunning and grounded “Euphoria”) and Sara Goodman (who produced 2020’s utterly forgettable “I Know What You Did Last Summer” reboot). Little more is currently known about the project, so it is difficult to judge how much promise this reboot has. However, one question remains: Why does this need to exist?
The topic of remakes and reboots is by no means a new one — overzealous television executives have been saturating our screens for years. However, “Cruel Intentions” seems to be yet another attempt at mining ‘90s and ‘00s cult classics for cheap, unoriginal content. Their goal appears to be to make people who loved the original complain and make teenagers unfamiliar with the original wonder what the big deal was.
Now, is every single teen remake of this kind a travesty? No. But to stand any chance of being valuable, there should be some reason or motivation that makes all of the time, effort and money put into its creation worth it.
For example, perhaps it should be transformative in some way. The recent uptick in cult classic films reimagined as musicals certainly fits this description — “Legally Blonde,” “Beetlejuice,” “Heathers,” and “Bring It On” stand out as prominent examples — as they actually do something creative with their respective source material, even if the quality of the individual musicals vary. In fact, even “Cruel Intentions” has already received similar treatment as a jukebox musical first staged in 2015. It is unlikely this new iteration will be as creative.
A reboot could also function as a sequel instead of a do-over — in fact, the previous attempt at a “Cruel Intentions” reboot intended to take this route, but it is unknown whether the difficulty of making a new audience care about the run-up to a story they were never part of was why the concept was axed. For example, although “The Craft: Legacy” was marketed as a sequel, it was not only incredibly bland, but also incoherent with its source material and full of confused and contradictory messaging. Perhaps then, a sequel (or indeed any reboot) needs to have something of value to contribute to its original.
Some examples point to the key being in modern technology. While not teen-focused, 2014’s “Interstellar” paid homage to the docking on the rotating ship scene from “2001: A Space Odyssey” (only this ship was spinning 100 times faster) — and it was awesome. Still, even this reasoning is not always valid — we need only compare the quality of the CGI lion in 2005’s “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” to the ones in 2019’s “The Lion King.”
Evidently, this boils down to the idea a remake needs a point other than as a cash grab. It should aim to do something new and be a quality piece of media that can stand on its own — and ideally do both, but clearly it’s dangerous to ask for too much.
Yet all of this remake business is still a middle finger to new, undiscovered, original creators everywhere. Film studios are overwhelmingly sending the message that taking risks and making meaningful art is far less important when you can probably maintain the bottom line by regurgitating something that’s already been done.
What is so baffling about this entire practice is that most of these remakes are either categorically terrible or so overwhelmingly mediocre that everyone immediately forgets they exist (hello, “Gossip Girl” reboot). This trend of reboots might be acceptable if they weren’t all so underwhelming — prevalent examples like “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” (which was deeply confused and inconsistent) and “Fate: The Winx Saga” (breathtakingly generic and an insult to the cartoon) have absolutely no staying power and invariably do a disservice to their respective source materials. Are studios hiring people who do not understand the original media? Are they just grossly incompetent? Both?
Let’s hope “Cruel Intentions” can defy the odds and actually be a quality piece of media. But maybe don’t hold your breath.

The 73rd Emmy Awards started with this year's host, Cedric the Entertainer, and fellow guests jamming to the chorus of the opening song, a riff on the Biz Markie classic: “TV, you’ve got what I need.” Unfortunately, the ceremony was interrupted by several too-long comedic bits that didn’t land, making the ceremony drag on. While many of the shows nominated for Emmys this year represented groundbreaking innovations and achievements in television, the ceremony itself fell short of spectacular.
To its credit, the show seemed geared towards helping audiences forget about the global pandemic — sometimes even too effectively. Performative acknowledgments that the show followed COVID-19 protocols seemed to be the only real protocol: Guests, nominees and performers kissing, hugging, and singing do not scream social distancing. Even Seth Rogen remarked[,] “There are way too many of us in this room, what are we doing?” Despite this, the Emmys were a proverbial breath of fresh air. After nearly two years of hardship amidst the pandemic, it was exciting to see some of last year’s most meaningful, unique shows that offered us much[-]needed escape highlighted through the ceremony.
The night was a particular success for Netflix’s acclaimed royal biopic series “The Crown.” Nominated for 20 Emmy Awards this season, “The Crown” took home seven, including their first Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner Olivia Coleman was in disbelief, admitting, “I’d have put money on that not happening.” Outstanding Supporting Actress in A Drama Series winner Gillian Anderson was understandably confused when a reporter asked her whether she had spoken to the long-deceased Margaret Thatcher about her Emmy-winning role. For six-time nominee Anderson, this was her second Emmy win in the arguably most competitive category of the night 24 years after she took home an Emmy for her role in “The X-Files.” Her win marked the end of an incredibly successful awards season for the actress, who also won Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and Critics Choice Television Awards for her portrayal of former Prime Minister Thatcher. From across the pond, with cast and crew gathered in a UK restaurant due to COVID-19 regulations, “The Crown“ made history by being the first show to ever sweep all seven drama categories.
Newcomer “Ted Lasso” dominated the comedic categories, winning a total of four Emmys, including Outstanding Comedy Series. While accepting his award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, Jason Sudeikis reminded the audience to appreciate and celebrate what’s most important in their lives and communities, explaining that “this show’s about family, this show is about mentors and teachers, this show is about teammates, and I wouldn’t be here without those three things in my life.”
Hannah Waddingham did not only win the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Show but would have swept the competition for the most relatable speech of the night, opening her acceptance with “ARGHHH Jesus Christ on a bike!” On and off stage, Waddingham was simply a delight — no one else was as excited about every single winner as Waddingham, distinctive in her custom Christian Siriano coral pink pleated chiffon gown.
Sadly, “The Handmaid’s Tale“ told exactly one tale at this year's Emmys: Previous Emmy success is not an indicator of future Emmy success. Out of 21 nominations, “The Handmaid’s Tale“ did not take home a single award, setting a record for the most Emmy losses in a season.
But more importantly, what happened to diversity? The Emmys started out with the most diverse field of nominees in the body’s history. The show’s host and many of the award presenters were BIPOC actors or performers. But not a single person of color won any of the major acting awards. Diversity might have been represented in the nominees but was nowhere to be found among the recipients, despite the number of talented actors of color up for awards.
However, three Emmy winners made history on Sunday night. “RuPaul’s Drag Race“ won the Emmy for Outstanding Competition Program, making RuPaul the most-awarded person of color in Emmy history. Debbie Allen became the first Black woman to ever receive the Governor's Award, and Michaela Coel became the first Black woman to win the Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series.
Both of these women did not come to joke around, delivering heartfelt and inspirational speeches that were the highlight of the ceremony. Coel challenged her fellow writers. “Write the tale that scares you, that makes you feel uncertain, that is uncomfortable. I dare you. Do not be afraid to disappear… from us for a while, and see what comes to you in the silence,” she said. “I dedicate this story to every single survivor of sexual assault.”
Allen used her speech to emphasize that each and everyone’s story matters, encouraging the audience, “It is time for you to tell your stories, it will make us a better place.”
Ultimately, the 73rd Emmy Awards underlined the power that television can have. In a world being torn apart by sexism and racism, television must be used as a critical and thought-provoking tool. It is essential to recognize those artists, the ones steering away from the common narrative, using their platform to present untold stories, daring to be different. From this year’s show, it is clear that the Emmys still have a long road to travel to actually recognize and celebrate the diverse talent in television today.

After three seasons of scintillating scandal, heartbreak, and poignant social commentary, the last thing any viewer anticipated was for the fourth installment of Netflix’s “Dear White People” to be performed in the style of ‘90s R&B. While the third season’s escapade into the Ivy League secret-society-scene toed the line between worthwhile mystery and fan-serving fantasy, the fourth season’s new musical direction most definitely sent the series flying off of the well-beaten path. On a positive note, the main conflicts of this season provided writers opportunities for adept and relevant social commentary. However, this season’s inability to balance realistic character development and genuine emotional conflict in between oddly placed homages to NSYNC leaves viewers wondering if “Dear White People” was even worth finishing.
Like many final installments of long-running series, the fourth season of “Dear White People” is told in retrospect as aged versions of the main cast reminisce and critique their younger selves. In this pandemic-wracked future, Sam and Lionel — appearing middle-aged based on a few gray streaks and an overgrown goatee — are placed in temporary quarantine together after Lionel’s book signing. Feeling like sellouts, as they both sacrificed their artistic integrity in pursuit of commercial paychecks, they agree to create a meaningful joint project — the film and narrative retelling of their senior year at Winchester. Unfortunately, this means reckoning with the traumas and conflicts which peppered their final semesters.
Since past seasons have often leaned towards being plot driven, it's no surprise that these conflicts shape out to be the most impactful aspects of the show. The main friction of this season takes place against the backdrop of the Varsity Show — a traditionally racist comedy performance organized by Pastiche. Set in the present academic year, in the wake of the institutional backpedaling following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, Troy and Fried Chicanery set out to reclaim the Varsity Show by adapting it into a 90’s R&B musical. Although the new and improved performance intends to highlight and empower the Black community, the physical performance itself is still expected to occur in Beckford Hall — which was named after a slave owner. In response, Black A.F. — a subgroup within the B.S.U — organize to protest the performance and the Black students putting it on.
While many of the previous plot points in “Dear White People” tended to rely on shock value — consider Moses’s predatory reveal or Coco’s pregnancy — this storyline felt surprisingly nuanced. Watching the activist organizations wrestle between various modes of attaining racial progress holds a jarring mirror to the realities of Black university life. For some, like Iesha, progress is only attainable by demolishing the system which kept Black people oppressed — hence why performing in a space dedicated to a holder of enslaved people inherently negates all attempts at Black empowerment. Conversely others, like Troy, find immense value in reclamation — viewing the process of reframing what was once exclusionary into something which celebrates Blackness as activism in itself— regardless of where the show occurs.
Just as the Black community is not monolithic, neither are their definitions of activism or advancement. At a time when there are ongoing conversations within Black organizations about what counts as advancement versus simply institutional pacification, it's refreshing to see these interactions reflected within television. Although the plot was interesting, this season’s confusing character arcs and lack of realistic emotional development led most scenes to fall stale.
After spending three seasons creating characters with distinct personalities, passions, and dynamics, some of this season’s characters grew ultimately unfamiliar. Why would Coco — a notably driven and cutthroat woman who has shown unwavering dedication to her academic success — leave college to appear on reality television? Where was Kelsey — a major character in the third season — for the bulk of season four? It was impossible to introduce multiple new characters — consider the amount of time spent establishing Iesha, the cast of “Big House,” and Troy’s mother — and simultaneously provide original characters with the attention they deserved. In the show’s effort to coalesce flash forwards, retrospect, social commentary, and musical pieces, at times it felt like the characters audiences had come to appreciate simply fell through the cracks.
This issue is only exacerbated by the incessant substitution of passionate musical breaks for genuine conversation in moments of character conflict. When Gabe and Sam argue over the future of their relationship, there is no need for them to sing an auto[-]tuned duet of “500 Miles” by The Proclaimers. Furthermore, when Reggie is unable to attend graduation after the traumatic events of the Varsity Show, the last thing the audience needs is for the Dean to belt out a ballad.
Instead, the writers could have accomplished a much more emotional impact by leaving the door open for more conversation than song. When Troy’s mother admits to him that she never desired children, it is heartbreaking because of the following silence, stares, and discomfort. In moments like these, there is more virtue in the absence of sound than the forced inclusion of it.
Overall, Season Four of “Dear White People” felt like both a nuanced social commentary and an unfortunately ambitious yet unsuccessful attempt to broaden the horizons of the show audiences had previously grown to love. While it wrestles with relevant topics, its commitment to both creative and character experimentation leaves the show feeling stale and slightly unfamiliar.

By now, even those who haven’t watched “Squid Game” likely know what it’s about. Just weeks after its Sept. 17 release, Netflix confirmed that the Korean show passed the 111 million viewer milestone, making it the platform’s biggest series launch in history. Memes, theories, and hotly disputed takes on the show have dominated social media feeds. Duolingo, Inc., a language learning app, announced interest in learning Korean increased by 76 percent and 40 percent in Britain and the United States, respectively, in the two weeks following the show’s premiere. On Oct. 6, four of the cast’s central members graced “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
Set in a contemporary South Korea riddled with socioeconomic issues, the titular game capitalizes on the desperation of impoverished citizens who will do just about anything to win cash. Some of the show’s characters are at least partially responsible for their dire situations — protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) filches from his family’s savings to gamble on race horses, while his brilliant hometown friend Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo) gets into hot water after embezzling money from clients.
The nine-part series, however, makes it recurrently clear that what makes the macabre game — in which destitute people play childhood games to win 45.6 billion won, or roughly $38.19 million — possible is not individual incompetence, but rather the socioeconomic immobility and corrupt governance of the society these players inhabit. What results is the creation of an extra-legal world called “Squid Game,” a brutal labyrinth of survival that takes place on an insular island off the coast of Korea.
The megahit’s global buzz is anything but unwarranted. Yes, “Squid Game” is a jarring indictment of capitalism and mercantilism, of the dual politics of despair and power. It warns of the moral, psychological, and social unraveling that commences the moment we decide to stop seeing fellow people as human beings. However, the absurdist drama of “Squid Game” probes a much deeper and more universal evil — the logic of exclusion. The show’s most fundamental questions are left unanswered; rather, they are a part of the cinematic prompt. The lack of closure to these basic ideas turns the moral onus of inquiry onto viewers themselves: Why is there a singular winner to this game? Where is the conscience of those who revel in the anguish of others? Had we been drawn into this world, where in its cruel hierarchy would we fall?
The most sinister part of “Squid Game” is its thin but still believable plausibility. There is a disturbingly prophetic and self-sustaining quality to the game, one that reflects the broader capitalist system it aims to put into question. In short, it forces the participation of the very people most harmed by its existence.
Several cinematic choices highlight the show’s underlying social critiques. Arguably the most effective is its musical score. The use of the songs “The Blue Danube” and “Fly Me to the Moon” are particularly apt. Traditionally associated with atmosphere and class, both songs are chillingly dissonant with the macabre sequences they play over. The title of Frank Sinatra’s ‘60s classic turns haunting in its double-meaning: It at once nods to the desires of players to escape their hellish realities, and the orgasmic pleasure the game’s patrons receive by indulging in the pain of others.
Some viewers have been quick to call the brutality of the Korean series gratuitous. New York Times television critic Mike Hale described “Squid Game”’s violence as “empty, bloody calories,” contending that its “pretense of contemporary social relevance” is used to legitimize unnecessary gore. Variety’s Chief TV Critic Daniel D’Addario noted that the show’s vague discussion of the moral and political challenges facing a destitute underclass seemed “painfully thin” as a rationale for hundreds of deaths.
The move of writing off “Squid Game”’s violence as empty is not just easy, but also exceedingly expected. In fact, the seeming implausibility of the show’s premise is what subjected it to serial rejection in the first place. Though South Korean director Hwang Dong-hyuk conceived of the show over a decade ago, it wasn’t until 2019 that Netflix chose to run with the pitch. In fact, at one point a cash-strapped Hwang had to pause the development of his script after selling his $675 laptop for extra money.
By all means, “Squid Game” isn’t without its shortcomings. Central characters including Gi-hun, Sang-woo, and North Korean defector Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) fall into frustratingly clean-cut tropes. Certain moments — including the final, rain-drenched confrontation between the last players standing — end exactly as expected. More gnarly issues include the irony of “Squid Game,” a show based on the fraught implications of global capitalism, being produced by none other than the megacorporation Netflix.
But dismissing “Squid Game”’s gore as a gratuitous flourish is misdirected at best, and morally questionable at worst. Violence is the underlying force that activates and pushes forward the technology of the game — and the brutal logic of the society that makes this absurd idea not just a viable choice, but the only option left. “Squid Game”’s layered and strategic depictions of interpersonal, social, cultural, and financial harm are precisely what make the series animated and urgent.
For many shows, violence is a gimmick. In “Squid Game,” violence is the point.

“Today is going to be a good day,” the titular Evan (Ben Platt) assures himself in the opening of “Dear Evan Hansen.” Like the Tony Award-winning musical it was adapted from, the film begins with Evan writing a letter to himself, a practice recommended to him by his therapist. He starts off strong with his affirmations, but by the end he is tangled up in his thoughts. He tells himself to be his authentic self, but not his awkward, boring self, and then berates himself for thinking he is awkward in the first place. Before he can get any farther into his head, he breaks into song and closes off the letter — which is later mistaken as a suicide note for another student.
The narrative, complicated but containing nuanced insight into the epidemic of teenage loneliness, makes “Dear Evan Hansen” worth the translation into another medium. Evan starts off the movie as a timid high schooler on a mission to have a good day, but his anxiety overtakes him in an encounter with Connor, who later dies by suicide. Connor’s parents find the letter near their son and interpret it to be addressed to Hansen, and suddenly, Evan finds himself lying to everyone about a supposed friendship he had with Connor. He makes up stories about their time together, like in the song “For Forever,” where he describes the late Connor and himself “quoting songs by our favorite bands” and “just [talking] and [taking] in the view.” He is pressured into it in order to appease Connor’s family, but the made-up friendship also represents what could have saved Connor, and an alternate reality that could save Evan. Eventually, we learn that Evan attempted suicide, and so Evan and Connor can be understood as foil characters, where one lived and the other didn’t; one succumbed to their story, while the other made up a new one to keep surviving.
Platt acts as an insecure teen overwhelmed by the modern world with tact and nuance. Whenever he is triggered, it sets off a harrowing sequence of nervous ticks. He constantly licks his lips and sticks his tongue out. He trembles, his eyes go wide, and sweat drips down his face. Platt leans into it with conviction — instead of aestheticizing Evan’s suffering, his mental illness is directly communicated and made raw, ugly, and real.
In the various musical numbers throughout the film, Evan breaks out of his shell, but neither the setting of the scenes, camerawork, nor his bodily movements match that energy. The camera is stuck in one place, such as a dining room or a kitchen, and it is fixed on Evan, with the variety of the shots only coming from different framings of him. It is possible the film does this to stay consistent with his restrained personality, which is noticeable even as he sings his heart out, but the choice ultimately prevents the story from taking on the merits of a movie musical. The camera is stationary and boring, the choreography minimal and suppressed, and the power of Platt’s acting wanes under the viewer’s relentless gaze. The shallow-focused sequences of Evan are too frequent, and eventually, the viewer is exhausted by the extreme close ups of his earnest face and quivering hands, wishing for a less explicit portrayal of anxiety.
At the turning point of the film, when Evan gets nervous on the stage at Connor’s memorial and breaks into the uplifting “You Will Be Found,” there lies a perfect opportunity to diversify the imagery of Evan’s experiences. The lights could dim and then when Evan reappears, maybe we could have seen flashbacks of him getting bullied or not picking up the phone for fear of social interaction. Instead, we see a repetitive series of shots of people just watching him from the audience, frozen like caricatures. Afterwards, this song blows up on social media and serves as the hopeful anthem that the whole film rests on, and yet it is captured with redundant techniques that don’t aesthetically support the power of the song. The potentials of film to elevate the story are wholly ignored.
“Dear Evan Hansen” does a decent job of transferring the narrative to the big screen, but aside from some minor rewrites, it really was just that. However incredibly Platt captured the essence of mental breakdowns, it was not enough to carry the lack of originality in regards to the mise en scene, character development, and camera work — elements crucial to successfully adapting theater into film. Stephen Chbosky has directed numerous coming-of-age gems such as “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” and “Wonder,” but never a movie musical, and it shows.

Everyone faces points in their lives at which a single decision could change everything. Whether that decision is where to go to college, what career to pursue, or who to marry, these small, life-defining moments are a basic part of being human. Therefore it’s not surprising that a show that explores these pivotal decisions holds the potential for a wide appeal, if executed successfully.
NBC’s new drama “Ordinary Joe” follows a man, the titular Joe (James Wolk), and the three possible paths he is able to take in life based on a single decision made ten years earlier at his college graduation. In all three paths there are clear benefits and hardships. In the first, he follows his passion to become a musician and marries the ambitious Amy (Natalie Martinez), but they have no children, which is an experience Joe wants desperately. In the second, he follows true love to marry his college best friend Jenny (Elizabeth Lail) and they have a son together, but he dislikes his job as a night-shift nurse and they are on the verge of divorce. And in the third, he follows in his father’s footsteps and becomes an NYPD officer but remains single and childless.
It’s clear from the direction of “Ordinary Joe” that little to no intelligence is expected on the part of the viewer. The metaphors are so heavy-handed and devoid of nuance that it’s hard to take them seriously. The first scene includes a reading of Robert Frosts’ “The Road Not Taken,” followed by a scene of Joe standing at a literal crossroads to these three possible lives — not exactly the definition of subtle. The opening voiceover, a directorial element that appears nowhere else in the show, is nothing more than a cheesy expositional reiteration of the concept of choice. The timelines, which are shown to the audience concurrently, are heavily color-coded to the point where that choice becomes distracting to the viewer. Every single item in the frame in any shot is either orange, green, or blue, to coincide with the “passion”, “love,” and “family” timelines respectively. In viewing a single episode, more time is spent noticing and reconciling the ridiculous lighting, wardrobe, and set choices for each timeline than consuming the actual story.
And what is that actual story here? In many ways, “Ordinary Joe” has decided to be three shows at once. When Joe is a nurse, it’s a medical drama; when Joe is a police officer, it’s a police procedural drama. The thematic connection of choice is missing entirely. It seems to take advantage of the three timelines to create a kind of “mystery.” As the events in each timeline inform the others, the audience is left trying to figure out what is the same or different between the three versions of his life, but they all seem almost entirely arbitrary. While it’s easy to describe the “concept” of “Ordinary Joe,” it’s almost impossible to describe the overarching plot and the larger point. All three of the stories, while they have their own trajectories, are paper thin and would never have enough material to fill an entire show on their own. Together they barely hold water, and the individual lack of substance makes the content overall feel hollow.
Because Joe is not spectating his other possible lives, what lesson is supposed to be learned from “Ordinary Joe”? The show’s message is not in the vein of “the grass is always greener on the other side,” because there are no sides here — Joe is not omniscient or able to gain a greater perspective on his life. Is the series supposed to advocate for the power of fate which might mean that somehow all the timelines will end up in the same place at the end of the season? Or is it supposed to imply that a perfect life is impossible to achieve no matter what decisions you make? It’s hard to imagine the conclusion to the first season, or even the contents of a possible second season, when nothing can be gained from any resolution in any of the three timelines. An unsatisfying ending, or no ending at all, appear to be the only possible outcomes.
“Ordinary Joe” is made for those at a point in their lives when they are already asking “what if,” but it offers nothing more than a shallow perspective on choice. The show holds no real message, only a facade of internal reflection and uninspired directorial decisions. Just as dwelling on a past you cannot change is pointless, so, too, is “Ordinary Joe.”

“The Many Saints of Newark,” the long-awaited movie prequel to HBO’s award-winning series “The Sopranos,” is one of the rare pieces of media you can judge by its cover. The title, a lazy pun on protagonist Dickie Moltisanti’s last name, couldn’t be more fitting: The movie is an uninspired pastiche of a great show, a perfect example of fan-pandering gone hopelessly wrong.
The film, set in 1960s and 1970s Newark, follows the life of Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola), an uncle figure to Tony Soprano (Michael Gandolfini, the late “Sopranos” star James Gandolfini’s son) and a member of the Soprano crime syndicate. After the police disrupt the mob’s hierarchical structure, Dicky is forced to maneuver around Newark’s racial riots, family drama, and competing crime groups, as he tries to become a better man and steer young Tony away from the mob.
“The Sopranos,” a cult classic with a plenty of backstory to explore, almost begs for a prequel. And films like “The Irishman” prove that following the early life of a mobster can make for a captivating picture. Unfortunately, “The Many Saints of Newark” director Alan Taylor is no Martin Scorsese, and the screenwriter and original showrunner David Chase’s lack of experience with the big screen becomes blatantly apparent. Such is the disappointment of the film’s main creative duo that their prequel can’t even rival the Disney+ “101 Dalmatians” prequel “Cruella,” which received mixed reviews.
As different as they may seem, what “The Irishman” and Disney's latest prequel have in common is a compelling narrative. They present stories that skillfully and logically follow the lives of their protagonists without needless detours. They know what they are and what they aim to achieve. “The Many Saints of Newark” doesn’t. It perpetually oscillates between shameless pandering to the fans, exploring Tony’s childhood, presenting Newark’s racial tensions, and following the ups and downs of Dickie Moltisanti’s life. There’s no direction, no string of careful setups and payoffs. By the time the closing credits roll in, the audience finds themselves still expecting more, because how can a film end when there was no indication of progress at any point?
The on-screen chaos is not a surprise in hindsight. On “The Sopranos,” Taylor and Chase had the luxury of a slower pace and time for narrative setups. But “The Many Saints of Newark” is not a thirteen-episode season, it’s a 120-minute movie — a fact that leads us to the film’s most jarring flaw. It's impossible to follow for a viewer unfamiliar with “The Sopranos.” The only background exposition that viewers get is a brief first-person narration at the beginning before being mercilessly thrown into the ocean of the six-season series’ lore, with a myriad of characters tangled in a complex web of connections.
Worse, the film’s fan service is tasteless. Fan-favorite characters are brought back, only to be reduced to two-dimensional caricatures propped by bigoted jokes and stereotypes that would fit an SNL New Jersey-themed skit, not the final goodbye of a beloved franchise. It would be generous to say that this act is entertaining for even the first five minutes, but even then, the concentration of cliches renders the film unbearable shortly thereafter.
There were some highlights. The performance of the two main actresses, Michela De Rossi (Giuseppina Moltisanti) and Vera Farmiga (Livia Soprano), was nothing short of inspired. They manage to stay serious throughout the cartoonishly exaggerated action of their scenes, putting up fantastically emphatic performances. Alessandro Nivola, Michael Gandolfini, and Ray Liotta are allowed more subtlety than Farmiga and De Rossi, and they more than deliver. Had their performances been backed by a serious script, they wouldn’t have felt out of place in a gangster epic like “The Godfather.” The costumes and cinematography were equally spot on, not just perfectly conveying the film’s setting, but thanks to a subdued, unsaturated color palette, also the mood. It’s a real shame no visual or production quality could possibly redeem a movie suffering such fundamental flaws.
Pulling off a prequel that manages to leave similar impressions on new audiences and die-hard fans of a franchise alike is difficult. “The Many Saints of Newark” brilliantly delivers by disappointing everyone.

As HBO Max branches more aggressively into the original series space — a task competitor Netflix has done very successfully during this quarantine-ridden time with titles such as “The Chair,” “Sweet Tooth,” and a plethora of others — they’ve begun to find their niche with “Scenes from a Marriage.” Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain shimmer on the screen with striking talent as they portray the growing strains of their characters’ marriage.
This unique retelling of Ingmar Bergman’s story of love, loss, growth, and self-actualization modernizes a commonplace, relatable story about people struggling in their relationships.
The story begins with a fourth-wall break as Jessica Chastain, not yet in character, gets coffee, talks to masked assistants and eventually takes her place on set. Although never explicit, the explanation behind this walk-through of the corporate collage becomes clear far later in the episode. This walk is not just Chastain making her way to her place on the soundstage. This walk represents Mira, Chastain’s character, walking into the emotional maze and trap that is her home.
The remainder of the show unfolds largely in four scenes: an interview, a friendly dinner party, a pre-bedtime ritual and a visit to a doctor's office. The interview lays everything out between the couple: Jonathan (Oscar Isaac) is confident and takes control as a grad student interviews the typical heterosexual married couple.
Jonathan is talkative and reflective. When describing himself, Jonathan identifies himself as Jewish, a father, and an academic (what he believes should have been his first statement), telling the interviewer his age, his political affiliation, and even his history of asthma. Mira, on the other hand, describes herself primarily as a woman, married, and a mother.
Jonathan mentions his daughter, but not his wife. Mira, on the other hand, primarily bases her self-perception on her womanhood and femininity. The disconnect between them is uncomfortable. When she has the opportunity to talk about her profession, she clams up even further. In these first 20 minutes of the episode, aptly titled “Innocence and Panic,” it’s all panic. Mira really is trapped in the metaphorical maze shown through the fourth-wall break. She can’t get a word in, and even the music, or lack thereof, adds to the tension of the scene. At every moment, it’s clear that Mira doesn’t want to be there.
One line stands out as stark and telling in their relationship. Mira is talking alone with the grad student as Jonathan is tending to their daughter. She gently lets slip that, ”At the beginning of a relationship, it feels like nothing can hurt you. And then you gradually start to realize actually that anything can hurt you.”
The episode wraps up in the examination room at Mira’s doctor’s office after the couple discovers that Mira is pregnant. They don’t think they can keep the child and maintain their relationship. Jonathan is excessively helpful, making the space his own and trying to pace away his stress. Mira is numb as she sits on the procedure table, about to take the medication to induce an abortion. The scene underscores their strained and uncomfortable dynamic. By aggressively trying to comfort Mira, Jonathan emotionally smothers her. In the end, she asks him to leave and, in a harrowing moment, pulls a thin white blanket over herself until she’s hidden beneath it, an unidentifiable figure crying on a table alone. This scene right at the end of the episode shows the strife hidden deep inside this broken woman and her marriage.
As “Scenes from a Marriage” continues, it will undoubtedly become a phenomenal show. With its amazing casting and fantastic writing, plus a story that already wowed audiences once, its run on HBO Max is going to be one to watch.

Titled “Poli,” the second installment of “Scenes from a Marriage” takes bold steps and further dives into the reasons behind the tension between the main characters Mira (Jessica Chastain) and Jonathan (Oscar Isaac). Their marriage is struggling, but one of them — Jonathan — is glaringly unaware of that fact. Their daughter and the prospect of another child are the bars of a self-made prison. “Poli,” through emotionally raw and expertly choreographed scenes, shows the everyday, constant threats to even what was outwardly perceived as a comfortable, happy marriage.
The show opens following Oscar Isaac through the set of the house as he makes his way to his position for the first scene. Just as this tactic was used in the first episode, this foreshadows the maze of strife that Jonathan is unknowingly walking into under his own roof. As this unique patterned entrance establishes itself, it will be an interesting opportunity to see the focus of each episode. Whose perspective will the audience walk into and settle down within for the episode?
Seemingly months after the end of episode one, with soft winter snow blanketing the neighborhood, Mira starts the episode travelling for her high-pressure job as the vice president of her technology company. Jonathan is comfortably at home, reading, lounging, and masturbating in his office in the attic. Not a care in the world, he is portrayed as safe within the kingdom of his house until Mira comes home early. She rushed back already wanting to leave again because, as she confesses to Jonathan, she’s been involved with another man.
Although the confession itself lasts less than a moment, the implications take the form of a beautifully curated 24 minute continuous shot. Jonathan and Mira argue in their bedroom, hopelessly trying to dissect the tragedy laid in front of them. The pain and shock turn to numbness and disbelief for Jonathan as he realizes he no longer has any control over his relationship. No part of this can be turned into a positive, and the best part of his life is actively trying to walk away from him and their daughter. In these moments, the pain in Jonathan’s eyes is palpable and heart-wrenching. The worst moments are those in which he is still defeatedly accepting the lost connection.
Then Jonathan wants to know about the man who stole his wife’s heart: Poli. An Israeli tech entrepreneur and CEO of a start-up under acquisition, the 29-year-old is everything that Jonathan is not. He’s young and vivacious, excited about every opportunity. Poli is risk-taking and gets what he wants. He’s exciting. Unbeknownst at the time, Poli was the reason — if only for a moment — that there was any spice in Jonathan and Mira’s lives. She was happy again.
She’s not happy with Jonathan — not happy in their home, their bedroom, or their relationship. He’s a forty-something professor working in a job he’s had for years and content in the quiet movements of his life. He’s innately comfortable with her by his side, so much so that he does not, or maybe cannot, see her walking away.
Then she leaves. For three months, she moves to Tel Aviv to manage the acquisition and merger of Poli’s company and her own. She calls a car at 7 a.m., not saying goodbye to their daughter, and leaves. Finally, in the aftermath of his world slipping away beneath his feet, Jonathan lets the festering emotion inside of him show. He calls their friends Kate (Nicole Beharie) and Peter (Corey Stoll) to see if they knew, and they did. He yells at them, berating them for letting her just walk away from him and their life together. Then he screams until his eyes water into his hands.
Their daughter Ava (Sophia Kopera), who won’t see her mother for three months, walks downstairs confused. She looks at her father, a vestige of a breaking man, in silence. Without a single speaking line in the episode, Ava manages to portray the disappointment, the sadness, and the confusion of the entire episode in a flash before the credits begin to roll.
Even the credits of “Poli” portray the new beginnings this family is experiencing. A soft blanket of snow continues to fall, dusting their quiet neighborhood in a beautiful, blank white sheet while eerie, disharmonious music plays in the background. Things are unsettled and cracking and the marriage between Mira and Jonathan is over.
The entirety of this situation is a perfect mirror of the original plot for the show of the same name by Ingmar Bergman. In the source material for the 2021 version of “Scenes from a Marriage,” it is the man who cheats and leaves the woman. It is the man who is the breadwinner and who barely sees his child. It’s stereotypical but also expected from the 1970s. The 2021 adaptation had to change and does so elegantly. Mira is the prototypical executive. She’s powerful and does what she wants. There’s no reason that the cheater which propelled the story had to be a man, and Mira fits that role perfectly.

A black screen, a panting child, and a stream of blood flowing from a dying girl: These images mark the opening of “Pan’s Labyrinth,” a 2006 film written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. At its core, “Pan’s Labyrinth” is about fantasy as a means for escapism — an exploration of how a young girl understands and copes with Francoist Spain.
“Pan’s Labyrinth” entwines the fantastical, surreal elements of Ofelia’s journey with the dreary, brutal events of Francoist Spain. Set in 1944 after the Spanish Civil War, soldiers sent by Franco attempt to snuff out groups of Republican rebels hidden deep within the forest. Ofelia, a young girl profoundly interested in fairy tales, travels with her pregnant mother to stay in the countryside with her stepfather, the cold and despicable Captain Vidal. Ofelia encounters a faun, who tells her that she is the reincarnation of a lost princess of the underworld, and embarks on a quest to return to her kingdom. Meanwhile, Vidal aims to locate the rebels as Mercedes, an unassuming housekeeper, struggles to keep away from his notice while helping the Republican cause.
Del Toro’s cinematography distinguishes two distinct but parallel plotlines, emphasizing cold, blue tones in Vidal and Mercedes’ scenes and warm reds and yellows in Ofelia’s fairy tales. Simultaneously, del Toro links the realms of the fantastical and the real by splicing together similar scenes. For example, as Ofelia escapes from the Pale Man, a horrifying monster who sits at the head of a cursed, bountiful feast and gorges on the flesh of children, Vidal sits at the head of a lavish political dinner party and discusses his plans for stricter limits on ration cards.
“Pan’s Labyrinth” sticks with its viewers long after the credits run, and that illusory quality is enforced by intentional ambiguity. Del Toro does not explicitly answer whether Ophelia’s experiences are fantasy or reality and instead leaves it up to the viewer. Are these ethereal events and creatures a tangible means for Ofelia to escape? Are we merely watching a young girl weave fantasies in her head to flee a world characterized by horror and violence? These nuances can be read in many directions. The film’s conclusion, for instance, reveals that Vidal cannot see the titular faun — is the magical creature just a figment of Ofelia’s overactive mind?
Perhaps by avoiding a conclusive answer to what is real and what is imagined, Del Toro allows his film to build a closer relationship between the fantasy and the real. For instance, Del Toro does a wonderful job tying Ofelia’s thematic journey with the clash between the fascists and rebels. Both dive into an exploration of memory, bravery, and disobedience. As opposed as they are, both Ofelia and Vidal are driven to preserve an imprint of themselves on the world. For Ofelia, survival means preserving the life and memory of the Underworld, and for Vidal, it means passing on a physical memento of his bravery to his son. Other parallels include Ofelia refusing to spill her brother’s blood for the faun, a direct echo of a scene where the doctor tells Vidal “To obey without thinking ... that’s something only people like you can do, Captain.”
Of course, Del Toro’s fascinating story is accomplished via Ivana Baquero, Sergi López, and Maribel Verdú breathing life into the central three characters of Ofelia, Vidal, and Mercedes. López perfectly translates Vidal’s repulsiveness, performing vile acts like shooting his own men and bashing in the heads of suspected rebels. His cold, callous acting emphasizes Vidal as a real-world counterpart to the disturbing monsters of Ofelia’s stories. Conversely, Baquero’s Ofelia behaves no differently when traversing mythical realms or the real world, navigating the real and surreal in the same dreamy and curious fashion. Finally, Verdú does a stellar job embodying the nuance in Mercedes’ character from her simmering resistance to her false meekness in front of Vidal, layers stressing that she, just like Ofelia, faces her own monsters.
The movie’s first and last shots are identical: the dying Ophelia as Mercedes hums a wordless lullaby. Where the opening shot plays in reverse and the concluding shot in the right order, the song is never reversed. From the film’s start to finish, del Toro reminds us of the inexorable ties between trauma and escapism and the similarities between the real and mythical worlds. More than just a parable for Francoist Spain likening facsism to the story’s mythological monster, del Toro weaves an incredible narrative with remarkable attention to cinematography and practical effects that more than earned a slew of awards.

It’s no secret that terrible movies are fun to watch. Movies like “The Room” and “Cats” are forever immortalized in the American anti-canon. In no genre does this assertion hold truer than horror. With Halloween approaching, it is time to count down the preeminent worst movies to watch during Spooky Season.
5. “Rubber” (2010)
French DJ Quentin Dupieux, also known as Mr. Oizo, entered the cinematic world with his debut film “Rubber” in 2010. The film follows a sentient tire, Robert, and his murderous rampage through the California desert. That’s the movie. Complete with absurd dialogue, middle-of-the-road acting, and pointless plot lines, “Rubber” is genuinely one of the most entertaining horror movies of the last decade. Structurally, Dupieux challenges the notion that films must have implicit meaning, thereby crafting a whole new meaning of his own. Deep stuff.
4. “The Cabin in the Woods” (2011)
Who doesn’t want to watch Anna Hutchinson make love to Chris Hemsworth before being brutally slashed by zombie rednecks? Via Joss Whedon’s screenwriting and Drew Goddard’s directing, “The Cabin in the Woods” geniously crafts a satire of the genre as a whole. So, why is it on the list of terrible horror movies? Simply because it is not really a horror feature, but rather a comedy. Although designated as a horror film, the sheer comedic timing and irony of the movie lends itself for a movie night with more laughs than screams.
3. “Halloween” Franchise
Fictional Serial killer Michael Myers has become such a household name that he appears on Google before the “Austin Powers” and “Saturday Night Live” actor of the same name (sorry Mike). Additionally, the “Halloween” piano cadence is impossible to miss in October. The original John Carpenter production in 1978 was an immediate hit, garnering 96% on Rotten Tomatoes: It is objectively not a bad film. However, the story of Michael Myers did not end there. In fact, the 11th sequel premieres on Oct. 15. Who can forget “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,'' with its whopping 9% Rotten Tomatoes rating, and “Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,” with an improved 12% rating? For the ultimate Halloween binge experience, watch the first 11 films in preparation for Jamie Lee Curtis’ glorious return to the franchise this October.
2. “Scary Movie” (2000)
Speaking of parodies, it’s important to give credit where credit is due to the Wayans brothers. Their 2000 masterpiece “Scary Movie” epitomizes Y2K humor and the entertainment of the new millennium. Ostensibly parodying the 1996 movie “Scream,” “Scary Movie” features all the necessities of a 2000s comedy — sex, drugs, hilarious screenwriting — all the while demonstrating the prowess of Black screenwriters in a white industry. With four sequels, the Wayans brothers have moviegoers all set for laughs in the month of October.
1. “Scary Godmother: Halloween Spooktacular” (2003)
This is perhaps the scariest of them all, not because of its content — it’s a children’s movie — but because of its horrendous animation, obnoxious dialogue, and atrocious editing. This cinematic creation played every single year on Cartoon Network during October, so it’s impossible to forget. Kids in the 2000s may distinctly remember turning on the TV after school, and — to their dissatisfaction — catching a glimpse of the unnerving characters. Yet, there remains an element of nostalgia which allows 2000s kids to look back fondly on this movie. While watching it, one is reminded not only of the simplicity of childhood, but also of the comedic elements which lie within unintentional abominations. Hence, the “Spooktacular” wins the title of the worst Halloween “horror” movie to watch this month.

“Have you caught ’em all yet?”
This was the last question I expected to hear in my Harvard interview. “Catching ’em all” is the goal of each Pokémon game, which has captivated me for over a decade. The prospect of taming wild creatures, battling with them, and conquering new lands still excites me to this day. But my passion for the Japanese franchise went beyond pushing buttons on my Nintendo DS and dishing out $40 each year for the latest journey.
I participated in many online forums dedicated to the games, offering theories and sharing sentiments with like-minded fans. Eventually, I wanted to go beyond the comment section and share my enjoyment with a wider audience, so I created my own website, Pika News Network. I had no experience with website building, just a love for writing and collecting those pixelated monsters. Alongside some guest writers, I posted almost weekly for about four years, attaining over 30,000 page views from nearly 130 different countries.
For a 14-year-old, these statistics were unbelievable, but I never sought to become the New York Times of Pokémon. It was something I enjoyed, but when it became too time-consuming, I made the difficult decision to let the website go and focus on schoolwork. It felt like giving up a part of me, but my education was my main priority.
The project was short-lived, but my love for the series and for writing wasn’t, so I struggled with deciding whether or not to discuss it in my college resume. I wasn’t convinced that Harvard was in need of a Pokémon Trainer. As a school of great prestige, I knew it wanted to see leadership roles and well-rounded involvement. I was afraid Harvard would instead see a teenager’s ramblings about a kids’ game. I didn’t want to be perceived as childish or someone who wasted their time on fruitless endeavors.
At the same time, I knew writing about Pokémon was a part of me. I was giddy with excitement when new details about upcoming titles were announced. My mind ran wild with possibilities as I analyzed each new trailer. Each comment on my website — positive or negative — only pushed me to keep improving, and I took every page view as an indication of trust. I was proud of what I accomplished, and I was committed to giving Harvard an understanding of who I am in every sense. Thus, Pika News Network made it on the resume.
But I never expected any of this to be a talking point in what was arguably the most important interview of my life.
When my interviewer brought up Pokémon, I had to pause for a moment and make sure I was hearing her correctly. To my surprise, she had familiarity with the subject matter, and her reaction was the exact opposite of what I expected. She was intrigued and interested and wanted to know my motivations behind the website and the lessons I had learned from the writing process. More importantly, she mentioned how including Pokémon in my resume grounded me as someone genuine and human, which validated my decision. Maybe I did have a chance at Harvard after all.
It then became clear to me then that I didn’t need to conform to a particular mold or attempt to be anyone other than myself. It was okay to be a high school valedictorian while enjoying the thrill of hunting rare creatures on a screen. It was okay to write a 4,000 word paper about how life imitates art one day, and talk about the villains of this fictional realm the next. It was okay to be me.
Nobody should ever feel like they have to adhere to a particular path or match a stereotype to achieve something; instead, they should be fearless about what makes them unique. There is no correct route when one has genuine passion, and whatever shape that may take, it is neither shameful nor inadequate: it is something to be celebrated.
And while I haven’t caught ’em all yet, I have attained something far greater. I sit here writing this from the comfort of my dorm in Canaday as the first in my family to attend college in the United States, let alone an Ivy League institution. With each day that passes and every ounce of effort I dedicate to my work, I know I am honoring the sacrifice they made decades ago: leaving everything behind in Romania to offer me a better life in the United States. Had 14-year-old me not manifested his enthusiasm for yellow mice and talking cats through writing, perhaps I would’ve ended up on a different path. The future holds many mysteries, but I will not stop playing or writing, reminding myself to be truthful to who I am. If I can encourage others to “catch” their passions and share them with the world, then this Pokémon Trainer will have won the most important battle of all.

Phone, wallet, keys, mask.
The short mental checklist I use before leaving Kirkland every morning is a tad longer these days than it used to be. I rush through Harvard Yard to class sipping my tea, and just before entering the building I deftly slip on my surgical mask. We’ve all become proficient in donning and doffing this newest wardrobe piece. Had you shown me my current collection of face masks a few years ago, I would have theorized that my future self decided on medical school.
I arrive in the seminar room and take one last glance at my notes before approaching the podium. It's my turn to present on this week’s topic. I begin by greeting my classmates with a smile, which I hope they will be able to perceive. I’m delighted to be greeted with a handful of smiles in return. Just above the horizons of the masks, their eyes smile back.
This past year, I’ve sported more masks, and in greater variety, than I thought possible in one hundred lifetimes. From the classic light blue, to my current go-to, a pink and navy floral print version. They’re an essential item in our daily lives now and a novel opportunity for creativity. Squished among the copious old receipts and candy wrappers that have perpetually resided in my pant back-pockets, my masks seem to have gained mainstay membership there as well. Like fitting my arms through a t-shirt, I rarely think twice about looping the elastic around my ears and pulling the wire over my nose. I’ve taught myself to incorporate this new maneuver into my everyday routine.
Of course, physicians like Atul Gawande have been wearing surgical masks for a long time. Gawande is a Harvard professor and a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. In his memoir “Complications: A Surgeon’s Notes on an Imperfect Science,” he peers back on his early years as a surgical resident and, in turn, lets us peer into a profession that, from the outside, seems a bit magical and enigmatic.
It is clear that the stories printed on the pages are imprinted in his mind. Through his journey of teaching and learning, Gawande stitches together some of the most salient lessons from his training as a surgeon: acknowledging and embracing uncertainty, understanding the imperfections of the people and the practice of medicine, all the while highlighting a new perspective on how truly extraordinary the whole endeavor really is. He reminisces on these years of surgical training, and from his reflection on this formative time in his education, I can’t help but ponder the focal points of my own educational journey.
I think I’ve learned many new things since coming to Harvard. In the sciences, in the humanities, and in what lies between. I’ve come across ideas that I simply couldn’t have even fathomed just a few years ago, but that now define the way I think. In learning, the unexpected becomes indispensable, the novel becomes normal. But what I’ve learned the most about is in fact something that I’ve been familiar with for my entire life. I’ve learned the most about myself. About how I learn.
I’ve found that teaching and learning are two sides of the same coin. Teaching gives me an opportunity to recollect and analyze how I first went from unknowing to knowing. It’s an opportunity not only to communicate an idea to someone else, but to communicate it more clearly to myself. Teaching reinforces not only what I’ve learned, but how I learned it.
I’m convinced that teaching is an endeavor that teaches the teacher just as much as the taught. There are so many ways to do it, and there’s definitely no right answer. Teaching is not constrained to the classroom either, it exists wherever and whenever we are learning from each other. Education is always changing. Catalyzed by the pandemic necessity of remote learning, we’re moving away from a one-size-fits-all model, and continuing to discover more deeply and more meaningfully how we can better teach and learn from one another.
Teaching asks us to challenge what we know and how our knowledge came to be. It forces us to probe what we take for granted as known and to perceive things through the lens of others. It’s been quite a year of screen sharing, mute buttons, and more technological snafus than any of us could possibly count. But each stumble is a bit of evidence that education is changing faster than ever, creating a new normal for teaching and learning, and new things to teach and learn.
Let’s ask ourselves what we’ve learned, about how we learned it — and use this understanding to make the process better for all of us. As I look from the podium towards the masked smiles in the classroom, ready to present, I can’t wait to learn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a satirical piece published over 16 years ago, our Editorial Board wrote that “Hilary Duff is a loser and a chicken” for taking classes at the Harvard Extension School. In poor writing and even poorer taste, the editorial implies an inherent value differentiation between HES and the other Harvard schools. The regrettable piece has resurfaced recently as the ambiguity surrounding the Extension School’s place within the University continues to linger.
For example, Harvard Extension School activists are still working to challenge the devaluation of their work in their current degree names, which include only the vague moniker of “Extension Studies” rather than mentioning students’ specific field of study. As we’ve previously opined, the current degree title is misleading and ill-fitting, and only one manifestation of the perceived chasm between HES and the other Harvard schools. A chasm which in reality, does not exist.
This is especially true in light of the ways in which the Covid-19 pandemic has changed our experiences with higher education. Over the past year and a half, the material conditions of student life have changed rapidly. Many of us have come to recognize that our Harvard education is about more than just physical presence in a lecture hall. Knowledge is valuable regardless of the space it is learned in, and education does not change in worth based on whether or not the degree completed virtually, as is the case for most HES students.
Indeed, many students at the College and the Extension School are enrolled in the very same courses with the very same professors. If HES students have the option to take the same courses as College students, any perceived distinction in the value of their education comes from a place of arbitrary superiority; one that we have constructed while engulfed in an academic environment riddled with competition, exclusivity, and constructed conceptions of meritocracy. Acknowledging the similarities in the instruction that Extension School and College students receive does not damage the worth of either program. Rather, the privilege enjoyed by students at Harvard College to take classes with other students from all walks of life and paths of study — whether from the Extension School, other Harvard schools, or nearby universities — is part of what makes Harvard such an enriching place to learn.
In fact, the very founding mission of the Extension School — which prioritizes being accessible and affordable to the public, especially those in the workforce — embodies much of what we have consistently called on Harvard to be. The Extension School is thus not only an essential part of Harvard’s civic duty, but also of the University’s commitment to the expansion of truth and knowledge, representing an ideal that should be celebrated, not shunned.
To that end, the democratized model of the Extension School — which enables a tremendous number of students to both receive and give knowledge — is perhaps the most closely aligned to the true purpose of education. Exclusive access isn’t what makes learning valuable. On the contrary, knowledge is a treasure that was designed to be shared.
As students at the College, we have gained much from the presence of the Extension School and its students, and we still have much to learn from them. In the past, our Editorial Board has not been as appreciative as we ought to be of what is a beautiful and crucial part of the Harvard community.
To Ms. Duff and all the other students at HES whose contributions have been undermined, in part by our board: We’d like to offer an apology and our sincere gratitude. And Hilary, our dreams are made of the sincerest hope that you will come visit your alma mater sometime soon.

Harvard University signed a new five-year research and development agreement with pharmaceutical company National Resilience, Inc. to advance the development of medical technologies, including gene, stem cell, and nucleic acid therapies.
Under the agreement, which the institutions are calling an “alliance,” Resilience has committed $30 million to fund research on therapeutic and biomanufacturing technologies, which faculty researchers at Harvard will lead.
In exchange, Resilience and the University agreed that any new therapies resulting from the alliance may be developed and licensed by Resilience and any companies it forms, in order to put those therapies through clinical trials and eventually commercialize them.
One such company, Circle Therapeutics, was already formed to large-scale test therapies for skeletal muscle disorders developed by the Rubin Lab, which is led by Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Professor Lee L. Rubin. The Rubin Lab's research is the first Harvard project to receive funding under the new agreement.
Small molecules, in the form of oral pills, used to be the only way to treat muscular disorders, according to Rubin. His lab is using the Resilience funding to continue its work in culturing skeletal muscle stem cells — also called satellite cells — in the hopes of harnessing their regenerative properties to treat those disorders.
Rubin said in an interview his lab has long hoped for the kind of financial support Harvard’s agreement with Resilience will provide.
“We were trying for years to find a partner to help us develop these muscle acting therapeutics — with not much success,” Rubin said. “There really are no muscle therapies that are based on the stem cell.”
Finding funding was made more complicated by the fact that his lab was developing novel forms of therapies, he added.
“In pharma, being first is not necessarily the best thing as maybe being second, where there is a path to follow,” he said. “We were laying out the path, and people are potentially risk-averse.”
“The Rubin Lab’s platform to expand and maintain in-vitro-derived satellite cells could lead to transformative cell therapies,” Vivian Berlin, the head of the Harvard Office of Technology Development’s Corporate Alliances team, which helped to coordinate the agreement, told The Harvard Gazette, a University publication.
“[The Rubin lab] has compellingly demonstrated the clinical relevance of this work,” Berlin told The Gazette. “Now with Resilience’s focused funding and experience in the development of complex medicines, we hope to set it on a clear path toward benefiting patients.”
Rubin said that he was glad that his lab’s research had been “endorsed” by Resilience.
“It was really nice to have external validation that we were doing something that might be valuable, that really might treat diseases that currently go untreated,” he said.

Nonprofit leaders and activists argued that non-government agencies and individuals ought to take bold action to promote equity in a virtual panel that closed out the annual Truth and Transformation Conference on Friday.
Hosted by the the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center’s Institutional Antiracism and Accountability Project, this year’s conference covered topics including the history of racism and the economic repercussions of racism.
The speakers on the panel, which was moderated by American Studies Ph.D. candidate Mary McNeil, explained how they believe organizations should be held accountable for their promises on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said he believes it is important to acknowledge that racial groups experience racism differently.
“Speaking as an East Asian American male, I recognize that I enjoy certain privileges,” Yang said. “So if I’m saying that we should all be treated equally, that’s not right, because the reality is, different communities have suffered in different ways.”
Eric K. Ward, director of the Western States Center, said during the event that society should invest in transforming power structures to achieve aspirations surrounding equity.
“I think that the conversation around equity is much more complicated and nuanced than this society will allow for, and that is why the shifting of leadership structure becomes so important in this moment,” Ward said.
Inequity arises from institutions of governance, according to Ward. He added that recognizing systemic racism and sexism is key to ensuring that everyone can “live, love, worship, and work free from fear and bigotry.”
Non-governmental institutions, such as news platforms and corporations, are also responsible for ensuring “equality of outcomes,” according to Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust.
In the fight for equity, Yang cited the importance of combating misinformation. Misrepresentations of marginalized groups — such as the notion that people receiving federal nutrition assistance do not work hard — may dissuade people from supporting programs aimed at rectifying structural inequalities, he explained.
“One of the fights that all of us need to engage in is against misinformation and disinformation,” Yang said. “Let’s be clear: there is a campaign out there that is trying to distort a lot of what is happening in society.”
While structural issues perpetuate inequity, every individual has a personal role in dispelling misinformation, according to Yang.
“Part of it is responsibility of the platforms, the Facebooks and Twitters — what are they doing to prevent false information from getting out?” Yang added. “Part of it is on all of us to make sure that we are contributing to getting the right information that is out there.”

Researchers from the Harvard Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering illuminated a connection between massage and the body’s immune response for muscle rehabilitation, according to a recent article published in Science Translational Medicine.
The idea that mechanotherapy — physical pressure, like massage, applied to the body for healing purposes — could influence cell and tissue function was long ridiculed by scientists. Over the past few decades, however, researchers have come to understand that there is interplay between mechanics and cell function.
“The field has looked into the effects of massage on physical manipulation on tissue regeneration in a number of different studies,” said Stephanie L. McNamara, a joint M.D./Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School who worked on the study. “But one thing that was really lacking was the ability to do it consistently and to be able to change parameters in a controlled fashion.”
The Wyss researchers were able to maintain controlled parameters by using a robotic system to apply consistent, compressive pressure on injured mouse muscles for three days. They then observed ultrasounds of the mice’s muscle tissue for evidence of muscle regeneration.
The results showed that pressure helps muscle regeneration by reducing the number of neutrophils, one of the first immune cells to respond to muscle injury. As the healing process continues, the reduction of neutrophils in an injury site aids muscle regeneration.
Inspired by previous research that examined mechanically induced muscle regeneration in the absence of biologically induced factors, Bo Ri Seo, a postdoctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute and first author of the study, undertook this research in the hopes of applying its results to other types of injuries.
The study could be expanded to larger animals in the future and could shed insight on the potential of mechanotherapy on other types of injuries, even in the context of cancer research, according to Seo.
“I would like to expand the study to connect with other types of diseases such as cancer for cancer patients and understand how stimulated immune responses by mechanotherapy could impact cancer progression or maybe prevent cancer,” she said.
McNamara also described how this research could be used to promote non-invasive procedural options.
“There are other populations of individuals that may not be amenable to having a surgical intervention for a muscle injury, or may not be amenable to having biological therapies that are typically given to help heal,” McNamara said. “For instance, elderly individuals is one population.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every October, National Women’s Small Business Month honors the numerous contributions of female entrepreneurs to local economies. In recognition, The Crimson spoke with some of the women who run popular establishments in Harvard Square.
Approximately 13 percent of Harvard Square’s businesses are solely woman-owned, according to Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
Shoshanah Garber, who co-founded Black Sheep Bagel Cafe in 2018, lauded female representation among business owners in Harvard Square.
“We do have an awesome community of female business owners,” Garber said. “Right in our building, we have a community of five female business owners, and that always makes a difference — to have a community that you can relate to and support each other.”
Joanne B. Chang ’91 — who opened the first location of Flour Bakery and Cafe in Boston’s South End in 2000 — wrote in an email that she has never felt “stymied” by being a female business owner. She was, however, “annoyed” early in her entrepreneurial journey when city officials assumed she was a man.
“When we first got our letter from the City of Boston asking for our annual payment for our sidewalk permit fee, the letter was addressed ‘Gentlemen.’ I crossed it off and put my name and sent it back with payment,” Chang wrote. “I did this for a few years and then one year it changed to ‘To whom it may concern’ and then a few years later it changed to ‘Dear Ms. Chang.’”
Chang — who grew up in a predominantly white community in Texas — wrote that being accustomed to being in the minority and being “laser focused” on her business goals meant that she didn’t allow potential hardships to hold her back.
“Sure it was daunting to go into a business meeting as the only female. But I was also the only minority at times and usually the youngest person in the room,” she wrote.
Alison L. Fong, who co-founded food truck and restaurant Bon Me in 2010, said her intersectional identity as an Asian woman has sometimes impacted her entrepreneurial experience, though she has learned to look past how others perceive her.
“As an Asian female, it’s oftentimes hard to be taken seriously just because we don’t look like the natural leader and the natural owner of anything. And I’m not sure why that is the way it is,” Fong said. “It’s definitely something that I notice, which is an interesting experience, but it’s also one of the things where as a business owner, you must have a thick skin.”
Kari Kuelzer — the owner and general manager of Grendel’s Den and Bar, which was founded in 1971 — said she decided to take over her family business because she wanted to expand her opportunities.
“I was at that point in my career where I kind of worked my way up through the ladder of somebody else’s company,” Kuelzer said. “I always felt like I was not even looking at a glass ceiling, but I was sitting in a waiting room, and the opportunity to be my own boss and run the business myself created a way out of that waiting room.”
Kuelzer added that being self-employed as a woman “means something different” than for men.
Last January, female- and minority-owned small businesses in Massachusetts were eligible to apply for state funding in response to financial hardship caused by Covid-19. The grant helped female business owners around the Square, including Flour and clothing store Mint Julep.
Throughout October, the city of Cambridge also sponsored numerous events to honor National Women’s Business Month, such as virtual workshops and in-person celebrations.
Garber said she hopes all Harvard Square businesses will be able to return from the pandemic in full force.
“I hope that everyone is able to come out of the last year as strong or stronger than we were before,” Garber said. “And that the small business community stays strong and resilient.”

Helena G. Buonanno Foulkes ’86, the president of Harvard’s Board of Overseers, is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor of Rhode Island.
Foulkes, who is a former executive at CVS Health, the drugstore chain, and a niece of former Democratic Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, declared her candidacy on Wednesday in a letter to supporters.
The date of Rhode Island’s Democratic primary in 2022 has not yet been set, but Foulkes is already facing a crowded field of competitors in her bid to succeed another Harvard alumna: former Governor Gina M. Raimondo ’93, who is now serving as Commerce secretary in President Joe Biden’s cabinet.
First appointed to the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — in 2016, Foulkes was elected president of the board in April for the 2021-22 academic year, which will be her last year as a board member. She is expected to serve out the remainder of her term while running for governor, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
There is precedent for members of the Board of Overseers to run for office while still serving Harvard. Most notably, John F. Kennedy ’40 remained on the board throughout his successful 1960 campaign for U.S. president.
Foulkes took the helm of the Board of Overseers as Harvard continued to wrestle with complications of the coronavirus pandemic, pledging in April that “my Overseer colleagues and I will do our best to help guide the University through this next chapter.”
Foulkes’s campaign maintained that running for governor would not distract from her role as president of the Board of Overseers.
“Helena is as committed to Harvard as ever, and she will successfully fulfill her responsibilities to the university, just as she has for the past five years,” campaign manager Emma Caccamo wrote in a statement Monday.
Just as she promised to Harvard affiliates, Foulkes wrote in her campaign announcement that she is prepared to help lead Rhode Island during a challenging time.
“The pandemic and years of Trumpian divisiveness forced us all to reflect upon our common humanity, even as our differences, real and perceived, worked to pull us all apart,” Foulkes wrote. “This is a time of both great crisis and opportunity in the Ocean State, and I am eager to spearhead the change that must come.”
In her first campaign video, Foulkes expressed support for creating environmentally sustainable jobs so that “the green economy is a driver of growth for all of us in the Ocean State.”
Her toughest primary opponent will be Governor Dan McKee, the former lieutenant governor, who succeeded Raimondo in January. Other declared contenders include state Treasurer Seth Magaziner, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, and former Secretary of State Matt Brown.
In the days since announcing her campaign, Foulkes has received scrutiny for a $500 donation to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in 2014.
“One of the last Republicans I contributed to many years ago was Mitch McConnell and it’s something I deeply regret and would never do again,” Foulkes said in a tweet. “It was before he colluded with Donald Trump to destroy the Supreme Court and more. I sincerely apologize.”
If elected, Foulkes would continue a tradition of political families like the Kennedys, Roosevelts, and Cuomos in dominating Democratic politics in the northeast. In addition to her uncle Chris who served five terms in the U.S. Senate, her grandfather Thomas J. Dodd served two terms as a senator from Connecticut, between 1959 and 1971.
On Sunday, Chris Dodd said he was “so proud” of Foulkes in a tweet congratulating her on the start of her gubernatorial campaign.
Despite the family connections, Foulkes said in the video that she “never thought about running for public office, but Covid changed everything.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard's campus emptied out due to Covid-19 last year, the University’s campus greenhouse gas emissions remained stagnant for a fifth straight year, according to preliminary data released Friday as part of the University’s 2020 sustainability report.
Harvard has pledged to become fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050. But the school has seen no reduction in its emissions since former University President Drew G. Faust set the targets in 2018.
Still, school officials maintain that Harvard is on track to meet both goals.
“The University is on pace to meet its goals to be fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050,” Heather A. Henriksen, managing director of the Harvard Office for Sustainability, wrote in a statement Monday.
To offset emissions, Harvard has also invested in offsite renewable energy, including solar and wind.
The school made steady progress between 2006 and 2016, decreasing emissions by 40 percent when factoring in campus growth. But emissions numbers have stayed flat ever since.
Julian Dautremont, the director of programs for the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, said schools often see emissions plateaus as they pursue reductions after first taking care of “low hanging fruit.”
“It’s not uncommon to see some plateauing, and then there’s some larger-scale change that potentially folks have been working on for several years,” he said.
Last year, Harvard met most of the goals set in its 2014 Sustainability Plan, but fell short of reducing waste and water usage by its 2020 deadline.
The University pledged in 2014 to cut campus waste numbers in half by 2020 compared to a 2006 baseline, with the hope of eventually achieving zero waste production. In 2020, Harvard did see drastic reductions to its waste production — but the report acknowledged the data is largely due to campus de-densification and not representative of a trend.
Trash per-capita last year was 27 percent higher than the 2006 baseline. The report attributed this jump to “significant operational changes” required to implement public health measures during the pandemic.
Dautremont said the impact of the pandemic on campus waste has been mixed, with reductions due to de-densification at many schools being at least partially offset by an increase in disposable products, such as masks.
Reduced campus population in 2020 also significantly improved Harvard’s water-use numbers. The University surpassed its water-reduction target set in 2014 — though a year late.
The University’s 2019 sustainability report blamed a “known infrastructure break” for its failure to meet the goal of reducing water use by 30 percent between 2006 and 2020. In 2020, water usage on campus was 36 percent lower than 2006 — water savings equivalent to filling Harvard’s Blodgett Pool 298 times.
The report pointed to the 14 percent cut in water use achieved by 2018 as “the most accurate” measure of its progress, acknowledging the 2019 and 2020 numbers were not reflective of a trend.
Beyond waste and water, Harvard took strides in its efforts to improve sustainability, achieving a 7 percent cut in net energy usage and completing construction on the new Science and Engineering Complex, which achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum status, the highest distinction offered by LEED.

Blue Bottle Coffee is set to return to Harvard Square in late October, months after the chain announced the permanent closure of its Square location.
The coffee shop, located at the intersection of Bow and Plympton Streets, had temporarily closed at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and reopened in late April, before officially closing on May 30.
Blue Bottle Coffee announced its plans to open its Harvard Square outpost, its 34th planned location, in late 2016. After multiple delays, the shop officially opened in February 2018, though some students had concerns about the store’s high prices.
Blue Bottle Coffee did not respond to a request for more information about the reopening of its Harvard Square location. A flyer posted on the window of the storefront reads: “We are training! Excited to welcome you back on October 31, 2021!”
In interviews, some students welcomed the news of an additional place to load up on caffeine, while others bemoaned the presence of another chain in Harvard Square.
Amy Huang ’24 said she was excited for Blue Bottle Coffee’s reopening, noting that it will make coffee more accessible for residents of the river houses.
“For Mather, Dunster, and even Leverett, there are not that many selections in the area close to us, and so I think Blue Bottle will be great in filling in that void,” she said.
Anna G. Farronay ’24 recalled positive experiences consuming coffee at Blue Bottle's Boston locations, claiming that their coffee is "on par with Starbucks."
But other students had reservations about the store’s reopening.
David A. Kennedy-Yoon ’23 said he was “kind of sick” of Blue Bottle.
“It was so expensive, and then they left, and now they want to reopen?” he asked. “I had a date that was just a disaster there, too. I have a lot of bad memories, so I was okay with it being closed.”
Jenn Luong ’24 said that she believes Harvard Square already has an “unnecessary amount” of coffee chains.
“I think a wholesome, beautiful, neighborhood small-business coffee shop would be great, like Café Pamplona maybe,” she said. “We don’t need another ‘blue’ named corporate coffee chain.”
The Bee Club — an all-female Harvard final club — recently purchased Café Pamplona’s former building for $2.2 million. Bluestone Lane, a Melbourne-inspired coffee-chain, currently offers customers coffee and breakfast items — replete with avocados — at its Brattle Street location.
If she is going to frequent a chain, Luong added, she would prefer it to sell items at affordable prices.
“I’d rather support a chain where I can get chicken nuggets for very cheap, rather than overpriced expensive coffee.”
Carly A. Tiras ’22-’23 said the high prices and lack of seating at Blue Bottle dissuaded her from stopping at the shop when it was open in the Square.
“I never really frequented Blue Bottle when it was open, just because it was expensive, and it’s more expensive than other coffee shops," she said. "The few times I have been, it’s been nice."

No. 12 Harvard (11-1, 4-0 Ivy League) smashed past Yale (5-7, 2-2) on Oct. 9, closing out the game commandingly in the second half with two goals off of corners for a final score of 3-1.
As is expected of Harvard-Yale games, it was a close and intense contest.
“Harvard-Yale in every single sport is such a traditional, competitive game with a little rivalry between the two teams,” head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden remarked. “I think we headed down there with the same expectation that [Yale was going to] do whatever [it] could to take it to us.”
An early goal in the first quarter by sophomore defender Mazarine Broze put the Crimson up 1-0. However, after this strong start, Yale surged back in the second quarter off a corner goal by junior midfielder Théodora Dillman.
“[From there, it was a] typical Havard-Yale Ivy League energy-driven game with some back and forth turnovers and some opportunities on both sides,” van Herwaarden said.
The score was to remain at 1-1 through halftime until Harvard came roaring back, scoring two strong corners off the stick of first-year forward Megan Joel.
“[We] did a really good job of trusting the process, our structure, and importantly each other, which I think is what contributed to the change in our game to take the lead in the end,” senior back Hannah Pearce said.
Joel has had a strong season so far and was joined on the stat line by Pearce, who leads the team in points with nine goals and two assists. With such a strong corner unit, the Crimson was able to capitalize on opportunities against the Bulldogs.
Van Herwaarden mentioned that Joel’s skill and Harvard’s commitment to the game plan allowed them to use Joel’s second goal as a planned corner.
“We knew that there was a weakness on that side, so we abused it to an extent and got the goal for 3-1,” van Herwaarden said.
Although Harvard’s offense certainly did its part to propel the team over Yale, its defense also held its own. The Crimson held the Bulldogs to no shots on goal in the second half. There has not been a team that has scored more than one goal against Harvard.
“We understand that we can bank on a very solid defense,” van Herwaarden said, “[even if it] is [not] something that we play for.
Although the services of junior goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo were not needed in the second half, she was able to make two saves in the first and is a large contributing factor to the strength of the Crimson’s defensive unit.
After another win this past weekend at home against Dartmouth, 4-0, followed by a non-conference victory against Boston University on Oct. 18, 1-0, Harvard’s next in-conference game will be a battle at home on Oct. 23 against the Princeton Tigers (8-5, 5-0) to determine which Ivy League team will remain undefeated in-conference.

So you asked for three roommates and instead got one? Or maybe you asked for one and got six? You said that you wanted to sleep at 3 a.m., but instead got paired with a bunch of kids who go to sleep at 8 p.m.? Every night? The rooming situation for freshmen isn’t always ideal, but sometimes, there are ways to make the best of it!
Here are seven ways to form a fam with your freshmen roomies:
Talk to them. Every. Single. Day. 
“Good morning,” “Good night,” “How are you?” And at the bare minimum: acknowledge their existence with a “hi.”
Share Your Food... Or Head to the Berg Together
Nothing is nicer than free food. Period. Note: they have to know you’re sharing food before you start eating all their peanut butter while they’re in class.
Show Some Love
Go to their events – their games, their performances, their study breaks – and show your support. They may not say it, but they’ll love it… and when they’re too stressed by their CS50: Introduction to Computer Science psets and Gov 20: Foundations of Comparative Politics readings (potentially because they haven’t done them in five weeks like this writer), bring them brain break snacks or Jefe’s (or Felipe’s, I guess).
Do the Chores Together (Yes, The Chores)
Fold the laundry, broom the floors, chase that rat out of the dorm, and hang the tapestry that fell three weeks ago back up. While you’re at it, make a cleaning chart for that en-suite bathroom & never give each other the stare down when the trash fills up again.
Game Nights, Movie Nights, Football Games, Picnics 
Whether it’s in your fancy basement (lookin at you, Thayer) or somewhere you have to take the T to get to, plan an event that can become a fond memory for you guys to reminisce about during finals.
If You’re Not Besties By This Point – Set Your Limits & Be Patient. 
Remember to agree on the non-negotiables: visitors at night, drinking, pineapple on pizza… Struggling to break it to them that you don’t really like country music at three a.m. on the speakers? Leave a sticky note, send them a text, or just tell them casually!
Did all of these things and still no luck? They just suck? Suck it up buttercup, there’s two more months till winter break. It’s time to stock up on those ear plugs, white noise machines, and sleep masks.
