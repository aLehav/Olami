After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Literature has a long history of romanticizing purposeless youth. From “The Sun Also Rises” to “On the Road,” many aspiring Hemingways and Kerouacs have paid tribute to the sad young men and women who leave home behind, travel without a plan, fall in love or get into trouble, and become lost souls forever lingering on the highway. In fact, these images have been so ingrained in popular culture that they have inevitably become clichéd. The everlasting trend of rebellious escape and spontaneous travels has even given rise to successful businesses such as CouchSurfing and BlaBlaCar. In such a world, is it necessary to write yet another story of a lost twentysomething traveling around the world? “Wreck and Order” shows that maybe it really isn't.
Hannah Tennant-Moore’s debut novel follows a storyline that has more or less become the standard formula for “wandering youth” tales. Elsie, an aimless, self-destructive young woman, gives up college and takes to the road with her tuition dollars in an attempt to find her inner calling. Unsurprisingly, she finds herself in Paris, the moveable feast of a city where she has experimental sex with almost every man she meets before she returns to California and falls in love with a reckless layabout named Jared. When their relationship collapses into an unavoidable mess, she leaves her country again to—of course—the East, where she tries to find peace of mind in Sri Lanka.
It is ironic that what should be a rebellion against the norm has eventually become the norm itself, and it is even more ironic that both the main character, Elsie, and the author, Tennant-Moore, seem to be self-absorbed in their endeavor, unaware that they are merely following a path undertaken by thousands. In the end, what they consider to be a journey of existentialist self-discovery and accumulation of experience is nothing more than a hormone-driven adolescent fever fed by the world of consumption. While Elsie always believes she is living adventurously, most of her decisions and opinions are surprisingly predictable; for instance, her obsession with the French language falls nicely into the stereotype of teenage girl fantasies. When Elsie encounters a French Sri Lankan man, the author spends a few pages eagerly describing how nervous and excited Elsie is to speak French with him, how she has learned French in school, and how she has long had an affinity for Flaubert and Labé—quel chic, les Français!
Apart from giving her heroine a clichéd personality, Tennant-Moore also attempts a clichéd style of writing as she blurs the boundary between the present and the past. Quite often, she lets Elsie slip into her own memories when she catches sight of a familiar object, which at least in some passages looks like a writing exercise based on Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time” (guess which country Proust is from). Tennant-Moore also punctuates the story with Elsie’s reflections on contemporary issues, from the Iraq war to sexual assault. However, despite her efforts to be profound, many of these discussions are disappointingly unoriginal, and tend to be maudlin opinions rather than mature thoughts.
Fortunately, honesty and wholeheartedness save the story from being a bore. The heroine never shies away from sensitive topics and is always open to anatomizing herself. She gives a very honest and detailed account of her sex life: her first sexual experience, experiments while growing up and traveling around, her feelings about orgasms, and her attempts to come to terms with her own body. Many times in the novel she recounts the intercourse she has and discusses what the episodes mean to her in a tone so believable and relatable that the words seem to be directly transcribed from a conversation between intimate friends. This direct honesty renders Elsie likeable no matter how flawed she is, and at times, brilliant reflections on topics such as selfishness in sexual relationships or the awkward but exciting experiences of teenage sex stem from such conversations.
Unfortunately, as nice as honesty is, the best it can do is to turn a mediocre novel into an honest and mediocre novel. Honesty cannot give more depth to a story, an attribute that “Wreck and Order” lacks the most, and much of Tennant-Moore’s book remains sentimental and self-pitying. Young people may always be the same. They might always make the same mistake and embark on the same spontaneous trips. “Wreck and Order” unfortunately seems to be just one of the many unimpressive stops on this never-ending journey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—For the second consecutive matchup between Harvard and Columbia, one shot turned the tables.
Last time out in Cambridge, it was a buzzer-beating jumper from Lions senior Alex Rosenberg, allowing Columbia to eke out a win.
This time at Levien Gym, the shot came from Columbia’s leading scorer, senior Maodo Lo. It looked like Harvard would be able to close out the first half down just two as senior forward Agunwa Okolie hit a jumper with five seconds remaining. But the Lions did not back down. Instead of running out the clock, Lo received a pass at half court and released. WIth the Lions fans on their feet, Lo’s shot banked off the backboard and into the net.
“We thought that was as big of a play in the entire game because of not so much just the three points, but how it changed the spirit for Lo,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly he was a different player and they would have been the same without that, but it certainly helped.”
While the Crimson hung on in the beginning of the second half, the dramatic shot changed the momentum for Lo and the Lions (18-8, 7-2 Ivy League), leading to an eventual 90-76 win over the Crimson (10-15, 2-7).
After scoring just two points prior to the heave, Lo went off in the second half. While Rosenberg led the Lions with 23 points on the night, Lo’s 17 second-half points put Harvard in a hole that it couldn’t escape.
“I noticed he was being a lot more aggressive in the second half,” freshman guard Tommy McCarthy said. “They run a lot of backdoors and stuff ... We went over it in practice this week and it’s something we shouldn’t have gotten beaten on and I had a couple lapses where I got beat.”
Despite the energy from the Lions following Lo’s shot, the Crimson held close through the first 10 minutes of the second frame, as it was able to pull within one-possession eight different times. However over the course of the next minute, the Lions took what was a two-point lead and stretched it to 10, with the run bookended with threes by junior Chris McComber and Lo. From that point forward, Amaker’s squad would never get closer than seven.
Midway through the first half, it looked like Lo might have been done for the night when he collided with freshman guard Corey Johnson under the basket and immediately grabbed his leg as he lay on the ground. The senior stayed down on the floor for several minutes as the trainer checked on his injury, but he eventually jogged off the floor on his own power, eventually returning to hit the half-court trey.
Harvard has struggled with consistency all year, typically either gaining a big lead, only to watch it crumble, or digging an early hole, forcing the team to forge a late comeback. For much of Friday’s game, however, the inconsistency manifested not as much in stretches of poor play, but in an inability to play both offense and defense.
Led by Okolie and McCarthy, who had 20 and 17 points respectively, the Crimson offense had one of its best games of the year by shooting at a 56.9 percent clip. But on the other end of the floor, the defense struggled to slow Columbia’s diverse offense.
“It’s very tough, like all five positions can drive the ball and all five positions can shoot the ball,” Okolie said. “[We] got lost in our rotations and they just stretched us out and made threes so it was tough for us on the defensive end.”
Columbia’s 90 points were the most given up by a Crimson defense this year, as the Lions’ reciprocated Harvard’s sharpshooting by making 57.4 percent of its own shots. It was the second time this season the Crimson gave up 50-plus points in a half.
While Columbia fights to stay alive atop the Ancient Eight, Harvard continues to separate itself at the bottom with the loss.
“We know we are not in the running for the Ivy League anymore but we are still focused on being a championship team,” McCarthy said. “We are not really worried about where we stand, we are worried about ourselves and focusing on becoming a championship team and sending the seniors out the right way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the No. 13/13 Harvard men’s hockey team, Friday night’s bout with rival Cornell presented palpable stakes: Win and secure the program’s first Ivy League championship since 2006. Tie and leave the Bright-Landry Hockey Center with no less than a share of the crown.
Therefore, one point was all that separated the Crimson from snapping a decade-long drought. But as Harvard forward Seb Lloyd put it in the postgame presser, “You don’t come to a game hoping to tie.”
Yet in spite of the sophomore's sentiment, 65 minutes of hockey proved insufficient for determining a winner on Friday, as the No. 16/- Big Red (12-8-6, 7-7-5 ECAC) erased two separate one-goal deficits in what amounted to a 2-2 draw in front of a capacity crowd of 3,095 at the Bright Center.
“I think the game for the most part ended up to me the way it should’ve been—a tie,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I would like to say that we played better and deserve better, but I think quite honestly both teams left a lot out on the ice. It was a physical game, a tough game, and both goalies made some big saves…. It was Harvard-Cornell—a typical game.”
The result brought about mixed feelings in the Crimson locker room, as Harvard will now have to wait for the result of next Friday’s contest between No. 8/8 Yale and Princeton to find out whether or not it has won the championship outright. The Crimson finished the year with a 7-1-2 record in Ivy League play, while the Bulldogs sit just one win off that mark.
Before the dust settled on Friday, Harvard (14-8-4, 10-5-4) nabbed a 2-1 edge with a little more than 12 minutes remaining in regulation after Lloyd received credit for beating junior goaltender Mitch Gillam amid an eight-man pile-up in the crease.
Just inside the right faceoff dot, junior forward Tyler Moy ripped a shot on goal that bounced off Gillam and into the air, giving Lloyd the opportunity to swat it down atop the goalmouth. The puck eventually reached Gillam, who swiped at it with his glove, sending it just outside of the blue paint. But then madness ensued.
Sophomore forward Dwyer Tschantz attempted to clear the puck behind his net, but instead, it pinballed off the skate of sophomore center Jared Fiegl and into the goal in the midst of a sea of bodies, giving Harvard its 26th power play goal of the year.
The goal mirrored a Cornell threat in the waning minutes of the second period where captain Christian Hilbrich poked in a loose puck that had been lying underneath sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen. However, a quick whistle from the officials, who deemed Madsen—lying on his back—had control of the puck, negated the goal that would have put the Big Red up, 2-1.
“The puck was obviously loose because we shot it in,” Cornell coach Mike Schafer said. “And then they let that scramble [where Harvard scored] go on forever, and our goalie gets pushed in…. I mean, the referee’s got to blow the whistle.” 
Nonetheless, the Crimson’s goal would count and the Big Red’s would not, putting Cornell in a 2-1 hole midway through the third. But less than two minutes after Harvard jumped in front, the visitors delivered an equalizer.
Fresh off an attacking zone faceoff won by rookie forward Anthony Angello, sophomore defenseman Dan Wedman beat Madsen top shelf after his blast from the point skipped off the skate of sophomore defenseman Clay Anderson just two feet in front of the goaltender. Wedman’s first career goal capped the scoring with 10:41 still left to play in the third.
The Big Red’s first equalizer of the night was more of an opportunistic one. After generating 15 shots on target in the opening frame, the Crimson came out firing again at the start of the second. But one outlet pass from freshman defenseman Alec McCrea was all Cornell needed to negate Harvard’s aggressive start.
Five minutes into the second frame, McCrea hit captain Teemu Tiitinen with an end-to end pass through the middle of the ice, and Tiitinen beat Madsen stick-side before freshman defenseman Adam Baughman had a chance to catch up.
Despite the Big Red's two tallies, Madsen was on top of his game Friday night, holding second-chance opportunities to a minimum and finishing with a total of 31 saves. On the other end, Gillam logged 33 saves of his own—16 more than he made in the teams’ first meeting back on Jan. 23 in Ithaca, N.Y.
“Phenomenal” was Schafer’s adjective of choice when describing some of the saves made by the dueling goaltenders. Yet the most impressive stop of the night belonged to someone far less accustomed to flashing the leather.
After Madsen held his right post to deny a Matt Buckles wrister towards the end of the first period, the puck shot off the back of sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman and began rolling towards the goal line. Diving in to swat it away with his right hand, however, was junior center Sean Malone, whose save enabled the Crimson to kill off the second of four Cornell power plays on the night.
Malone also provided Harvard with its first tally, converting a turnover into a goal from Gillam’s left post 8:32 into the opening frame. The Buffalo Sabres prospect left the game with an injury in the third period, but Donato—while unsure about Malone’s availability for Saturday night—revealed that the junior was bouncing around in the locker room after the game, easing concerns about his prospective recovery.
With the draw, the Crimson remains in third place in the ECAC, but its hold on a potential first-round bye—awarded to the top four teams in the conference—is down to two points. No. 18/- St. Lawrence and Dartmouth, who are currently tied for fourth, are right on Harvard's tail with three games remaining in the regular season.
Meanwhile, the Crimson will be pulling for Princeton next Friday, as a Tiger win or draw at home against Yale would give Harvard outright possession of the Ivy League title.
“We don’t want to be sharing it with anybody,” co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—The Harvard men’s basketball team dropped its second consecutive contest as the Crimson fell to Columbia, 90-76, on Friday night. Harvard (10-15, 2-7 Ivy League) allowed its most points of the season as the Lions (18-8, 7-2) capitalized on 13 Harvard turnovers and put the game out of reach with a 51-point second half. It is the first time that the Crimson has conceded 90 points in a non-overtime Ivy League contest since Feb. 13, 2009.
SPREADING THE FLOOR
Harvard was doomed by a balanced Columbia offensive attack on Friday night. While Harvard coach Tommy Amaker utilized a bevy of defensive strategies in an attempt to slow down the Lions, the Crimson was unable to consistently keep the hosts off the scoreboard.
“They have a lot of firepower,” Amaker said. “[Senior guard Maodo] Lo is a big time difference maker with his ability to carry the team in stretches if they need that and the plays he can make off the bounce and the ability to spread the floor with shooters. I think they become a very dangerous team.”
Lo was second on the team with 22 points, but it was the team’s balance and the matchup problems it created that propelled Columbia to the season sweep of Harvard. Senior forward Alex Rosenberg finished with 23 points and the big man’s ability to extend out past the three-point line made him a nightmare to guard. With senior forward Agunwa Okolie on him, Rosenberg found his teammates whereas when captain Evan Cummins covered him, the Short Hills, N.J. native exhibited his shooting range.
While the Crimson has faced off against teams with zone busters this season, it was the supporting cast that proved to be the difference in New York. Nine different players scored for the Lions, including junior forward Chris McComber, who drained two three-pointers, and junior forward Jeff Coby, who took advantage of the overextended Harvard defense and went six-of-seven from the charity stripe.
“It’s very tough,” Okolie said. “All five positions can drive the ball and all five positions can shoot the ball so it’s really tough. We could have stayed in front, got lost in our rotations but they just stretched us out and made threes.”
The Crimson went with a smaller lineup down the stretch in an attempt to contain Columbia’s shooters. Okolie slid down to power forward while freshman forward Weisner Perez logged 16 minutes, his most since Feb. 5, primarily guarding the Lions’ fours and fives.
GUNNIN’ FOR IT
Okolie was a bright spot on both ends of the floor for Harvard. The senior shouldered the offensive load for the Crimson in the first half, scoring 11 points before the intermission while having to cover Lo or Rosenberg on the other end. It took Okolie almost eight minutes to score his first points of the second half, but he led his team on the defensive end and chipped in rebounds and assists as his team cut into the five-point halftime deficit.
“It’s obvious that he is our most important player,” Amaker said. “We’ve had to move him all around the floor; not only does he have to guard guys like that but we need him to score for us. He’s as productive and as efficient as anyone on the offensive end for us. There’s nothing more that we can ask him to accomplish for our team.”
Being Harvard’s most versatile and important player is something few could have predicted entering the season. The senior was the Crimson’s defensive specialist but averaged only 4.3 points per game last year. Okolie has kept up the defensive pressure but has also posted 12 double-digit scoring outputs and is second on the team in rebounds per game.
Okolie was the glue that held Harvard together on a night when it allowed Columbia to shoot 57 percent from the field. The Ajax, Ontario native led all players with 35 minutes of game action and was the Crimson’s high man in points, assists, and rebounds.
“He’s our X-factor for sure,” said freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy. “He is one of our best players, if not our best player. He brings it every night. On defense, he does whatever we ask of him—he guards each position. He is really versatile and his offensive game this year has progressively got better and better and better and I think his confidence has gone way up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were no celebrations. No fist-pumping congratulations.
The No. 13/13 Harvard men’s hockey team solemnly saluted the Bright-Landry Hockey Center crowd following their 2-2 tie with No. 16/- Cornell on Friday. The Crimson’s 10-year Ivy League title drought might not have ended in the way Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 would have drawn it up, but a trophy is a trophy, no matter how small.
The Crimson will have to wait until next week to learn whether they have clinched their league-leading 22nd Ancient Eight title outright, as a win by Yale at Princeton on Feb. 26 would split the Hobey Baker trophy between Cambridge and New Haven. In the meantime, Harvard will direct its attention to the conference and national races that lie ahead.
WILD ONE
Midway through the first period, referee Cameron Lynch skated toward the left corner of the Cornell side as Harvard’s third line carried the puck up the right wing. Following an initial shot by Crimson junior Sean Malone, Lynch drifted behind the Cornell net and into the path of Big Red puck-carrier Ryan Bliss. 
Pressured by Harvard junior Tyler Moy, Bliss tried a breakout pass, but his feed clipped Lynch’s right skate and skittered back to Malone, who buried the puck top-shelf for Harvard’s first score.
The play merited choice words from Cornell coach Mike Schafer after the game.
“What frustrated me the most was that I don’t know what the referee was doing standing behind our net on our breakout,” Schafer said. “What the hell is he doing there? Obviously he’s out of position. When our defense goes D to D, and it hits the referee, that’s a bad break. It happens.”
Malone’s goal highlighted a challenging night for the ECAC officiating crew, who contended with several close calls around the crease Friday. After a quick whistle on a loose puck under Harvard goaltender Merrick Madsen near the close of the second period, sophomore Seb Lloyd provided the Crimson’s second mark of the night from inside the crease on a pile-up play that could have been called dead before the puck crossed the line.
Later, Cornell got its own bounce off a skate, as stay-at-home sophomore defenseman Dan Wedman earned his first collegiate goal off a one-timer slapshot that changed direction off the boot of Harvard junior Clay Anderson.
“[It was] just a wild game from the goals that were scored, the calls that were made, but I thought two teams played really hard,” Schafer said.
MALONE ALONE
Through Friday’s first two acts, Sean Malone was the Crimson’s leading man.
In addition to his goal, the third-line center made a key block inside the Harvard crease to keep the Crimson up by one at the first intermission. He followed that up with an open ice hit on 6’7” Cornellian Christian Hilbrich in the second period.
Malone made an early exit, however, with a lower body injury in the third period. In his absence, Donato rotated three lines through the game’s later stages, but he feels optimistic about the health status of the Buffalo Sabres’ draft pick moving forward.
“He’s bouncing around, so hopefully it’s something he’ll be able to recover from, but I’m not sure about his availability for tomorrow night,” Donato said.
PAIRWISE WATCH
The tie did little to help the Crimson’s place on the national stage. After Friday, Harvard maintained its 12th spot in the PairWise Rankings, placing the team near the bubble for an at-large NCAA tournament bid with three regular season games and a to-be-determined tournament schedule remaining.
Friday losses by St. Lawrence and Rensselaer, meanwhile, aided the Crimson in its bid for a first-round bye in the ECAC tournament. Harvard stands third in the conference rankings, a win ahead of Dartmouth and St. Lawrence for a top-four finish and home ice in the conference quarterfinals.
The Crimson's title hunt will not stop at the Ivy League trophy, shared or unshared.
“That’s a nice trophy to start with, but obviously we have a lot to play for down the stretch,” Donato said.

At risk of falling into the classic Harvard trap of complaining about the weather, it’s worth asking, what has been going on outside recently? Between last Sunday and Tuesday, there was a 60 degree temperature swing. That’s preposterous. How is one supposed to know which Patagonia, Canada Goose, or North Face level of jacket will fit any given day? In an effort to unveil the mysteries of nature, Flyby did some investigative journalism, and discovered a definitely legitimate letter from Mother Nature herself:
“Dear ignorant humans,
You guys really screwed up. Like big time. This whole carbon emissions thing is starting to be more than just a minor inconvenience. I sort of figured you’d get the hint last year when I dropped 108.6 inches of snow on your beloved Boston, MA, USA. When that didn't work, I  thought the whole increasing yearly temperatures and rising sea levels would do the trick, but again, no. You just keep pumping more and more crap into my face. Do you have any idea how ugly ozone depletion is making me?
But now things are just getting ridiculous. I was going to just keep raising temperatures bit by bit passive aggressively until you got the message, but some of you still blabber about how “it was so cold last winter! If the globe is warming, why do we keep getting snow storms?” So I finally snapped. That’s why it was negative a billion last weekend and basically summer today. If you’re going to demand a linear rise in temperatures to prove that climate change is real, then I’m just going to keep screwing with you. Think about it. You’re going to look like such IDIOTS when it’s 60 degrees in February and you go outside in your precious Canada Goose. Then as soon as you warm up (ha) to the idea of wearing shorts in the winter, I’m going to turn your city into Hoth. So have fun, people, you brought this upon yourselves.
Angrily,
Nature”
