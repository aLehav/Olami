After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While South Regional 15-seed Princeton University put the Ivy League on the radar this month with its Cinderella-esque March Madness run, two Brown University basketball players similarly drew the spotlight to the Ivy League, but in a very different fashion.
The duo filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all present and former Ivy League athletes, arguing that the Ivy League has unlawfully colluded to reduce financial aid and compensation for student-athletes. The suit claims that the League’s policy against athletic scholarships works as monopolistic price-fixing, an alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.
While we hold our student-athletes in the highest regard — they bring us student life and fun galore! Who can forget the annual adrenaline rush of Harvard-Yale? — this lawsuit fundamentally misunderstands the role of student-athletes on our own Ivy League campus.
Just like all other Harvard students, Harvard’s student-athletes are individuals with exceptional skills at both the academic and extracurricular levels, who contribute significantly to the College. The status of a student-athlete here should therefore be immaterially different from that of any other student — all should receive fundamentally equal treatment and consideration.
We thus oppose the idea that Harvard’s student-athletes should receive compensation beyond that which any student here would receive through financial aid. Harvard’s need-based financial aid system is incredibly generous; moreover, we find merit in the egalitarian principles that lie at its heart. The cost of attendance mirrors one’s ability to pay, prioritizing those who most need financial support and opening this institution’s doors to a more diverse set of individuals to go on to leave their marks on the world.
Athletes, too, benefit from a need-based financial aid system. Precisely because financial aid is not contingent on being an active athlete, student-athletes at Harvard have great freedom to define and redefine their college lives — perhaps even leaving athletics — without ever fearing their education becoming financially untenable. Student-athletes should never be boxed into their ‘athlete’ roles and out of their ‘student’ roles by financial aid with strings attached.
The idea of a merit-based financial aid system, both in and out of athletics, reeks of a toxic competition that ultimately rewards less aid overall. Will recruited and walk-on athletes begin to differentiate themselves as factions within the same team? Will violinists go head-to-head to determine who is a prodigy worthy of aid and who is only a hobbyist?
At Harvard, where merit abounds by virtue of admittance, for our admissions committee to separate certain students for merit-based scholarships would be like Paris choosing the fairest goddess for the golden apple: a vain endeavor that only leads to ruin.
While we are definitely not lawyers, we find the lawsuit’s characterization of Ivy League sports recruitment as a monopoly intellectually implausible. As the suit literally mentions, there are several non-Ivy institutions with an akin quality of education that compensate athletes in the form of merit-based financial aid. As such, if the benefits of an Ivy League education do not suffice, there is no shortage of comparable alternatives.
We maintain that Harvard’s student-athletes are students first and athletes if they want to be; a financial aid system that compensates them for their athleticism is at odds with this premise. They are students, just like everyone else, and should be considered for financial aid based on their ability to pay. We’ll keep cheering on our athletes to win games in their courts — but unfortunately, this time, we can’t support their case in court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I lost my phone on a solo trip to New York City.
It was early January in the Northeast, when frigid temperatures are accompanied by sharp wind and snowflakes that creep up the back of your coat, clinging to your skin. Despite my red nose, chapped-dry lips, and extra pounds of clothing to protect myself from the weather, I was eager to get the full New York experience: the captivating Manhattan skyscrapers, endless traffic jams, and energy-filled crowds speed-walking through the streets.
For me, entering a large, modern city is psychologically stimulating. The astonishingly complex, human-built structures and the never-ending hustle culture is to me the epitome of human ambition, of the constant desire to improve our surroundings and ourselves through progressive advancement. Interacting with thousands of people in such quick succession inspires me, and instills confidence within me to chase my dreams.
Yet those same concrete streets quickly became engulfing and intimidating the second I checked my pocket and realized that my recently bought iPhone was no longer there.
I was quickly overwhelmed by a flood of thoughts: pending emails, unanswered texts, and the sensitive information within my phone. But then I panicked: I realized that not only was I missing the necessary tools to manage my day-to-day life, but also whoever found my device would potentially have access to sensitive data that, if compromised, could devastate my finances.
In addition to worrying about my ability to carry out my normal life, I also had to find my way back home. The train system which I was previously able to navigate with ease became a puzzle of colorful, intersecting lines on a physical map, as I attempted to decipher a path to my home without Google Maps. At this moment, I realized that my entire generation has this problem: Growing up with technology, many of us have never had to comprehend the immense size of our cities and their intricate street systems, and have hardly ever experienced the difficulty of navigating without our phones and computers telling us where to go.
But even though I had lost my phone, I still had to find a way home, complete my assignments, and submit internship applications. After my initial panic — and a lengthy remorseful contemplation on my failure to purchase phone insurance — I started to develop a deeper connection to my surroundings. As I attempted to find my way back home, I found myself sparking conversations with random New Yorkers, primarily asking for directions, but also learning about their lives. In a world saturated with technology, we often forget the fun of interaction, and the intellectual development that comes from learning about each other.
I lacked the comfort of technology, yet I found myself enjoying the challenge of problem-solving and reflecting throughout the journey that accompanied it. The train rides that I once spent staring at my phone screen became adventurous and exciting. Not only did I discover new aspects of the city, such as the captivating world of underground graffiti as I looked out the train window, but I also felt relaxed and at peace.
Many of us know that it would be beneficial for us to get off our phones a little bit more. But despite our awareness of the cell phone’s omnipresent role in our lives, we fail to recognize our dependence on them — how incompetent we’d be without them.
Oftentimes, Harvard’s academic rigor, as well as our ambitious nature and constant desire to feel productive, makes it easy to spend most of our time connected to technology. We are so focused on attempting to set ourselves up for the future through our academic endeavors that we forget to enjoy the pleasures of our surroundings and the people we spend time with. We fail to explore and appreciate the history embedded within every corner of our campus, and to take advantage of everything we can learn from the incredible range of experiences contained in Harvard’s student body.
At Harvard, it often feels like we are supposed to grow up as fast as possible. We spend too much of our time looking forward, never pausing for a moment to learn about the spaces we inhabit, or the people that we share those spaces with. Losing my phone allowed me to forget my ambition and, for a few hours, forced me to immerse myself in the people and the history of a city I love.
Although I am still financially recovering from losing my phone, I urge everyone reading this piece to follow two pieces of advice. First, ensure your new devices, and second, lose them once in a while.

Pardis C. Sabeti is a professor at the Center for Systems Biology and the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, a professor in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Disease at Harvard School of Public Health, institute member of the Broad institute, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. She does work in computational biology, medical genetics, and evolutionary genetics.
FM: You teach Life Sciences 1B — the flagship introductory genetics class — along with three other professors. Some LS1B alumni I talked to said they were surprised that you taught it, given your qualifications. What do you like about teaching an intro course compared to the smaller graduate classes you teach?
PCS: I just love all teaching. I love teaching in the small group, where there’s such personal connections.
But I love teaching in the big group, and trying to figure out how to make the big group experience seem personal.
LS1B has been one of the greatest highlights of my career.
I’ve never not taught it, even during the Ebola outbreak. After I shattered my pelvis and my knees, during SARS-CoV-2 … No matter what’s going on, it just grounds me to come back to LS1B.
It’s such a privilege and an honor to get to teach, to introduce amazing, young, brilliant minds to this topic in their college education.
FM: What are you most excited about right now — in and out of the lab?
PCS: So many things. It’s hard to say what I’m most excited about. I love my days. I really do. I’m working on four papers right now with my students, running the gamut of so many different topics. On every one, I’m like: this is my favorite project! Every project is my favorite project.
FM: How would you define computational biology or computational genetics, your primary areas of study, to a lay person?
PCS: Eric Lander, my mentor, once described genetics as ‘biological information as described through math.’ Basically the genome is one big code to decipher. And we can use computational tools to really understand them, and understand the logic, and build on that, and build new tools based on that.
Being a computational biologist is someone who uses mathematics and computer science to mine the genomes of humans and other organisms on this earth to understand how they work and to use that to the advancement of life on Earth.
FM: It seems that computational genetics is an inherently interdisciplinary field. But your research has also spanned other disciplines, including statistics, information theory, and medicine. How do you keep up with such a wide range of fields, and how do you decide what to work on?
PCS: I have always been somebody who’s just very curious about a lot of different fields.
I surround myself with brilliant people who can bring a lot of the expertise that I don’t have.
I usually find where there’s nobody else working, where my being there might make a difference.
I’m not in it to win a race. I’m in it to find what races aren’t being run.
FM: What’s your next big project?
PCS: It’s the big project we’ve been in for a decade, but we’re really picking up momentum on it, which is building the future of surveillance systems.
In the next several years, it’s really putting our money where our mouth is and taking the research and really implementing it to try to build resilient systems and early warning for outbreaks.
FM: Since at least the sequencing of the human genome in the early 2000s, as you talked about, using algorithms and statistical tools to study biology has become commonplace. Now the advent of artificial intelligence-based technology like AlphaFold and the possibility of genome editing with CRISPR seems to open up new frontiers. Where do you think the future of biology lies?
PCS: Yeah, we’re generating genomes from every organism on this planet, and every individual of different species on this planet. And we’re starting to understand the logic of how these genomes work. And then with these new generative AI models, we can actually create completely novel sequences that have their own properties.
It’s exciting to know that we could really have a lock on every infectious disease spreading, and we could use that to then build precision therapies that really target the thing that’s making you sick, and nothing else. So all of that is really exciting. But it’s also terrifying, because there’s so many ways that we can misuse this.
And, you know, I’m an M.D., and I literally am the last person you know that will take a medicine. Literally everything is natural. If I get sick, I take avocado and water. That’s it, you know what I mean? I will not take an antibiotic. I don’t think that most of the medicines we’ve created make us healthier.
FM: Why is that?
PCS: So far we’ve made them pretty poorly. Antibiotics blast our entire microbiome, and we have no idea the doggone effects of that.
I do think that medicines are powerful and transformative. But I do think that they should be more of a last resort choice, not the first go-to.
FM: Your lab has a tradition of making extremely elaborate holiday cards. The one in 2021, for example, featured members of your lab dressed up and photoshopped onto the covers of popular board games, like Candy Land and Operation. How did this tradition start, and how does it work now that the lab is so big?
PCS: It was my first year as faculty: 2008.
I started getting this whole slew of family holiday cards. And I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t really have a picture to share, but I do kind of have a family; there’s this really cute lab, you know, delightful lab that I’m making. So just one night on a whim, I drove to a local K-Mart and bought a lot of ugly holiday sweaters and a menorah and some different multi-denominational things. And I just was like, let’s just take a photo.
And then we got the bug.
We had a completely underwater holiday card where I ended up renting scuba gear. We just started getting really intense about every part of this.
We’ve got celebrity guest cameos; we had Chris Martin from Coldplay and Seth Meyers from SNL in our SNL card.
Longzhi Tan — who is a former undergraduate with me, and now professor at Stanford — I need to give him a shoutout. He started photoshopping for us as an undergraduate, and he’s still photoshopping for us through graduate school at Harvard and postdoc at Stanford and now professorship at Stanford.
FM: Which was your favorite?
PCS: You can’t do this to me. I don’t do favorites. Like literally every one is magical in its own right.
FM: What was your biggest setback on the way to becoming a leading genetics researcher?
PCS: So many. Like I can’t pick my favorites, I can’t pick my biggest setbacks. They’re all pretty big.
I think the one thing I’ll say that you should know is that a successful life is not one that is free of setbacks. It’s defined by setbacks.
Probably the most important setbacks were just being lost in graduate school and having my project not going anywhere.
In a way, college is your childhood for being an adult, and graduate school is your adolescence for being a professional. It’s a time where there’s a lot of existential angst.
And if you don’t really have good support and people there to make you feel like you’re on the right track and tell you when you’re not, in a healthy way, then you could get lost.
FM: When you graduated Harvard Medical School in 2006, you were only the third woman to receive summa cum laude honors. What are the difficulties, as you see it, for women pursuing careers in science and medical research?
PCS: It is not to say it is not difficult to be a man, and to be a good person in society today. I actually feel for all of my students very much. Even at this age of now 47 years old and a tenured professor, I’m still asked to clear dishes at conferences where I might be the keynote speaker, and shushed when the men are talking. That happens all the time. And overlooked for grants that I proposed that are given to junior faculty who have never done the work before.
It’s pretty relentless. Because people are innately suspicious of women and their ability to manage things.
Or just the fact that I’m a computational biologist who has written a lot of papers myself as first author, that are developing new algorithms. And yet, most people literally don’t think I know the math.
It’s laughable, but it’s also sad. It really doesn’t bother me that much. I clear the dishes. I clear the dishes. That’s what a nice person would do. Sometimes I think I shouldn’t, because that’s not helping the cause. And sometimes I think I need to be more forceful. I know that that impacts other people that don’t have a voice more. I’m always trying to balance like, when do you say something?
During Covid, the same thing happened: I got kicked out of every room.
All these women who were just brilliant scientists, like the people that were in charge in outbreaks before, were all told to sit this one out, and I was told to sit this one out.
Essentially it was being told that the men take charge here.
And it’s why you saw most of the prominent voices during Covid were men, even though a lot of the people I know and I work with are women.
The world is not fair. It’s just not fair. None of these races are run equally in any way. So for me, I keep going because it’s important for the people that come after me and for everybody else that’s in it with me.
FM: Aside from your teaching and research, you’re also the lead singer of indie rock band Thousand Days. Is there a new album in the works?
PCS: There are a lot of songs we haven't released yet, some of which are so old that it’s almost silly to release. And there is new music being written but I’m pretty focused on a few other things right now.
FM: What are you listening to right now?
PCS: You know, really everything. Every spring I make a mix for LS1B, so I make a LS1B study mix. So I just started listening to a lot of tunes and trying to find new gems for the mix.
Two bands that I’ve re-fallen in love with are Petit Biscuit and Walk off the Earth.
FM: Your resume is practically exploding with academic achievements — a Rhodes Scholarship, multiple publications in Nature, a winner of the prestigious Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator award, and, on top of that, you’re one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People of 2015 for your work on Ebola. Yet you also played varsity tennis in college, started bands at Oxford and Harvard Medical School, and you continue to sing for Thousand Days even as a full-time professor and researcher. How do you balance all your commitments?
PCS: If you really do things you love, it’s not like commitments. It’s just like, I love playing music. I love playing tennis. I love the kind of work I do.
You’re actually finding the path of least resistance. People waste a lot of time working really hard in something they don’t actually care about, but that some external driver made them think they care about it. I just make things move faster by doing things I really like to do.
FM: Follow-up question: Do you sleep?
PCS: Yeah, I do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since becoming the president of American University in 2017, Sylvia M. Burwell ’87 has acquired nearly six years of experience working with a university’s governing board. Now, she wants to join one for the next six years.
Burwell said she is running for election to Harvard’s Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — because she wants to serve “a place that’s really important and doing really important work.”
“It is a special thing in terms of what it means to me personally and why I want to, if given the opportunity, to be able to give back,” she added.
Burwell said that promoting diversity and inclusion would be one of her priorities if elected to the Board of Overseers. She has advocated for “inclusive excellence” at American University, where she said 57 percent of her senior leadership are people of color.
“You can’t be excellent as an institution of higher learning without actually having inclusion,” she said.
Despite Burwell’s focus on diversity and inclusion in her bid for a seat on the Board of Overseers, the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard did not endorse her. The Coalition, an alumni advocacy group, is a strong supporter of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
In addition to her experience in higher education, Burwell boasts a lengthy career in politics. She held two cabinet positions in President Barack Obama’s administration, serving as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2014 to 2017 during the Ebola and Zika outbreaks.
Burwell would be the second Obama administration secretary to sit on the Board of Overseers if elected, joining former Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. ’96. Two members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81 and former Small Business Administrator Karen Gordon Mills ’75 — were also both members of Obama’s cabinet.
Burwell said that she is “very excited” about Harvard University President-elect Claudine Gay, adding that she hopes to provide Gay with a helpful perspective as a university president.
“Having someone who sits in their seat and can see and understand from their perspective on a daily basis is something that I hope would be valuable,” Burwell said.
On the Board of Overseers, Burwell is excited to tap into the “generative part” of the Overseer role and shape higher education over the coming decade.
In particular, Burwell said she hopes to increase trust in higher education by listening to critics on the political left and right.
“One of the things that I think we all need to do in higher education is recognize the legitimacy of some of the concerns, versus saying, ‘We’re being attacked,’” Burwell said.
“I actually believe that some criticisms of higher education are legitimate,” she added. “So therefore, what I would want to encourage Harvard to do is to think through what are the legitimate concerns that are being expressed and what are we doing about them.”
Correction: March 31, 2023
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sylvia M. Burwell ’87 was the former president of American University. In fact, she is the current president.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People tease Srishti K. Gupta Narasimhan ’97 for having “too many Harvard degrees,” the Board of Overseers candidate said.
How many is “too many”? Narasimhan holds four degrees from the University: a bachelor’s in Biology and master’s in Molecular and Cellular Biology from 1997, an M.D. from Harvard Medical School completed in 2002, and a master’s in public policy from Harvard Kennedy School completed in 2003.
“I think it’s just a testament to the fact that I loved, I was nurtured, and I [was] incredibly supported by the Harvard community.” Narasimhan added.
Narasimhan’s campaign for the Board of Overseers focuses on promoting diversity, cultivating interdisciplinary thinking, and supporting the future of higher education.
After graduation, Narasimhan worked at McKinsey and Company for 18 years, first on child mortality and access to vaccines and later on diversity, equity, and inclusion within the company and its global talent program.
Currently living in Basel, Switzerland, Narasimhan sits on the board of Swiss biotech company Idorsia Pharmaceuticals and the Norrsken Foundation, a nonprofit that supports social impact startups.
Narasimhan said her multifaceted education and career have given her interdisciplinary skills to improve access to education and health equity globally.
“Both my career in global health equity plus my life has gotten me to work and live abroad,” Narasimhan said. “What I think would be really exciting to bring back to the University is bringing perspectives that reflect thinking from around the world. “
Narasimhan has worked in health and education policy in Peru, Tanzania, India, Botswana, and Indonesia, and has lived in Europe for nearly 10 years. She said serving on the Board of Overseers would help her grow Harvard as a “global institution.”
Narasimhan, an alumni interviewer for the College for the past decade, said it is critical for Harvard to continue to admit a diverse pool of students “in spite of how the Supreme Court decides on this challenge,” referencing the lawsuit brought by Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard over its race-conscious admissions policies.
She said Harvard should also support inclusivity through providing generous financial aid, ensuring undergraduates are academically ready to join desired programs regardless of educational background, and encouraging them to explore a variety of academic disciplines.
“It’s really important to figure out how Harvard is going to transmit the knowledge that it creates in each of the departments and schools into something that feels more interdisciplinary,” Narasimhan said.
As an undergraduate, Narasimhan served as the co-president of the South Asian Association, contributed to a nearly 300-page ethnic studies report as part of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ Academic Affairs Committee, and was chosen as one of Glamour Magazine’s top 10 promising college women of 1996.
For the past decade, Narasimhan has been part of Harvard’s Global Advisory Council. She is also active in organizing activities for the Class of 1997 and served as the co-chair of its 25th reunion last June.
Narasimhan said she is grateful for her time at Harvard, where she met many of her friends and mentors, as well as her husband, who was also part of the University’s M.D.-M.P.P. program.
“Harvard transformed my life,” she said.

Harvard Government concentrator turned food entrepreneur Arturo Elizondo ’14 is campaigning for a spot on the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body.
One of five candidates endorsed by the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an alumni advocacy group that aims to promote diversity and equity at the University, Elizondo is a first-time candidate focused on bringing a wider range of voices into the ranks of Harvard’s administration.
Elizondo is co-founder and CEO of The EVERY Company, a food technology startup dedicated to shifting menus toward sustainable, animal-free protein. A former Lowell House resident, Elizondo helped to create the Harvard Latinx Student Association and volunteered at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter during his years as an undergraduate.
Elizondo pointed to climate change, artificial intelligence, and student mental health as the most pressing challenges facing Harvard in the coming years.
Citing an undergraduate experience that inspired him to believe he could “change the world,” Elizondo said if he wins a seat on the Board of Overseers, he hopes to give students the “confidence to take this leap of faith.”
“I’m incredibly privileged and lucky to have had the education that I had, to have the resources I had to do it, and I want everyone to feel that way,” he said.
Elizondo said his campaign’s focus on student well-being and mental health stems from a personal understanding of the challenges that come with attending Harvard.
“I lost a friend to suicide while I was at Harvard. I lost a housemate to suicide,” he said. “We need to do everything we can to not have that story repeat itself.”
“I think that Harvard can be a really incredible place but also a really tough place to thrive,” he added. “I’d love to see Harvard continue building on the tools that it has so that everyone can thrive in this kind of environment, no matter where we come from.”
After graduating from the College, Elizondo interned for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. By then, his focus was already shifting to biotechnology, food, and entrepreneurship.
Elizondo was named the National Hispanic Institute’s Person of the Year in 2019 and recognized in the Forbes “30 Under 30” list at the age of 27, alongside several other awards honoring his entrepreneurial work.
If elected, Elizondo said he would commit to transparency around Harvard’s governing boards “as much as I’m allowed to.”
Still, Elizondo said he believes individuals have a “limited” ability to change the governing system and hopes to instead provide a “perspective from alumni and from people outside the ivory tower.”
“Ultimately, these are my views,” he said. “At the very least, I want to ensure that that voice is in the room so that when the administration is making decisions, that there’s a seat at that table, that there’s a voice in that room.”
Elizondo stressed the importance of maintaining Harvard’s role on the international stage.
“Our world is changing so quickly, and we can’t afford to be on the sidelines,” he said.
“I want Harvard to become a beacon of hope — be that example of what institutions can do to lead,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stephanie R. Khurana will serve as chief executive officer of Axim Collaborative, a new nonprofit launched by Harvard University and MIT, the organization announced in a press release Thursday morning.
Axim Collaborative, previously known as the Center for Reimagining Learning, is a nonprofit created by the two universities using proceeds from their sale of the jointly owned education platform edX. An online learning initiative started by Harvard and MIT in 2012, edX was sold to Maryland-based tech startup 2U, Inc. for $800 million in 2021.
Axim aims to make learning more accessible, effective, and engaging by building on edX’s “commitment to educational equity,” according to the press release. The nonprofit will focus initial efforts on supporting post-secondary education for underserved groups.
Khurana, who will assume her role on April 3, said in the release that she is “excited to take on this opportunity to help learners realize their educational and career aspirations.”
“We have unique potential using Axim’s resources and capabilities to catalyze efforts that will make a difference of a lifetime for so many people,” she said.
Khurana has served as managing partner and chief operating officer of the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation, a global venture philanthropy firm, and on the boards of several education equity organizations including Generation, Propel America, and Empower Schools.
Khurana served as faculty dean of Cabot House from 2010 to 2020 with her husband, Rakesh Khurana, who was appointed dean of the College in 2014. She has also been involved with several University-wide initiatives, including the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging and the Presidential PK-12 Task Force.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who will serve as co-chair of Axim’s board of trustees, said in the press release that he was “delighted” to have Khurana as the first CEO of Axim.
“With her years of dedication to advancing educational equity, along with experience in leveraging technology to promote access to higher education, Stephanie is the right person to work with the communities that share our vision to shape and implement the agenda for this exciting endeavor,” he said.
In addition to Garber, several other top Harvard administrators sit on Axim’s board, including Executive Vice President Meredith L. Weenick ’90, Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Bharat N. Anand ’88, and Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget Terry Long.
MIT Provost Cynthia Barnhart, who will also serve as a co-chair of Axim’s board, said in the release that Axim “will require collaboration with a diverse set of partner organizations” to pursue its mission.
“Stephanie is an ideal leader to build on the non-profit’s early work to understand how we can add value to a mature landscape of committed researchers and organizations,” Barnhart said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College admitted 3.41 percent of applicants to the Class of 2027, marking the second-lowest admissions rate in the College’s history.
The College’s Admissions Office notified 1,220 students of their acceptances in the regular decision cycle at 7 p.m. Thursday. The admitted students join 722 applicants accepted through the College’s early action program in December, totaling 1,942 admitted students from a pool of 56,937 applications.
This year’s acceptance rate reflects a slight increase from last year’s record-low acceptance rate of 3.19 percent, with a 7 percent decrease in the total number of applications from last year’s all-time high of 61,220 applicants.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview Thursday that he believes the Class of 2027, like every admitted class, is “unique.”
“Our admissions committee would say the proof in all this is the individuals we recruited, first of all — from around the country and around the world — and then ended up over a long period of time, admitting,” Fitzsimmons said.
“Now, of course, we hope they’ll choose to come here,” he added.
African American or Black students comprise 15.3 percent of applicants admitted to the Class of 2027, a decrease from 15.5 percent last year. The proportion of Latinx students admitted dropped to 11.3 percent from 12.6 percent in the year before. Just over 2 percent of admits are Native American, a drop from 2.9 percent last year. Native Hawaiian students made up 0.5 percent of accepted students this year, a drop from 0.8 percent last year.
Harvard admitted the highest ever proportion of Asian American applicants at 29.9 percent, marking a 2.1 percentage point increase from the 27.8 percent accepted to the Class of 2026.
“It’s been part of a long-term trend,” Fitzsimmons said. “The percentages have been going up steadily. It’s not a surprise.”
The uptick comes in advance of the Supreme Court’s decision on a lawsuit against Harvard brought by Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action group that claims the College’s race-conscious admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants.
Legal scholars widely expect the Court’s strong conservative majority to overturn affirmative action, with a decision expected in late spring or summer.
Students admitted to the Class of 2027 come from all 50 states and 102 countries. Roughly 22 percent of admits hail from the Mid-Atlantic, 17.4 percent from the South, 15.9 percent from New England, 17 percent from the Western/Mountain region, 10.1 percent from the Midwest, and 15.8 percent from U.S. territories and abroad.
After the U.S., the countries with the highest numbers of permanent residents admitted to the Class of 2027 include Canada with 44 admitted students, the United Kingdom with 24 students, and China with 16 students. The College also admitted 12 residents of Australia, 10 from Italy, eight residents each from Germany, Turkey, and India, and seven residents of Ukraine.
For the sixth consecutive year, women make up at least half of the admitted class. 53.6 percent of students identify as women, a decrease from 54.2 percent last year. 32 admitted students identify as nonbinary.
This year’s admitted class also includes 23 veterans, a jump from 18 veterans accepted last year, amid Harvard’s campaign to increase veteran recruitment. 43 students expressed interest in the ROTC program, a slight increase from 40 students in each of the last two admitted classes.
Roughly 28 percent of admitted students intend to concentrate within social sciences, 17.4 percent intend to concentrate in biological sciences, 16 percent in the humanities, 9.5 percent in engineering, 8.8 percent in Computer Science, 6.8 percent in the physical sciences, and 6.5 percent in math. The remaining students, around 6.7 percent of applicants, were undecided.
For the second year in a row, Harvard expanded its financial aid policy for low- and middle-income families. The cost to attend Harvard College will be free for families with annual incomes falling below $85,000, an increase from last year’s threshold of $75,000.
The College also announced that for the 2023-2024 academic year, the total cost of attendance would increase by 3.5 percent to $79,450 for students not receiving need-based financial aid.
The Admissions and Financial Aid office estimated that 55 percent of admits will qualify for need-based grants, reducing costs for families to $13,000 annually. An estimated 19 percent of accepted students qualified for Pell Grants, a decrease from 20.5 percent last year.
Fitzsimmons said that the changes to Harvard’s financial aid initiative were “revolutionary.”
“You cannot pick up the newspaper today without looking at people’s concern about inflation and all kinds of issues in the world,” Fitzsimmons said. “In that context, this is again, to me, part of a stunning revolution.”
This marks the College’s third test-optional admissions cycle, which allows students to apply without submitting standardized test scores. The Admissions Office lifted its testing requirement in June 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and announced in December 2021 that the policy will extend through applicants to the Class of 2030.
When asked about the future of Harvard’s test-optional policy, Fitzsimmons said it is “too early to tell.”
“We put it out there that we would be test-optional through the Class of 2030 and that seems realistic,” he added. “We continue to look at what’s been happening and we’ll have plenty of evidence to make a good decision when the time comes.”
The Class of 2027 will have the chance to explore campus during Visitas — the College’s annual admitted students weekend — from April 23 to 24. “In some ways, the opportunity they have to learn from each other even during the two days of Visitas will make the biggest difference in terms of whether or not they’ll come,” Fitzsimmons said.
Admitted students have until May 1 to accept or decline their offer to join the College’s Class of 2027.

A newcomer to Harvard’s governance scene, Luis A. Ubiñas ’85 is pledging steadfast support for University President-elect Claudine Gay and vowing to bring transparency back to the table.
Endorsed by the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, Ubiñas — a College and Harvard Business School graduate — is campaigning for a seat on the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body.
Chair of Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation and former president of the Ford Foundation, Ubiñas is a nonprofit leader focused on “advancing human opportunity.” He is also an advisor to the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships, serves on the Council on Foreign Relations, and previously worked as a senior partner at McKinsey.
For his work, Ubiñas has been honored by the National Council for La Raza, the NAACP, and the Business School’s Latino Alumni Association.
Ubiñas said his decision to campaign for a position on the Board of Overseers was driven by a desire to pay back a “debt of gratitude” owed to Harvard.
“Much of my life was driven by the fact that Harvard had enough faith in me to invest what to me seemed an imponderable amount of money back then,” he said. “So, when given the opportunity to give back to Harvard, when given the opportunity to to serve in almost any way, I say, ‘Yes.’”
Ubiñas said his family’s background motivates him to facilitate Gay’s transition into her new role. He added that he plans to “provide advice and counsel as needed” to the University’s first president of Afro-Caribbean descent.
“My parents also came to America. My parents also placed an incredibly high value in education, hard work, and the idea that I can be part of her journey, a part of a group of people who want to make the University successful and want to make its president successful, is really important to me right now,” he said.
Ubiñas also said it is important to support Gay to foster “sustained leadership.”
“My hope is that all of us — students, faculty, administrators, alumni — can enter her tenure with the hope and desire for providing her support so that she can make the most of her tenure and we can see her be there for 10 years or maybe even longer,” he said.
Ubiñas said he will commit to increased openness if elected to the Board of Overseers, adding that there is “nothing more clarifying than transparency.”
“I’m deeply personally committed to transparency,” he said.
“We know that transparency at the University and elsewhere — more transparency is typically better,” he added. “It is in disclosure and accountability that better decisions are made.”
Beyond the University’s administration, Ubiñas also said he hopes Harvard will be a forum for fostering “respectful and open” conversations with a wider range of voices.
“The University has a powerful place in our society as being the kind of place where people can meet — people who may even disagree can meet — and have the kind of civil dialogue that we collectively need to have,” he added.

University of California, Irvine Sociology professor Kristin Turney discussed the prevalence and implications of anticipatory stress among incarcerated individuals at a lecture hosted by the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies Thursday.
The lecture — titled “‘The Waiting Game’: The Pervasiveness and Proliferation of Anticipatory Stress During Jail Incarceration” — is part of the Social Demography Seminar series, which investigates the mutual impacts of various social factors and issues on population processes.
Turney began her talk by noting the prevalence and expansion of the United States incarceration system.
“As a result of the expansion of the criminal legal system over the past half century, approximately five percent of U.S. adults have spent time in prison,” Turney said.
Turney then outlined the known health effects of incarceration on individuals and their families.
Incarcerated people face stress that has “wide ranging deleterious repercussions” on both physical and mental well-being, Turney said. These individuals often experience “unsafe conditions, poor nutrition, and extreme punishment via solitary confinement,” circumstances that result in worse mental health, high rates of infectious disease, and early mortality.
“The stressor of prison incarceration proliferates to family members, impairing the health of children who are children of incarcerated people, romantic partners of incarcerated people, and parents of incarcerated people,” Turney said.
In addition to the adverse mental and physical effects of incarceration, the lecture also discussed its economic burdens.
“They endure economic instability that stems from reduced household income but also costs associated with incarceration — fines and fees, all sorts of costs,” she said. “They incur additional household responsibilities in their family member’s absence and so have to figure out how to fill the responsibilities left behind.”
Turney’s research also suggests that there may be another mechanism causing poor health outcomes among incarcerated individuals.
In collaboration with UC Irvine associate professor Naomi F. Sugie, Turney investigated the role and impact of anticipatory stress, defined as a concern about “conditions that do not yet exist — and may never exist — but are projected to occur sometime in the future.”
According to Turney, anticipatory stress explains a pathway through which “these earlier stages of criminal legal contact can damage health.”
In contextualizing her research, Turney emphasized the discparity between prison incarceration, in which an individual has already been convicted, versus jail incarceration, in which an individual is awaiting adjudication.
“Jail incarceration — and the corresponding questions about charges, adjudication, and sentencing — involves considerable uncertainty about when somebody’s going to be released,” Turney said.
For her research, Turney used interviews of 123 incarcerated individuals and their family members throughout different stages of the jail incarceration process. The study took place in Southern California with predominantly Latino males, their children’s mothers and caregivers, and their own mothers as subjects.
In presenting her findings, Turney discussed the primary causes of anticipatory stress within the individuals interviewed, the most prevalent one of which was the outcome of their adjudication.
“In terms of looking at men’s anticipatory stress, 71 percent of them brought up anticipatory stress about the adjudication of when they’re going to be released, if they’re going to get more charges, what their future is going to look like,” Turney said.
Other causes of anticipatory stress include anxiety over the status of relationships, the well-being of loved ones, and reintegration after release, according to Turney.
In describing individual interviews that were conducted with incarcerated individuals and their families, Turney categorized the cases into three broad categories: shared, emerging, and halted anticipatory stress. Turney defined shared anticipatory stress as stress that is held by both the family and the individual, emerging anticipatory stress as stress held by the family and not the individual, and halted anticipatory stress as stress held by the individual and not the family.
Turney elaborated on emerging anticipatory stress by discussing a causal factor.
“For the most part, men who don’t report anticipatory stress are those who commonly experienced cyclical incarceration — those who turned in and out of jail facilities for many years — suggesting that the accumulation of stressors allows men to adjust to the uncertainty the irrationality the powerlessness that goes along with incarceration,” Turney said.
Anticipatory stress, in which family members do not experience symptoms of stress, was often due to “weak or non-existent relationships with their incarcerated family member,” Turney said.
Turney concluded the lecture by discussing potential policy applications for anticipatory stress research, such as “more speedy and efficient trials” and eliminating “cash bail across the country.”
“It wouldn’t reduce all anticipatory stress because there still would be uncertainty about your sentence,” Turney said. “But it would reduce some other anticipatory stress because people would be with their families doing their quote, unquote, typical life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fiona Hill is not a fan of legacy admissions.
A first-generation college student who described her scholarship to attend graduate school at Harvard as “transformational,” Hill is making legacy admissions a cornerstone issue of her campaign for the Board of Overseers.
“I think most people are coming to that conclusion that it’s just untenable over the longer term,” Hill said. “It’s intrinsically unfair.”
Hill, who was born in Durham, England to a family that “always struggled with poverty,” received her undergraduate degree from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. She noted that legacy admissions is a distinctly American phenomenon.
“Universities around the world don’t do that,” Hill said. “Nobody would get any special positioning in Durham or in St. Andrews because of family ties.”
“Harvard is already addressing it to make sure that people who were already donors at the university cannot increase their donation if they’ve got a child who’s about to apply,” Hill added. “But that’s probably not sufficient.”
Hill graduated from Harvard in 1998 with a Ph.D. in history and a specialization in Russian and European affairs. At Harvard, she served as a resident tutor for Cabot House, where she met her future husband. Hill worked at the Brookings Institution before becoming a national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia, advising former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
Hill went on to serve in former President Donald Trump’s National Security Council, where she was the senior director for Europe and Russia. Hill left the White House in July 2019, later providing key testimony against Trump that led to his first impeachment by the House of Representatives.
Despite her extensive credentials, Hill says it is her personal experience she hopes will prove to be a valuable asset on the Board of Overseers.
“I think I’ve got a lot to bring to the table,” Hill said. “Coming from a forgotten, former industrial, semi-rural area — there’s a lot of overlap with people from across the United States who also come to Harvard.”
Hill, who was endorsed by the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, also said she supports the creation of an ethnic studies department.
“It’s kind of bizarre, in fact, that the University isn’t supporting that,” she said.
“It was a debate when I was at Harvard and I assumed that we were already moving along in this past decade since I’ve left,” Hill added. “I was really quite shocked to find that that still hasn’t been resolved.”
Hill also said she would use a seat on the Board of Overseers to advocate for making financial aid, student housing, and mental health support key priorities during Harvard’s next capital campaign.
“Ultimately, university is there for the students,” she said.
“I, myself, was really very grateful that a lot of that support was there when I was in graduate school,” Hill added. “But it wasn’t there for everyone.”

Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard called on Harvard Law School professor Jody L. Freeman to leave her position on the ConocoPhillips board of directors in an open letter published Tuesday.
Freeman, who founded the Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program and established the Law School’s first environmental law clinic, has served on the board of directors of ConocoPhillips for more than a decade and chairs ConocoPhillips’ Public Policy and Sustainability Committee.
In the letter, Divest Harvard criticized ConocoPhillips — the largest oil producer in Alaska — for “listening to the call of profit without regard for climate degradation,” referencing the company’s Willow Project, an $8 billion oil-drilling project in Alaska that is set to last 30 years. Recently approved by the Biden administration, the project shows that Freeman’s position of “helping reform ConocoPhillips from the inside” is not working, the letter says.
ConocoPhillips did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the letter’s criticisms.
The letter urged Freeman to “ask herself” whether she is being “used” by ConocoPhillips and if the company is “co-opting” her “respect and legitimacy” rather than paying for her expertise.
Divest Harvard acknowledged Freeman’s “important climate work” in the letter and called on her to “not continue to grant legitimacy to ConocoPhillips by sitting on their board of directors” and honor her climate commitments over “an industry whose influence on academia and on the world has been nothing but toxic.”
In an emailed comment to The Crimson, Freeman wrote that she believes her involvement at ConocoPhillips “remains positive.”
“I share the goal of moving the world to a low carbon future as fast as possible and forcefully addressing the enormous challenges posed by climate change,” Freeman wrote. “There are many ways to make a difference, and activism is very important.” she wrote.
“I have chosen to engage in several ways, including by being an independent director on the board of ConocoPhillips to help advance the transition to a low-carbon economy, and think my involvement there remains positive,” Freeman added.
Phoebe G. Barr ’23-’24, an organizer at Divest Harvard, said Freeman’s position at ConocoPhillips and her position at Harvard are incompatible.
“Jody Freeman currently takes $350,000 a year from ConocoPhillips, and this gives her a fiduciary responsibility to that company,” Barr said, citing a salary figure from the company’s 2019 proxy statement. “She also holds a position at Harvard of a top climate adviser and environmental law professor, which gives her a responsibility towards Harvard and towards the climate commitments of Harvard, and we believe that these two responsibilities are not compatible.”
Still, Barr said Divest Harvard’s goal is not to place blame on Freeman.
“Our aim is certainly not to place all of the blame for a pervasive issue onto a single individual,” Barr said. “But we do believe that individuals, especially individuals at very powerful institutions like Harvard, have the power to make very strong statements with their actions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Current and former members of the Harvard Institute of Politics Student Advisory Committee praised “the stable pick” of Setti D. Warren as the permanent IOP director, adding they are pleased the appointment stayed within the IOP.
Warren’s appointment to the permanent role was announced Wednesday, concluding a national search that narrowed to four finalists earlier this month. Student interviewers had viewed Warren as a viable candidate prior to his selection, though he was not their top choice.
“I trust the Dean’s decision,” said IOP Communications Director Ethan C. Kelly ’25. “If the Dean thought Setti was the right choice, then I believe he is the right choice.”
Warren — the former mayor of Newton, Massachusetts — joined the IOP in 2021 as its executive director and became its interim director in July 2022 after the unexpected departure of former IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78.
Former IOP Vice President Tabitha L. Escalante ’23 wrote in a statement she is “thankful that the IOP will not undergo another senior staff transition,” with Warren staying in the top role. Members of the Student Advisory Committee said they were also pleased with the decision to keep the appointment in-house.
“Having a director with already a year’s experience means he knows how to hit the ground running,” Kelly said.
“With any organization, with any company, with any entity, picking someone internal by nature is more of a seamless transition,” said Robert Fogel ’25, one of the JFK Jr. Forum Committee co-chairs.
The sense of relief among current and former IOP student leadership comes after a series of staff changes in recent years.
“It’s gonna be a strong start in leadership at the IOP. There have been some issues with turnover in the past,” current IOP Vice President Pratyush Mallick ’25 said.
“There probably doesn’t need to be a transition because Setti is already interim director,” Fogel added.
Current student leaders also said Warren was a “pretty good choice” and the IOP will not experience “infrastructure change” as a result of his appointment.
Former Student Advisory Committee members, however, are conflicted about whether Warren will be able to help the IOP reach its full potential.
“It’s not really bringing anything new to the IOP because, not only was he just interim director, he was executive director,” former Student Advisory Committee member Luis F. Esteva Sueiro ’24 said.
“I am confident that his meaningful collaboration with students can allow the Institute to successfully grow and flourish,” former IOP Vice President Escalante said, referring to Warren.
Esteva Sueiro said that selecting a director “jumping on MSNBC every now and then,” rather than Warren, would have disadvantaged students.
“If we got a David Axelrod to the IOP, how much time would he have for students, and how much time would he have to truthfully engage with student programming?” Esteva Sueiro asked, referencing the former University of Chicago Institute of Politics director.
“Setti is an IOP guy for sure; the IOP is Setti’s thing,” Esteva Sueiro added.
IOP spokesperson Lauren Miller wrote the Institute’s staff are “excited to continue working under Setti’s strong and capable leadership to inspire students’ lives in politics and public service.”
The current Student Advisory Committee looks forward to further collaboration with Warren, who has been “super receptive to student feedback,” according to Mallick, and is overall supportive of Elmendorf’s decision.
“I’m excited. I think that a lot of students have been able to have good working relationships with him over the past year,” Kelly said.
“Setti is amazing,” Fogel said. “We’re really happy to get to continue working with him.”

Jenner and Block, the New York-based law firm investigating Harvard’s women’s ice hockey program in light of allegations of abuse against the program and its head coach, aims to complete its review by the end of April, according to a former team member.
The investigation comes amid accusations that head coach Katey Stone fostered a toxic environment on the team, including making disparaging comments to players and other coaches, downplaying injuries, and displaying insensitivity to mental health issues. The allegations — published in the Athletic and the Boston Globe — date back more than 20 years.
The review — which was announced by Harvard Athletic Director Erin McDermott on March 14 — will be the eighth surrounding Harvard Athletics in the last seven years.
Abra A. Kinkopf ’06, a former Harvard women’s ice hockey player on the 2002-03 team, said Jenner and Block told her during a March 25 phone call that the firm hopes to make the review process efficient.
“They said that they were going to try to make it as swift as possible, and they were hoping it would be end of April,” Kinkopf said.
Kinkopf said there was uncertainty around the timeline, and she was told “it could extend further” or conclude earlier than expected.
Jenner and Block did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the investigation is expected to end “by the end of the academic year.” The last day of spring term classes for the College is April 26, and the final exam period for 2023 lasts from May 4 to May 13.
Two current women’s ice hockey players said they had not been informed of the investigation’s timeline by Jenner and Block or Harvard Athletics.
Kinkopf said Jenner and Block has offered to connect review participants — including former players — to mental health resources. Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Service has also offered support to current team members, according to a Harvard spokesperson.
While any individual with knowledge of the situation can share comments with Jenner and Block, Kinkopf said that, according to her phone call with the firm, the investigators will not be actively reaching out to alumni or current players.
“They will talk to anyone, but they’re not going to seek out people of note,” she said. “They’re also not going to dig for information. And they are very clear they cannot force any students or athletes to speak.”
Kinkopf said lawyers from Jenner and Block made it clear during the call that “they represent the school, they don’t represent people.”
“Their job is to publish recommendations for the school,” she said. “So the recommendations they publish will belong to Harvard, and Harvard can then choose whether or not it wants to make it public.”
On March 24, the Athletic reported that top freshman defender Jade A. Arnone ’26 had entered the transfer portal, and associate head coach Lee-J Mirasolo had taken a leave of absence. The Globe investigation reported that 14 players have left Stone’s team since 2016.
Kinkopf questioned why Stone is permitted to remain in her role as the investigation takes place.
“One of my concerns with the investigation is that Katey Stone’s still on campus,” she added.
Dane declined to comment on criticisms of the ongoing review.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Student Wellbeing Council launched the first Harvard Wellbeing Week with a series of events focused on student mental health last week.
The events included movie nights, a knitting session, physical wellness and stress-management workshops, and small-group conversations such as one titled, “Introverts in an Extroverted World.”
The weeklong programming stems from recommendations from a 2020 report released by a student mental health task force that Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 assembled in 2019. Student Wellbeing Council Chair Annie E. Kim, a master’s student in Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, wrote in an email that she hopes Harvard Wellbeing Week will become an annual program.
“We know that this year’s wellbeing week was a bit of a surprise for most students because we didn’t have much time to plan it,” Kim wrote. “We wanted to do something earlier rather than later.”
Harvard Wellbeing Week aimed to inform students about the University’s existing resources and teach them about the different aspects of mental health listed in Harvard University Health Services’ wellbeing framework: relational, emotional, financial, spiritual, environmental, intellectual, vocational, and physical.
Kim said some students may not be aware of the resources provided by different departments at Harvard.
“It’s hard to filter through some of the information that we’re getting,” Kim said in an interview.
The events were held in collaboration with different school programs and resources to maximize student engagement, according to Kim.
“One thing we innovated was the partnership with CrimZone (which is usually for athletic events) to promote some select wellbeing week events in the app so that students could ‘check-in’ and earn points towards the swag store,” Kim wrote. “It’s also a great way to track student engagement in our programming.”
Kim wrote the Student Wellbeing Council will also send out a survey asking students for feedback regarding the inaugural event. She added that the organization hopes to create formal feedback mechanisms for students who use the University’s other mental health resources, such as Counseling and Mental Health Service and TimelyCare, a new telehealth counseling platform.
Though not every event was been packed with students, Kim said they offered opportunities for students from different schools to connect with each other.
“Attendance probably isn’t always as high as we want,” Kim said. “But I think those who do attend seem very engaged and very thankful for that.”
As the Council continues to plan more University-wide programs, Kim wishes to support the increasing demand for counseling and other mental health services among students.
“These years are a really vulnerable time for us as students. It is particularly worse in high performance environments like ours,” Kim wrote. “We hope that we can address wellbeing as something students can incorporate in their daily lives to help us thrive and build resilience in what seems like increasingly turbulent times before things seem hopeless.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Supreme Court on the brink of upending affirmative action, Harvard Board of Overseers candidate Vanessa W. Liu ’96 said she intends to focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion if elected to serve on the University’s second-highest governing body.
Liu said she is prepared to help Harvard navigate the consequences of the potential end to the practice of race-conscious college admissions. Equally important, Liu said, is improving the diversity of the University’s faculty.
“That’s certainly what a lot of students are looking for and demanding,” Liu said. “Being able to say, ‘Hey, when it comes to faculty appointments, can we have more transparency around that? Can we have an overview of what the pipeline looks like?’”
“I think that’s also going to be just as important,” she added.
Liu was raised in New York City’s Financial District and attended Stuyvesant High School before enrolling at Harvard College, where she was a resident of Dunster House. After college, Liu obtained a degree from Harvard Law School and spent over a decade working as an associate principal from McKinsey & Company.
In 2005, Liu began working as an alumni interviewer for Harvard. She deepened her ties to the University in 2014 after she was selected to join the Harvard Alumni Association’s board as an elected director. Liu rose through the HAA ranks over the years, becoming president of the organization from July 2021 to June 2022.
Speaking to The Crimson from a cafe just blocks from where she grew up, Liu said she sometimes pinches herself when thinking about her life trajectory. Despite her long track record of service to the University, Liu said her friends from college would never have imagined that she would become this deeply involved with Harvard as an alumna.
“I wasn’t singing Harvard from the rooftops like many people were,” Liu said. “But it’s only afterwards that I’ve just realized that that gave me a path in life that was incredible, and I’m thankful for it.”
Endorsed by alumni advocacy group Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, Liu said she would be a “fervent supporter” of creating an ethnic studies department at Harvard if elected to the Board of Overseers.
While Liu said she is optimistic Harvard will establish an ethnic studies department under the tenure of President-elect Claudine Gay, she noted that it will require administrative and faculty support, as well as financial resources.
“I would very much hope that the Board of Overseers is going to be working with President-elect Dean Gay to basically say what is it that’s needed for that path, and to make sure that’s something that everybody gets a chance to weigh in on,” Liu said.
Liu also said that she believes that her experience as president of HAA will prove valuable as the University gears up for its next capital campaign.
“Most people, probably — you can never say everybody — is proud of the fact that they went to Harvard and also feel very strongly that Harvard should remain a very strong institution,” Liu said. “Being able to drive towards that to say, ‘Hey, we can rally and think about ways that we can ensure the future success of Harvard,’ is something that I’ve been able to talk a lot to alumni about.”

In 2009, Board of Overseers candidate Robert L. Satcher, Jr. boarded the space shuttle Atlantis on a 10-day mission to the International Space Station, becoming the first orthopedic surgeon in space.
From 2004 to 2011, astronaut-physician Satcher worked for NASA, logging more than 259 hours in space.
Today, Satcher works as a physician and associate professor of orthopedic oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. He earned his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1994 after receiving his bachelor’s and Ph.D. in chemical engineering from MIT in 1986 and 1993, respectively.
Satcher’s interest in joining the Board of Overseers stems from the “convergence” of issues that he claims currently face Harvard, including climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion, recent changes in leadership, and Harvard’s role in shaping higher education at large.
In terms of pushing Harvard to prioritize climate change, Satcher cited his background in chemical engineering and as an astronaut who had seen Earth from space.
“My commitment to the stewardship of the earth, of course, stems from the privilege that I had of being an astronaut and being able to see the Earth from space and from orbit and knowing what a precious resource it is for us that we have to work together to preserve,” he said.
Satcher said he is also committed to continuing Harvard’s efforts in educating the next generation of leaders and ensuring equitable representation.
During his time at HMS, Satcher said he had noticed that the faculty, relative to the student body, was significantly less diverse. To address this issue, Satcher worked with three other M.D.-Ph.D. students to write a white paper examining faculty diversity for then-Medical School Dean Daniel C. Tosteson.
“[The report] was instrumental in moving forward and establishing the Office of Diversity, which still is there and I think has done a great job in terms of keeping that issue appropriately in the forefront of considerations in terms of faculty hires at Harvard Medical School,” he said.
Satcher noted his efforts towards the establishment of what is now the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Partnership as one legacy he is “most proud of” leaving behind at Harvard.
Upon graduating from HMS, Satcher has continued to stay involved with the University as an alumni, giving talks at various alumni-sponsored events. Most recently, Satcher was chosen to speak at the Harvard Medical and Dental School’s 2020 virtual Class Day ceremonies.
“Coming back and talking to the graduates and being in that role was a pretty special experience,” Satcher said. “It was right in the midst of Covid.”
He noted that the pandemic backdrop brought even more attention to Harvard students and their leadership, particularly as graduating medical students prepared to enter the crisis-stricken health care workforce.
Having served in numerous roles at Harvard, even including as a former proctor in Pennypacker Hall, Satcher said he feels a commitment to contribute to Harvard as part of the Board of Overseers because of how transformative his experience had been.
“It’s not only the education,” Satcher said. “It’s just the thinking beyond and outside of traditional boundaries. It’s such a collection of fantastic people, doing things that you may not have ever thought or thought to do or thought to be possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvey A. Silverglate, a 1967 Harvard Law School graduate, is staging an outsider campaign for election to the Board of Overseers. His mission? Fewer administrators, more academic freedom.
Despite not being tapped by the Harvard Alumni Association as one of eight candidates to the official ballot, Silverglate staged an outsider campaign to appear on this year’s ballot.
Candidates who are not selected by the HAA can still join through a petition campaign if they receive signatures from 1 percent of the number of eligible voters in the previous year’s election by Feb. 1. In 2009, Silverglate gained enough signatures but ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Board of Overseers.
This year, Silverglate did not receive the 3,000 signatures needed to appear on the ballot. Instead, he continues his bid with a write-in campaign.
Since graduating from HLS, Silverglate has worked in criminal defense, civil liberties, and academic freedom and students’ rights cases and currently practices in an “of counsel” capacity at Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein LLP, a Boston-based law firm whose current and former clients include embattled professor John L. Comaroff, CS50 students accused of cheating, and the Fly Club.
When he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1967, Silverglate said there were “very few” administrators. He added it is “outrageous” that there are now more administrators than faculty members at Harvard.
“If you got rid of 90 percent of the administrators, which is what I’d like to do, you make college more affordable,” Silverglate said. “And more people can go without having to worry about getting scholarships, which are relatively scarce, although Harvard has more scholarships than most institutions because of its wealth.”
“It would generally improve the academic climate because you would have people who would be prepared to state their real views about things,” he added. “You would get rid of speech codes, which are the brainchild of administrators.”
Silverglate believes that Harvard currently lacks a focus on academics, and instead prioritizes “not getting in trouble.”
Silverglate’s first major case as a lawyer was representing 200 Harvard students charged with rioting in an anti-Vietnam war demonstration in 1969. The jury acquitted the charges.
“My first impression of academic administrators was that they were enemies of true teaching and true scholarship,” Silverglate said.
After publishing a book on universities censoring speech that he believes should have been protected, Silverglate said many faculty and students around the country reached out to him for help.
“We started a nonprofit to deal with it,” Silverglate said, referring to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
Since the 1980s, Silverglate has held law tables at Dunster House once a semester. In 1985, he taught a class at the Law School and was offered a tenure-track position. Silverglate declined the offer because he saw that Harvard was “increasingly run by the bureaucrats.”
“​​Somebody has to say something to an audience that matters,” Silverglate said. “I’m prepared to do it because I don’t want to be invited to anybody’s cocktail parties. I’m not worried about being socially ostracized. I don’t go to parties anyway.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Anthropology professor and former Department Chair Ajantha Subramanian will leave Cambridge to teach at the City University of New York, citing a lack of support from Harvard’s administration in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against three Anthropology professors.
Subramanian was on temporary leave as chair when The Crimson reported in May 2020 that Anthropology professors John L. Comaroff, Theodore C. Bestor, and Gary Urton were facing complaints of sexual misconduct, including some levied by graduate students.
She announced last month in a tweet that she would leave Harvard for the CUNY Graduate Center. She confirmed in emails to The Crimson that she will start as a full professor on July 1, 2023.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson Wednesday, Subramanian wrote that “a major push factor” for her decision to leave Harvard was the “delayed administrative response to faculty losses in Anthropology.”
“This lack of adequate support seems directly related to the tumult in our department caused by faculty misconduct leading to three publicly disclosed Title IX complaints,” she wrote.
Subramanian also wrote that graduate students’ experiences in the Anthropology Department was “Exhibit A of the failure of Title IX at Harvard.”
“These experiences suggest that Harvard’s primary concern is to avoid litigation, especially by faculty,” Subramanian wrote. “This predisposes the institution to protect the rights of the accused over those of accusers.”
“The way the policy is administered generated distrust and hostility within our department and forced student complainants to upend their education, and possibly curtail their careers,” she added. “Instead of taking our experience as evidence of a deeply flawed system, the university has focused on containing the damage.”
In her statement, Subramanian took particular aim at Social Sciences Dean Lawrence D. Bobo, writing he was “neither encouraging nor supportive” of an internal Anthropology Department review launched in response to The Crimson’s reporting, instead telling department leaders to “‘calm things down.’”
“Apart from paying for a communications consultant, the social science dean essentially left us to manage the fallout on our own,” Subramanian wrote.
“The takeaway for me is this: Harvard is unwilling to help departments that try to address inequities and abuses of power meaningfully,” she added.
In an emailed statement, Bobo said he could not comment on private conversations with individual professors and that his success as dean is contingent on working with “vital and productive” faculty and departments.
“For me, that means assuring that each unit under my supervision has the resources and tools necessary for excellence in their research and teaching mission,” Bobo wrote. “It also means assuring that each unit lives as fully as we are able into a shared commitment to maintaining a Harvard community that is equitable, diverse, and inclusive.”
“Over the last several years our Anthropology department has faced challenging issues, which have spurred important conversations within the department and across the FAS,” he added. “I think meaningful change and progress has taken place in recent months, but much work remains to be done.”
History and African and African American Studies professor Vincent A. Brown, Subramanian’s husband, wrote in a Wednesday email that he had no plans to leave Harvard “in the immediate future.”
In The Crimson’s May 2020 investigation that reported allegations against the three Anthropology professors, Subramanian and the interim Department chair, Rowan K. Flad, wrote a lengthy statement where they reiterated their dedication to diversifying the department and responding to student complaints.
The committee tasked with conducting the internal department review released its report in July 2021, more than a year after the initial Crimson investigation. The report recommended sweeping reforms, including a departmental code of conduct, external reviews of allegations against senior faculty, and third-party arbitration for misconduct cases.
Subramanian said Wednesday that the internal review received resistance from “a subset of senior male anthropology faculty who preferred to see sexual misconduct as an isolated problem unconnected to a larger department culture.”
“Their actions prioritized protecting the department’s reputation and their own authority rather than addressing deeply problematic gender dynamics,” she added.
The current Anthropology Department chair, Matthew J. Liebmann, declined to comment.
In February 2022, 38 faculty members wrote a letter to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay questioning the sanctions Gay — now Harvard’s president-elect — imposed on Comaroff in January 2022. Subramanian and Brown were two of 73 faculty to respond in opposition. Soon after, 35 of the 38 faculty members retracted their signatures.
When three female Anthropology graduate students filed a lawsuit against Harvard alleging the school mishandled years of sexual harassment and professional retaliation complaints against Comaroff, Subramanian was among 15 tenured Anthropology professors who signed a letter asking the embattled African and African American Studies and Anthropology professor to resign.
This semester has seen a surge of campus activism against Harvard and Comaroff, including a walkout, an email campaign, a march, and most recently, a sit-in at University Hall on Wednesday.
In her statement, Subramanian wrote that Harvard’s focus on “containing the damage” fueled the recent wave of campus activism, and she called for a reevaluation of the school’s Title IX policies and procedures.
“Only a serious and far-reaching review of Harvard’s Title IX policy, and especially its practical implementation, will prevent this kind of crisis from recurring,” she wrote.
Subramanian also said that in the wake of The Crimson’s reporting, Harvard administrators failed to provide adequate support to Anthropology faculty.
She wrote that when asked for what she would like in a retention offer, she asked Bobo, the Social Sciences dean, “for enough faculty lines to improve working conditions” to help remove the burden on other Anthropology faculty as their colleagues left.
“Although one search was authorized this year, this is totally inadequate,” Subramanian wrote. “I am not convinced that the university is committed to rebuilding Anthropology.”
Subramanian wrote that her interests “are wonderfully aligned with the strengths of the CUNY Graduate Center’s Anthropology faculty.”
“The Graduate Center is more amenable to research and teaching than Harvard, which imposes a heavy administrative burden,” Subramanian wrote.
She will be teaching and serving as a Ph.D. adviser at CUNY and said she will likely be affiliated with CUNY’s Center for Place, Culture, and Politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeffrey D. Dunn ’77 said he would bring an “insider’s and outsider’s” perspective if elected to the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, and stressed the importance of working to protect democracy amid global upheaval.
A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business School, Dunn said the University must work to produce the next generation of leaders to navigate the moral challenges posed by what he sees as growing threats to democracy and the rapid development of technology.
President and CEO of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Dunn formerly served as the executive chair, president, and CEO of Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that produces Sesame Street. During his time with the nonprofit, Dunn earned 38 Emmy awards, a Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award, and the MacArthur Foundation’s inaugural $100 million change grant.
Previously, Dunn was also president and CEO of HiT Entertainment, president of Nickelodeon Film & Enterprises, and COO of the Nickelodeon Networks Group.
At the University, Dunn has been a member of the Harvard Student Agencies board, a Harvard Advanced Leadership fellow, and an executive in residence at the Graduate School of Education.
For Dunn, the most critical challenges facing the University are the rise of authoritarianism, the threat to democracy driven by income inequality, and rapid technological change.
“Globalization and computers have upended industries and the livelihoods of large numbers of people, and the result has been a dramatic rise in income inequality, which has fueled populism and authoritarianism,” he said. “Polls now show that democracy and capitalism are now both vulnerable.”
Dunn said he hopes Harvard will “lead the education sector” through this “profound change.”
“People often take their cues from Harvard. Leading universities drive what happens below them because they admit students and so the feeder system below them reacts to what they think those universities value,” he added. “Harvard has a very significant role to play in setting the educational agenda for the country.”
“Every school at Harvard is going to need to prepare its graduates for a much more demanding and complex future leadership role than today,” he added.
Dunn said if elected to the Board of Overseers, he is “strongly in favor of the most transparent leadership.”
“I’m all for transparency,” he said. “I believe in transparency.”
To Dunn, though, the responsibility for transparency extends beyond the University’s governing boards.
“The Board of Overseers is not a governing board; they don’t make decisions,” he said. “It’s really the leaders’ job, the Harvard administration’s job to be transparent. I would counsel them and advise them to do that.”
Dunn said he hopes the Board of Overseers will act as a “conscience” for University leadership.
“I don’t come to this with an agenda or politics,” he said. “I would hope the Overseers would put aside any personal agendas and listen thoughtfully to everybody and to the broader alumni community and help the leadership of Harvard arrive at the best decisions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee kicked off its annual Israeli Apartheid Week on Sunday, which includes a slate of events around Palestine and an art installation that received criticism from some Jewish campus organizations.
The Committee organized seven events for the week, including panels that highlighted student activism, experiences of LGBTQ+ Palestinians, and South African-Palestinian and Kurdish-Palestinian solidarity. The final organized event of the week is a Sunday drag performance by Egyptian-Canadian artist Halal Bae.
The PSC, described on its website as an organization “dedicated to supporting the Palestinian struggle for self-determination, justice, and equality through raising awareness, advocacy, and non-violent resistance,” hosts the programs as part of the international Israeli Apartheid Week movement that began in 2005.
Like previous years, several of the Committee’s events centered on intersectionality. Dalal Hassane ’26, a PSC organizer, said these sessions were important for recognizing both parallels and tensions between different groups.
“I think, like with any other group, it’s very important to highlight the significance and impact of solidarity between Palestinians and other occupied groups around the world,” Hassane said.
A Thursday conversation titled “South African Palestinian Solidarity” featured Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions co-founder Omar Bargouti and drew parallels between the apartheid in South Africa and its “modern counterpart in Israel,” according to the PSC’s Instagram.
On Tuesday, the Committee hosted a panel on student activism with guest speakers from the University of Chicago and the University of California, Berkeley, who discussed the climate around pro-Palestine activism on their respective campuses.
Nadine S. Bahour ’22, who moderated the panel, said Tuesday that the Israeli-Palestinian geopolitical conflict is relevant to other global social issues.
“Every single topic that you can think of, Palestine, it’s happening there, because it’s a full country with people that have all the same problems that everyone else has,” she said. “I think that’s why it applies to everywhere.”
As part of the week, the Committee also installed a mock apartheid wall composed of a series of painted panels, with one reading, “There is no zionist state without racism colonialism ethnic cleansing.” Another reads, “Veritas? Harvard upholds apartheid. We are all complicit.”
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo declined to comment on the PSC’s installation.
The wall, installed in Science Center Plaza, is intended to serve as a reminder that “freedom from state violence and oppression is a universal struggle,” according to a post on the PSC’s Instagram.
On Monday, Harvard Hillel Israel Chair Daniel O. Denenberg ’26, Hillel Intern for Combating Antisemitism Sabrina P. Goldfischer ’23, and Hillel President and Crimson Editorial editor Jacob M. Miller ’25 wrote in an email to Hillel affiliates that they found the wall “offensive.”
“We’re emailing you because in previous years this wall has been a talking point for much of Harvard’s Jewish community. For some Jews, it has also been painful and offensive,” they wrote. “However much you care, Israel is the world’s only Jewish state. It is our historic homeland. It has held together our people and shaped our culture and practice for eighty generations.”
“We therefore unambiguously reject the PSC’s characterization of Zionism as racist or colonialist,” they added.
The statement specifically criticized one panel of the wall “featuring black and white imagery” that they called “reminiscent of the Holocaust concentration camps for many last year.”
Some members of Hillel, Harvard Chabad, and Harvard Israel Initiative stood in Science Center Plaza and Harvard Yard to provide Jewish student perspectives on the installation to passersby.
Sarah Bolnick ’23, co-president of Harvard Israel Initiative, acknowledged the intention behind the installation, but said she considers it “a form of hate speech.”
“It’s supposed to be beautiful and symbolic, but I think if you look at it, it really is very offensive and aggressive,” Bolnick said.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson Thursday, Miller said Hillel encourages dialogue between different views but criticized the PSC’s rhetoric.
“At Harvard Hillel we welcome a variety of views on Israel and believe that dialogue and debate are vital when discussing such a complex issue,” Miller said. “But ridding our discussions of substance and throwing around inaccurate buzzwords to describe a complicated situation is counterproductive and immature.”
Hassane said those who find the wall offensive should reflect on the installation from a Palestinian perspective.
“This is an art installation that’s supposed to represent the apartheid wall that currently stands in Palestine,” Hassane said. “I think that they need to ask themselves, ‘How does this wall affect Palestinians? How does this wall affect the people that it was built to oppress?’”
“I think that it’s just very important for us to recognize, to listen to the voices of Palestinian people. Not only the voices coming from Palestine, but the voices of Palestinians on campus,” she added. “They’re often overshadowed. They’re often silenced.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge residents advocated against staff cuts in the budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year at a Cambridge Public Schools meeting Thursday evening.
The current budget details the district’s plan to cut nearly 30 education interventionists and paraprofessionals, who currently work within CPS schools to provide additional academic support to students. These positions were funded using federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund grants, established in 2020 to support school districts during the Covid-19 pandemic.
But as the funding is set to expire on September 23, 2024, superintendent Victoria L. Greer said in a Tuesday meeting that the positions must be cut to avoid “a funding cliff.”
“The goal of the plan all along had not been to continue these positions past two years,” Greer said. “The idea was to help students kind of get back on track, help the schools recover.”
Tina T. Lieu — a CPS parent and part of the leadership team of Cambridge Families of Asian Descent — sent out a group letter on behalf of anti-racist activist group North Cambridge Courageous Conversations last week to raise parent voices in opposition to the staffing cuts.
“There wasn’t enough time in the budget as it was scheduled for meaningful outreach and comment by the broader community,” Lieu said in an interview. “It’s almost like going to the dress rehearsal for the play and saying, no, no, I want to cut off that act.”
After a discussion with Greer and the School Committee budget chairs, Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui announced in Tuesday’s meeting that the subsequent meeting would be reframed as an opportunity for more Cambridge residents to voice their opinions on the new budget.
“We reframed it from a budget workshop to being public comment and another opportunity for folks to weigh in,” Siddiqui said.
On Thursday evening, 15 Cambridge residents came before the School Committee to raise their concerns about the current budget.
Dan Monahan, president of the Cambridge Education Association, said at the Thursday meeting that temporary positions created during the pandemic became “integral” to the operations and support systems of CPS schools.
“What data besides dollars is being used to make the decision to remove these positions?” Monahan addressed the School Committee members in his public comments. “Does the evidence show that they’ve not been effective?”
During the meeting, CPS parents raised concerns over discrepancy in budget allocation between Kennedy-Longfellow School and other CPS elementary schools.
The current proposal allocates a lower budget and fewer resources for Kennedy-Longfellow School in the upcoming fiscal year, including reduction of two classrooms and 4 staff members. The general fund is reduced by approximately $220,000 compared to the current year.
A document responding to the reduction concerns on the CPS website states that budget allocation should be compared on a “per student basis.” Kennedy-Longfellow School will receive “the highest per student funding,” reflecting the “highest percentage of high needs students” in the district, according to the document.
Maritza Soto, a CPS parent, said the district needs to provide more “transparency on how the disparity in per pupil spending is justified.”
Pointing to the lowest professional development and close to lowest school improvement allocation, Soto said the figures “don’t reflect the level of support required” by Kennedy-Longfellow School, which parents said has a greater proportion of high-need students.
“CPS is setting these children up to fail,” Soto said.
Another CPS parent, Adam Zeller, said his daughter has “grown an unbelievable amount academically” with support from Kennedy-Longfellow School. The school, however, is facing low performance in MCAS exams, low student attendance, and the highest percentage of chronically absent kids in the district, Zeller said.
“It will only make these problems, which are already more pronounced than other schools in the district, even worse,” Zeller added. “Ke-Lo needs more support, not less.”
School Committee member David J. Weinstein said the current budget process allows everyone to bring forward recommendations but acknowledged the difficulty in increasing awareness about the budget among concerned residents.
“I think something didn’t happen the way maybe it should, that we’re hearing this now, and not earlier in the process,” he said. “I want to make sure that we’re doing this in a way that does meet our equity goals.”
Cambridge residents expressed concerns regarding overall transparency of the budget approval process. While Monahan said he appreciates additional meetings and the timeline extension, he believes that CPS parents are “stuck in a zero-sum game.”
“Once it’s public, you are told if you add something, you have to take something else away,” Monahan said. “The status quo needs disrupting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams competed in the NCAA Championships in Durham, N.C. this past weekend.
The women’s team sent six fencers to the championships: senior Elizabeth Tartakovsky (sabre), first-year Zoe Kim (sabre), sophomore Lauren Scruggs (foil), sophomore Ever Marinelli (foil), sophomore Emily Vermeule (epee), and first-year Faith Park (epee).
Tartajovsky, the reigning women's sabre 2022 NCAA national champion, headed into her third tournament looking to continue her dominance. This was Kim, Marinelli, and Park’s first NCAA appearance, while Vermeule and Scruggs were headed into their second career NCAA performance.
After last year’s second-place finish, the Crimson looked to come back and demonstrate its improvement throughout this season. Coming off of a fantastic season with an impressive 19 wins, the second-most in program history, Harvard had immense momentum going into the weekend.
After day three of the competition, the Crimson stood in fifth place with notable contributions from Scruggs, Tartakovsky, and Vermeule.
By the end of the competition, the Crimson walked away with a fourth-place finish, along with strong individual performances from Scruggs, Tartakovsky, and Vermeule.
Scruggs was crowned champion after a stunning win against Princeton's May Tieu in the finals. Pulling away early, Scruggs never looked back and secured the win. She is the first women’s foilist to bring home the gold medal since 2014.
Tartakovsky also brought her all, advancing to the finals after completing a comeback win against Maggie Shealy of Brandeis University in the semifinals. Ultimately, Tartakovsky fell just short of first place in a competitive bout against Columbia's Nora Burke during the finals with a score of 15-13.
At the end of the competition, Vermeule tied for third in women’s epee round-robins, Marinelli finished tenth in the women's foil round-robins, Kim placed eleventh in the women's sabre round-robins, and Park took sixth place in the women’s epee round-robins.
The men’s team sent four fencers: sophomore James Chen (foil), senior Kenji Bravo (foil), junior Jonas Hansen (epee), and first-year Ark Ma (epee).
Chen, Bravo, and Hansen have all appeared at the NCAA championships previously, garnering a bronze medal, eleventh-place finish, and ninth-place finish, respectively. This year’s championship marks a milestone in Ma’s career as his first tournament appearance.
At last year’s championships, the men’s team finished in second place with key contributions from Chen, who tied for third overall, along with Hansen and Bravo who finished ninth and eleventh, respectively.
Junior captain, Hansen, went into the weekend with First-Team All-Ivy League honors, as well as men’s epee Northeast Regional champion.
Hansen did not stop there. While encountering some close bouts throughout the weekend, the Cambridge, Mass. native emerged victorious, earning the title of men’s epee national champion.
“Coming into this year’s NCAA Championship felt much less stressful, bringing our experience from last year and from traveling to compete at the Air Force Academy earlier in the season," Hansen commented. “Personally, I felt that this made for a more enjoyable experience, both in terms of fencing and for the overall trip.”
After finishing in third place after the fifth round of the tournament, Hansen earned a place in the semifinals which took place on March 24th. Matching up against Columbia rival Teddy Lombardo, Hansen had his work cut out for him.
“Having both trained with and competed against Teddy for the past ten years, it was almost poetic that we should meet up in the NCAA semifinals,” Hansen explained. “He is an incredible fencer, and I have come to develop such a strong respect for him, both on and off the fencing strip.”
“I have found it incredibly rewarding in fencing to find that intense competition and friendship often go hand in hand — a kind of friendly rivalry that allows for great a sense of community in an otherwise individualistic sport,” the captain continued.
After a tight match, Hansen secured the win that would send him to the finals against Ohio State’s Paul Veltrup, who he became familiar with throughout the competition.
“Paul and I had traveled in the same pod together for the entire competition, so we had both gotten a good sense of each other’s fencing style when the finals came around,” Hansen said.
Despite trailing early, Hansen turned it around and was able to pull away, securing the win.
“What helped me to gain momentum towards the end was to lock in on actions I was confident in executing, but also getting into the mindset of simply enjoying the moment I was living,” he reflected.
“Just taking a second to consider how cool it is to be at the NCAA Championships in the first place, not to mention the finals, helps me to remember to fence out of joy for the sport rather than out of stress for the best result.”
Hansen is the third epee men’s national champion in Harvard history, and he could not contain his happiness.
“When I left the fencing area just after winning, I was ambushed by a sea of my Harvard teammates, who were all so ecstatic for me that I couldn’t help but be all smiles for the rest of the day,” Hansen beamed.
At the end of the competition, Ark Ma placed 22nd in the men’s epee round-robins, James Chen finished 13th in men’s foil round-robins, and Kenji Bravo placed 15th in men’s foil round-robins, marking an end to Harvard men’s fencing impressive 2022-23 season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early in the Ivy League season, the Harvard softball team has an 11-9-1 overall record on the season paired with a 4-2 conference record. It has finished two Ivy series so far where it swept the University of Pennsylvania and went 1-2 against Cornell, though losing both games only by one run.
In its first Ivy match-up of the year, Harvard faced off against the University of Pennsylvania. Right off the bat in the first game, the Crimson scored three runs. The team didn’t look back on its way to a dominating shutout (6-0) with junior pitcher Anna Reed allowing only three hits throughout the seven innings of play.
In the second game, the Crimson found itself once again up by three runs after only the first inning. Harvard continued to dominate the rest of the game with a total of nine runs, fourteen hits, and only one defensive error.
In the third match-up, Penn gave Harvard more of a challenge: with a slower start, the Crimson’s first run wasn’t scored until the third inning. It caught fire in the fourth inning, scoring six more runs. In the fifth and sixth innings, Pennsylvania started to put together a comeback and scored five runs. In the end, Harvard completed the sweep with a 12-6 victory.
A week later, the Crimson received its first loss. It began another Ivy series against Cornell with an incredibly strong four-run first inning but remained scoreless thereafter.
“We scored first and when they scored, we didn’t keep scoring,” head coach Jenny Allard said. “That was our problem.”
By the end, the Big Red completed a comeback to win the first game 5-4.
When questioned about how a team retaliates in the second game of a doubleheader after losing the first, Allard said, “You do a reset and focus on what you need to do to be more successful.”
And reset is exactly what Harvard did: with zero defensive errors and sophomore pitcher Katie Arrambide throwing a one-hit game, the Crimson shut out Cornell 6-0 to close out the first day.
The following morning, Cornell jumped to an early three-run lead by the second inning. Harvard struggled to put together an offensive push and remained scoreless until the sixth.
“We came back in the seventh innings, but we have to start much earlier than that,” Allard stated.
The comeback was too little too late and the Crimson couldn’t complete their last-inning rally. It fell short by one run, and Harvard lost 4-5.
As the Crimson looks forward to the rest of the season, it has its goals established.
“Our goal always in this program is to be in it the last weekend, to have a chance to win an Ivy title,” Allard said. “You have to stay the course, persevere, fight, be resilient, and overcome obstacles.”
To make the Ivy League tournament, the Crimson will need to be in the top four Ivy teams. Currently, Harvard sits at number three, but there are still twelve more Ivy games left this season.
With their goals well established and their path to success well planned, Harvard softball is optimistic and excited for the rest of the Ivy League season. The next series for the team is at home against seventh-seeded Brown this upcoming weekend. As it looks forward to competition, the primary focus of the team is on maintaining a goal-oriented mindset towards the end of the season and keeping players' heads in the game.
“That’s what we need to work on, that’s the whole mental game,” Allard said. “They have to take more initiative, have a sense of urgency, and fight harder to solve problems within the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, the Harvard track and field team competed at the Raleigh Relays, Hurricane Invite, and UMass Lowell Riverhawk Invite. The track team saw great success in the second week of its outdoor season, earning nine first-place finishes and setting two new school records.
“The plan was just to go to Raleigh this weekend and get a time qualifier for the regional championships, which is the race you need to go to qualify for nationals,” said sophomore Graham Blanks about his coach’s advice going into his race. “ I knew I needed to run 29 minutes or faster to get that qualifier. So basically that was the plan —  just to go in and get that time as painlessly as possible.”
Blanks did just that, representing the Crimson well in the men’s 10000 m. He placed second in his heat of 99 runners. His time of 28:24.79 seconds places him second in the nation and third in Harvard’s history.
“With the distance being so long, there’s more time to sort out when there’s a lot of runners,” Blanks said about his mentality approaching his race. “In the heat I was in, we even had two rabbits pacing at two different paces, so it was almost like two races within a race. It’s not really that pressing of an issue to get into a certain spot in the pack. With that in mind, I tried to get out a little hard but nothing crazy, and then after a lap or so worked my way up to the front and then settled in for the rest of the race.”
Along with Blanks, his teammates also had impressive races. A total of 196 runners competed in the 1500 m event in Raleigh, with sophomore Noah Ward and first-year Vivien Henz finishing in the top 100 runners. Ward took third place in his heat with a time of 3:47.11 seconds and Henz finished 12th in his heat with a time of 3:50.47 seconds. Senior Will Crisp finished second in his heat with a time of 4:01.81 seconds.
In the men’s 5000 m, junior Acer Iverson finished seventh overall with a time of 13:41.46 seconds. The time puts him just below his school record in the books and seventh in the NCAA. His teammates, sophomores Ben Rosa and Pierce Cousins, also finished in the top 100 out of 205 runners competing, taking 47th and 98th place overall, respectively.
“To list off a few names that raced well, Acer Iverson most likely got a 5K qualifier time [and] Noah Ward had a good race in his 1500 m — he closed really fast and almost won his heat,” Blanks commented. “Another really good race was from Pierce Cousins too — he went out and did his first 5K ever and also had a really fast last lap.
“It was good to see on one side, a lot of people developing and getting better, and on the other, we were able to get some qualifiers,” he continued.
Over at the Riverhawk Invitational, the Crimson continued to have success.
Representing Harvard in Lowell, Mass., sophomores Annelies Quinton and Cristina Demeo competed in the women’s 1500 m. Quinton ran a time of 4:48.05 seconds to place third out of 40 runners, while Demeo placed eighth with a time of 4:55.46 seconds. Their teammate, junior Noah Miles, won the men’s triple jump with a personal record of 13.58 m. Sophomore Allaura Osborne also had a personal best in the women’s hammer throw, throwing a mark of 38.75 m.
Over at Hurricane Invitational in Coral Gables, Fla., nine athletes won gold medals, and two set new Harvard records.
“Our coach said ‘Let’s have fun. We’ve done what we need to do, our training has prepared us for this, so let’s go out there and run and do our best because we love the sport,'” junior sprinter Lance Ward said. “ That’s what we did — and we had a lot of great performances come out of that.”
For the field athletes, it was sophomore Kenneth Ikeji who set the tone. In the men’s hammer throw, he threw a mark of 69.18 m on his fifth attempt to win the event, as well as set a new event record for the Crimson. Ikeji was the only contestant to successfully record a score on all six attempts. His teammate, senior Alexander Kolesnikoff, also won his event in the men’s shot put, throwing 19.02 m to put him in sixth place in the NCAA rankings. He also got on the podium for the men’s discus, getting second place in the event.
Senior Stephanie Ratcliffe also won the weight throw for the women at a mark of 65.45 m. Sophomore Cara Salsberry, alongside juniors Cammy Garabian and Estel Valeanu, received podium spots for the event, winning third, fifth, and sixth places respectively. Senior Sarah Omoregie took silver in the women’s shot put with a throw of 16.80 m, which placed her sixth in the national league. Valeanu added to the Crimson’s winning streak in the women’s discus, throwing 55.52 m to win gold for the event, putting her in eleventh place in the nation.
For the jumpers, sophomore Anastasia Retsa, the school record holder for the women’s pole vault, won the event with a mark of 4.15 m. She cleared the mark on her first attempt, jumping just 0.1m away from her personal record. Sophomore Izzy Goudros, the school record holder for the women’s long jump, earned second place in the event with a jump of 5.96 m.
On the track, the Harvard runners continued their winning streak.
The sprinters started off with some strong races. Sophomore Jaeschel Acheampong ran a personal best of 10.50 seconds in the men’s 100 m dash to win the event, a time that puts him fifth in Harvard history. In the same event, Ward and first-year Jonas Clarke took second and fourth places in their heat to finish fourth and seventh overall, respectively.
Ward, the school record holder for the men’s 200 m dash, also won the event with a time of 20.86 seconds. Junior Gregory Lapit finished behind him in second place with a time of 21.04 seconds.
Senior Aaron Shirley added to his accolades with his race in the 400 m hurdles. His school record time of 50.29 seconds was two seconds faster than the other competitors in the race, earning him first place. In the same race, first-year Ondrej Vesely and sophomore Peter Fischer finished fifth and seventh place, respectively.
“It’s just the second meet of the outdoor season and we’re already breaking these records,” Ward commented. “Our team is the best it’s ever been, and that’s kind of proof of that. That’s just going to continue to happen. All these records are temporary —I think that’s what we’re all thinking.”
Sophomore Victoria Bossong won the women’s 800 m run with a time of 2:07.43, placing her 12th in the national league.
At the beginning of this week, it was announced that the Harvard men’s team and women’s team were both ranked in the top 25 in the nation, with the men’s team sitting in an impressive fourth place, and the women’s team at 23rd.
“It was just an amazing feeling,” said Ward about the team’s ranking. “It feels like it’s been a long time coming and kind of a product of all of the effort and sacrifice and dedication that’s been put into the sport this year by everybody in all the event groups, and also across both genders.
“That’s just really been bringing us together as a big family of around 120 people and I’m really glad to be a part of it,” Ward added.
Blanks added, “It’s definitely a consequence of all of us competing last weekend, but it is hard to do. It just happens that, right now, early in the season, we have a few guys that are maybe in the top ten and top 20, but I think it’s telling of where we are right now.”
“As the bigger programs come out of hibernation after indoor season and start competing, that ranking will drop, but I think it is something to be proud of. It’s indicative of how our team’s progressed,” he continued.
Next up, Harvard track and field will compete at the Florida Relays taking place from today through April 1st, as well as taking on the UMass Dartmouth Corsair Classic on Saturday.
