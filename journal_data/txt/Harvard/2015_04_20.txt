After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 20, 2015, at 11:48 a.m.
It’s the most wonderful time of the year: Fresh off the heels of the 2014 midterm election, politicians have begun announcing their candidacies for the 2016 presidential election. From Hillary Clinton accidentally telling the world she “fought children and families all her career” to Rand Paul selling autographed copies of the Constitution printed in gold leaf for $1,000, the fun has only just begun.
Despite the ridiculousness of some of the campaign tactics so far, the fact remains that this election will undoubtedly be a historic one. Our next leader will have to deal with problems internationally in Russia and the Middle East, in addition to domestic issues such as the racial tensions that came to the forefront of the public consciousness in a dramatic way this fall. But before the next president confronts these issues, he or she must first face the grueling gauntlet of the primary process—unfortunately, that process has become increasingly reliant on the amount of money that a given candidate is able to raise.
During the lead-up to this latest election, we have once again been reminded of the desperate need for campaign finance reform. We are troubled by the fact that many politicians today are valued for their ability to raise money rather than their ability to govern. The resignation of Illinois Republican Aaron Schock, who was valued mostly for his ability to raise money for other young Republicans, is yet another reminder of the problems inherent in our electoral system. No representative should be better known for his Instagram profile than for his legislative record.
We find this conflict between governing and raising money deeply troubling. Those who finance campaigns in the United States have an incredible power in the electoral process; recent statistics suggest that fewer than 700 thousand people were responsible for all of the donations of $200 or more to campaigns, parties, and political action committees during the 2014 election. In other words, those who spent the most on elections accounted for only 0.2 percent of the population. The implications of these numbers are troublingly clear: Elections in the United States are for sale. In order to preserve the democratic process in this country, fundamental reforms are necessary.
According to the Washington Post, groups allied with prominent Republican backers Charles and David Koch plan to spend nearly $1 billion supporting Republican candidates in the upcoming election. This level of spending is unfortunately nothing new; further, it is an amount of money that is nearly as much as either of the major parties. An electoral system that allows two extravagantly wealthy men to have as much financial influence as the two major political parties must be fundamentally reformed.
There is clearly something wrong with a political system that prioritizes the impact of money over actual substantive policy ideas. Keeping the amount of money spent on the election from spiraling out of control is crucial—our politicians should represent all their constituents, not just a few wealthy backers. It’s time for America to take its elections back.
CORRECTION: April 20, 2015
An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that Aaron Schock was from Ohio. In fact, he is from Illinois.

Please choose your least favorite person from the list below:
a)   Stoner athlete
b)  Fake bitch
c)   Shy prude
d)  Loud-mouthed know-it-all
Isn’t it nice how clean and organized we can make things once we typecast? Since middle school we’ve all been steadily growing into our adult bodies and slotting ourselves into the appropriate societal niches. No longer do I aspire to become president, ballerina, and mom with equal measure of hope.
And, as we find our strengths, certain weaknesses of others start to rub us the wrong way. We each have collected our list of unpleasant personality types. I don’t really mean people whom we find morally reprehensible. But just those who are, well, irksome, annoying, and not worth our time.
I’ve been sitting around thinking about what most everyone takes for granted, and it seems like we all agree that friends are people whom you like and choose to spend time with for no other reason. Looking at my list of nearest and dearest, though, I’m not sure that’s what makes for the most lasting or enriching friendships. Here are a few points in favor of seeking out friends who aren’t the first pleasant acquaintances you happen to collect.
1. Friendships that require more work last longer.
One of my friends from high school and I had just the worst rapport. We fought like dogs or siblings. On multiple occasions he came up to me and said, “Thank you for saying XYZ nice thing to me today. This morning, I had my hand on the button to remove your contact info from my phone.” We were—in a word—incompatible.
I can’t map out exactly how it happened, but after years of bickering, sometime near the transition from junior to senior, we just stopped fighting. We’ve gotten along perfectly since. This isn’t the only friend with whom I’ve had this happen, but in each case, the season of fighting is followed by a much longer period of harmony.
When I think about why these friendships survive as others crash away on the rocks of different time zones, I have only one plausible conclusion: We earned it. I fought to keep them in my life, and they fought to keep me. I don’t know why we were fighting for it. It was only proximity that had thrown us together. Yet, because it was together that we learned how to make ourselves understood, our friendships based on proximity grew into something more lasting.
If you find yourself in the middle of a difficult relationship with a difficult personality, consider sticking it out. You may be building the foundation of a structure you will one day hold dear to your heart
2. Difficult friends prepare you for difficult colleagues, children, and all of the other people who you don’t get to choose.
Once you’ve stuck it out with a close friend and ironed out the kinks, other people’s highs and lows are no longer as striking. Your colleague won’t have your deepest insecurity in his back pocket to whip out in a moment of anger.
It blows my mind when people who dislike most other humans have kids. How do you think you’ll possibly get along with these quasi-random personalities now permanently entrenched in your family?
In the spirit of deepening your love for humanity at large, find its outliers and learn to love them first. It only makes loving the rest of the spectrum easier.
3. Learning how not to judge a book by its cover takes the kind of practice that caring for difficult friends offers.
Never have I spoken to someone for more than 2 hours without getting some kind of surprise. Lives are complicated. Perhaps the clean-cut girl in your philosophy section has a cult following in the death metal scene that would leave you floored. Even if her life is just as you would have predicted, there’s an emotional richness to her story that you’re missing out on right now. People are beautiful and messy and sublime. Befriending those who don’t stand out to you can serve as a humbling reminder of human complexity.
Now that I’m here in my adult body with my adult mind and several of my adult life choices already made, I’m surprised to find out just how much of a typecast character I am at Harvard. Whether I’m (erroneously) assumed to be the quiet white girl from the suburbs or the snotty little know-it-all, the eyes defining me fall blind to the intricate pleasures I do have to offer.
The “unappealing personality crowd” for much of my life has been a “them” rather than an “us.” Yet as I age, I find more division and more judgments available for use. At this point, I think we all have personalities distinct enough to prove unappealing.
Please remember that the next time you’re on the brink of reaching out a hand to meet someone new, or when you’re just about to unfriend that difficult somebody on Facebook, they are me, they are you, and we all are sublime creations stuffed into types just waiting to be let out.

James Madison would have hated Rotten Tomatoes.
Sure, he might have appreciated the fact that movies existed, but Madison was also the man who, in the Federalist Papers, formulated perhaps the foundational argument against mob rule.
“There is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual,” Madison wrote. “Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention.”
Concentrating absolute power in the majority leads to tyranny because nothing prevents large groups from imposing their opinions on small groups. In a phrase, mob rule confuses popularity for quality.
A wise thought from Mr. Madison, and one that sadly applies across much of the Internet.
In the case of Rotten Tomatoes, the mob has slapped a score of 20-percent onto the cult classic of “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl.” That’s unfortunate, but not as unfortunate as the fact that this sort of crowd-sourced criticism tricks you into viewing general consensus as absolute truth.
There are no checks and balances in this system, only the majority opinion.
Even on Twitter (or Facebook) it’s common, if not expected, to measure the quality of a tweet (or a photo) by how many retweets (or likes) the original garners.
In this way, majority approval in the virtual world—on Amazon, on Instagram, on Yelp, on YouTube, and so on—overshadows all other considerations and contributes to a collective psychology in which we agree to accept the most common opinion as the most correct one.
“Whoa there,” I can hear you saying. “Stop yelling. Surely you need to acknowledge the difference between a mob-ruled government (dangerous, pitchforks involved) and a mob-ruled website (harmless, all-caps involved).”
I agree, to a certain extent. Madison was considering some of the heaviest practicalities that any human being can consider. That’s why he contributed to the Constitution while I contribute to The Crimson.
However, I believe that my polemic against this follow-the-majority psychology has merit because such psychology, when shared by an entire society, deeply hurts the way that content is produced and consumed on the Internet.
I’ll begin with the producers—not only bloggers, moviemakers, and remote-control manufacturers, but also us, the great social-media generation.
Since all web users participate in a system that understands popularity as quality, we strive to garner as much positive attention as possible. We crop, tag, and caption our Facebook photos in exchange for crowd approval. We give our Crimson articles headlines such as “15 Amazing Thoughts about BuzzFeed” in order to grab more eyes.
In effect we focus less on producing the best content than on producing the most popular content. Our need for majority appreciation results in self-censorship.
And in those cases when we don’t receive the desired amount of adulation, we feel awful. If fame is success, then anonymity is unmitigated failure. In one extreme case, this perspective led a little-known blogger named Dennis Williams to reveal his discontent to a Washington Post reporter before committing suicide.
Meanwhile, for consumers of content, accepting the majority opinion suffocates idiosyncrasies. If you need a place to eat, you’ll just go to the most-starred restaurant and buy the exact meal that everyone else has bought.
Why should the average opinion of human beings matter anyway? The average opinion neglected Van Gogh in his time (“One star—a total lunatic”) and awarded Best Picture to “How Green Was My Valley” instead of “Citizen Kane.”
But for you righteous rabble-rousers who want to buck this whole majority thing, the structure of the Internet constrains your rebellion. The front pages of websites display the most popular items. Facebook feeds back the most-liked items. YouTube prioritizes the most-watched videos.
It’s not a matter of swallowing what the mob feeds you; it’s a matter of opening your mouth at all.
In certain cases, it can be beneficial to know whether more people prefer the color of this toaster-oven to that one. However, most websites go several leaps too far by letting you slide into thinking that the shared opinion is right. Unless you make a real effort to resist, you adopt the Internet’s publicly assigned judgments of the worth of art, objects, and even other people.
Anarchy is not the answer—please don’t smash your computers. In order to maximize the value of the Internet, however, you must learn to distrust the easy statistics of popularity.
After all, a movie with a 20-percent rating is not automatically less worthwhile than a “masterpiece” with a 90-percent rating. Especially if the 20-percent movie focuses on the adventures of a shark-boy, and perhaps even a lava-girl.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sponsors of the Freshman Enrichment Program won $3,000 for their proposal through the Undergraduate Council’s "Harvard Project" grant initiative after receiving the most student votes in an online poll last week.
FEP, which was one of three finalists chosen last week by the Council’s Student Initiatives Committee, aims to help students from under-resourced high schools transition to life at Harvard.
According to Student Initiatives Committee Co-Chair Daniel V. Banks ’17, the program will consist of a speaker series, mentoring program, and several events and dinners during the fall semester for the Class of 2019.
Savannah M. Fritz ’17, who proposed FEP, hopes the program will grow to become an official pre-orientation program in the years to follow.
The program won the grant money after receiving 43.8 percent of the 1,164 student votes during the Harvard Project’s voting period, which closed on Friday. Renegade, a student-run arts and advocacy magazine, came in second with 31.4 percent of the votes, while AirDry, an initiative to put drying racks in dorm and House laundry rooms, received the remaining 24.6 percent of votes.
The grant aims to reward student initiatives through the $3,000 in funding, as detailed by a piece of legislation passed on March 23. The UC encouraged projects to abide by  the Council’s greater goals of student health, inclusivity, and campus-wide sustainability.
According to Banks, other Ivy League schools such as Yale and Princeton already have programs such as FEP that ease the transition for students from these high schools.
Fritz wrote in a statement last week that while the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, as well as the First Generation Student Union, have enacted major change in ensuring smooth transitions for incoming freshmen, she wants to further the process by creating FEP.

Entrepreneurs of various backgrounds discussed their paths to success with an audience of Harvard students and schoolchildren from underserved New York City communities at Harvard Ventures’ Entrepreneurship and Empowerment event on Friday.
The event began with a keynote by Robert N. Shapiro ’72, a former vice-chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers, who said that future global interchange will “depend more and more” on developing an understanding of different people and cultures.
Shapiro encouraged the audience to diversify their academic pursuits. “As you are studying all of the STEM subjects, you should be complementing them with the humanities that enable you to understand the people and cultures you are dealing with,” he said.
One of the organizers of the event, Joseph W. Kahn ’18, said his interest in social entrepreneurship motivated him to develop the event to provide children from underserved communities exposure to entrepreneurship.
Following Shapiro’s keynote, panelists from three groups—young, experienced, and social entrepreneurs—described their ventures. In between the three panels, schoolchildren presented their own ideas to the audience.
According to several speakers during these panels, taking advantage of opportunities drives success.
Anthony Davenport, CEO and founder of Regal Financial and a speaker in the experienced entrepreneur panel, credited his success to his realization of an opportunity to develop a business to teach people about credit.
Reflecting on his experience losing money in his real estate endeavors during the financial downturn, Davenport said that he then realized that “a lot of people were suffering from the same issues who needed help getting back on their feet.” The ability to help people with credit continues to motivate him in his career to this day, he said.
Brendan Lattrell, CEO and Founder of Grapevine, said that not wanting to give up on his ideas was a large determiner of his success, as was seeing a space in the market for helping various brands sell their products by working with Youtube stars.
In the social entrepreneurship panel, CEO and Founder of Pursuit Sports Group Romone F. Penny said he developed his financial strategy consulting firm based on the prospect of not only helping professional athletes remain financially stable, but also using those athletes as ambassadors of financial education to impact “the community from a financial standpoint.”

Over 400 students gathered Friday evening for Harvard’s 12th annual Relay For Life, raising about $33,000 for cancer research and for support for survivors.
The 12-hour event, one of many held annually around the world, centered on a fundraising walk around the Gordon Indoor Track. It also featured games, food, ceremonies, and performances by student groups.
This year’s total falls short of the group’s $60,000 goal, but organizers say they are pleased with the experience that the event provided.
“We all get so wrapped up in the stuff on campus,” said Preeti V. Srinivasan ’16, one of the event’s directors. “It feels so nice to just take 12 hours out of our day and realize that all of this money is going to the American Cancer Society.”
Several student organizations set up stands selling food and raffle tickets at the event to raise additional money. All of the proceeds will be donated to the American Cancer Society to fund cancer research efforts and benefit survivors.
The opening ceremony featured a speech by Harvard Medical School student Erin M. Fletcher who has been involved with Relay For Life since her days at San Diego State University as an undergraduate. Fletcher discussed her work providing a summer camp experience to children with cancer.
Lighter moments like a Miss Relay contest led by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and a late night dance competition were balanced with more solemn ones such as the traditional luminaria ceremony, which Srinivasan and her co-director Gabriel E. Molina ’15 referred to as their favorite part of Relay events.
During the luminaria ceremony participants joined together to walk a silent lap around the track as a tribute to those who have been affected by cancer. Each participant was given a glow stick to indicate the impact of cancer on their lives, be it their own diagnosis, the diagnosis of a loved one, or their commitment to the cause.
“It’s that moment every year when I remember that this is all worth it,” said Srinivasan, “the moment when you realize we’re actually making a difference.”

After a long licensing process, a group of students is in the process of planning Harvard’s first ever university-wide TEDx event after receiving approval from TED.
TEDx events are licensed by the official TED organization, a nonprofit that provides a forum for short educational speeches, but are planned independently by local groups.
The event will be held next October, according to Christian G. B. Haigh ’16, the co-president of TEDxHarvardCollege, which is the student group in charge of putting on the event.
Haigh said that the traditional TED-style talks will be interspersed with more hands-on activities such as musical performances, art projects, and perhaps even a dance party.
“We don’t want to have the traditional, [where] you go get a coffee and a bagel and sit down in your seat and wait while everyone congregates,” he said.
Eva Shang ’17, co-president of TEDxHarvardCollege and an inactive Crimson editorial editor, said that the event will aim to be more interactive for the audience.
“You can have a TEDx event that’s purely about the videos...but we’re hoping to create a daylong experience,” she said.
Shang and Haigh said that they experienced difficulties in being licensed by TED as well as being recognized as a student group by Harvard.
“TED officially licensed locations, say Cambridge or Boston. It also licenses universities,” Haigh said, “but it doesn’t license schools within universities.”
Their group thus had to encompass all of Harvard’s schools to get official approval. Haigh said that this conflicted with Harvard’s branding policy, which requires official student organizations to only be associated with one school.
But Haigh said the group eventually gained Harvard approval, and last fall TED officially approved TEDxHarvardCollege, which represents all the schools.
Previously TED has made exceptions for events at the Law School and the Graduate School of Education, but this group will be the first to include participants from across the university.
Organizers are currently determining who will speak at the event.
At an open mic event held on Sunday, about 10 students gave two-minute speeches for a chance at a spot during the event next fall. Mark S. Staples ’17, who is in charge of speaker selection, said videos of the speeches will be posted online for students to vote on.
Jerry Anunrojwong ’18, who auditioned at the open mic with a speech on math’s applications in dating, said he was excited about the prospect of improving his public speaking skills and reaching a wider audience for his ideas.
Some of Harvard's peer universities including Yale and Stanford have held similar TEDx events.

The advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is urging the Worcester County district attorney to investigate allegations against the Harvard-run New England Primate Center surrounding 12 monkeys that were euthanized or found dead in their cages at the center between 1999 and 2011.
The Southborough, Mass., primate center, which is set to close at the end of May, came under fire earlier this month for a report that the monkeys died due to dehydration as a result of inadequate care. Known for its HIV and neuroscience research, the center is also being investigated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture after six monkeys transferred to the Oregon Zoo last May died soon after arriving.
In a letter Friday to Worcester County District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr., PETA argued that the inadequate care at the center violated Massachusetts’s cruelty-to-animals legislation, which outlaws “unnecessarily failing to provide [an animal] with proper food [or] drink,” and urged the district attorney to “pursue charges against the experimenters responsible for overseeing the animals’ care.”
According to documents released earlier this month by Dr. Frederick C. Wang—who served as interim director of the center at the end of 2011 through the start of 2012—one monkey did not have a waterspout in its cage, and another had a malfunctioning water line.
"PETA is calling on the district attorney to send a message that experimenters can't get away with fatally neglecting animals—and then failing to report those deaths to the authorities," PETA Director of Laboratory Investigations Justin Goodman wrote in an emailed statement.
In 2011, Harvard initiated “a significant review of [their] operations” at the primate center in response to what it called “self-identified events,” according to a statement from the Medical School. After the review, the center reorganized its administrative and veterinary leadership and “implemented the most rigorous standards and administrative procedures.” The Medical School has continued to maintain its commitment to resolving the problems related to the monkeys’ deaths.
“We care deeply about this issue and view the well-being of animals within our care for the purpose of advancing scientific understanding of disease as a public trust,” says a statement from the Medical School.

UPDATED: April 20, 2015, at 6:14 p.m.
At the Undergraduate Council’s general meeting on Sunday, representatives discussed a smartphone application called “Club In” that will allow admitted students at Visitas this weekend to register their names with various student groups.
The application, developed by Crimson Yard representative Hugo Yen ’18, seeks to eliminate the process of club registration on paper and on laptop computers. According to Yen, admitted students may use the camera on their smartphones to scan barcodes assigned to individual clubs, which will automatically register them for emails.
Yen also worked alongside various students and administrators to develop “Omni,” the application that will officially replace the “Harvard” smartphone app later this week.
The Council also announced that it will review Ventfull, its calendar application and web platform, as well as the Freshman Class Committee and the Student Faculty Committee, at its next and final meeting of the semester.
Representatives from the Student Relations Committee will compile a report later this week in order to gauge whether or not these initiatives should be continued to the next academic year. According to UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, approximately 1,300 undergraduates are currently signed up for Ventfull.
Also at the meeting, chair of the Council’s Freshman Class Committee Riya N. Patel ’17 introduced an initiative that will provide funding for groups of 10 students and two UC representatives to have dinner in Harvard Square.
According to Patel, this will help give students from different social groups an opportunity to meet and socialize with each other.
In other business, representatives unanimously voted to allot $11,044.93 to 31 different student groups in its tenth “grants pack” of the semester.

Despite mounting a valiant fourth-quarter comeback, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team failed to dig itself out of a significant early hole against Princeton. The Crimson (6-7, 1-4 Ivy) outscored the Tigers, 4-0, in the final period but fell just short, dropping a 12-11 decision on the road Friday night.
A sluggish start ultimately doomed Harvard, as Princeton (8-4, 4-1) sprinted out to a 6-1 lead by the middle of the second quarter. Goals by senior long stick midfielder Brian Fischer and freshman midfielder Sean Coleman cut the deficit to three goals entering halftime and helped slow the early momentum of the Tigers.
“We wanted to take away their strong hands, which they were able to respond to very well,” junior goaltender Bryan Moore said. “Princeton was more comfortable than any team we’ve played this year dodging to their weak hand, which put some unexpected pressure on us early.”
Fischer has emerged as an offensive threat in the latter half of the season. After not recording a point during his junior campaign, the Garden City, N.Y., product has scored in three of the Crimson’s last five games as part of a group of long sticks that have shown a nose for the goal. Harvard’s poles have combined for 17 tallies this season, far more than the unit’s output from a year ago.
After the break, both offenses came out firing, scoring more goals in the third quarter than in the entire first half. They traded scores for most of the quarter, and a goal by freshman attackman Tim Edmonds brought the score to 10-7 in favor of the Tigers with under a minute left in the frame.
However, Princeton answered immediately, scoring just eight seconds later on a goal by sophomore attackman Sean Connors. Just eight seconds after that, Tigers attackman Ryan Ambler found the net on a pass from faceoff specialist Zach Currier, turning a three-goal margin into a commanding five-goal lead in the blink of an eye.
“That was a pivotal point in the game right there,” said Harvard coach Christ Wojcik '96. “[Currier] made two outstanding plays off the face-off for them to score.”
After a rough game to that point, the fourth quarter was all Crimson. Junior midfielder Ian Ardrey scored less than a minute into the period to pull Harvard within four. He then broke an eight-minute scoring drought for both teams with 6:35 to play, making the hope of a Crimson comeback a possibility by bringing the score to 12-9.
With time winding down, Harvard drew a penalty and junior attackman Devin Dwyer cashed in on the man-up opportunity with just under two minutes left in the game to cut the deficit to two goals.
However, Princeton won the resulting draw and proceeded to kill the clock, drawing three penalties as the Crimson defense doubled and pressed to try to win the ball back. The penalties appeared to be the dagger for Harvard, but an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the Tigers gave the ball back to the Crimson.
With Harvard still a man down after the string of penalties, freshman attackman Tim Edmonds managed to get off a decent long-range look and snuck it by Princeton goalie Tyler Blaisdell to make it 12-11 with 35 seconds remaining. Although Crimson junior midfielder Keegan Michel won the ensuing faceoff, he lost it on a backcheck from Currier, and the home team corralled the loose ball before winding out the clock to hold on to the victory.
The loss brings Harvard to 1-4 in the Ivy League, thus eliminating the Crimson from postseason contention. The only things on the line for the Crimson in this weekend’s game against rival Yale will be pride and the chance to hurt the Bulldogs’ postseason chances.
“I think there’s a lot on the line for us [against Yale],” Wojcik said. “[We have] a tremendous amount of pride in playing that game…in finishing the season with our best game of the year.”

The penultimate race of the regular season was a jam-packed one for the Harvard and Radcliffe crew teams. The men’s teams each had dual races, while the women’s teams participated in competitions.
MEN'S CREW
The No. 5 lightweight team defeated Navy at home to take the Haines Cup for the sixth year in a row, besting the Midshipmen for the seventh consecutive time.
“We knew that Navy were going to be a strong team going into the race, so we were expecting close races which is exactly what we got,” junior lightweight Jack Kelly said.
The varsity eight race began close, with both boats neck and neck for the first 1,000 meters. After crossing the bridge, though, the Crimson pulled away. In the last few hundred meters of the race, Harvard was ahead by open water. Navy closed the gap, but still finished five seconds behind the Crimson, which finished at 6:03.
The second varsity squad also won, defeating its opponent by open water. Harvard finished in 6:08, while the Mids finished 10 seconds later.
Navy took the next three events, besting the 2F and 5V teams by open water, the third varsity team by six seconds, and the fourth varsity team by seven.
Princeton put an end to the No. 4 Harvard men’s heavyweight team's win streak on Lake Carnegie in Princeton, N.J., Saturday morning. The team earned its first split of the season, defeating MIT and falling to Princeton, which won the Compton Cup.
The Crimson came in second place in each of the four races, falling behind the Tigers each time by less than five seconds. The varsity eight team finished five seconds behind the Tigers in the first event, completing the 2,000 meter race with a time of 5:48.4. The team beat MIT by open water. This was the only event MIT participated in, giving Harvard the automatic win over the Engineers.
WOMEN'S CREW
The Radcliffe women’s heavyweight team participated in the Clemson Invitational this weekend, finishing third in the competition.
The varsity boat recorded a time of 6:34.3, coming in behind Washington State, which finished at 6:29.6, and Virginia, which won the event with a time of 6:28.
The JV boat took fourth place in a log-jam with two other boats from Oregon State and Minnesota. The Black and White, with a time of 6:43.2, finished .2 seconds behind Oregon and .7 seconds ahead of Minnesota.
The No. 2 lightweight team dropped two races against Princeton at home on Saturday, bringing its 18-game win streak in dual races to an end. Like the men’s race, the V8 team was tight to the end. The Black and White fell behind in the end though, crossing the finish line at 6:32, exactly one second behind the Tigers, who took the Class of 1999 Cup.
The JV team recorded the only win of the day. The team finished at 6:41, defeating both the Princeton JV and the heavyweight third varsity teams by open water.
On Sunday, the lightweights came in second in the Lightweight Invitational against No. 4 BU and No. 1 Stanford on the Charles. The first varsity team came in one second behind BU in its heat but advanced to the grand final based on its time of 6:58.1.
In the Grand Final, all three boats were battling it out for the first 1,000 meters, but the Cardinals pulled away in the second half, finishing three seconds ahead of the Black and White, which crossed at 6:39.6.
The JV boat took third in the competition, and the varsity four won by open water.
“Coming away from this race, we're looking forward to getting into some aggressive racing next weekend…and pushing ourselves beyond the limits of our expected capabilities,” freshman heavyweight Kathleen Malloch said. “This race provided the platform for us to come together both in individual boats and as a team, providing an opportunity to get racing experience in, and motivation to push ourselves going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team finished its regular season with a split in its two-game weekend slate, taking down George Washington but falling short to No. 13 Princeton by equivalent 15-7 scores. The Crimson (19-11, 6-3 CWPA) completed its regular season with the most wins that the program has seen this decade.
“I think we played well in the GW game but I think we played a little bit below our potential in the Princeton game,” junior Yoshi Andersen said. “We were making mistakes that we talked about a lot and really tried to work on.”
HARVARD 15, GEORGE WASHINGTON 7
The first half of the Crimson’s contest against George Washington (12-14, 1-8) saw the two teams equally matched. The second half was a different story.
Five third-period goals led Harvard to an eight-goal victory on Saturday afternoon. The Colonials were unable to keep up with the Crimson, only netting one goal in the penultimate eight minutes. Harvard outscored GW by seven goals in the second half of the contest.
“We knew that we had to pick up the intensity,” Andersen said. “We switched up the defense so that we would have more opportunities on the counterattack.”
The first half was much more evenly matched, with both teams scoring two goals in the first frame. The second quarter looked to be ending in a similar fashion before junior Charlotte Hendrix netted a goal in the waning seconds to send the Crimson into the locker room with a 5-4 lead and momentum heading into the second half.
“I think we did start off a little bit on the slower side in the first half,” freshman attacker Sami Strutner said. “Something we’ve been working out is coming out strong and fast-paced.”
The win sends the Crimson into the CWPA Eastern Championships with some sense of momentum.
“Our biggest goal is to be really patient in all of our games and not try to force shots and try to rush into wins,” Andersen said.“We are such a good team when we are focused and relaxed and playing each possession one-by-one.”
PRINCETON 15, HARVARD 7
By the time the seventh second-quarter goal passed by the outstretched arms of captain and goalie Ariel Dukes, the Tigers (26-3, 9-1) had all but sealed the victory at Brown on Saturday morning. Princeton entered halftime with a seven-goal lead that it never seriously came in danger of losing in the second half of play.
“We were having a very bad passing day,” Andersen said. “We couldn’t connect with each other on our passes. Princeton’s obviously a very talented team and they’re going to capitalize on every mistake we make. I think we allowed the mistakes to snowball.”
Hendrix and Andersen each scored goals in the game’s first eight minutes to keep the Crimson within one goal headed into the second frame. But the Harvard offense sputtered as the Tigers exploded over the next eight minutes, with sophomore Lexi del Toro scoring the only Crimson goal of the quarter.
The Crimson defense held stronger in the second half, but its offense was not able to overcome the halftime deficit.
The second-quarter surge led Princeton to its 20th straight win over the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team came into its weekend series with Yale with high hopes for a four-game sweep. After winning both of Saturday’s games, those aspirations vanished in the 10th inning of Sunday’s first game, and the Crimson fell short once again in the back end of the twin bill.
The Bulldogs (12-21, 4-12 Ivy) managed to escape narrowly with both victories, 4-2 and 2-1, on Sunday at O’Donnell Field after Harvard outscored the visitors by a combined 17-5 margin a day earlier. With the games having no postseason implications for Yale, the wins allowed the Bulldogs to eliminate their archrivals (18-19, 7-9) from Ivy League Championship contention as Dartmouth claimed its eighth consecutive Red Rolfe Division title. YALE 2, HARVARD 1
The final game of the weekend followed a similar script to the one that immediately preceded it, as both contests featured dramatics and a narrow Yale victory. Harvard continued its weekend trend of getting on the board in the first inning as it tagged Bulldogs starter Eric Brodkowitz for an early run. The Crimson maintained the slim lead until the seventh inning, as freshman Ian Miller allowed his only two runs of the game in that frame after Yale Robert Baldwin went yard.
“It’s tough because pitching well is great, but you really want to win this game because it meant a lot for us going forward,” Miller said.
Up only a run, the visitors left the door open for Harvard in the ninth. Two runners reached base after Bulldogs first baseman Eric Hsieh was forced off the bag by consecutive sloppy throws and junior Mitch Klug was hit by a pitch.
With the game on the line, the Crimson had the right man up, captain Ethan Ferreira, the team’s leader in almost every offensive category. The designated hitter battled Brodkowitz, seeing nine pitches before his shot to the warning track found the glove of Yale right fielder David Toups.
“I saw [Brodkowitz] three times on the day and pretty much knew everything he had,” Ferreira said. “I put a good swing on the ball to right, but it just didn’t fall.”
YALE 4, HARVARD 2 (10 INNINGS)
The early game, intended to be seven innings, needed three extra sets before the Bulldogs scored the decisive runs in the top of the 10th.
Harvard jumped out to an early lead, scoring in the bottom of the first, but Yale tied the contest up in the top of the third inning. The game swung back in the Crimson’s favor in the fifth as sophomore Matt Hink homered to left. The Bulldogs drew even again in what was intended to be the game’s final frame. Needing extra innings to settle the contest, neither team could tip the scale in its favor until Yale managed to bring two runners home with a two-out rally in the top of the 10th. HARVARD 7, YALE 0
Harvard picked up right where it left off on offense from Saturday’s first game, jumping out to a three-run advantage in the bottom of the first. Doubling that lead in the second removed any real doubt about who would take the day’s second contest.
The game featured active bats from the Crimson, errors on defense from the Bulldogs, and a fast start that put the hosts up early. Senior Matt Timoney kept the Yale offense off-balance all day, as the senior threw seven and two-thirds innings to pick up his sixth win of the year.  HARVARD 10, YALE 5 (7 INNINGS)
Harvard and the Bulldogs opened the weekend with hot offensive starts, as both teams got on the board in the first inning.
Both teams produced their highest offensive outputs of the weekend despite only playing seven frames. With the lineup clicking on all cylinders, the Crimson capitalized on a slough of hits to plate 10 runs, four of which came in the bottom of the game’s opening inning.
Yale could not keep pace offensively or defensively, as Harvard churned out 11 hits on the day while Yale committed three errors. Junior pitcher Nick Scahill had his most dominant performance of the season, striking out seven and allowing just one hit in four innings to pick up the win in relief.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last home stand of the season, the Harvard softball team came out with a strong showing against Yale, going 3-1 on the weekend to climb above the .500 mark overall.
After a mid-week non-conference game against Bryant, the Crimson has just a four-game set against Dartmouth to close out the regular season.
“We want to play Harvard softball so we have a chance going into the last weekend,” Harvard senior Laura Ricciardone said. “It’s important for us to do our thing and make sure we have a shot going into that last weekend and all bets are off, just go for it.”
YALE 3, HARVARD 1
The team’s only loss of the weekend came in its last contest of the series. The Crimson (20-19, 11-5 Ivy) could not pull off the sweep against the Bulldogs (9-20, 3-11), as two runs in the top of the seventh inning proved to be the deciding factor.
Leading up to the seventh, the match up was concentrated on pitching. Ricciardone got the start for the Crimson. She was strong through her seven innings, striking out three and walking only one batter, but the defense gave up two unearned runs in the final frame that were the difference in the game.
With two outs in the top of the seventh, the Crimson was just one out away from going into its half of the seventh inning attempt, but back-to-back fielding errors allowed the Bulldogs to pull ahead. Harvard could not answer the call in the bottom of the inning.
HARVARD 6, YALE 4
After going down 1-0 early in the top of the first, the Crimson was able to keep the eyes on the prize en route to a four run bottom of the second that proved crucial in the win.
With two on base and two out, senior first baseman Adrienne Hume came up big, sending a triple deep down the left field line, plating two runs. Junior enter fielder Zoe Galindo joined the hit parade with her single to left center, scoring Hume from third. A stolen base and a wild pitch later, senior second baseman Katherine Lantz stepped up to the plate and sent a double deep into left field, capping off Harvard’s scoring for the inning.
Yale looked as if it might make a comeback in the top of the seventh when third hitter Camille Weisenbach was up with a runner on second and a chance to tie the game, but junior Morgan Groom pitched her way out of the jam, inducing Weisenbachto fly out to center to end the game.
HARVARD 6, YALE 5
With the score knotted at four and two outs in the bottom of the sixth inning, freshman Maddy Kaplan connected for a double to center field to give the Crimson a 6-4 lead.
The Bulldogs brought the potential go-ahead run to the plate in the top of the seventh, but senior shortstop Emily Gusse stopped a sharp grounder and flipped the ball to Lantz to end the game.
Harvard got on the scoreboard first in the bottom of the third inning. After senior Andrea del Conte walked, Kaplan laid a bunt down the third base line for a single to set up the run-scoring opportunity for the Crimson. Gusse capitalized with a double to the left-field gap, the first of two for the San Diego, Calif., native in the game.
“[Gusse’s] been so steadily defensively and she’s really coming on strong offensively,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “For her to be that clutch, we really needed it.”
Yale responded in the top of the fourth inning with four runs on five hits off of Harvard sophomore pitcher Taylor Cabe. Ricciardone entered the game in relief, but the Bulldogs took advantage of a Crimson error to score their fourth run of the inning.
Gusse added her second double of the game in the bottom half of the fifth inning to even the score and set Harvard up for the late-inning win.
HARVARD 10, YALE 1 (5 innings)
Ricciardone led the Crimson on the mound and at the plate in the team’s opener against the Bulldogs with three strong innings in the circle and a grand slam.
The Crimson continued to put pressure on Yale after the grand slam, adding three singles and a three-run homer off of the bat of Lantz to take a decisive 9-0 lead.
“We were on a three-game slide there, so it was good especially for this team to come out in the first inning,” Ricciardone said. “That sets an incredible tone for the rest of the day.”
The Bulldogs scored their lone run of the game in the third inning, capitalizing on two consecutive errors by Crimson infielders.
Senior Gabrielle Ruiz came on in relief and struck out four of the nine batters she faced to close out the game for Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­A week after jeopardizing its playoff standing with a pair of losses, the Harvard men’s volleyball team responded in an emphatic fashion with a 3-1 victory over George Mason (11-12, 4-5 EIVA) at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Powered by a defense that recorded 38 digs, the Crimson (12-11, 6-5 EIVA) held the Patriots to a .106 kill percentage and clinched a spot in the four-team postseason alongside Penn State, Princeton, and George Mason.
“We really played well across the board,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said. “We shut them down with our blocking and defense, and then our serving was probably as good as it’s been all year as well.”
Zimmick, who leads all EIVA players with 1.17 rejections per set, notched six block assists. Meanwhile, freshman setter Marko Kostich, junior outside hitter Branden Clemens, and sophomore outside hitter Alec Schlossman combined for 27 digs, one more than all the Patriots together.
Yet George Mason found cracks in the defensive wall throughout the second set, when the Patriots tallied eight kills on 19 total attacks. Midway through the frame, George Mason used a 6-0 run to take control. Harvard lost five of these six points because of attacking errors, and the Patriots rolled to a 25-18 set win.
“You just want to start over and start fresh.” Zimmick said. “There wasn’t anything that we fundamentally did wrong. It just happened to be that we had a couple of our errors come at the same time.”
As soon as the game ended, however, so did George Mason’s offensive success. The Crimson held the Patriots to a .030 killing percentage the rest of the way while posting a .288 mark of its own.
In the fourth set, this margin was particularly obvious, with George Mason totaling nine errors compared to eight kills.
“It was knowing exactly what they had in their arsenal,” Clemens said. “We knew that if we got off to a great start containing them offensively, then we could probably handle their overall team.”
The score reflected the imbalance, and the Crimson won six consecutive points to build a 7-4 advantage. The margin only grew from there. Harvard put together two additional runs and sealed the overall victory with a 25-15 set win.
By contrast, in the opening frame, the Patriots stayed neck-in-neck with the Crimson through a 17-all deadlock. Then Harvard took over—or, more precisely, Clemens took over.
With four kills, Clemens fueled an 8-1 run that swung the set from a close contest to a 25-18 blowout. On the night, his kill percentage stood at .262, adversely affected by the mistake-laden second game. Co-captain D.J. White led the hosts with 13, and Clemens accumulated 11.
Clemens’s kills in particular came at opportune moments throughout the contest. Not only did he help close out the first frame, but he also notched a pair of finishes in the last four points of the third, which the Crimson took, 25-19.
“You make one good play, and that can carry over into the next one,” Zimmick said. “The good plays that you make, those need to stay in your mind.”
Much like the starting set, the third frame stayed close—in this case up to 14-apiece—until a Harvard run ended the stalemate. With a 7-2 stretch, the hosts gained command before Clemens’ finishes ended the period.
While this weekend’s conference play determined which teams will compete in the playoff, the order remains in flux with a contest against Sacred Heart for the Crimson remaining.
“This week we kind of reminded ourselves of our game plan and worked on the things that we needed to clean up,” Clemens said. “We did a really good job of putting those two things together to get a really important win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing where she left off during the indoor season, Harvard track and field sophomore Nikki Okwelogu shattered her own Ivy League shot put record for the second week in a row, highlighting a weekend full of success for the team.
With just three weeks left to prepare and train until the Ivy League Outdoor Heptagonals, the Crimson teams split up once again, sending squads to the UVA Challenge—facing off against some of the best in the nation—as well as the MIT Sean Collier Invite.
“I was really proud of the way they competed,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was great for them to see some competition they don’t normally see, get out of their comfort zone a little bit, and see some of the nation’s best.”
UVA CHALLENGE
Okwelogu led a successful contingent of field athletes, posting a 16.78 meter mark to edge out the competition and take home the women’s shot put invite title. The throw broke her own outdoor Ancient Eight record, continuing her record-setting season.
The sophomore was not the only successful field athlete on the weekend, as senior Taylor DuPont placed seventh in the shot put with a season best 12.2 meter mark. Classmate Hannah Mayer placed sixth in the javelin invite with a mark of 45.08.
On the men’s side, junior Spencer Lemons tied for fourth in the high jump with a height of 2.02 meters. The field athletes weren’t the only ones to achieve success this weekend, with various athletes demonstrating their talent on the track.
The female sprinters left their mark both on the record books and the meet, as senior Danielle Barbian finished seventh in the 100-meter dash and moved to fourth in the program record books with a 24.29 second performance in the 200 meter dash. Junior Christi Scott came close behind with an all-time fifth-best 24.39 mark.
The success continued in the 400 meter hurdles, where sophomore Jade Miller was edged for the title, finishing second with a time of 57.67. Classmate Jackie Modesett placed ninth with a personal best 59.87 mark, the fourth-best time in school history. Modesett recorded another personal best in the 100 meter hurdles, placing third in Harvard history with a time of 13.76.
Miller’s performance proved to be especially successful as the sophomore makes her way back from an injury which prevented her from running most of the indoor season.
“I’m really happy because I’m just coming off an injury,” Miller said. “It’s really nice to get back to my race and feel confident running it despite having to stop running for an elongated period of time before this [race].”
In the 4x400 relay, Miller, junior Madison Hansen, Modesett and Scott combined to take home a 3:42.67 finish, the sixth-fastest in Harvard history.
In the distance portion, sophomore Sarah Gillespie ran a personal best 4:21.04 in the 1,500 meter run to establish herself. She was joined in the record books by seniors Molly Renfer and Whitney Thornburg, whose performances in the 5,000 meter race notched them the fifth and sixth-place finishes in the Crimson record books with times of 16:25.83 and 16:27.18, respectively.  Rookie Courtney Smith set a collegiate personal record with a 16:46.74 finish.
On the men’s side, junior Tom Purnell’s 3:47.99 1,500-meter performance ranked him eighth in program history, while freshman Gabe Montague set a personal record with a time of 3:53.29.
In the multi-events, junior Mark Hill set a personal record for the decathlon with a point total of 6,008, the fourth highest in the Harvard record books. In the women’s heptathlon, Hansen’s score of 5,070 was good for fourth place overall and classmate Allison Morrison set a personal best with a score of 4.972, the seventh-highest in program history.
The strong all-around showing at UVA reaffirmed the program’s focus on maintaining a strong squad all around, which Saretsky was pleased with.
“I think it shows the depth of our team,” Saretsky said. “We take a lot of pride in being a complete track and field program, so we want to be able to be competitive in all the events and we were able to display that this past weekend.”
MIT SEAN COLLIER INVITE
Competing down the river at neighboring MIT, the Crimson had a five athletes place in the top-10.
Sophomore Alex Kirby and freshman Randy Raymond placed seventh and eighth, respectively, in the 400-meter run, while Kirby also placed tenth in the javelin.
The other top-10 finishes of the day were proved by senior Fred Ward, who took eighth in the 1,500, rookie Tomoya Hasegawa—ninth in the 100-meter dash—and freshman Lucia Alexander, who took fourth in the women’s high jump.
Harvard continues its season next week at the prestigious Penn Relays, which attracts a crowd upwards of 40,000 people and the Brown Springtime Invitational, before heading down to Philadelphia just two weeks later to compete at Heps.
With Heps comes pressure for both teams, as the men look to take home the title while the women look to defend it. While the expectations are high, Miller believes that the support the athletes have for each other—as well as the balance shown this weekend—will play a big role in preparing the team for the upcoming challenge.
“I would say the [team] is very supportive,” Miller said. “We all understand that one person alone can’t win this team title, we all understand that we’re all parts of something bigger and better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­This past weekend in Princeton, N.J., the Harvard women’s rugby team battled heat, injuries, and a trio of opponents at the Ivy 7’s Championship. Although the Crimson reached the semifinals, two defeats at the end of the day consigned Harvard to a fourth-place finish.
“We were playing with some new combinations on the field,” sophomore Claire Collins said. “We made big steps as a team even if that didn’t show up in the standings of the tournament.”
DARTMOUTH 15, HARVARD 0
For the past several weeks, co-captain Kaleigh Henry could only watch from the sidelines as her Crimson side bounced from sevens match to sevens match.
But with seconds left in the first half of Harvard’s consolation match against Dartmouth and with Henry’s injury finally healed, the senior had a chance to do something more than watch. She collected the ball and embarked on a long run, keeping possession until she was near the line. Then, a Big Green fullback dragged her down to end the half.
In the final match of the day, not even Henry could evade the Dartmouth defense, and the Big Green shut down the Crimson. Dartmouth held a single-try advantage after the first seven minutes, but this lead soon expanded thanks to a pair of second-period scores. When the final whistle sounded, the margin had grown.
“The place that we got in the tournament does not accurately reflect how we feel we played,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “Only a few little mistakes makes the score look drastically wider than it actually is.”
PRINCETON 26, HARVARD 5
In a semifinal match against the eventual champions Princeton, Harvard’s fate was determined not by open-field brilliance but rather by the gritty violence of a ruck. Early in the second half, the Tigers held a 7-5 lead when a fight for the ball developed. Princeton emerged with possession and the ball carrier found space to run, sprinting all the way through the line for the team’s second try of the game. A pair of late scores cemented the victory, as the Tigers advanced to the title game.
“Obviously it’s not the result that we wanted, but we’re not discouraged at all,” Collins said. “We’re ready to practice and ready to finish our season on a high note.”
Junior Lydia Burns provided the Crimson’s lone outburst of the day midway through the opening period. Henry, Burns, and freshman Dalton Youngblood combined for the sequence that sprung Burns free across the field.
“It was very consistent improvement throughout the day,” Collins said. “We just couldn’t pull it out at the end of the day.”
HARVARD 22, YALE 0
In the last regular-play match of the competition, Harvard’s Tessa Muss led the way.
The freshman’s first try put the Crimson on the board for the first time at 5-0; her second try expanded the lead to 17-0. Facing elimination from the tournament, Harvard stayed alive, wiping out the Bulldogs, 22-0. Burns and sophomore Mariah Turner also scored for the Crimson in the team’s highest-scoring performance of the event. However, Harvard’s defense proved the star of the match.
“We were putting forth a lot of effort and really playing hard,” Collins said. “We were going hard into contact, trying to get into the open space.”
DARTMOUTH 26, HARVARD 14
Down 26-0 with minutes left in the first match of the day, the Crimson faced the prospect of not only defeat but also blank-slate embarrassment.
Evidently Burns and Muss thought otherwise.
With a pair of late scores, the duo broke the shutout and cut into the margin. However, the effort could not prevent defeat, as Harvard fell, 26-14, to Dartmouth.
“There was some really incredible and inspirational play that happened, which makes us very optimistic moving forward,” Kantor said. “The connections on the field get better every single time we play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a harsh winter, greens were finally green in New England for the Harvard men’s golf team as it traveled to New Haven, Conn., this weekend. The Crimson competed in the annual Yale Spring Invitational, placing sixth out of 14 schools with a combined score of 26-over 867.
The invite featured three rounds of play over the two days, with 36 holes being played on Saturday and an additional 18 holes taking place Sunday morning. Wake Forest finished play as the tournament champion, posting a cumulative team performance of 15 strokes under par. The Demon Deacons were the only team able to finish under par for the tournament.
On the individual side, Crimson sophomore Kendrick Vinar came away tied for 12th at four strokes over par. Not far behind was freshman Greg Royston at five over par, which was good enough for a tie for 14th place. Royston again shot a 70 in round three.
“I hit the ball the best I’ve hit it so far this year,” Royston said. “I’ve been working hard the entire season and trying to make my game as strong as possible knowing that we have our most important tournaments coming up.”
In addition to Royston and Vinar, the five-man Harvard scoring team was also comprised of sophomore Daniel De La Garza, junior Rohan Ramnath, and captain Akash Mirchandani. De La Garza finished tied for 21st, shooting seven over par. Ramnath’s plus-11 placed him in a tie for 38th, while Mirchandani shot a plus-18 to earn him a share of 58th place.
Coming in second place was Clemson, a whopping 28 shots behind the Demon Deacons. Among Ancient Eight contingents, Yale led the pack. The Bulldogs came in fifth place overall at plus-26, just one shot ahead of Harvard. Also participating representing the Ivy League was Brown, which finished in 13th with a plus-61.
The Yale Golf Course sports a par of 70 and total yardage of 6,775. In 1988, Golf Magazine included the course on its list of the 100 most difficult courses to play in the world.
The top four players at the event all hailed from Wake Forest, paced by junior David Womble. Womble’s six-under 204 put him two strokes ahead of freshman teammate Paul McBride. Bulldogs freshman Jonathan Lai was the only Ivy Leaguer to finish play under par. His score of 209 put him at one-under for the tournament.
“This tournament featured the strongest field of teams we’ve been up against all year,” said Royston. “We played against a lot of upper-echelon players. It was a great opportunity to show us where our game is at in this point of the season.”
Weather conditions at Yale were much better than what the Crimson have seen at their other spring invites, with sunshine and moderate temperatures dominating. But course conditions posed a challenge for play, especially with regards to putting.
“The greens at Yale are quite tough,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “They’re big and extremely undulating and there a lot of micro breaks in different parts of the green.”
Other schools fielding squads at the Spring Invitational were Virginia, Duke, Virginia Tech, Michigan St., UConn, Hartford, Towson, and Boston College. Yale, the host, was the only competing school that fielded two teams.
This invite was the last tune-up for the Crimson before it heads to Saucon Valley Country Club in Bethlehem, Pa., next weekend for the Ivy Championships. A trip to NCAA regionals will be on the line.
“I’m very confident in our team going forward,” Rhoads said. “This is a talented, motivated, hardworking group that has done everything that it can to be ready. Obviously anything can happen at a tournament, but I think our play is at the top of the league.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sailing took on four regattas this weekend, with contingents competing at Yale, Connecticut College, Boston College, and Northeastern. The Crimson took second place at the Owen/Mosbacher/Knapp Trophy, third at the Oberg Trophy, fourth in the Savin Central Series Four, and seventh at the Thompson Trophy.
OWEN/MOSBACHER/KNAPP TROPHY
Harvard came in second of 18 teams in the regatta at Yale, racing in 420s.
In the A division, senior skipper Brian Drumm and junior crew Jacob Brandt led the team to a third place finish, behind host Yale and St. Marys. Juniors skipper Andrew Mollerus and crew Sydney Karnovsky held down the B division, coming in second.
Sailors contended with conditions ranging from no wind to sizeable gusts.
OBERG TROPHY
Another Crimson squad competed on the Charles, at the Oberg Trophy hosted at Northeastern. The team sailed in FJs and Fireflies, finishing third of 13 teams.
In the A division, freshman skipper Nick Sertl and sophomore crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj tied for second with Roger Williams, slating 59 points. The duo of sophomore skipper Matthew Mollerus and freshman crew Ariana Gross slipped to fourth in the B division, while sophomore skipper Bennett Capozzi and junior Adam Brodheim reeled in third in the C division.
The wind on the Charles faired pretty weak—a new challenge after weeks of racing in cold, gusty conditions.
SAVIN HILL CENTRAL SERIES FOUR
Harvard also competed at BC, where the team came in fourth of seventeen teams with 181 points. Teams sailed in 420s.
A division freshman skipper Taylor Ladd and junior crew Kristina Jakobson came in sixth, while the freshman due of skipper Dylan Farrell and Kirstin Anderson slated fifth place overall in the B division. Farrell and Anderson started with a rough start, but managed to pull themselves, and the team to fourth with five top-three finishes late in the weekend.
THOMPSON TROPHY
Yet another squad of Crimson sailors traveled to Connecticut College, where the team finished seventh of 18 teams from all across the United States. Sailing in 420s, Harvard competed against teams from Florida, California, and everywhere in between, including Jacksonville, UC Santa Barbara, and Wisconsin.
In the A division, senior skipper Michael Drumm and freshman crew Kevin Coakley took 13th. Another 13th place came from senior skipper Gram Slattery and sophomore crew Julia Lord in B division.
The performance in the C division drastically improved the Crimson’s standing, with junior skipper Marek Zaleski and senior crew Rebecca Frankel taking first with 49 points—a full 25 lower than second place Old Dominion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team solidified its second-place standing in the Ivy League this weekend, picking up two conference victories against foes Yale and Brown.
While Columbia’s wins over Princeton and Penn clinched the Lions’ second straight Ivy crown, the No. 34 Crimson (19-6, 5-1 Ivy) made strides towards earning a fourth straight NCAA Tournament appearance with the wins over the Bulldogs and Bears. Harvard lost to Columbia, 5-2, back on Apr. 5.
This weekend, the Crimson traveled to New Haven, Conn., defeating archrival Yale on Friday, 5-2, before returning to Cambridge and taking down Brown on Senior Day by the same score.
“It was a great senior day,” co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “Our class has been through a lot together. We’ve had four great season’s together, and we’re hoping we can make this one last as long as possible.”
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
On Sunday, the Crimson easily handled the Bears (15-7, 1-5), who sit tied with the Bulldogs for sixth in the Ancient Eight. In Harvard’s final home match of the season, it was finally warm enough to play outdoors at the Beren Tennis Center, and the squad celebrated seniors Steinroeder, co-captain Denis Nguyen, Shaun Chaudhuri, and Henry Steer.
In doubles, the team mixed up the lineup, going with some all-new doubles pairings. Nevertheless, the Crimson was still able to earn the doubles point. Junior Nicky Hu and sophomore Sebastian Beltrame claimed first doubles, 7-5, while Nguyen moved down to the second court and teamed with freshman Grant Solomon, winning 6-3.
Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 explained the reasoning behind the team’s switching the doubles pairings.
“Sometimes, you just get stale,” Fish said. “You have to shake it up if they’re not producing. If guys are playing with each other and something doesn’t go well, the other guy can end up feeling guilty. It turned out well.”
In singles, the two co-captains carried the Crimson to victory in a match in which there was never in doubt. No. 39 Nguyen came back from a first-set deficit to win in three sets after the match was decided, and Steinroeder clinched the match for Harvard with a 6-3, 7-5 victory.
In the other contests, Hu won, 6-3, 6-3, at No. 2, while freshman Kenny Tao won his sixth straight dual match, 6-2, 6-1, on the sixth court.
Winning the doubles point was unfamiliar territory for the Crimson in recent times, as Harvard has not claimed the opening advantage since its first Ivy match against Cornell.
“The team has gotten used to being under pressure, coming into singles being down a point,” Fish said. “Today, we almost didn’t know what to do with that point, and some guys didn’t come out strong. Maybe we’re better with our backs against the wall.”
HARVARD 5, YALE 2
On Friday, the Crimson sent Yale (11-11, 1-5) to a 5-2 defeat on its home courts, coming back to deliver a quick victory even after falling behind in doubles.
Nguyen and Yeung, playing in their traditional top spot, were upset, 6-2, on court 1, and Solomon and fellow freshman Jean Thirouin lost by the same score at third doubles.
Despite coming in at a disadvantage, Harvard was able to eventually come away with five singles victories. Nguyen’s loss on the top court was the Crimson’s only blemish on the scoresheet.
Hu dominated the Bulldogs’ Martin Svenning, 6-2, 6-0, and Beltrame also earned a straight-set win. Tao came back from a first-set loss to win, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, and Steinroeder closed out the match with a 6-0, 4-6, 6-2 finish.
Harvard took care of business on a weekend in which its Ivy hopes died out, but saw its NCAA chances remain strong. The Crimson has one remaining conference match against Dartmouth next weekend.
“We moved closer to our goal of finishing second,” Fish said. “If we finish second in Ivies, it’s pretty definite that we’ll get into NCAAs. If we lose to Dartmouth, who knows? We have just as much on the line as Dartmouth does, and it’ll make for a terrific end-of-the-season matchup.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team hosted Yale on Friday and traveled to Brown on Sunday in search of its first Ivy League wins of the season.
The search continues.
Despite singles victories from four different players, the Crimson (7-11, 0-6 Ivy) fell 4-3 to both the Bulldogs (9-10, 3-3) and the Bears (10-9, 3-3).
“Everyone fought hard and we came very close,” coach Traci Green said. “We keep tasting victory and I think we’re getting closer. We competed to the last point as hard as we could.”
BROWN 4, HARVARD 3
After a rare day off on Saturday, the Crimson traveled to Providence to take on Brown. Just as on Friday, the team fell one match short. The team has dropped six straight games in conference play.
Harvard lost the all-important doubles point to start the day. Sophomore June Lee and junior Amanda Lin fell but freshman Ellen Jang-Milsten and junior Amy He picked up their second consecutive doubles win, 8-5, to set up a showdown in the final doubles match of the day. With the match tied 6-6, Bears Alyza Benotto and Dayna Lord rallied to take the last two points and the victory over sophomore Monica Lin and freshman Annika Ringblom.
“I think we still really need to work on starting quicker and not having slow starts,” Lee said. “I think that’s one thing that a lot of the other teams have, right when they walk into the building, you feel a different energy.”
Freshman Ellen Jang-Milsten continued her hot streak in Ivy League play with a 6-3, 6-0 victory. The first-year has won each of her last three singles matches. Losses by Lee and sophomore Monica Lin gave the hosts a 3-1 lead they would not relinquish.
“Ellen is a very special player,” Green said. “She’s very mentally tough. She’s been really maturing over the last few months. It’s very nice to see her game start to come together and she’s reaped the benefit of all of her hard work.”
He won her second match of the day to get the Crimson within one match, but Benotto sealed the deal for the Bears with a three-set victory over Ringblom. Amanda Lin wrapped up a 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 victory over Brown junior Ammu Mandalap, but it was not enough as Harvard fell to the Bears for the first time since 2011.
YALE 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard fell short in its fifth straight Ivy League match, with Friday’s contest marking the closest the team has come to winning in conference play so far this season. The Crimson was able to pick up the doubles point but was outscored in singles action, 4-2.
Jang-Milsten led the way for Harvard on Friday, picking up singles and doubles victories over Yale. The Alpharetta, Ga., native took out Bulldogs sophomore Sherry Li in straight sets and teamed up with He to defeat Yale captain Hanna Yu and freshman Valerie Shklover, 8-1.
The Crimson was able to secure the doubles point after sophomore Monica Lin and first-year Annika Ringblom defeated the Bulldogs junior duo of Madeleine Hamilton and Ree Ree Li. Lee picked up Harvard’s other singles victory with a 2-6, 7-6, 7-5 come-from-behind win over Sherry Li. Lee’s victory came from the fouth slot, as she was the highest seed to notch a singles win for the Crimson. Jang-Milsten picked up her win from the fifth spot.
Also bouncing back from an injury was Kallenberg who missed both of last weekend’s matches. The freshman was back in the top spot for the Crimson but fell in straight sets to Yu and re-aggravated her injury.
Ringblom, the only Harvard singles player to pick up a victory against Princeton last weekend, fell on Friday to Ree Ree Li, 6-4, 6-4. Monica Lin, playing from the second spot, and Amanda Lin, the Crimson’s sixth singles player, both took their matches to three sets before eventually falling. This is the second year in a row that Harvard has lost to Yale and the fourth time in the last five years.
“There’s so much parity right now in the Ivy League, a lot of gridlock amongst the teams,” Green said. “Our team has shown a lot of improvement. It’s been tough to reap the rewards on the scoreboard but overall what we’re really proud of is the way our students are representing Harvard and fighting the whole season regardless of where we are in the standings.”

For those of you who have started camping out in Lamont to prep for finals, you may not know about a new problem that has gone viral. For those who want to know more about the new thing after White Dress, Blue Dress, we have some answers for you.
Who is Cheryl, and what’s her problem?
Cheryl is a girl who got sick of the ol’ “Harvard Intro” in a controversial logic problem originating from Singapore. The logic problem (shown above) is referred to as “Cheryl’s Birthday”, and it is a struggle to figure it out. But it is a bigger struggle to think about what is wrong with Cheryl.  Why is she so secretive about her birthday?
Why do we care?
Because as Harvard students, we are very intelligent and love to solve hard problems. Also at first, people thought this brainteaser was intended for middle school students.
People were worried that Singapore was forcing middle school kids to do impossible math problems. The creators of the puzzle, the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiads (SAMSO), later clarified that the problem was actually part of a test given to sophomore and juniors in high school.
So if you haven’t figured out the answer yet, don’t feel too bad; just think about it as an extra SLS 20 problem.
So, what is the answer?
In response to global interest and many arguments, SAMSO has released an official solution to the problem. According to them, July 16 is the right answer. Well, great. I guess we can pack up our bags and move on, right?
Well, can we move on? Let’s call it a day?
Not so fast. Like the controversy with #thedress, there seems to be a lot of people who argue that SAMSO is actually wrong.
The “alternative answer” is August 17th. Their argument? “How the heck does Albert know that Bernard doesn’t know Cheryl’s birthday?” For those of you who want the detailed explanation, The Guardian has one here.
In the end, the difference comes down to a small technicality: did Albert know (alternative answer) or did he deduce (original answer) that Bernard doesn’t know Cheryl’s birthday?
This thought process has led to many people arguing that the answer is in fact August 17th. However, on their facebook page, SAMSO has already declared that this “alternative answer” as being wrong.
Wait, if SASMO says they’re wrong, isn’t that it?
That depends. As the New York Times has pointed out, this logic puzzle is quite convoluted. Given the way SASMO has written the question, either answer could arguably be right. It’s like that one problem on a final that was written badly by your professor or your TF. Either way, you hope you can still get those extra points.

The Harvard First-Year Social Committee has been on a roll this semester organizing fun and creatively named events such as “Love is in the Scare” and “New Kids on the Block.” This past Thursday’s event, called “After Hours at the Harvard Art Museums” was no exception.
“After Hours” offered freshmen the chance to realize their lifelong dreams of re-living the plot of the fabulous children’s book “From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.” Nothing is more thrilling than staring at a couple of Van Goghs and medieval capitals past hours of operation and pretending you’ve illicitly snuck into a museum past closing time.
Food:
The event started with a reception in Sever Quad at 8:30 p.m. that was plentifully stocked with the basics. What’s not to like about chocolate-chip cookies and brownies? The spread also included veggies and dip, allowing freshmen who pigged out the chance to feel less terrible about all the ‘zerts they had just consumed.
Ambience: 
Classy, but kind of not. The invitation said “chic attire encouraged,” but many freshmen did not get the hint. The result: a tent filled with people dressed in everything from blazers and spring dresses to noobs in sweaty gym clothes (hint: me).
People started to move into the Museum at 9:00. You could feel the excitement in the air, as many freshmen admitted that they had never even paid a visit to the Harvard Art Museums before. Many went to explore the various galleries, while others hob-knobbed with the likes of Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67  and other resident deans. A talented quartet from the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra played classical music in the background. They were followed by a much more casual, but just as delightful guitar jam session.
Entertainment: 
Excellent. A new work by Carlos Amorales entitled “Triangle Constellation,” hangs from the ceiling of the Museums’ Calderwood Courtyard and provoked many questions: Is it rotated or am I just imagining things? Will it play music like a real triangle? What does it all mean? To top things off, Dean Dingman and the artist themselves christened the artwork.
All in all, “After Hours” was a great event. It offered a fun opportunity in the midst of midterm season for freshmen to relax, while enjoying the newly built Harvard Art Museums. Keep up the good work HFYSC! We cannot wait to see what is in store for Freshman Formal.
