After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 23, 2016, at 2:15 p.m.
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde will leave his position on Feb. 1 after less than three years in the post and will no longer be an employee of Harvard College.
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana announced Lassonde’s departure in an email to undergraduates late Friday afternoon. In the brief message, Khurana wrote that Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 will serve as the interim dean of student life. Dingman said he will continue to serve in his current post at the Freshman Dean’s Office as well. Khurana did not provide an explanation for Lassonde’s unexpected departure, but thanked him for his service to Harvard. 
When reached by phone late Friday afternoon, Lassonde, who lives in Mather House, said he was not available to comment. His assistant, Dorothy Villarreal ’15, also declined to comment.
“I will miss Harvard and all it affords and I will, particularly miss you students,”Lassonde wrote Saturday in an email to The Crimson.
The departure appears sudden; Khurana did not specify when the College would appoint a permanent replacement. In a Jan 19. letter shared with Currier House residents, Khurana wrote that Lassonde would lead the search for new House masters.
“Additionally, in February, Dean Lassonde and I will be hosting community meetings in Currier to understand its particular needs,” Khurana wrote at the time. Khurana invited students to reach out to Lassonde about the search process.
As of Friday evening, Lassonde was slated to teach a history seminar on childhood in America this semester, according to Harvard's course catalog. By Saturday morning, the directory no longer listed that course. While Lassonde did not specifically comment on the course, he wrote in the email that “I especially loved teaching in the History Department which takes its teaching mission so seriously.”
The course, which was most recently offered last spring, received an overall score of “5” on the Q guide, the College’s course and instructor evaluation system. A 5 is the highest score a course can receive.
Dingman would not offer comment on Lassonde’s departure from his post and deferred requests to College spokesperson Rachael Dane, who declined to comment beyond the contents of Khurana’s email. She later clarified that Lassonde will no longer be an employee of Harvard College beginning Feb. 1.
Lassonde is an active member of Mather House and occasionally hosts House-wide study breaks.
Mather House Master Michael D. Rosengarten said that he learned of Lassonde’s departure from Khurana’s email.
“We are so surprised,” Rosengarten said.
The Dean of Student Life oversees an office with a host of administrators who manage student extracurriculars, housing assignments, and residential tutors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After winning just its second true road game of the year, the Harvard men’s basketball team (9-8, 1-0 Ivy) will put its three-game winning streak on the line when it travels to Hanover to take on Dartmouth (6-9, 0-1) in the second half of its conference-opening home-and-home with the Big Green. Beat writer David Freed lists three things to watch.
TURN TO UPPERCLASSMEN
As the calendar turns to the Ivy League season, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker is notorious about shortening his bench and relying on upperclassmen. With the exception of the 2012-2013 season, when the team had just two upperclassmen (Laurent Rivard ’14 and Christian Webster ’13) in the rotation, Harvard has frequently limited its underclassmen to spot duty during Ivy League play. Even junior Zena Edosomwan, a starter last year, played just 13.5 minutes a game during Ancient Eight play. In the last seven contests of the year, he played more than 10 minutes once.
The emergence of senior Patrick Steeves brings up questions about how Amaker will manage the minutes of his youthful squad. The coach has already proved willing to yank freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy early for junior Corbin Miller, who provides steadier, albeit less creative, play. Increased playing time for Steeves, whose 9.6 points a game rank second on the team behind Edosomwan, may knock both sophomore Andre Chatfield and freshman Weisner Perez to the fringes of the rotation.
CHANGING IN THE GUARD
One of the dominant early-season trends for the Crimson has been the change in offense from last year. After having only three passable three-point threats a year ago—all of whom rarely saw playing time together—Harvard has significantly improved spacing a year later. Miller and freshman Corey Johnson have been long-range machines, shooting a combined 41 percent on 12 attempts a game. With Steeves shooting 53 percent and McCarthy boasting a respectably 36 percent mark, Harvard has had excellent spacing.
The improved spacing has put teams in a defensive bind regarding Edosomwan, the only Ivy League player averaging a double-double. Throwing double teams at Edosomwan, as Dartmouth did in the last matchup, has not proven successful. The junior has evolved into a more adept passer, ranking fourth on the Crimson in assists per game, and excels at finding the open man. In the last matchup with the Big Green, he had six assists as Harvard shot 53 percent from the field and 50 percent from three in one of its best offensive performances of the year. In the rematch, look for Dartmouth to stick more closely to the Crimson’s shooters.
A THIN BENCH
When the two teams last met, Dartmouth got 65 percent of its production from its two stellar underclassmen—sophomore wing Miles Wright and freshman forward Evan Boudreaux. The early favorite for Ivy League rookie of the year took it to Edosomwan and captain Evan Cummins inside, finishing with 21 points and 10 rebounds, including a pair of late threes to keep the Big Green in the game. Wright shot a blistering five of eight from three and took advantage when senior wing Agunwa Okolie came off the floor, making all four of his shots.
In the rematch, Dartmouth will need more production from the rest of its team, however. Senior Connor Boehm will especially be called on to shoot better than his one for eight performance in Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HAMILTON, N.Y.—Coming off a four-goal defeat at the hands of last-place Clarkson last weekend, Harvard men’s hockey coach Ted Donato elected to shake up his lines Friday night, even sending his second line out to take the opening faceoff against Colgate at Starr Rink.
But amid all the skipper’s mixing and matching, the line making the most noise was the one that remained untouched. Top-liners Alex Kerfoot, Kyle Criscuolo, and Jimmy Vesey all lit the lamp for the Crimson, lifting No. 9/8 Harvard (10-4-3, 6-3-3 ECAC) to a 4-2 win over the Raiders (7-15-2, 3-7-2).
“That was absolutely a huge win for us,” junior forward Sean Malone said. “Losing three of our last four, we knew we had to come out and get the job done tonight and get the two points.”
“I thought we played more to our identity than we have in the last few games,” Donato ’91 added.
With the score knotted at two midway through the second, Criscuolo’s 100th career point put the Crimson ahead for good. Less than 30 seconds into Harvard’s first power play of the night, junior defenseman Victor Newell fed senior left wing Colin Blackwell atop the left circle, and the fifth-year forward blasted a shot toward goaltender Charlie Finn.
Standing in the netminder’s line of vision, however, was Criscuolo, who tipped home the shot while jawing for position with defenseman Jake Kulevich, lifting the co-captain to the century mark and putting the Crimson in front, 3-2.
The assist from Blackwell, meanwhile, was one of two on the night for the North Andover native, who also set up Malone for Harvard’s first goal of the night just over three minutes into the contest.
Blackwell darted up the left wing before putting the brakes on atop the left circle, but rookie defenseman Ken Citron gave the senior no room to work with as he looked to get a shot away. After failing twice, Blackwell crashed to the ice, but not before managing to nudge the puck with his stick down the slot.
Waiting atop the crease was Malone—promoted to second-line center for Friday’s tilt—who took control of the slow-moving puck. Moving from right to left on the goalmouth, the Sabres draft pick slid his way around Finn and put home his fourth goal of the season from the goaltender’s right post.
“I thought Sean was a major factor all game using his speed,” Donato said. “We want to have a lot of depth to our offense, and certainly tonight with the way Sean was going and the way Colin Blackwell was going, it really makes us a much more dangerous team.”
Just over a minute after Malone put the Crimson on the board, Colgate’s captain retaliated. Initiating the attack in the Harvard end, sophomore forward Mike Panowyk sent defenseman Victor Newell to the ground with a shifty move along the right wing, giving the second-liner space to send a centering pass to his left.
Amid a sea of surrounding sticks, captain Mike Borkowski won the battle for the puck on the doorstep, grabbing it and backhanding a shot past goaltender Merrick Madsen to even the score at one.
Borkowski was far from finished. Kerfoot sent the Crimson into the first intermission with a 2-1 edge after batting home a second-chance opportunity in front of Finn at 7:30, but the second-line center equalized yet again less than a minute into the middle frame.
Taking a cross-ice pass from junior defenseman Brett Corkey low inside the right circle, Borkowski beat Madsen without a defenseman in sight, moving the captain into the team lead with 11 goals on the year—one ahead of senior forward Tyson Spink, who leads the Raiders with 25 points on the season.
But ultimately it was Harvard’s pair of captains who clinched a victory. Criscuolo’s 13th goal of the season gave the Crimson its third one-goal edge of the night, and an empty-netter from Vesey at 19:17 put the cap on the visitors’ 4-2 victory.
With the goal, Vesey extended his point streak to seven games despite his second consecutive night with just two shots. He now sits just one goal and one point shy of No. 1/1 Quinnipiac’s Sam Anas for first in the ECAC in both categories.
While Harvard’s top point-getter had a quiet night in the shot department, the Crimson generated 39 as a team—its fourth-highest output this season—to Colgate’s 27. Harvard now sits third in the conference, one point ahead of No. 10/10 Cornell, whom the Crimson will meet Saturday night at Lynah Rink.
