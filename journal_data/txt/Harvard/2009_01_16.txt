After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a Saturday in 1982 the Harvard Crimson published a story on a student-led march against violent crime in Black neighborhoods organized by a group of Black Christian undergraduates at Harvard in the William J. Seymour Society. This initiative foreshadowed over two decades of work conducted by Black student intellectual activists who were concerned about the growing problem of Black-on-Black violence and what was then becoming known as the Black underclass. At that time an ad hoc coalition of Black churchmen, in collaboration with the Nation of Islam and other grass roots activist began a series of fora to address the issue. These initiatives, reported in both the Boston Globe and the Harvard Crimson were, amusingly, never reported in any of the research which evolved into a cottage industry, on what came to be known as the Boston Miracle. Yet there was a direct connection between the Harvard based initiatives and the subsequent organizing efforts of the late eighties that involved first white mainline Episcopal, Unitarian and United Church of Christ churches, and then the Black churches in the nineties in focusing upon the explosion of violence related to the crack epidemic.
More than one analyst predicted that the violence would only intensify as a demographic surge led to a large group of children entering their teenage years by 2006. In 1996 there were approximately 23,000 teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 in Boston. In 2006 there were close to 30,000. The predicted spike in violent crime has become real, but little preparation had been made to meet the challenge. One important political truth which cannot be overemphasized is that no amount of federal, state or municipal intervention can serve as a substitute for effective parenting and adult supervision in the lives of children. Aggressive, targeted law enforcement is necessary but insufficient.  
There is in analytic terms a deeper moral and cultural crisis that overshadows the lives of the poorest children in our most isolated inner city neighborhoods. There are major structural barriers which retard the development of Black inner city communities: joblessness, social isolation, social decay and discrimination. But in addition to all this these communities are in the midst of a kulturekamph of Black-on-Black violence which is a direct result of the political crisis of fatherlessness. At the root of the instability of the Black ghettos is the fact that there is not a functional patrilineal system that governs the communal life by physically maintaining order as occurs in other working class neighborhoods, regardless of race or ethnicity. When the fathers are absent, as a political fact of life in communities, disorder and chaos follow. The lack of male role models perpetuate the problem and leave women and children emotionally and physically vulnerable.  For anyone who bothers to walk the unforgiving streets of the poorest black neighborhoods in any mid-sized or large city in the United States, this is obvious.
There is a contest between the forces of disorder and anomie and the forces of order and the rule of law. Since the mid-1970’s the Black community has been in a cultural civil war drawn largely, although not exclusively, along class lines until very recently when the Black middle class was sucked into the fray. The macro-structural socio-economic sources of this conflict were brilliantly documented in William Julius Wilson’s 1978 essay The Declining Significance of Race, which appeared just as the political and geographic isolation of the Black underclass from the middle and upper classes was being institutionalized. This cultural decay now affects almost all social classes but is most damaging in the lives of our poorest children. Here we have a generation of children imprisoned in very poor black neighborhood and left to die. It is clear that in Massachusetts cities like Boston, Brockton and Randolph a generation of very poor and very young Black youth are in violent rebellion against fatherlessness and by large extension law and order. As I as a piece published in the Boston Globe, “this largely unacknowledged crisis is part of a larger international narrative: from Kingston to London from Los Angeles to Chicago, we are witnessing the globalization of ‘thug life’…this phenomenon has emerged as a powerful symbol of the cultural and political decay of Black civil society.”
What then is to be done? First there must be a basic recognition that generally speaking law enforcement will at best contain, as opposed to preventing, violent crime. As violent youthful offenders become younger, violent crime is likely to become more unpredictable and anarchic and therefore more difficult to control. This last point cannot be stressed enough. In other words, when an eleven-year-old child brings a semi-automatic weapon into an elementary school, and Bloods and Crips are recruiting in middle schools we have new challenges that cannot be addressed without leadership from the neighborhoods. Secondly, since there is currently no politically impartial forum sponsored by any state or municipal agency or university that engages the political realities of black youth violence on the ground the larger community must develop independent fora to effectively engage this issue. 
For example Paul S. Grogan of the Boston Foundation should, with university and community partners, convene a series of forums to launch a two pronged attack on the rising homicide rates among Black youth: studying the implications of this fact for local public policy and neighborhood action, second, launching a non-partisan citizens’ commission, modeled on the Chicago Crime Commission, to serve civil rights check on the secret data generated by the Boston Regional Intelligence Council which compiles “intelligence” data on alleged high-impact players involved in violent gang activity. This is important because of the potential for the work of the council to violate the civil rights of young people the overwhelming majority of whom will Black and poor. It is crucial that Harvard’s Black intelligentsia no longer permit the usual suspects of the criminal justice industry to control the policy discourse on questions of public safety that so disproportionately affect poor Black people. The Boston Foundation’s current twenty-six million dollar Street Safe initiative, led by Robert Lewis Jr., presents an excellent opportunity for Harvard undergraduates to volunteer in local community-based organizations in the effort to stem violence in the Black community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When citizens of Massachusetts voted yes in November to Question 2, the “Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative,” many of them thought that they were voting to legalize marijuana.  Because marijuana is illegal under federal, not state law, this would be impossible—states can only choose how they punish use of the drug, not whether or not it is illegal.  The new law, which was inserted into The General Laws of Massachusetts, chapter 94C, section 32L, actually reads, “possession of one ounce or less of marihuana shall only be a civil [rather than criminal] offense, subjecting an offender who is eighteen years of age or older to a civil penalty of one hundred dollars and forfeiture of the marihuana, but not to any other form of criminal or civil punishment or disqualification.” In Massachusetts that is, small-scale possession became the legal equivalent of a bad traffic ticket.  Law enforcement officers, however, worry that citizens’ first impression may prove all too close to correct—that the “marijuana ticket” will prove impossible to enforce and is thus a de facto legalization of weed.  In the short run, officers should try to enforce the law as best they can, despite the enforcement challenges that it presents; it is, after all, law.  In the long run, however, citizens and officers alike should consider the real reasons that officers hesitate to enforce the law, and what can be done to better the situation.
It is essential to uphold the integrity of the law to the degree that law enforcement officers can.  In a January 3rd article in the Boston Globe, “Police Balk at Ticketing Marijuana Offenders,” chiefs of police in the towns Clinton and Auburn stated that because of the flaws in the law’s wording, their forces would not even attempt to enforce it.  Their line of reasoning here is faulty.  Police are not hired to legislate, but to enforce legislation.  One concern voiced by Wayne Sampson, executive director of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association—that state law prohibits officers from demanding identification when dealing with civil infractions—is simply not true. Other worries, including those such as who will print the physical tickets, that current citation books lack a check-off box for marijuana possession, or that officers will be unable to identify “an ounce,” are simply laughable.  Law enforcers in Massachusetts are trained to deal with life-and-death scenarios; they should have enough initiative and creativity to improvise physical tickets in the short-run and to Wikipedia “ounce,” as anyone can do with an internet connection.  Despite enforcement issues, some users are sure to be compliant, which means that the law will be at least partially enforced.  Officers must do their best to enforce this democratically-enacted legislation, even if a few marijuana offenders will slip through the law’s loopholes.  
It is worth noting, however, that some police officers’ reluctance to enforce the law as it now reads may be because citizens of Massachusetts on whole (police included) overwhelmingly believe that marijuana use should not be considered a crime.  While it is understandable that the Massachusetts Sheriff’s Union and the Massachusetts’ Chiefs of Police Association opposed Question 2 (due of the enforcement challenges that it presents), these very organizations could make their own—and citizens’—lives much easier by supporting movements such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), which seek to remove marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act Schedule I list.  This list, which claims to include and does include drugs (1) with a high potential for addiction, (2) no medical use and (3) a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision.  Schedule I is not the right place for marijuana—a drug no more addictive than cigarettes, that very arguably has medical uses (such as an anti-nausea medication) and is not unsafe under medical supervision.  
Question 2 raises several important issues for Law Enforcement Officers in Massachusetts.  For now, officers should do the best that they can to enforce the existing laws.  Eventually, however, officers’ organizations should realize that all would benefit from removing marijuana from the controlled substances act and letting states determine the actual legality of smoking pot.  Law enforcement organizations would help citizens and themselves by getting behind the movement to legalize marijuana.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to the dramatic surge in crime in the 1960s, lawmakers across the country and at all levels of government responded with a novel and dangerous policy known today as mass incarceration. Sociologist David Garland defines mass incarceration as the policies that produce a national imprisonment rate that exceeds the historical and comparative norm for similar societies. Since then, the U.S. incarceration rate has skyrocketed to 715 per 100,000, the highest in the world (Russia is a distant second at 584 per 100,000).
We can look to changes in criminal law over the past decades to explain how we achieved this unprecedented rate. Drug crimes account for much of the increase in prison populations. In 12 years, the prison population with drug convictions leapt from 6% in 1979 to 25% in 1991 at the state level and from 25% to 56% at the federal level and these numbers continue to grow. In addition, the courts have become increasing punitive. Arrest rates increased, and defendants are convicted at higher rates for longer sentences. Mass incarceration expanded the net of criminality to include drug offenses and public order offending, such as loitering and drinking in public. It catches more people and punishes more of them more harshly, by adding drug charges, mandatory minimums, and three strikes penalties to their sentences.  
With all these policies in place, it is no wonder that correctional departments are struggling to keep up. Massachusetts specifically increased correctional spending by 127% so that it now rivals spending even on public universities. Our courts can’t keep up with the deluge of trials and appeals. And still, rather than stop and wonder whether mass incarceration is actually keeping us safe, states plunges forward blindly, building more prisons, double bunking inmates, making it even harder for people with records to get jobs and housing, and cutting rehabilitation services for people with addictions and without high school diplomas and job skills.  
Mass incarceration is not making us safer, but less so. It is nearly impossible for people with criminal records to get jobs, so they often return to crime in order to support themselves and their families. Sixty percent of former offenders recidivate (commit another crime) within 3 years of their release from prison. One in 10 black children have a parent in prison; one in three black children whose parents have no gone to college will lose a parent to prison by the time they are 14. The unemployment rate for black men is estimated between 30 and 60%, and black people are seven times more likely to go to prison that white people. The greatest crime of all is that our politicians and policymakers can look at these numbers and persist in the ignorant and unjust policies that brought them about.  
In October, the Mass. Dept. of Corrections announced that it will start double bunking inmates at Shirley Prison in order to keep up with the massive influx of inmates. Before we think about the implications of such a policy, it is more important to know what politicians are doing to stem that flow. So far, the answer is nothing. They would rather strain the state’s resources to maintain a popular and highly politicized policy that is actually hurting our state. Double bunking is exactly the sort of short term solution that will sustain the problem of mass incarceration. As long as we keep building more prisons, hiring more correctional officers, and cramming more inmates in cells built for one, we condone a flawed and unjust legal system. Politicians seem to think it is working, when all the evidence, from the inner city to within the prisons themselves, points to the contrary.  But why is this specific policy is so harmful? In addition to being symptomatic of our government’s complicity – if not its deliberate attempts – to lock up the poor black males of our cities puts too many citizens in a harsh environment.
Prisons are not safe places: they create more crime than they cure and the risk of victimization by violent or sexual assault is at least times more for people in prison than in normal society.  It is despicable that we take away people’s liberty and dignity so readily under mass incarceration. Worse, while under the state’s so-called care, they are placed in toxic, dangerous, and frightening environments, and we are surprised when they commit more crimes after their release. Increasing the number of correctional officers and placing people in solitary confinement is not going to make prisons better but worse. We ought to look at reforming the laws and prisons that produce crime, rather than persisting in this folly and injustice.
People who have committed crimes are not the dregs of society to be dispensed with as politicians deem necessary.  Policies that are unjust to criminals are still unjust in an absolute sense. Mass incarceration is not working. Correctional facilities themselves are struggling to handle this ludicrous practice of locking up our most disadvantaged citizens. At best, it is impractical and expensive. At worst, as a trip to a prison and a conversation with an inmate will prove, it is inhumane, unjust and unconscionable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard students, an unarmed robbery in the yard is cause for campus-wide alarm and Harvard University Police Department (HUPD) e-mail notification of every student.  What, then, would the response be to 46 aggravated assaults a week?  
 Apparently, the answer is a study.
Indeed, 46 aggravated assaults per week is the average number endured by only one and a half square miles, or five specific neighborhoods of Boston, a community of which Harvard is a major part.  These neighborhoods include Dudley Square, Grove Hall, the South End/Lower Roxbury, Morton and Norfolk Streets area in Dorchester, and the Bowdoin and Geneva Street area of Dorchester.
And yet, Harvard has not yet contributed financially to this initiative.
StreetSafe Boston is a new multi-year safety and youth development initiative being sponsored by the City of Boston and a number of local non-profits.  Its primary mission is to focus crime-fighting resources on roughly 6,000 young people in Boston, both violent criminals and at-risk youth.  The goals are to increase engagement of at-risk youth with community programs and services, develop a feeling of safety and security in the five targeted neighborhoods, and reduce violent crime and homicides.
StreetSafe Boston is a much-needed mixture of new and old-school approaches to helping violent and potentially violent youth.  The program, due to its unusual mixture of public and private partners, will be able to hire 25 new street workers through the Ten Point Coalition (A Boston ecumenical group of clergy and other leaders), therefore bypassing Massachusetts’ Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) laws which prohibit Boston from hiring street workers with a criminal background.
The ability to hire street workers with criminal backgrounds will hopefully bring a new and exciting energy to the street worker program.  In the 1990s, after Boston suffered a high of 151 murders in a year, an initiative similar to StreetSafe Boston was able to achieve a glorious reduction in crime now referred to as the Boston Miracle.  The street workers of this time were often former gang members or criminal offenders who were able to use their street credibility to persuade violent and potentially violent youth to choose a peaceful path.  
StreetSafe Boston will allow street workers with street credibility to return to the targeted neighborhoods, and will extend hours of operation for proven organizations operating nearby.  The idea is to use effective street workers to bring violent and at-risk youth to neighborhood organizations which can provide them with job training and other social services.  
The truly fantastic part of this six-year, $26 million initiative is that it is a generous, cohesive, public/private collaboration.  The Boston Foundation, a major funder of non-profit organizations in Boston, will be providing $1 million every year.  In addition, the State Street Foundation, United Way, the Alchemy Foundation, the Lewis Family Foundation, the Josephine and Louise Crane Foundation, the Barr Foundation, and the Baupost Group will all be supporting the program financially.
That said, Harvard’s contribution has been a study out of the Kennedy School of Government providing the statistical basis for StreetSafe Boston.  Of course, this is an important contribution, and on top of that, experts from our Sociology Department and the Kennedy School’s Criminal Justice Policy and Management program will be helping to develop and evaluate StreetSafe Boston.
But where is the cash?  Harvard certainly has the money to spare, despite the recession. Look what the Boston Foundation, not even worth one billion dollars, has promised. Harvard can do better when it comes to improving its own community.  
As both a Harvard student and a lifelong resident of the area, my lifetime here includes the Boston Miracle, and StreetSafe Boston’s remarkable similarity to action at the time of the miracle promises success.  
Now, Harvard is in a unique financial position to ensure the success of StreetSafe Boston, as well as the safety, security, and well-being of its neighbors and community members.  
Of course, Harvard can’t toss money towards every cause in the world, but there is a major problem throughout a community in which Harvard owns over 600 acres of land.  Committing research to StreetSafe Boston is not enough.  I think the wealthiest non-profit in the United States can afford to be added to the list of problem-solvers.  
I would be proud to be a part of a university which can affix its name to the list of causes of the second Boston Miracle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andrew Hatch, the former Harvard quarterback and LSU signal-caller who briefly started for the Tigers in 2008 after transferring to LSU from Harvard the previous year, is planning to transfer back to Harvard, the Associated Press is reporting. But according to Harvard's admissions office, the well-traveled athlete might not have a spot reserved for him back in Cambridge.In March of 2008, the college announced a two-year moratorium on transfer admissions due to housing limitations. That policy appears to also apply to Hatch, despite past instances of athletes transferring out and then returning. “Transfer admissions has been suspended, therefore no candidates, regardless of previous admission, are eligible to transfer to Harvard College at this time,” director of transfer admissions E. Marlene Vergara Rotner wrote in an e-mail today. The admissions office does not comment on the cases of specific students.Hatch made national headlines by starting the season opener for LSU, last year's national champions, before suffering a series of injuries that sidelined him for the second half of the year. He finished the season 25-for-45 passing for 282 yards and two touchdowns. Hatch also ran 35 times for 139 yards and two scores. There is precedent for Hatch’s return. In 2003, Zachary M. Puchtel ’05-07 transferred to Minnesota, where he played the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons as a walk-on for the basketball squad. After his eligibility expired, Puchtel returned to Harvard and received his degree. In 2002, catcher Mickey Kropf ’04-05 transferred to Vanderbilt, where he played for two seasons before returning to Cambridge. Both those transfers, however, occurred before the current moratorium took effect. —Jillian K. Kushner contributed to the reporting of this story.
