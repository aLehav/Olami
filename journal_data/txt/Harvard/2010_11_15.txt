After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given the complexities involved in running the Undergraduate Council, experience and vision are essential for successfully implementating campaign promises. For this reason, we endorse Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12 to be the next president and vice president of the UC. We support the breadth and depth of the Ebrahim-Cao platform and believe that their extensive backgrounds on the Council and track records of execution will serve the student body well.
The Ebrahim-Cao approach is grounded in pragmatism. Importantly, both candidates are well versed in the UC system. Ebrahim has been the chair of the important Student Life Committee for three semesters and has sat on the Education Committee; Cao is currently the secretary of the UC and has served on the Student Initiatives Committee and the Student Life Committee. Accordingly, Ebrahim and Cao know how to work within the UC system to effect change. Additionally, the relationships Ebrahim and Cao have forged with various members of the College administration will prove practical for implementing new ideas.
In fact, during their time on the UC, Ebrahim and Cao have had a history of accomplishment and put many programs into motion, and we hope to see similar measures continue. Their combined contributions include attempting reforms for social space, installing the Winternship program, expanding the UC TKTS program, and working with the Finance Committee to improve student events.
The Ebrahim-Cao platform addresses a multitude of issues that are relevant to the student body, and we feel that they have a concrete plan for improving the well-being of Harvard students. First, the Ebrahim-Cao campaign has expressed a desire to make better use of social space on campus—an aspiration that has long been suggested with negligible results. This time, however, there is a significant difference: With Ebrahim-Cao’s definitive plans regarding large venues, off-campus venues, and house spaces, it seems that reform may be implementable. One of the new proposals includes a fund to help organizations afford large venues, which will make holding large events considerably easier. Additionally, the ticket’s plans to free up house spaces such as junior common rooms will make it easier for organizations to hold meetings.
Ebrahim-Cao’s proposals to improve Winter Break are also appealing. The creation of a real “J-Term” has so far proved unsuccessful, and the ticket appears determined to change this. Notably, Ebrahim-Cao has put forth a plan to increase funding for international programs and to expand the Winternships program, leading to easier ways for students to get jobs during the cold months. Although creating a full-blown J-Term right away may be implausible, we hope that Ebrahim-Cao will be able to set the stage for long-term improvement.
Furthermore, we believe Ebrahim-Cao’s stance on the independence of student organizations is admirable. Given the seemingly draconian anti-alcohol rules that plague the College today, we feel their plans to reestablish trust between organizations and University Hall will result in better social opportunities for organization members while also maintaining the rule of law. Working within the system seems to be the best way to bring about compromise, and we feel that mindset is one of the strengths of the Ebrahim-Cao ticket.
Additionally, we approve of the ticket’s acknowledgement of less visible issues on campus. Ebrahim-Cao’s platform’s wide approach addresses many ongoing and often-neglected issues, such as sexual assault, safety, and student group independence. In particular, the UC should consider how to reduce sexual assault on campus; it has a particular advantage because it is student-led and in touch with students’ lives.
Moreover, the Ebrahim-Cao campaign has remained mindful of other problems like shuttle schedules and hot breakfast, which have been part of UC campaigns in the past but were not actually solved. Ebrahim and Cao seem committed to resuming work on issues where former UC presidents and vice presidents have trailed off.
There are myriad issues on campus that need to be addressed, and the UC needs leaders who will champion such causes. Ebrahim-Cao’s pragmatic and thorough approach to implementing much-needed reform has an excellent chance for success.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A couple of weeks ago, I logged onto Facebook to find my news feed littered with provocative statuses. One read, “I like it on the floor!” Another declared, “I like it on the kitchen table!” As I soon learned from my inbox, this was an unofficial, Facebook-based movement to raise awareness about the dangers of breast cancer—“the game has to do with where we put our handbag the moment we get home. Let’s see how powerful we women really are!!!”
I forgot about the phenomenon until a little later, when I encountered a display of hot pink bras in front of the science center commemorating Breast Cancer Awareness Week. Nearby, a table run by the Harvard Cancer Society was selling pink shirts that read “Save Second Base.”
Putting the two together, I realized why Facebook statuses declaring “I like it on the table!” bother me so much. Breast cancer is not a sexual issue. It has nothing to do with femininity or female sexuality. In fact, around one percent of breast cancer patients are male. Raising awareness about breast cancer by displaying hot pink bras and joking about where we place our handbags not only demeans the experience of males and non-gender-identified people suffering from breast cancer but also equates breast cancer with sexual activity or sexual allure. This association could make many women uncomfortable, especially those enduring cancer themselves.
Furthermore, a campaign to “Save Second Base” may be a humorous and provocative way to generate discussion about breast cancer among college students. However, it does so at the cost of dignity and accuracy. Breasts do not exist for the purpose of providing sexual pleasure to men or to women, and it is not appropriate to depict them as primarily sexual in function. In fact, this is not only inaccurate but also propagates the objectification of the female body already pervading college culture.
Harvard culture would never allow a Safe Darfur campaign to be advertised with the slogan, “Save hot black women!” While many women suffer as a result of genocide, Darfur relief efforts need no sexualizing. A movement to save “second base” is no different.
Similarly, an analogous campaign for testicular cancer awareness that sold shirts advocating “Save Home Plate!” would be considered offensive and distasteful. Why, then, should there be a double standard allowing women to sexualize their bodies for the sake of gaining attention to an otherwise “unattractive” cause?
I am sure that the organizers of the Facebook campaign and the women and men of the Harvard Cancer Society did not intend for this type of discomfort, and they certainly found an effective way raise discussion about breast cancer among college students. However, displaying bras or posting suggestive Facebook statuses fails to support breast cancer victims and instead subtly hints at the sexual availability of Harvard’s women.
There are undoubtedly similarly effective and less objectionable ways to generate awareness and support. For example, national breast cancer awareness and prevention groups also employ traditionally “feminine” imagery by distributing light pink ribbons and emphasizing female solidarity. However, they do not present breast cancer as a solely female issue—for example, the Susan G. Komen homepage features photographs of both men and women—and there is no sexuality implicit in pink ribbons or in smiling groups of people. Perhaps we college students could learn a lesson from these successful national breast cancer prevention movements.
The sexualization of breast cancer is inappropriate and insensitive, and it promotes gender-normative ideals. The Harvard Cancer Society should reconsider its marketing strategy for future breast cancer campaigns, and intelligent college students should think more critically before advocating “sexy” causes that might nonetheless be offensive or demeaning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, happy scenes met the release of an important political prisoner in defiance of a controversial political regime. If you read news headlines, you probably know the name: Arnaldo Ramos Lauzurique.
Actually, that may not be whom you expected. The number one name this weekend in high-profile releases has not been Lauzurique, but Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese voice of democracy and public figure who has spent most of the last 20 years in dentention. Aung San Suu Kyi has always been a national figure in Burma (which the current regime and some media outlets refer to as “Myanmar”) as her father, General Aung San, is Burma’s founding hero.
A Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi is an international voice of cooperation and democracy who has drawn comparisons to Nelson Mandela. World leaders have praised her release; President Obama called her a “hero.” In China, the main ally of Burma’s military junta, Aung San Suu Kyi’s release received minimal coverage but was at least acknowledged. Her release must have significance in China, given the recent firestorm over the awarding of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo.
On the face of it, the importance of Arnaldo Ramos Lauzurique’s release cannot compare to that of Aung San Suu Kyi. One is a potential peacemaker and state leader, known throughout the world. She speaks magnanimously and with a calm and presence that led The New York Times to describe her demeanor as reminiscent of a “motivational speaker.” Meanwhile, the other freed prisoner, Lauzurique, is a near septuagenarian with no great legacy of democratic speeches; no crowds swarmed him on his release. His wife spoke for him, saying that they were happy to be reunited and would remain in Cuba, as they are too old to emigrate elsewhere.
So Lauzurique may not have a Nobel in his future, and he certainly won’t be providing sound clips showing a well-known “characteristic buoyancy” as Aung San Suu Kyi does. Yet his release should not be lost in the buzz from Burma. Lauzurique is the first prisoner in Cuba to reject freedom through exile and be released by the Cuban government in any capacity. While many of the 52 prisoners who were offered the breakthrough deal left the country, Lauzurique was one of 13 who refused the deal.
The Cuban prisoners had been in custody since 2003 after a government crackdown. In September, I wrote about the potential new direction of Cuban policies made possible by a revitalized, internationally conscious Fidel Castro. The decision to release Lauzurique to his home in Cuba will not be immediately emulated, as another of the 13 has agreed to leave for Spain. But Lauzurique’s situation is a strong sign that Cuba is moving forward with its release of all political prisoners, a key step in the country’s forward progress.
Unfortunately, the same promise is not immediately evident in Aung San Suu Kyi’s release in Burma. While her freedom is a victory for democracy, analysts have tempered their optimism: It seems that Suu Kyi’s release reflects the confidence of the military junta more than it does its willingness to reform. There are still thousands of political prisoners in the state, and the regime may be confident that it is well funded and strong enough to shoulder any new pressure from Aung San Suu Kyi. Her own lawyer has cautioned that her movements may be restricted, and while she seems free, for now, to give public addresses (at least as long as she espouses her willingness to work with the junta), there is a significant difference between public addresses and practical changes.
If the government in Burma is willing to work with Aung San Suu Kyi, her release will have had an enormous effect. But for now, beware the overstatement of any release caught up in the news cycle. There is a conveyor belt for the process—the BBC updates a profile piece of the public figure, while journalists reach out to the leaders of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States for comment. Whether the leader knows of the dissident or not, their flacks have them call the person a “beacon” or, for the less creative ones, a “hero.”
If excitement in Burma proves justified, the upside of Aung San Suu Kyi’s release is enormous. Thinking cautiously, however, it seems a safer bet that Lauzurique’s release represents part of a trend. Expect Cuba to continue to release prisoners and move toward democracy. In Burma, democracy’s greatest voice is now free. But we will have to wait to see if the move is anything more than lip service.

The countdown to The Game can officially begin.  In just six days, the Crimson football team will take to the field at Harvard Stadium to play Yale in the last game of the season.
Although yesterday’s loss puts the Crimson out of the running for the Ivy League Championship, the game, fueled by hundreds of years of rivalry, is still sure to be exciting.
And while we hope we can say the same for the tailgate, it seems like the Harvard administration is doing anything it can to stifle the student tradition that necessarily accompanies any big collegiate football matchup.
Along with Harvard Athletics’ unwavering ban on kegs and other “items that promote the rapid consumption of alcohol,” various clubs and social groups have reportedly received emails in the past few weeks warning them of serious consequences for any violations of tailgating regulations.
The crackdown is a far cry from just a few years ago in 2004, when ESPN apparently televised a tailgate party as part of its football coverage.
But then again, that was also the year of the infamous “We Suck” prank, so maybe now we’re better off than we think.

The Harvard Kennedy School officially announces the start of its Future of Diplomacy Project, which is intended to study diplomacy in a systematic manner, on Nov. 9 with the introduction of two new resident and three non-resident fellows.
The resident fellows are Said Tayeb Jawad, who is a former Ambassador of Afghanistan, and Yvonne Yew, who is a former Singaporean diplomat with experience in regional and multilateral issues in Asia and Europe. Non-resident fellows are Marc Grossman, former U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Kenneth I. Juster ’76, U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce from 2001-05, and David L. Phillips, director of the Program on Peacebuilding and Rights at Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human Rights.
According to the head of the initiative, Professor R. Nicholas Burns, all of the fellows will speak, interact with students, and conduct research with faculty at the school.
Burns said he hoped that the project would have more than theoretical use.
“I believe we are witnessing the return of diplomacy as the primary vehicle to resolve international problems after the focus on military force by the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq since 9/11” he said.
Yew spoke of the shift in international interactions and the rising importance of diplomacy. She stated, “In a post-Cold War world where states have been transiting towards a different global order, a key component for policy-planners is to identify, understand, and predict trends developing in international politics.”
Juster, who has always been close to Harvard, having previously attended the College, the Kennedy School, and the Law School, said that Harvard’s diversity was particularly useful as a means of bringing together differing perspectives.
He said, “I have always had a high regard for Harvard as an institution and for its convening power. Harvard can bring together scholars and practitioners from all over the world, as well as someone like myself who has been in both government and business.”
Juster already spoke at several seminars last week including one entitled “Diplomacy and Negotiation: Lessons from Government and Business,” held Tuesday, Nov. 9. He said he looks forward to more seminars in the Spring semester, and to outstanding guests, including one of India’s foreign secretaries.

The Harvard Graduate Council hosted the Harvard Leadership Conference this past Saturday to give graduate students from different disciplines the opportunity to come together and discuss the challenges facing leaders today.
The conference, themed “Leading Together in Complex Times,” began on early Saturday morning and consisted of professor-led panels and group discussions that explored leadership in various fields.
The organizers of the conference, which included the Kennedy School of Government Center for Public Leadership, capped attendance at 300 and brought together graduate students from all 12 graduate schools.
The students got to interact with one another at the “collaboration lunch” in which they broke into small groups and discussed topics of similar interests.
“I was meeting people from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Divinity School and we were all discussing issues in education,” said L. Abigail Humphrey, a masters student at the Graduate School of Education. “That was just a neat way to meet people across various graduate schools.”
Tom Ghegan, a principal at a private equity firm who served as a panelist for “Leadership in the Corporate World,” said he decided to participate in the program because, as a Harvard Business School student, he wished there were more programs that brought together graduate students of all the different schools. Ghegan said the conference was effective in its purpose.
“I couldn’t believe how many people were up at 10 a.m. on Saturday morning to attend this conference,” Ghegan said.
Rear Admiral Susan Blumenthal, M.D., M.P.A, the Director of the Health and Medicine Program at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, was one keynote speaker at the conference. Congressman Ed Markey (D-MA) was also a featured speaker.
The conference closed with another keynote speech by Michele Pierre-Louis, the former prime minister of Haiti.
“I really enjoyed the last keynote,” said Vicky W. Zhou, a fourth-year student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“She was just really inspiring and said that it is possible to just be good, and not politically-hungry, to rise the ranks.”
The Graduate Council, a representative body for graduate and professional students, hosted an annual leadership summit for two years that was only for the leaders of graduate student groups across the university. This year’s conference, however, was open to all graduate students who wished to attend.
“This year, we thought ‘How can we bring together all students from across the schools and not restrict to one set of leaders?’” said Nickhilesh S. Chand, the vice president of advocacy on the Graduate Council and the conference chair.
Following the conference, President of the Graduate Council Pukar Malla, a second-year masters student at the Kennedy School of Government, said the council hopes to make more university-wide students groups official.

The three Undergraduate Council presidential tickets proposed improvements to social and academic life during an hour-long debate in Annenberg Hall last night.
The event, moderated by Council Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11, attracted approximately 50 freshmen.
Matt S. Coe-Odess ’12 and Tengbo Li ’12, one presidential ticket, said that, if elected, they would work to improve school spirit, shift dining hall hours, allow students to shop teaching fellows, and improve social life on campus.
“There are so many students here who want to socialize, but not necessarily want to drink,” Coe-Odess—who is running using only the last name Coe—said, explaining that he would like to see the UC sponsor more alcohol-free parties on campus.
Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12, the other UC-insider presidential ticket, explained their plan to make contacting College administrators easier for undergraduates, called for travel grants during winter break, and proposed creating a “welcome week” for upperclassmen before the start of the fall term.
Ebrahim-Cao said they believed the UC should better direct funds to students to help improve student life.
Sporting bright pink campaign T-shirts, Collin A. Jones ’12 and Peter D. Davis ’12—who frequently elicited laughter from the audience—talked about their plan to get University President Drew G. Faust to start a Twitter account.
During their remarks, Jones referenced the recent string of alleged robberies on campus, saying, “We don’t just care about student life, we care about students’ lives.”
They said they would not attempt to improve social life because they thought Lamont Café and the freshman mailing room were sufficient social spaces.
The event was organized by the UC freshman representatives, working for the Coe-Li and Ebrahim-Cao tickets.
The main goal of the event was to provide freshmen with an opportunity to learn more about each ticket’s platform, according to Akshay M. Sharma ’14, a UC Representative for Ivy Yard.
James P. Biblarz ’14, a representative for Crimson Yard, working for Ebrahim-Cao, added that even though the freshman class typically has the highest voter turnout rate, many students are often misinformed about elections.
“They don’t know about the method of voting, who the candidates are, what position they take, what the issues are,” he said.
The UC presidential elections will run from 12 p.m. today to 12 p.m. on Thursday. Voting takes place online.

Siddharth A. Kara, a Fellow with the Carr Center Program on Human Trafficking and Modern-Day Slavery, won the 2010 Frederick Douglass Book Prize for his book, “Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery.”
Yale University presents the award on an annual basis to the author of the best non-fiction book on slavery. Kara’s was the first book concerned with modern-day slavery to win the award.
“I think that it’s a significant milestone,” said Dr. Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, Director of the Carr Center’s Human Rights and Social Movements Program. “In awarding this prize to Siddharth, the Douglass Prize committee has acknowledged that slavery and trafficking are not a thing of the past.”
Kara left his investment-banking job to travel and research human trafficking of all kinds. He interviewed thousands of current and former slaves across 20 countries. “Sex Trafficking” is one of three books that Kara is writing as a result of this research.
According to the U.S. Department of State, one million children are exploited by the global commercial sex trade every year.
Kara said that over the course of the past ten years, people have become far more aware of issues of human trafficking.
Though international awareness of trafficking has risen, Kara feels that more serious analysis is required.
“The problem comes when the awareness-raising activities are sensationalistic and sometimes misleading.”
This lack of in-depth research is one of the reasons that Kara said he began his travels.
The book, however, is more than a study of the problem. Kara proposes tactics to more effectively combat human trafficking, including more proactive interventions, greater economic penalties, and certain protections for victims.
Kara sees human trafficking primarily as an economic phenomenon, driven by the ability to generate huge profits at almost no real cost or risk. “We have to invert that,” he said.
Ultimately, Kara feels that the solution to these problems can only come through a unified movement with stakeholders at every level of society. “The big challenge, of course, is that this is a global problem,” said McCarthy.
“Global social movements have a huge set of obstacles to overcome in organizing themselves.”
But even individuals can make a difference in contributing to the end of human trafficking, said Kara. He especially emphasized the importance of knowledge and advocacy at the university level, and the prospects of creating a unified grassroots movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s noon on an overcast Wednesday, and Collin A. Jones ’12 is on the science center lawn campaigning to become Undergraduate Council President. Unlike his fellow candidates, however, Jones is sporting a full-size Tigger suit, with pogo stick in hand.
“I’ve been on this pogo stick for ten minutes straight,” he shouts, climbing back on. Next to him is his running mate, Peter D. Davis ’12, holding a giant felt board with three sloppily placed pillars, representing their campaign points, attached.
“Do you support democracy, safety, and the twenty-first century?” he asks. “Vote Jones-Davis!”
With their simple platform of “three pillars,” a catchy Michael Jackson campaign song, and a pet frog as a mascot, the Jones-Davis campaign deviates considerably from traditional UC tickets.
Although neither Jones nor Davis has UC experience, the two proudly tout their high school student council experiences and membership in the National Honor Society in a YouTube campaign video.
“Can the average Harvard student bring that type of experience to the table?” Jones challenges.
A ‘NONTRADITIONAL’ TICKET
Among the three pairs vying for leadership of the student body this year, the Jones-Davis ticket has been dubbed the “non-traditional” or “outsider” choice.  While the Coe-Li and Ebrahim-Cao tickets are both composed of current UC leaders, Jones, a comparative religion concentrator in Quincy House, and Davis, a government concentrator in Currier, make no mystery of their lack of UC experience.
“The majority of the student body knows nothing about the UC. We want to represent the majority of the student body,” Jones says. “We promise that we don’t know any more than you do, and we probably know less.”
Jones and Davis, however, say they are trying to leverage their underdog position to achieve grassroots support. Through a series of quirky campaign videos, a loyal staff team, and a website modeled after that of New York’s The Rent Is Too Damn High Party, this duo is working to win the hearts and minds of the student body.
“We’re pleased with our virality,” Davis says.
REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE
Chief among the proposed Jones-Davis initiatives is their first campaign promise—“the pillar of democracy,” by which the two propose to open all UC decisions to a popular vote. Citing the UC’s increase in representatives, the two said they would like to increase that number by 6,000 or, Davis adds, “however many it would take to have everyone at Harvard represented.”
The two plan to implement this vision of direct democracy through Google forms, SurveyMonkey or “the doodle.” Their first poll, which ended last Wednesday, asked students to vote on how they should spend their campaign money.
Among requests for “icing” University President Drew G. Faust and their competitors—not to mention changing their remaining $20.10 into pennies to be strewn around campus—one suggestion was louder than the rest.
“The people have spoken, and they have told us to buy a small animal,” Jones said.
Early Thursday, the two headed for Alewife, where they purchased a Cuban Tree Frog—for the people. The frog, which they named Harvard, will reside in a newly-purchased terrarium, dubbed “the 21st century.”
A THREAT TO THE ‘UC BELTWAY’
With a strong band of devotees and a notoriety that is growing day by day, Jones-Davis may present a threat to the more traditional UC platforms on display. As of yesterday, their campaign’s Facebook page had 137 likes, running behind Ebrahim-Cao’s with 259 but ahead of Coe-Li’s 48.
And even though the two are rejecting offers of endorsement from campus organizations out of their refusal to run a “traditional” campaign, Jones-Davis is hoping to score big-time with a show of support from basketball star Shaquille O’Neal himself. The two appealed to Shaq for an endorsement last week via his Twitter page.
However, while Shaq has yet to respond, other voices from outside the student body have chimed in to show their approval.
“To me, the UC is a largely decorative organization that sends you emails once or twice a year,” said Alexandra A. Petri ’10, a former UC VP candidate who ran  with Roger G. Waite ’10 on a platform that advocated replacing the UC with Hapsburg rule.
“There’s no one who’s more largely decorative, or from whom I’d like to receive emails from once or twice a year than Pete Davis,” Petri said.
Petri, now a Washington Post editorial contributor, said that to do well as a nontraditional ticket,  the candidates must define themselves well and pander. One of the most difficult hurdles a nontraditional campaign must pass, she said, is “getting your friends to vote for you.”
A SERIOUS SIDE
Underneath the campaign stunts and tongue-in-cheek YouTube videos, however, Jones-Davis campaign proposes some less humorous suggestions.
For example, even though Jones and Davis don’t have explicit UC credentials, neither lacks leadership experience. Jones is a ‘Hahvahd Tour’ Guide and spent his summer working in an orphanage in the Dominican Republic through Harvard’s Rockefeller Grant initiative, while Davis is a co-founder of “Harvard Thinks Big,” a contributor to the fake news show On Harvard Time, and a co-president of the Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society.
Professor Andrew Berry, who spoke at Harvard Thinks Big, called Davis a “logistical genius” for being able to gather so many big-name professors in one place at the event, and Quincy House Resident Dean Judith F. Chapman said that Jones has integrity and “does the things he says he’s going to do.”
In addition to strong resumes and recommendations, the two have also highlighted several important issues about student life in their various videos and interviews.
When asked about social life at Harvard, for instance, the pair cited the Harvard-Yale Game in the fall and Housing Day in the spring as “sufficient” for community-building—“once a semester is enough,” Davis said.
In the meantime, however, the team stands behind its campaign slogan:
“...Until we Run Out of Money, or Get Removed from Office.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students, wearing shirts and holding signs saying “HIV POSITIVE”, demonstrated at a high-profile global health conference in Boston Friday, calling on the Obama administration to fulfill its pledge to sharply increase funding for AIDS programs.
During a break, members of the Harvard College Global Health & AIDS Coalition spoke with Ambassador Eric P. Goosby, coordinator of U.S. international HIV/AIDS efforts, asking for the administration to spend $50 billion over five years for the fight against AIDS, as Obama promised during his campaign.
So far, the government has steered less than $6 billion into AIDS programs, Goosby said at the conference.
The Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Global Health’s Inaugural Symposium brought together leaders in global health and in government to talk about the fight against AIDS.
When a panel that included Senator John F. Kerry, Goosby, and Harvard Professor of Global Health and Social Medicine Paul E. Farmer, opened the floor to questions, Krishna M. Prabhu ’11 asked Goosby to publicly call on the president to fully-fund the fight against AIDS.
While Prabhu spoke, approximately 30 coalition members stood in the front row and unfurled a banner saying, “Demand Obama Keep His Promise.”
Prahbu said that the members represented those who had died worldwide of HIV/AIDS during the morning’s four hours of speeches.
The actual number would have been about 1,000, according to data from the World Health Organization.
Goosby said the president is committed to fighting AIDS, but the economic climate makes that difficult.
“I will commit to you to continue to be in dialogue with leadership,” Goosby said.
“But it is the president’s decision as to how he is able to find resources and allocate those resources”
When coalition members Marguerite Thorp ’11 and Scott T. Gregg ’12 spoke with Goosby during a break, he said that all other government programs are being cut, and that more lives are being saved than ever before.
Thorp said she was disappointed that Goosby did not agree to call upon the president to increase funding.
She said she believes economic conditions should not affect the United States’ monetary commitment to AIDS.
“When the economy turns downward, AIDS doesn’t take a vacation,” Thorp said.
“The poorest of the poor are suffering the most ... if we scale up [aid efforts] now, we could end the epidemic by 2050.”
Kerry, a Democrat, praised the presence and activism of the coalition, saying that it was vital for citizens to keep the government accountable.
With Republicans set to take over the House in January, he said pressure from citizens for Congress to do the right thing was necessary.
He urged the students to protest before groups that opposed AIDS funding.
However, in an interview Thorp responded to that statement, saying that the Democrats are still in power and are not doing enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Laughing together across a table at the Greenhouse Café, Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12, who are running for Undergraduate Council President and Vice President respectively, come across as lifelong friends. Few would guess that they have only known each other since their sophomore year. The duo, elaborating on their personal experiences in the Undergraduate Council, are just as at ease discussing UC politics as their run-in with a four-year-old in a “Where the Wild Things Are” costume.
The duo have already garnered the majority of student group endorsements, including the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, the Black Students Association, and the Queer Students and Allies.
Ebrahim and Cao have worked together on the UC’s Student Life Committee for the past year. They say their time on the committee has imbued them with a greater understanding of social needs on campus.
They say they hope to facilitate collaboration across the University to supplement social programming on campus—a platform echoed in their slogan: “Your vision. Your voice. Your solutions.”
“We are basically running on a vision of partnering with students, student groups, and faculty to improve the Harvard social experience,” their campaign site reads.
COMPLEMENTARY CANDIDATES
Ebrahim, a neurobiology concentrator in Quincy House, and Cao, a government concentrator in Pforzheimer, attribute the strength of their candidacy to their complementary experiences at Harvard.
A member of the UC since his freshman year, Ebrahim possesses the savvy of a veteran insider and says he has the experience to implement his proposals.
“I’ve worked so much with the administration,” Ebrahim says. “I’ve built the relationships that matter to actually get these things done.”
Cao, a UC representative since her sophomore year, actively participates in a slew of student activities on campus, including the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association, the sorority Delta Gamma, and the Institute of Politics.
She has also moderated the anonymous confessional website HarvardFML, an experience that she reflects upon fondly as “the worst form of procrastination.”
The pair say that though they come from different backgrounds on campus, their goals are the same.
They hope to revitalize the relationship between students, administrators, and faculty members.
“The UC isn’t great at planning a lot of stuff on its own,” Ebrahim says of the Council’s attempts at organizing social events, “but we want to partner with student groups.”
Providing money and support to student groups, they say, will spark the creation of new and exciting events such as a massive end-of-the-year party and a cultural week that brings together the talents of various ethnic clubs on campus.
A PLATFORM WITH PERSONALITY
Ebrahim and Cao have plans to reinvigorate social life at Harvard, which they say will engender an equally engaging environment for freshmen and upperclassmen alike.
One of their principle goals is to recreate Freshmen Week (also known as “Camp Harvard”) for all students at the beginning of the school year—a period that they would call “Welcome Week.”
According to Cao and Ebrahim, the extra time would help upperclassmen meet their new housemates and give students a chance to hang out with their friends before the chaos of shopping week. As it stands, they say, students are just “thrown back into classes.”
Cao and Ebrahim say they also intend to continue the UC’s encouragement of technological innovation on campus—a project the Council has engaged in through “Hack Harvard,” a program that allows five undergraduates to further develop their CS50 projects over January Term.
The ticket presented several ideas for new smartphone applications includeing “Get Out Harvard,” which matches students of similar interests and suggests events for them to attend in Boston, and a conglomerate of applications entitled “The Boys,” which includes a modified Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services application, a party finder application, and an improved shuttle application.
Ebrahim and Cao say they hope these online tools will improve social life on campus and foster friendships between students with similar passions.
And while their platform may seem daunting, Ebrahim and Cao say they will be able to accomplish everything they have proposed.
“We would never promise anything in our platform if it weren’t something we were actually intending to deliver on,” Ebrahim says.
The pair is not waiting to be elected before putting their policies into action. The proposed Forum for Change, an idea that Ebrahim had at the beginning of the summer, is meant to be a meeting ground for faculty, House Masters, and students, allowing undergraduates to “make their case directly to the University’s decision-makers.” The duo have already spoken to Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, and Ebrahim says that the administration’s response has been “overwhelmingly positive.”
The pair say that their complementary personalities will help them continue working on their proposed initiatives if they are elected.
“We work really well together. That’s the thing—when you’re P and VP you have to spend so much time together,” says Ebrahim. “Every president I talked to told me to pick someone you like spending time with, because otherwise you’re going to be miserable 25 hours a week.”
When asked what Cao thinks of her partner-in-politics, she calls him “the biggest cheese ball ever.”
“He’s one of those people that will make a joke and he’ll be the only laughing,” she says.
Ebrahim says that his favorite thing about Cao is “her smile.” He jokingly claims that it is impossible for her to keep a straight face.

When it comes to swimming, the Big Green and the Big Red are no match for the Crimson. The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team crushed its competition in the opening meet of the season. The squad traveled to Hanover, N.H. on Saturday and toppled host Dartmouth by a score of 222-78. The Crimson dominated Cornell in a similar fashion, winning 216-82.
Harvard (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) captured 13 of the 16 events at the meet to control its first matchup with conference competitors. These two victories put the Crimson squad on track to continue the success it enjoyed against Ivy opponents a year ago. Last season, Harvard triumphed over the Big Green and the Big Red in Ithaca, N.Y., a day after falling to Texas A&M in its opening meet.
“I thought overall we had good energy and raced well,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “There were a lot of good signs and a lot of little things that we need to work on. I was pleased with the way they got up and raced from the first race to the last race.”
The Crimson conquered both of the team relays, snatching up first and second in the men’s 200-yard medley relay. Junior Nicholas DuCille, sophomores Greg Roop and Owen Wurzbacher, and freshman Jack Pretto finished with a time of 1:33.94, touching the wall just a half of a second before the second-place Harvard team.
Later during the meet, the Crimson took home first place in the 400-yard freestyle relay. DuCille teamed up senior Will Heyburn and freshmen Spenser Goodman and Oliver Lee to gain victory with a time of 3:07.77, over two seconds ahead of their second-place competitors.
“Winning against Cornell and Dartmouth in the [200-yard medley] relay was a great way to start off the meet,” co-captain Justin Davidson said. “We struggled with relays a bit last season, so we’re heading in the right direction for the rest of the season.”
Harvard proved to be equally dominant in the individual races. In the 200-yard freestyle, the Crimson recorded a 1-2-3-4 finish, with three freshmen grabbing the top three spots. Goodman took the event in 1:40.70, just tenths of a second before classmates Chris Satterthwaite and Wes Stearns.
The rookies continued their success, racking up points for the squad when Pretto earned second in the 100-yard backstroke in 51.25. Junior Robert Newell just edged out Pretto to take the event with a time of 51.22.
“I think the freshman class had a phenomenal day [on Saturday],” Davidson said. “They’re really talented and responded to the challenges of competing in the Ivy League incredibly well. We’ll be looking forward to them helping us throughout the year.”
DuCille was one of the standout performers for the Crimson upperclassmen. He led the charge in the 100-yard freestyle to win with a time of 46.79, besting Goodman’s second-place time of 46.98. DuCille also grabbed second in the 50-yard freestyle, right behind teammate Lee.
Co-captain Douwe Yntema stepped up into his role as one of the team leaders, swimming the 200-yard butterfly in 1:53.34, good for second place behind junior Niall Janney. Janney also beat out his competition in the 200-yard individual medley, his second win of the meet.
In the one-meter diving event, Harvard cleaned up and took three of the top four places. Sophomore Michael Stanton took home the gold in the event with a score of 295.05. Senior Zac Ranta and freshman Joe Zarrella finished in second and fourth, respectively, with scores of 291.85 and 284.
“What was most impressive about the divers...was that they came back in the one-meter competition after not winning the three-meter event,” Murphy said. “It was the second opportunity to compete, and I thought they did a good job.”
After a dominant performance in the pool this weekend, the Crimson opens up its home season against Columbia on Friday afternoon. It is the first of three home events for the squad this year. Last season, Harvard edged out a win over the Lions, 167-133, and will look to continue its winning ways in the water.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council presidential candidate Matt S. Coe-Odess ’12 knocks three times on the door. It’s a holiday—Veteran’s Day—so he says he doesn’t expect many people to answer. But he waits patiently, ten seconds, then fifteen, to see if anyone’s home  in Thayer 205.
Coe-Odess—a tall, blonde psychology concentrator in Kirkland, who is campaigning using only the last name Coe—is a bona fide door-knocking expert. As the chair of the UC Social Life Task Force last year, he knocked on over 600 doors asking students what they wanted to see changed in Harvard’s social scene. Since last Monday, however, he and vice presidential candidate Tengbo Li ’12, an economics concentrator in Pforzheimer, have been knocking on doors asking for something different—votes to support their election to the Council’s two highest offices.
After twenty seconds, Antony S. Bett ’14 opens the door halfway. After Bett skeptically agrees to listen, Coe-Odess launches into his spiel.
Coe-Odess and Li say that their ticket seeks to increase the Council’s responsiveness to the student body and their immediate concerns, with priorities such making social spaces more accessible and fostering school spirit.
FROM THE STUDENTS
Coe-Odess says he joined the UC in his sophomore year because he wanted to see the Council be more in touch with the concerns of the student body. That same commitment to advocating for student voices has inspired his current presidential run.
“I got so tired of hearing all these great student ideas fall by the wayside,” he says. “I thought—‘why can’t I be the one to bring the student voice to the forefront?’”
During his time as Kirkland representative, Coe-Odess has done his part to respond to his constituents’ needs, according to Herbert W. Virgin-Downey ’12. “When I asked him to get vending machines in DeWolfe, he took care of it instantly,” he says.
Coe-Odess continued to emphasize student opinion as the chair of the Social Life Task Force, a position which allowed him to communicate directly with many students about their ideas about social space. These conversations—and the opinions they elicited—were integral in the formation of his and Li’s platform.
“Most of the ideas on our platform come from students,” Coe-Odess says, such as their proposals to extend dining hall hours and institute a teaching fellow “shopping week.”
RESULTS “RIGHT NOW”
Coe-Odess says he and Li want to focus not only on ideas generated by current students, but also on initiatives that will affect for current students.
“I don’t want to waste any amount of energy or money going towards something that’s not going to directly benefit the students on this campus right now,” Coe-Odess says.
Warner J. Wood ’14, a UC representative who has endorsed the ticket, says he approves of Coe-Odess’s commitment to action.
“I’m so sick of the UC talking,” Wood said. “I want to see a UC that gets stuff done, that’s proactive.”
This attitude is reflected in many of the ticket’s platform points, especially in regard to one of the most hotly-contested issues of this election: accessibility of social spaces for students.
Coe-Odess says he wants to work to make already-existing spaces more accessible for student parties and socializing, citing the Kirkland student lounge and Ticknor Lounge as examples.
“We want to extend the rules that already exist for dorm [room parties] to common spaces,” Coe-Odess says.
Coe-Odess says he and Li also want to create a central area bar where students can congregate. Coe-Odess cites attempts to create theme nights at Tommy Doyle’s and says he plans to meet with the manager of Conga soon.
In addition to tackling social space, Coe-Odess and Li also view invigorating school spirit as an important component of their campaign.
Coe-Odess says he is convinced that more students would go to athletic games if they became a social destination.
“Getting everyone to go is what [makes the games] fun,” he says, pointing to the success of the newly-instated “UC Game of the Week,” a initiative which highlights a sports game, such as the recent women’s volleyball match against Yale, to encourage high turn-out.
“I feel like Harvard has great academics, but I don’t feel like we have a great social life,” Wood says. “Matt is pushing for a more cohesive community on campus.”
Some have criticized the ticket for being too focused on short-term goals.
James P. Biblarz ’14, a UC representative who endorsed the Ebrahim-Cao ticket, says he believes the Council should play a bigger role on campus than just promoting campus community and school spirit.
“We’re the students at the greatest university in the world, and we need a voice for major policy initiatives,” Biblarz said, citing the controversy over the Social Studies scholarship recently named after Martin Peretz and the development of the General Education curriculum as issues in which undergraduates should have a say. “It’s important that [the UC president] has a long-term vision.”
Li argues that while the ticket is more focused on achieving “tangible goals” for students, their platform is not one-dimensional—for example, they also have pledged to work with the College administration on longer-term projects such as House renewal.
REACHING THE VOTERS
Coe-Odess and Li say they decided to run in October, several months after opposing ticket Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12 started to prepare for the election. Li admits that their late start might have given their ticket some disadvantages, such as a delay in reaching out to students and student groups.
Although the Ebrahim-Cao ticket may have more endorsements—the current count lies at 16 to his ticket’s five, including, according to their website, Pinocchio’s Pizza and Subs—Coe-Odess maintains that his campaign is in “great shape.”
Coe-Odess, who is a member of the Owl Club, says he thinks the platforms he and Li advocate for will appeal to some demographics that typically never vote, such as athletes. He added that his membership in the club will give him the opportunity to work with final clubs to solve the social space crisis, and would give him a perspective that others in the UC might not have.
“I think we’re going to see a large turnout of the Harvard crowd that isn’t usually involved in UC elections,” he says.
Since campaigning started on Monday, Nov. 8, Coe-Odess and Li have stood outside the Science Center every day, blasting music, handing out flyers, engaging students in conversations, and participating in UC debates.
And until voting starts on Monday, they’ll be knocking on doors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Offensive sparks from new faces weren’t enough to help the Harvard women’s hockey team take home a victory this weekend. The Crimson (2-2-2, 2-2-2 ECAC) suffered a 4-1 loss at the hands of Quinnipiac (8-5-1, 3-4-0) on Friday before rallying to tie Princeton (3-5-1, 3-3-1), 2-2, on Saturday.
“It was still another improving weekend,” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “We showed some weaknesses in the Quinnipiac game. I think we showed a lot of heart fighting back in the Princeton game.”
HARVARD 2, PRINCETON 2
With under five minutes left in the third period, the Crimson seemed to be headed to its second straight loss to an unranked opponent. Down 2-1 to the Tigers at Hobey Baker Rink, Buesser and classmate Katharine Chute took matters into their own hands.
“[We were playing] two-on-two in the middle of the ice,” Chute said. “She and I criss-crossed. She went down the left side and made a beautiful pass to the back door, and I tapped it in.”
The goal, coming nearly 16 minutes into the third period, brought Harvard even with Princeton, and the Crimson did not let the Tigers take the lead again despite being outshot, 12-9, by Princeton in that frame.
While Chute’s late-game goal was the one that secured the tie for Harvard, the forward’s first goal also pulled the Crimson even.
Tiger sophomore Kelly Cooke had put Princeton on the board midway through the first period to give her team a one-goal lead it would hold for over 20 minutes of ice time.
It began to look like the night before, when an early goal by the Bobcats paved the way for an upset victory.
But 12 minutes into the second period, Chute found the back of the net.
Just as in the third period, the scoring play began with the efforts of Buesser on the forecheck. The puck then found its way to tri-captain Liza Ryabkina’s stick.
“She put the puck on net,” Chute said. “And I got it on my backhand and put it in the top.”
When Chute’s first goal wasn’t enough to put away the Tigers, who found the net in the opening minute of the third period, the forward responded with her second goal of the night, this time bringing the teams even for good.
“She’s been absolutely outstanding this year,” Buesser said of Chute. “It’s four years of work that’s finally paying off. This year, it’s all coming together. I think she’s definitely a leader on the team. She’s showing what hard work and dedication to this team can result in.”
The game also marked the first career start for freshman goaltender Lauren Joarnt, who made her collegiate debut in the third period against Quinnipiac. Joarnt made 20 saves in the tie.
QUINNIPIAC 4, HARVARD 1
In a game of career firsts for athletes on both sides, Bobcat freshman Kelly Babstock stole the show Friday night at the TD Bank Sports Center. The Quinnipiac rookie’s hat trick in the second period buried the Crimson’s hopes for a victory and overshadowed the play of Harvard sophomore Whitney Kennedy, who scored her first collegiate goal three minutes into the third period.
The Bobcats found the back of the net first when junior forward Chelsea Illchuk put the puck past Crimson sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy midway through the first.
Though Harvard was able to hold Quinnipiac scoreless for the remainder of the frame, it lost its defensive composure as soon as the second period began. Before two minutes had expired in the second, Babstock had scored her first goal.
The Bobcat rookie found the back of the net twice more in that frame, teaming with Quinnipiac junior Kate Wheeler both times.
Their first dual effort came 6:45 into the second period, while the second came with less than three minutes to go before the break.
“She’s definitely a very skilled player,” Buesser said of Babstock, who leads the nation in scoring with 27 points. “I think we had a few defensive breakdowns all over the ice...[but] you definitely have to hand it to her. She played an outstanding game.”
A four-goal lead proved too much for the Crimson to overcome, but Kennedy’s late goal ensured that Harvard would not finish the game scoreless. The sophomore’s tally came three minutes into the third period.
“I don’t think the goaltender saw it at all,” Buesser said. “Our offense is needing some sparks. That line of [senior Ashley] Wheeler, Kennedy, and [freshman Kalley] Armstrong has been working pretty hard. [The goal] is really the result of hard work. Hopefully she can pour on a few more this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most cross-country races, the goal is to place as high as possible within the field of runners. But at the NCAA Regionals this past Saturday, the Crimson had another goal in mind: to advance to the NCAA National Championships.
The men’s and women’s teams traveled to Madison, Conn. to race against the best teams in the region at the Hamonasett Beach State Park course, but they fell short of a ticket to Terre Haute, Ind. with 12th- and 14th-place finishes, respectively.
“Overall, it was sort of an anti-climatic end to the season,” women’s captain Eliza Ives said. “It was one of those days when you can’t focus too much on the final results and need to learn from it and move on.”
But with two NCAA Nationals appearances already under his belt, men’s captain Dan Chenoweth knows what it takes to advance to the next level. The senior rose to the occasion for a third time with a third-place overall finish, earning the senior an individual berth to the national competition.
Chenoweth completed the 10K course with a time of 29:51.2—only 14.3 seconds behind the overall winner.
“Dan is really amazing,” Ives said. “He is incredibly consistent and inspiring in that way...He always races incredibly hard and to his utmost ability. He did a great job.”
“Dan did the job that he needed to do,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “He had more pressure on him than a lot of the guys out there since he’s already been [to the national championships] two times before, but he handled the pressure well and took care of business.”
Following behind Chenoweth were junior Michael Hoffman and freshmen Kurt Ruegg, Aaron Watanabe, Maksim Korolev, and Kellen Blumberg, who all finished in the top half of the 229-runner field. For a team plagued by upperclassman injuries all season, the rookies continued to step up for the Crimson.
“As a class, the freshmen had the right mindset,” Chenoweth said. “They were prepared for the distance and worked really hard in the competition...It’s been kind of cool to see the freshmen come along and see the power that their class has.”
On the women’s side, juniors Nicole Cochran and Jeanne Mack led Harvard with strong performances on the 6K course, overcoming personal setbacks to cross the finish line at 21:29.6 and 21:30.6—good for 53rd and 54th place, respectively—out of 247 runners.
“I was really pleased with our top two women runners,” Saretsky said. “Neither [Cochran nor Mack] were 100 percent and were pretty banged up this week. I was really proud of their ability to put themselves out there to do as well as they could to help the team.”
Ives finished six seconds behind Mack for 61st place and was followed by freshman Kristina Funahashi, juniors Kailyn Kuzmuk and Kirsten Jorgensen, and senior Thea Lee.
Ultimately the veteran squad was unable to overcome the pressure and the recent injuries to several members of its roster.
“We are at peak fitness but are compromised by injury right now, and we had some lofty goals that were riding pretty heavily on our minds,” Ives said. “It was definitely our hope to advance to Nationals, but things would have needed to go perfectly for everyone, and things didn’t go perfectly for anyone.”
And given the good showing within the field of competition, both the men’s and women’s squads hope these will be results they can build upon in the future. While depth is important, this race showed that responding to the challenges that the sport presents is a key to future success.
“You try to contain injury as much as you can, but sometimes you just get unlucky,” Chenoweth said. “It’s part of the sport. You just need to learn how to deal with those things and come back from them.”
“The sport is unpredictable,” Ives said. “You definitely have to be ready for anything.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Harvard men’s hockey team matched St. Lawrence and Clarkson relatively evenly, what ultimately separated the Crimson from these two teams was how it played in the second period. Over the weekend, Harvard (2-2-0, 2-2-0 ECAC) found itself in between the two teams, topping the Saints (2-6-3, 2-2-0), 4-2, and falling to the Golden Knights (5-4-2, 1-2-1), 3-1.
“We played much better on Friday than we did on Saturday,” co-captain Chris Huxley said. “On Friday night, we played a full game. We came out hard and played for a full 60 minutes and had a lot of energy throughout. But on Saturday night, we didn’t play a full 60 minutes. You can’t win games if you don’t play a full game.”
CLARKSON 3, HARVARD 1
On Saturday night at Cheel Arena, the difference between the two seemingly even teams was shown through each squad’s performance during the second period. Despite holding back the Clarkson offense for much of the first period, assistant captain goaltender Kyle Richter and the Crimson defense were unable to prevent a second-period surge by the Golden Knights. In a span of three minutes, the Clarkson offense slipped a pair of goals into the net to make it 2-0.
Though Harvard owned advantages of 36-35 in shots and 34-33 in faceoffs, the Crimson could not take advantage of its chances. A particular failure of Harvard was its inability to convert on its power-play opportunities. The Crimson went 0-for-4 on the power play in the third period and 0-for-5 overall.
With Harvard pressuring during the third period, senior forward Michael Biega was able to halve the Clarkson lead with his first goal of the season, 6:30 into the frame. But Golden Knights goalie Paul Karpowich’s 12 saves in the third period and a late Clarkson goal helped the Golden Knights hold on to win 3-1.
“The road trip that we were just on was a tough one,” Richter said. “Every team right now, early in the season, is a learning experience for us that gives us takeaway points from every game. But I think that the biggest thing that we’ve learned so far is just the level of competition that we are going to have to bring [to get] back-to-back wins on the road, especially next weekend.”
HARVARD 4, ST. LAWRENCE 2
Against Rensselaer last weekend, Harvard did not register its first goal of the game until the final 10 seconds of play. But by the end of Friday’s game, the Crimson had made its mark on the scoreboard. Harvard scored once late in the first period, twice in the second, and once in the third to capture its first road victory of the season at Appleton Arena.
Taking advantage of a slow start from the Saints, junior forward Eric Kroshus gave the Crimson a first-period lead with his breakaway goal at the 13:37 mark.
Leading up to the early goal, sophomore defenseman Danny Biega collected the puck in his own zone and found Kroshus with a long pass to the neutral zone, where the waiting Kroshus was left unmarked. The junior forward then skated towards net and knocked the puck past netminder Matt Weninger to put Harvard in the lead, 1-0.
With this early goal, Harvard never looked back. In the second and third periods, the Crimson dominated on both sides of the puck. During the second period, Harvard outshot St. Lawrence, 20-7, resulting in goals by juniors Colin Moore and Alex Killorn.
Defensively in the second period, Harvard was also nearly perfect. In the opening minutes of the period, St. Lawrence seemed poised to capitalize on a three-on-two break until Huxley delivered a hip check to halt the Saints offense in the midst of its best scoring opportunity of the period.
Though St. Lawrence would eventually get on the board at the 9:12 mark of the third period, and later trim the Crimson lead to one goal with about five minutes remaining, Harvard’s performance in the second period and the solid goaltending by Richter throughout the game proved insurmountable for the Saints.
With only a few minutes left on the clock, St. Lawrence brought heavy pressure by pulling their goalie and adding an extra offensive attacker. But Richter, who registered 41 saves in the game, proved to be unbreakable, and Kroshus sealed the win with an empty-net goal with seven seconds left.
“We have confidence in all our goalies,” Huxley said. “But Richter by far has been playing really well. In the middle of games, when there are a few minutes of chaos and teams are all over us, he’s been holding up the iron and making the big saves."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Radcliffe crew raced its way to another fine weekend at the Foot of the Charles on Saturday.
The Black and White’s top performances came from the heavyweight novice eight, which won its race, and the heavyweight A four, which finished second.
The lightweights boated four fours, a novice eight, and a third varsity eight, while the heavyweights raced four fours and two novice eights, as well as a third varsity eight. The squads took on boats from Brown, Dartmouth, Northeastern, Syracuse, Rhode Island, Rutgers, Buffalo, Boston University, Massachusetts, Boston College, and MIT.
Brown barely nudged out Radcliffe to claim first place in the varsity fours race. The Bears finished in a time of 13:39.5, three seconds ahead of the Black and White’s time of 13:42.5.
“The first four were incredible: we were within three seconds of Brown,” heavyweight co-captain Rachel Rauh said. “We did exactly what we wanted to do. Obviously, we would have preferred to be three seconds faster than Brown rather than slower, but we had a great race. We were happy with it. This bodes well for the upcoming year.”
Rauh coxed the A four, which featured rowers co-captain Olivia Coffey, sophomore Shelly Pearson, and juniors Liz Soutter and Christina McClintock, who is also a Crimson sports editor.
Radcliffe’s B four finished 11th with a time of 14:16.9, while the C and D fours finished 26th and 39th, respectively, out of the 49 total boats in the varsity four competition.
“Today gives us confidence that we will be in the mix in the Ivy League this spring, and that we have the capacity to compete,” Rauh said.
The Black and White’s first lightweight four had the highest finish of any lightweight crew and placed 23rd overall. Radcliffe’s other lightweight entries placed 33rd and 42nd.
The Foot of Charles race also demonstrated a bright future for the Black and White novices.
The first novice boat won its event, and its time of 13:09 was the fastest time posted by any crew in the regatta. Second-place Dartmouth finished 14.1 seconds behind Radcliffe.
“Overall it was a pretty strong performance,” Rauh said. “The novice races are usually the highlight of the Foot of the Charles. This is the freshmen’s opportunity to shine. Our freshmen won—they had a great race. Our program was thrilled about that.”
The second novice heavyweights finished in 15th place out of the 23 competing boats. The lightweight boat finished 11th.
“The freshmen did a great job today,” Rauh added. “They have been mixed in with the varsity most of the fall, but this was their one and only race as a first novice group. It was their one moment to shine, and they really stepped up.”
Last weekend at the Green Monster Regatta, the Black and White finished second as a team to the Big Green, a memory the athletes had in the back of their minds heading into this weekend’s race.
“The loss motivated us to really go after it in the Foot of the Charles,” freshman heavyweight Miruna Ioan said. “We did not know what to expect since Dartmouth defeated us last weekend. It was such a great surprise to see that we had beaten them by so much.”
The Regatta not only served as an opportunity for retribution but also as a final chance for the team to hone its skills heading into winter.
“We were very set on winning our race because we started off first,” Ioan said. “We didn’t have any boats to pass or any boats ahead of us, so we were focused on pushing as far away from the other boats as possible.”
“We thought of each stroke as an accumulation of all our hard work we’ve done so far this season,” she added. “We wanted to show everyone what we had accomplished in the past two months.”
Each Radcliffe boat defeated the corresponding Dartmouth boat in all three races.
In the third varsity eight event, the Black and White’s heavyweight entry finished sixth, while the lightweight boat finished eighth.
“I think everyone gave the best they could,” Ioan said. “Everyone’s fall season ended well. I know some of the boats from other universities had good races as well. Overall, the Foot of the Charles was a great race for everyone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took the squad 15 games to do it, but for the first time since Sept. 6, the Harvard men’s soccer team finally scored more than one goal in a contest, knocking off No. 18 Pennsylvania, 2-1, in its season finale.
“I thought it was our most complete game of the year,” co-captain Rob Millock said. “I thought guys stepped up and really rose to the challenge. In terms of our last game, it was a great way to leave.”
After scoring five goals in its first two matches, the Crimson (5-7-5, 2-3-2 Ivy) moved up to No. 6 in the national rankings in mid-September. After that, the season took a turn for the worst, as the Crimson won just two of its next 14 games, twice losing star forward Brian Rogers to injury in the process.
But on Saturday in Philadelphia, the team was able to snap a six-game winless streak and send its seniors out on a high note, as junior defenseman Tim Linden’s double-overtime goal in the 108th minute gave the Crimson its second victory against a ranked team this season.
“It felt good, kind of bittersweet,” Rogers said. “After you put together a performance like that, it’s tough because you have to come to the realization that the season’s over, and I think we were just starting to play the best we had since the beginning of the year.”
The Quakers (12-5-0, 5-2-0) had the game’s first great scoring opportunity early in the first half, but Crimson sophomore goalie Brett Conrad denied Penn forward Christian Barreiro with a diving save to his right on a shot fired through traffic.
Barreiro made up for that soon after. The junior took a string of passes from teammates Loukas Tasigianis and Travis Cantrell and scored from 25 yards out, beating Conrad to put Penn up, 1-0, at 39:01.
But the Crimson struck right back just 2:15 later, when Rogers took a pass from Linden and crossed the field from left to right at the top of the box. The sophomore then fired a shot on net, beating Quaker goalie Ben Berg into the top right corner at 41:16.
“Penn had just scored, so I thought it was important that we respond early,” said Rogers, who finished the season as the team leader with five goals.
Harvard came out on the attack in the second half, but Berg made saves on shots by sophomore Zack Wolfenzon and junior Baba Omosegbon to keep the game tied.
After nobody was able to get on the board for the remainder of the period, the match went to overtime, and Conrad raised his game for the occasion.
In the first OT, the Harvard keeper made two big saves on shots by Quakers Nick Unger and Stephen Baker, keeping the Crimson’s hopes alive.
Near the end of the first overtime period, Penn had a great chance to win. With the clock winding down in the period, a Barreiro shot beat Conrad but just missed wide left, sending the game into a second extra session.
“I thought Brett was incredible,” Millock said. “He’s worked really hard for the past year-and-a-half...I’m really happy for him.”
With under two minutes to go in the second overtime, freshman forward Connor McCarthy set up a two-on-one with Linden down the left side. McCarthy sent a pass to Linden, who fired a one touch shot past Berg for the game-winner. It was Linden’s first goal of his career.
“To have gotten a tie going down to Penn wouldn’t have been a bad result,” Rogers said. “But I think we all felt like we deserved a win, and that would have been the story of the season, that we kept tying games we should have won. So I think Tim getting that goal really ended our season on the right note.”
Conrad made seven saves in the victory, while Berg made four for the Quakers in defeat. The teams each took 14 shots in a physical game that saw 36 fouls (24 by Harvard) and eight yellow cards. With the win, Harvard finished the year tied for fifth in the Ivy standings.
Despite the disappointing season, seniors Shomesh Chaudhuri, Alex Chi, James Pelletier, and co-captains Millock and Jaren LaGreca finished their Harvard careers with a positive showing.
“It really validated everything that we’ve been saying all year long that we were one of the most talented teams, if not the most talented team in the Ivy League,” Rogers said. “Its encouraging going forward...everyone’s really optimistic and can’t wait to get back into the swing of things, offseason workouts.”
“For the senior class, it gives them a nice last memory of their college careers, so it’s all anyone could have asked for to finish the season,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday night’s game against Princeton had all the drama needed for the perfect season finale.
Emotions ran high in the fifth set, as the Harvard women’s volleyball Senior Night was coming to a close and the 14-12 score had the Crimson just one point away from its underdog victory.
All it took was junior Sandra Lynne Fryhofer’s 13th kill of the night to provide Harvard with the happy ending it wanted.
“It was the perfect way to end our season,” senior Mikaelle Comrie said. “We have had a lot of long five-game matches that didn’t go our way, so it was nice to finally close one out on our last Senior Night.”
This weekend’s double-header against Penn (15-10, 11-2 Ivy) and the Tigers (13-11, 8-5) began with a disappointing three-set sweep by the Quakers, 25-23, 25-18, 25-23. But Friday night’s results were overshadowed the following evening, when the Crimson (9-17, 6-8) triumphed over Princeton for the first time in the four-year careers of both Comrie and co-captain Miyoko Pettit.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
A lack of team communication in the first set sent Harvard to an early deficit on Saturday against the Tigers, but according to Comrie, as Princeton began to pull ahead, 21-11, the Crimson finally heard the wake up call.
“At that point, we realized we had nothing to lose,” junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll said. “No matter what, we wanted to go into the second set with momentum. It could have gone either way [from there].”
After reconvening during a timeout, a string of eight unanswered points and consistent service from sophomore Taylor Docter helped Harvard hold off the Tigers and win the opening game, 26-24.
“We kept going one [point] at a time,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said. “Those comebacks are hard to come by—I mean we’ve had one of those in the past—but to hold them on game point is huge.”
Harvard rode its wave of unanswered points into the second set, when it sprinted ahead, 5-0, and, after taking the Tigers point-for-point for the remainder of the game, defeated them, 25-21.
Princeton finally responded by tailoring its offensive formations to its biggest threat, junior middle blocker Cathryn Quinn, a change that allowed it to capture the third and fourth sets, 25-14 and 25-22, respectively.
“They got a run similar to what we got in the second game, and those are really hard to come back from,” Ingersoll said. “We’re also used to giving teams five games. Knowing you have a couple games ahead of you, it’s tough to mentally pull through for the win.”
For the eighth time this season, the Crimson found itself in the fifth set, but luckily for Harvard, the prior experience finally seemed to pay off.
After trading leads throughout the closing set, the score knotted at 11. The Crimson proved the class of 2011 deserved its recognition for the night when a kill by Comrie and several digs from Pettit in the final four points of the match helped Harvard’s offense close the books on the Tigers and the season.
“We both wanted to play our best and wanted to play as hard as we could,” said Comrie, who led the Crimson with 20 kills. “The team played well because we knew how much this mattered to both Miyo and me. It was great to see everyone come together.”
PENN 3, HARVARD 0
Although the Crimson was able to avenge its previous 3-2 loss to the Tigers on Saturday, Harvard was unable to do the same in its rematch against Penn and suffered a three-set sweep to the Quakers for the second time this season.
“We played well, but came up short,” Weiss said. “They weren’t making any mistakes...We were playing so well, but you’ve got to play flawless volleyball.”
While individual performances from two Penn seniors, setter Megan Tryon and top hitter Julia Swanson, posed threats to Harvard, the Quakers’ combined defensive effort sealed the Crimson’s fate.
“Our defenders are great at getting balls up,” said Ingersoll, who led Harvard in blocks and kills for the weekend, despite playing through a shoulder injury. “But it doesn’t always translate into a kill if we’re not given the chance to get that perfect dig.”
Despite the loss, the Crimson’s victory over third-place Princeton kept the Harvard in place to finish the season fifth in the Ivy League standings.

Harvard women’s swimming and diving made a splash during its season opener against Ivy League rivals Dartmouth and Cornell in Hanover, N.H. this past Friday. The Crimson emerged from the water with 184.5-115.5 and 186-114 wins over the Big Red and Big Green, respectively. By the end of the night, Harvard further decorated its start to the season by nabbing six pool records and nine event wins.
This wasn’t the first time that the Crimson posted a strong first performance against Dartmouth and Cornell: Harvard has opened against the two schools since 2007, wining each of those meets. But the Crimson had no intention of taking its opponents lightly this time around.
“We didn’t want to go in complacent,” co-captain Ali Slack said. “We definitely wanted to show them just how well we’re doing this year and how hard we’ve been training these past few months.”
Helming the tide of success for Harvard was freshman Paige Newell, who came away with wins in the 1,000-yard freestyle with a time of 10:07.19 and the 500-yard freestyle in 4:56.56—both new pool records.
“Paige is showing everyone what our freshman class can do,” senior Kate Mills said. “She was actually sick last week. When she came back, we all told her go out there and break the pool record, and she responded, ‘Alright.’ That just epitomizes the attitude of our freshmen.”
Mills herself established two pool records during the meet—one individual and the other as a part of the 400-yard freestyle relay with Slack, senior Katy Hinkle, and freshman Jenna Gregoire. Mills surged to a first-place finish in the 200 butterfly, clocking in at 2:01.19—more than three seconds ahead of the previous record. The 400-yard free relay closed out the meet with a 3:30.08 victory.
Hinkle complemented her teammates’ victories with another pool record finish of 23.68 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle and a win in the 100-yard freestyle, touching the wall in 52.35.
“The meet was amazing not only because of the times, but also just the way we came together cheering behind the lanes,” Slack said. “Everyone was really pulling together. The more we’re pushing ourselves, the better the end of our season is going to be.”
Junior Meghan Leddy also gave the Crimson reason to celebrate with a pool record-breaking victory in the 200-yard backstroke in a time of 1:59.88. Sophomore Mackenzie Luick added to Harvard’s point tally with a 2:22.29 first-place finish in the 200-yard breaststroke.
The Crimson diving squad bolstered the swimmers’ strong results. Sophomore Teagan Lehrmann came in second in both the 1-meter and 3-meter diving finals, each behind Dartmouth freshman Katy Feng.
With another season underway, Harvard has its broader goal firmly in view: the Ivy League championship, which narrowly fell out of the team’s grasp last season. And the key to seeing the Ivy League title return to Blodgett Pool lies squarely in the details.
“What everyone else doesn’t get to see is that before every meet, we all stand up in front of one another and discuss our goals,” Mills said. “[Last Friday at Dartmouth], each and every one of us hit our personal goals. Each team we face is an opportunity to perfect our skill sets. It’s the little things that will end up making a huge difference.”
Its sights set on redemption, Harvard will carry this strong momentum to Uris Pool in New York on Friday, where the Crimson will face off against Columbia, which dropped its first meet to a strong Yale team this past weekend.
“I think we have a really special team this year, and Dartmouth is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we’re capable of accomplishing,” Mills said. “Every year’s team is different. It’s about how well personalities congeal, and this team’s atmosphere is incredible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has a lot to live up to, but this season’s Harvard wrestling squad proved it is ready to step up to the challenge.
The wrestling team traveled to Binghamton, N.Y. to compete in the annual Binghamton Open yesterday and saw the best results from its middle weight classes. Action kicked off at 9 a.m. and went into the late evening.
Two of the Crimson wrestlers were battling until the last stage of the tournament. Although Harvard could not pull out a win in any of the weight classes, junior Corey Jantzen and sophomore Walter Peppelman both reached the finals. Sophomore Adam Hogue, another Crimson standout, fought through to the semifinals but fell to an Old Dominion opponent and finished fourth overall in his weight class.
“I think we wrestled well,” Jantzen said. “I think we’ve shown a lot of progress since September when we started working out. We’re getting better in a couple of areas, and everyone competed well.”
Wrestling at 149 lbs., Jantzen almost capped off his return in the perfect way. After missing most of the 2008-09 season due to injury and taking the next year off from college, there were questions about how the Harvard wrestler would perform in his first event back in a Crimson singlet.
But Jantzen put many of those questions to rest with his performance yesterday. The junior cruised through his first three bouts to the semifinals, earning bonus points along the way. He pinned his first two opponents easily and earned a major decision in the next round.
Continuing his dominance, he crushed his opponent, Donnie Vinson of Binghamton, in the semifinal. He battled in the final but couldn’t carry the momentum from his earlier rounds to pull off the victory. He fell to No. 2 and defending 141-lb. NCAA Champion Kyle Dake of Cornell narrowly in a 2-0 decision.
“I think I performed well for my first tournament back,” Jantzen said. “Honestly, I’m not satisfied, though. I had to shake out some cobwebs and get used to competing again. There’s still room for improvement, but it was a great start.”
Peppelman progressed through the tournament in a similar fashion as Jantzen, pinning his competitor in the first round and winning two major decisions in the next two rounds. In just those three rounds, he outscored his opponents, 31-3.
Peppelman continued to roll, earning a spot in the semifinals against the Big Red’s Jesse Shanaman. He dominated his opponent in a 10-0 major decision to face another Cornell opponent, DJ Meagher. Try as he might, Peppelman could not defeat Meagher and dropped a 4-2 decision in the final.
“I think that I wrestled well,” Peppelman said. “There are still things I need to change and work on, but it was a good place to start from, and I’m hoping to improve during the year.”
Hogue (165) managed to make it to the semifinals, just one step shy of matching his Harvard teammates. He pinned his opponent in the first round in 1:06 and won the next two matches to reach the semifinals.
Hogue dropped that match to Daniel Rivera of Old Dominion and also lost an 8-1 bout to Binghamton’s Matt Kaylor in the third-place consolation matchup. He finished in fourth place with a 4-2 record for the competition.
After a successful freshman campaign, sophomore Steven Keith also opened up his season in an impressive fashion. The 125-pounder lost in the first round to Penn’s Mark Rappo but rebounded quickly with three consolation wins. Rappo stopped his run again in the wrestlebacks with a 9-7 decision.
Another Crimson rookie, freshman Cameron Croy (184), was victorious in his first two rounds, but fell to Binghamton’s Nate Schiedel in the following bout. In the wrestlebacks, he won his first matchup but eventually fell to Lehigh’s Keith Bailey, 4-2. Other Harvard wrestlers who managed to pick up wins included sophomore Nick Brazeau (165), junior Bryan Panzano (184), and senior Michael Sadler (174).
After a strong showing from many of the wrestlers in individual action, Harvard competes in its first dual tournament next weekend, again in Binghamton, N.Y. This time, the Crimson takes on tougher competition, facing Penn State, Michigan State, and Eastern Michigan.
“We prepare for every competition and match like it’s a national finals match,” Jantzen said. “There’s not much different we’re going to do. As for things under our control, we need to make sure our bodies are well and stay focused.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With voting for the leadership of the Undergraduate Council opening today, Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12 and his running mate Bonnie Cao ’12, the current UC Secretary, have pulled ahead in the race for student group endorsements. A total of 16 groups had given the Ebrahim-Cao campaign their stamp of approval as of yesterday.
Beyond the number of endorsements that Ebrahim and Cao have won, the ticket has picked up endorsements from many of the most visible student groups, including the Black Students Association, Asian American Association, Harvard Republican Club, and Harvard College Democrats.
Their opponents Matthew S. Coe ’12—the UC Social Life Task Force Chair—and his vice presidential candidate Tengbo Li ’12—the chair of the Education Committee—have racked up endorsements from Veritas Financial Group, the Brazilian Club, H-Club, the Harvard College Economics Review, and Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs.
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this month, UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 named social life as the most important issue in this year’s race.
“That’s the thing that’s getting student groups excited,” Hysen said.
According to Dems President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, Dems members were drawn to Ebrahim and Cao’s experience working with student groups and realistic proposals for improving access to social space and fundraising opportunities. The club has predicted the ultimate winner in the last seven UC presidential elections.
Coe and Li’s proposed Student Venture Capital Fund, which will provide student groups with capital for investment and growth initiatives, has helped draw in endorsements from entrepreneurship-focused student groups such as the Veritas Financial Group.
“It’s unique,” Coe said of the program. “We could see student groups profit exponentially.”
The third ticket in the race—comprising of UC-outsiders Collin A. Jones ’12 and his running mate Peter D. Davis ’12—has decided not to vie for official approval from student groups. The Jones-Davis campaign has instead relied on online multimedia including videos and a “direct democracy” poll soliciting suggestions for how to spend $20.10 of their campaign funds. The ticket released a video over the weekend chronicling their purchase of a Cuban tree frog with the final portion of their budget.
“We feel like the current framework of the UC campaign process is very biased towards candidates that have been in the UC before,” Jones said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rachel A. Maddow criticized the growing gap between the campaign process and the reality of governing last night at Harvard Kennedy School, during the Theodore H. White Lecture on Press and Politics, in which she said that this gap has been driven by the American media.
Maddow, the host of the popular Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, said that in today’s news business, “what’s working is political conflict.”
Maddow began her remarks by stating that the American public “hates” the press. She cited the recent coinage of the term “lame-stream media” as an example of the distaste for reporters.
Maddow said she sees the effect of popular antagonism against the media in her own ratings.
“Am I particularly more exciting when I talk about Fox News?” she said.  “The numbers rise because there is an appetite for hearing that commentators from the right are terrible people.”
She said the lines between governing and campaigning have been erased, and the climate of intense campaigning usually reserved for the final days of political campaigns exists constantly now.
This climate, she said, creates problems for governance. As an example, she said that newly-elected Republican congressmen have been told not to join committees because committee membership is bad for future campaigns. “Committees are where Congress does a lot of its work, in, you know, making laws and stuff,” she said.
She also added that the current media landscape favors “screamers.”
“For websites seeking the video click, it’s the exclamation points that count,” Maddow said.
She said that the loss of a single, authoritative, voice in news, replaced by a multitude of voices, is not a bad thing.
She called the current media landscape a meritocratic one in which the best, most journalistic websites are the most read.
Members of the audience were generally receptive of Maddow’s message. “I agreed with her,” said Morgan M. Wilson ’14.
“She comes from an intellectual standpoint, and as she said, she’s not a screamer.”
“I think she has a perspective that isn’t often shared about how the change in American media can be a positive thing,” said William F. Poff-Webster ’14,
Before the lecture, the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy presented the David Nyhan Prize for Political Journalism to William Greider, the national affairs correspondent for The Nation.
“Bill Greider has strong views, and he’s been expressing them for more than 40 years,” said Alex S. Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on Press, Politics and Public policy in his introduction. 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 18, 2010
An earlier version of the Nov. 15 news article "Maddow Discusses Politics and the Media" stated that the lecture was delivered at the Institute of Politics. In fact, the location was Harvard Kennedy School. The Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy—not the IOP—presented the David Nyhan Prize.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a contentious hour-long debate last night, the Undergraduate Council passed legislation that puts forward a series of measures to address the gender imbalance on the Council.
The legislation comes in light of this fall’s elections—after which only 12 of the 51 UC members were female—but Council members expressed reservations about the methods that the Council chose to use.
The UC will be required to reach out to Peer Advising Fellows and publicize elections more heavily over women’s group e-mail lists in an effort to increase the number of female candidates. According to Student Relations Committee Chair Ashley M. Fabrizio ’11, the UC is often overlooked as a viable option for those interested in getting involved at Harvard.
But some UC members objected to the tactics the legislation took to create a gender-neutral campaigning process. In discussions with female members and other women leaders across campus over the last month, Council leaders have found that women are often less likely to engage in door-to-door campaigning, seen as the key to winning Yard elections, or are less well received when they do campaign in their Yards.
“Because the election period is so short, you basically have to be a really aggressive go-getter, and to have the nerve to go door-to-door and sell yourself,” UC Secretary and current Vice-Presidential candidate Bonnie Cao ’12 said in an interview last month.
The legislation requires the UC to host a “meet the candidates” night and send out short biographies and platforms of each candidate over district e-mail lists to give each candidate more visibility.
But some representatives opposed the legislation’s emphasis on campaigning, arguing that there is not enough evidence that this is the true cause of any imbalance.
“I think it’s super offensive to say that women are too timid to run,” said Adams House representative Ellen V. Lehman ’11. “It’s very subjective.”
But the UC ultimately passed the legislation, citing the importance of taking some steps to address the long-standing issue.
“This has been a perennial problem. We talked about this my freshman year,” said UC Student Life Chair and current presidential candidate Senan Ebrahim ’12. “We’re not trying to achieve some ideal gender ratio. We just want to give every candidate who runs a level playing field.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—In the game that would decide the fate of its season, Harvard didn’t look like a team fighting for a title. It looked like a team that just got beat.
All season long, Penn has felt like it had something to prove. After going undefeated in the Ivy League last year, the Quakers were not picked to repeat despite returning the majority of their starters. Combine that chip with the emotional drive to win another title in honor of Owen Thomas, Penn’s captain-elect who passed away in April, and it was clear that the Quakers would be a force to be reckoned with on Senior Day at Franklin Field.
So perhaps the more surprising thing is that through a quarter and a half, the matchup actually looked like a game that was going to be contested.
Harvard’s had its own share of adversity to overcome this season, most of it coming in the form of injuries to key players. It, like Penn, had built its team around a dominating defense. And in the opening drives, the Crimson was the offense in the better rhythm.
As the game wore on, though, the Quakers’ dominating defense and physical offensive line simply shut Harvard down. But Harvard’s confidence was lost long before halftime—and it was because it shot itself in the foot.
Penn looked solid but was far from masterful in the first half, and Crimson penalties—like an illegal motion call that nullified a 28-yard reception—and miscues—like a fumbled punt that gave Penn the ball on the Crimson nine-yard line—kept Harvard from taking advantage of that open door.
“You know that you’re not going to score a lot of points against these guys historically,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said, “so you have to minimize turnovers, you have to play great field-position football with special teams, and you have to stop them. And we couldn’t do consistently really any of the three today against a very good football team.”
A lot of credit must go to Penn, which clearly asserted itself as the best team in the Ivy League. By the middle of the third quarter, the Quakers made even the dominant Harvard defense look like a scout team. For the first time all season, we sat in the press box and wished that the clock would tick faster, that the massacre would end.
The final stats tell the story of the game all too well. The Crimson managed to outgain Penn by over 100 yards and had twice as many first downs as the Quakers, but it also gave up three interceptions and 63 penalty yards. Simply put, Penn was able to dominate not because it made big, flashy plays, but because its players did the little things well, nearly every time.
“The thing about this team is that they’re so simplistic,” Murphy said. “It’s really old-time football, and it’s impressive.”
Against the bulk of the teams on its schedule, Harvard’s play on Saturday would have been enough to win the game. But what was missing was that extra spark that a team needs to pull off a real upset.
The Quakers found that spark in the memory of Owen Thomas, and you could see it in the way they played. Penn was a team that was going to stop at nothing to get the title, and the Crimson just didn’t play with that kind of energy.
For the second straight year, Harvard heads into the final week of the season knowing that an Ivy title isn’t in the cards. But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to play for. For the seniors, who are 3-0 against Yale in their careers thus far, there’s still an awful lot of pride on the line.
As a writer and a fan, I hope the Crimson can find that spark somewhere in the chorus of vuvuzelas in a packed Harvard Stadium this weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his first game of the 2010 season, Keith Wright was one of the few things that wasn’t wrong with the Harvard men’s basketball team’s debut performance.
The junior co-captain had his best collegiate game to date, tying a personal best with 22 points and grabbing a career-high 16 rebounds. But that wasn’t nearly enough for the Crimson, as Wright’s teammates shot a paltry 21 percent from the field in a 66-53 loss at George Mason Saturday afternoon.
“I felt like we got the shots we wanted. We just couldn’t knock them down, we couldn’t finish,” Wright said. “George Mason played a great game. They were the better team.”
Harvard hung with the Patriots through a sloppy first half, but a 14-0 run by Mason early in the second turned a 39-33 lead into a 53-33 advantage, and the Patriots never looked back.
The young Crimson guards seemed frazzled early on, passing up open looks from three and instead trying to drive inside, which led to many of team’s 11 first-half turnovers. But Wright—who scored the team’s first 10 points—kept Harvard in the game, as George Mason had trouble stopping the center in the paint.
After the Crimson cut the Patriot lead to one with 8:12 remaining in the opening period, Mason went on a 6-0 run after back-to-back turnovers by juniors Andrew Van Nest and Oliver McNally to open up a seven-point advantage at 21-14.
Three consecutive Wright points brought the team back within four, but the Patriots pushed the lead back to nine with 5:17 remaining in the first.
Harvard fought back again and went into the half down by only four, 32-28, with Wright scoring 15 of the team’s 28 points in the opening period.
“We didn’t play our best basketball,” sophomore Christian Webster said. “[But going into the half] we were feeling good, only being down four even though they played pretty well in the first half and we played not so well.”
But the Crimson opened the second half with three consecutive turnovers, leading to easy fast-break baskets for Patriots Andre Cornelius and Luke Hancock to push the George Mason lead to eight.
A Webster three later pulled the Crimson within six at 16:13, but that was the closest Harvard would get the rest of the way. Patriot guard Cam Long responded by drilling back-to-back threes to push the lead to 45-33 with 13:40 remaining. After forward Ryan Pearson hit a jumper to extend the lead to 14, freshman Laurent Rivard and McNally committed back-to-back turnovers, allowing for two easy Cornelius layups to make it 51-33.
A three by Crimson sophomore guard Brandyn Curry at 9:18 finally stopped the run, but by then it was way too late.
“I think the turnovers were just first-game miscommunication,” Webster said. “I think most of it was first-game jitters...everyone was trying to do things that we don’t normally do, and I think that’s what caused [the turnovers].”
Webster added that he felt the team tried to force the ball inside to Wright too much in the second half, leading to steals and fast-break points for the Patriots.
The lead never fell below 17 until a Wright layup with 3:27 to go, and a McNally three and Van Nest jumper in the final 80 seconds made a late 18-point deficit seem more respectable.
The lone positive from the contest was the play of Wright—the Virginia native finished with a double-double in his return to his home state. The Crimson had just one double-double all of last season.
“Keith was pretty extraordinary,” Webster said. “He was a beast in the paint. Their big man who was supposed to be really good couldn’t stop Keith. He really showed what he was capable of doing.”
Rivard—expected to be the team’s highest-scoring freshman—struggled mightily in his collegiate debut, going 0-11 from the field, including 0-7 from downtown. Curry (2-10), and Webster (3-12) did not fare much better in the loss.
Hancock scored a team-high 14 points for the Patriots, while Pearson added 13 and Cornelius had 11. McNally and Webster each scored seven for Harvard.
Despite out-rebounding the Patriots, 41-34, the Crimson—which clearly missed injured forward Kyle Casey inside—was outscored, 40-20, in the paint. The team turned the ball over 24 times, leading to 24 George Mason points.
“We’ve just got to play basketball like we’re used to playing,” Wright said. “We’re a better team than we showed yesterday. We just try to move on…we’ll take care of some of that stuff in practice, but I’m still confident in our guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the opener of one of its most highly-anticipated seasons in recent history, the Harvard women’s basketball team certainly looked sluggish coming out of the gates. It took 20 minutes for the Crimson to wake up from its offseason slumber, but once it did, Harvard rolled to an easy 73-54 win over Maine on Saturday afternoon in Orono, Maine.
“I wasn’t surprised by [the slow start],” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We chalked it up as first-game jitters. We collectively know that we have the potential of having a special year. We’re the deepest we’ve been in I don’t know how long.”
The Black Bears dictated the tempo of the game for much of the first half, dominating the game on both the offensive and defensive sides of the court.
Faced with a 20-10 deficit with 8:01 to play in the opening half, junior point guard Brogan Berry hit a three-pointer to trigger a 9-1 run that worked the Crimson back into the game. By the time both teams headed for the locker room, Harvard trailed Maine by just one point, 29-28.
For the Crimson, several missed opportunities in scoring easy buckets led to overall poor defensive play.
“We missed a lot of layups in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “I’m going to guess that we missed six [or] seven layups. We don’t normally miss them. We didn’t dig in on defense because of that.”
“We came out slow,” Berry said. “We lacked some defensive intensity and urgency, but towards the end of that half, it really just came down to picking up our defense, and as a result of that, our offense started flowing.”
Harvard started off the second half by going inside to forward Emma Markley.
An easy layup for the All-Ivy senior gave the Crimson a lead it would not relinquish for the rest of the game.
Defensively, Harvard switched to a semi-full-court press defensive set, hoping that the change would disrupt the Black Bears’ offensive rhythm.
“We used a mix of man-to-man and zone defense, and because of that, Maine couldn’t get shots in the second half that they got in the first half,” Berry said.
After shots from Berry, co-captain Christine Matera, and sophomore forward Victoria Lippert, the Crimson began to pull away from Maine, leading 44-36.
A three-pointer from senior Claire Wheeler and baskets from Lippert and sophomore Elle Hagedorn sealed the deal for Harvard, as the team outscored the Black Bears, 45-25, in the second period.
“We are capable of doing a better job defensively than we did in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “It all starts with ball pressure and team defense. The defense creates the offense, and as soon as that happens, you feel good, and you don’t miss the shots that you should be making.”
Harvard ended the second half shooting 57.1 percent from the field, a stark contrast from its 30.3 percent effort in the first half.
Three players finished in double figures, as Berry led the Crimson with 20 points, six rebounds and six assists.
Lippert and Markley added 17 and 12 points, respectively.
“I had to do as much as I can to get us back in the game, whether it’s scoring, playing defense, getting rebounds, or passing,” Berry said.
While the Crimson picked up its defensive intensity, the team still managed to lose the battle on the boards, a facet of the game that was one of Harvard’s weaknesses last season. Even with Markley and Wheeler inside the paint, Maine held the rebounding edge, 44-38.
“We didn’t win in that statistics column,” Delaney-Smith said. “I’ll be curious to see where we failed, because we’re an entirely different team regarding rebounds. What we did really well was rotate, and sometimes it’s just the luck of the draw that the ball doesn’t come your way.”
“Today wasn’t the best day for us on the boards, but we’re improving overall in practice,” Berry added. “Maine’s a great rebounding team offensively, and they had a couple guards who really crashed hard. Sometimes it’s hard to find those players. We’re going to get better from here on out.”
By notching its first win, Harvard has finally gotten its season underway.
“We didn’t start very well, but we finished really well, and that’s all that really matters,” Delaney-Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA–With 11 minutes to go in the fourth quarter, the glaring sun disappeared behind the west stadium wall of Franklin Field. Chances had set on a Crimson victory, though, well before the final quarter.
With Harvard and Penn nearly matched in time of possession (28:53 to 31:07), average yards gained per play (4.7 to 4.8) and Harvard exceeding Penn in net yardage by a count of 410 to 278, Crimson turnovers proved critical to deciding the ultimately lopsided 34-14 Quaker victory.
Junior quarterback Collier Winters was the source of three of the Harvard turnovers that left the Crimson at a serious disadvantage.
One particular play call in the fourth quarter epitomized Harvard’s inability to capitalize on scoring opportunities. After pushing into Penn territory, Winters fired from the 35-yard line into double coverage, underthrowing the ball. Penn’s senior defensive back Josh Powers leapt up, nabbed Winters’ pass, and terminated the drive with a Penn touchback.
Other than the interceptions—one of which was determined by a bounce more so than Winters’ arm—Harvard’s quarterback went 21-of-44 for 219 yards and a touchdown.
On the other side of the ball, sophomore play caller Billy Ragone passed for a quiet 59 yards on 4-of-12 passing without committing a turnover.
RUNNING RIOT
Although kept at bay through most of the first half, Penn’s running game broke out as the second quarter drew to a close and continued to dominate the game in the second half.
Leading the charge was sophomore running back Brandon Colavita, who amassed 122 yards and two touchdowns. Late in the second frame, Colavita capped off a 62-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown run to open up the game in Penn’s favor. Accepting the ball from Ragone at the two, the 220-lb. sophomore bolted diagonally to his left, upending a Crimson defender before tumbling into the endzone to put the Quakers up, 10-0. Colavita’s score broke the stalemate between two rigid defenses, and, moving into the second half, the running back continued to take advantage of a tiring Crimson defense.
“Our idea going into every game pretty much is to pound the ball, running it, and to wear [the defense] down,” Colavita said. “Our O-line, I think they’re the best in the league, and it’s a credit to them for sticking with a very good D-line, a very good defense.”
Penn’s dominant offensive line allowed its running game to prosper, as the Quakers netted 219 rushing yards throughout the game on a Crimson defense which yields only 100.8 yards per game.
Harvard safety and captain Collin Zych admitted the blunt but powerful technique of the Penn backs made it difficult for Harvard’s defense to control the running game.
“They played hard, they run hard, and they’re not going to sit and try to juke you,” Zych said. “As [coach Tim Murphy] said, they’re simple runners. You’ve just got to bring them down, and it comes down to tackling, and there were some plays we just didn’t tackle well.”
IN MEMORIAM
With their win over the Crimson, the Quakers are guaranteed at least a share of the Ivy League championship. Although the win represented a worthy cause for celebration, a tone of somber reverence marked the victorious home team following the game. Coaches and players alike saw the imminent Ivy League title as the culmination of a season devoted to the memory of co-captain Owen Thomas, who took his own life last spring.
Penn responded by dedicating its efforts this season to the memory of his leadership and character. According to Quaker junior linebacker Erik Rask, the team’s loss of a core defensive leader represented a source of adversity that it transformed into motivation.
“Owen’s been in everyone’s thoughts every day, every minute, every second throughout the whole year,” Rask said. “We just really wanted to do it for Owen, and this whole year, we know he’s been watching down on us. It’s just an awesome feeling to win it for him, because he’s such an awesome person and meant so much to so many guys on this team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two gold-medal finishes represented the strength of the Harvard fencing team in its opening tournament at the Penn State Open this weekend. Reigning national champion Caroline Vloka and freshman Alexandra Kiefer both garnered gold medals for the Crimson, while freshman teammate Michael Raynis earned a silver medal and junior co-captain Valentin Staller a bronze medal in the epée and sabre, respectively.
The results are even more impressive because of the level of competition the Harvard fencers faced. The University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Ohio State, and Duke were all contenders for last year’s NCAA championship.
“This was a tremendous start to the season,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “All the top schools competed in the tournament...and Harvard overall dominated. It was one of our better showings in a long time here.”
“The tournament was a really important competition for us,” Staller added. “All the best schools were there, and it sort of showed us where we are at this point in the season.”
Although the men did not have a gold medalist, they did record two top-15 finishers in each of the three respective weapons. Raynis was supported in the epée by junior James Hawrot, who finished eighth, and sophomore Benjamin Cohen, who finished 26th. In the foil, freshman Lucas Lin took eighth, and co-captain Hao Meng finished 11th. But it was the sabre that boasted the strongest showing, with three Crimson top-10 finishers by the swords of Staller, freshman Eric Arzoian, and sophomore Thomas Kolasa, who finished second, fifth, and 10th, respectively.
Even without the gold, the depth of the men’s side will play to its advantage.
“We have some superstars, but we also have some depth [on the men’s team],” Brand said. “In each weapon we have some representation, and it shows in the results.”
During the tournament, the superstars were found on the women’s side with the efforts of Kiefer and Vloka. Also turning in respectable finishes were sophomore Nadia Eldeib and freshman Dakota Root, who finished 15th and 17th in the epée, junior Shelby MacLeod, who took 23rd in the foil, and junior co-captain Hayley Levitt and sophomore Elena Helgiu, who placed 19th and 23rd in the sabre.
“The women showed some of the terrific individual fencers we have on board,” Brand said. “[The women] don’t have the depth of the men...but they’re a very cohesive team.”
Notably missing from the women’s squad was junior Noam Mills, who is currently competing at the World Championships. Mills, who fences the epée, was the second-place finisher in the NCAA championships last year and garnered All-American and All-Ivy first-team honors.
Vloka helped support the absence of her teammate, despite a lingering wrist injury. The national champion captured the gold in the sabre, laying the groundwork for another NCAA title this spring.
“She’s obviously one of the most competitive people I’ve ever worked with at Harvard,” Brand said. “The injury is a concern...but she’s determined to compete. I’m confident she’ll stay strong...and certainly has a shot at repeating this year.”
Even with the star power of the upperclassmen, the recruits this year are showing their colors as well, proving that a small but talented class can make an impact early. All but one of the freshmen finished in the top 20 of the competition, with Kiefer and Raynis capturing medals in their first collegiate appearance.
“Compared to last year’s team, we’re stronger this season with our recruits,” Brand said. “We have the top epée fencer in the country, and Lucas Lin has bolstered our foil squad, which has traditionally been our weakest board. The recruits are already making an impact.”
“We have a fantastic recruiting class this year,” Staller echoed. “They bring a lot of positive energy, experience, and confidence, which are all huge in fencing.”
With a strong group of freshmen and a seasoned band of upperclassmen, the Ivy League title and a solid NCAA tournament showing are within reach for the Harvard fencers.
“This [year], we have a team that is definitely in the running for the Ivy League championship,” Brand said. “To win the title, you need two really good fencers at each weapon...and we have it. We have great individuals and an edge over the competition as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University added to its directly held U.S. traded securities last quarter—helping fuel a 7-percent increase in the value of those assets to $1.54 billion—and the University made sizable new investments in its already large emerging markets portfolio.
The University’s holdings were reported last Friday in a mandatory quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing disclosing Harvard’s direct holdings of U.S.-listed securities. Harvard manages a portion of its endowment directly and contracts with outside money managers for the remainder.
The University increased its investments in exchange-trade funds that track the performance of the Brazilian, Mexican, South Korean, and other emerging economies. Investments in emerging market ETFs represent about 67 percent of the investments reported in last week’s filing.
After its domestically traded securities portfolio declined in value earlier this year, the University broadly expanded its stock market investments last quarter with a variety of stock purchases in U.S. corporations.
According to the filing, the University now owns a $4.8 million stake in Halliburton, the energy conglomerate that has recently come under fire for its connection to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest accidental off-shore spill in history. Halliburton contracted with BP to provide cement for parts of the rig.
The University has also increased its holdings of real estate-related investments with the purchase of stock in KB Homes, an ETF tracking new U.S. residential construction, and further investment in Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, a hotel development firm in which the University has invested $46.8 million.
While the University has largely utilized ETFs to tap into emerging markets, it also made investments the U.S.-listed stock of foreign firms, including multimillion-dollar investments in two state-owned Chinese companies, the oil company China National Offshore Oil Corporation and the telecommunications company China Mobile Limited.
University officials were not available for comment yesterday.
Like the broader market, the University endowment suffered heavy losses during the financial crisis beginning in 2008 but has recently begun to recover, posting an 11 percent gain in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, which brought the endowment’s value to $27.4 billion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—In the second quarter, freshman kicker David Mothander lined up for a potential game-tying field goal, and it looked as though the Harvard-Penn football game would live up to its billing as a close battle. But as Quaker linebacker Erik Rask burst up the middle, blocking Mothander’s kick, it became clear that Penn would continue to do what it does best—shut the door.
The No. 18 Quakers (8-1, 6-0 Ivy) posted 27 straight points in a dominant 34-14 victory at Franklin Field, clinching at least a share of the Ancient Eight crown and sending the Crimson (6-3, 4-2) to its second Ivy loss.
“Well, Penn’s a tremendous football team...and today they were completely in sync, special teams, defensively, and offensively,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “And it made us look bad, no question about it. I didn’t feel like we played great.”
But the Crimson didn’t always look outmatched on the field. Throughout the first half, it appeared that Harvard would give the reigning conference champions all they could handle, as the visitors outgained Penn, 137 yards to 119. But the only stat that mattered was up on the scoreboard, where Penn led, 10-0, at the break after taking advantage of a couple of Crimson miscues.
The game was scoreless after the first quarter, with the top two scoring defenses in the league staying true to form. Harvard opened the second period in much the same way, forcing a seemingly harmless Quaker punt, but Scott Lopano’s kick hit junior Dan Minamide in the back and a group of Penn players fell on the ball at the nine-yard line.
Although the Crimson defense held strong, limiting the hosts to a field goal, the Quakers were finally on the board, and they didn’t look back.
After blocking Mothander’s kick five minutes later, Penn drove 62 yards in six plays and Brandon Colavita burst into the endzone from two yards out for the first of two touchdown runs on the day.
And with the start of the second half, an entirely different Quaker team seemed to take control.
“They made some changes with what they were doing, some good things that were beating our scheme,” said captain and safety Collin Zych. “And also, we were out of position a couple of times, and they took advantage of it.”
While Harvard’s offense continued to struggle against the second-ranked rush defense in the FCS, Penn found a rhythm behind its corps of running backs, scoring on all three of its third-quarter drives.
Although the Quakers completed just four passes for 56 yards on the day, Colavita and fellow bruisers Jeff Jack and Luke DeLuca rumbled for 165 yards on the ground—part of Penn’s 222 rushing yards overall—and pushed the lead to 27-0 after three periods.
The kicking game also held strong for the Quakers, as senior placekicker Andrew Samson followed up his first-quarter chip shot with a booming field goal from 45 yards out in the third. With the pair of scores, Samson moved into first place on the school’s all-time list for field goals made.
As Penn’s offense began to click in all phases, the Crimson was constantly forced to play catch-up, and the visitors weren’t up to the task. Harvard put up just 77 yards in the third quarter, and when it finally seemed to get something going, the Quakers always managed a response.
Junior quarterback Collier Winters orchestrated an 11-play drive at the end of the third that reached the Penn 35, but his deep throw to junior Levi Richards hung up in the air too long, and Quaker safety Josh Powers caught up to the streaking wide receiver in time to pull down an interception in the endzone.
“We don’t really have one star player on the defense,” Rask said. “Each week we’ve had someone come up big, and we’ve made the plays when we need to make them, and we just never really quit.”
Of course, Harvard’s offense also refused to quit, and Penn could not keep the Crimson off the board completely. Winters followed up his poor throw by leading a 64-yard touchdown drive, capping the effort with a deep jump ball to senior Mike Cook, who ripped it away from a defensive back and cruised into the endzone to break up the shutout.
The Crimson added a final score late, after Winters headed for the sideline to protect his mending hip. With sophomore Colton Chapple leading the offense, Harvard took advantage of good field position en route to its second touchdown. Senior Gino Gordon—whose 110 rushing yards were the most by an Ivy back against Penn this year—took a pitch from Chapple and reached the endzone untouched from three yards out.
In the end, though, the Quakers proved too strong in all phases of the game, as Harvard was forced to watch its counterpart celebrate an Ivy title for the second year in a row.
Penn coach Al Bagnoli earned a Gatorade bath for his school-record 130th victory as head coach, and the Quakers’ 15th Ancient Eight crown marks the second-most among Ivy League schools.
“Obviously, we don’t feel great right now,” Zych said. “It’s a tough feeling. And give credit to Penn, they were a great team, and they played well. They played better than we did, and they deserved to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. women’s national hockey team started off its stay at the Four Nations Cup with a shootout win over Canada, and the rematch between the two squads proved just as exciting. But this time, it was the host Canadians who came out on top, topping the American women, 3-2, in overtime on Saturday night in Newfoundland.
The U.S. team is coached by Harvard’s Katey Stone and featured three Crimson skaters—Julie Chu ’06-’07, Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08, and sophomore Josephine Pucci.
But the Canadian who proved to be the difference-maker was an all-too-familiar face for Harvard. Rebecca Johnston, a Canadian Olympic veteran who is also a junior at Cornell, scored both the first and game-winning goals for her team on Saturday.
Johnston’s first goal put Canada up, 1-0, late in the opening period. But a pair of quick scores midway through the second gave the Americans a one-goal lead.
Chu tallied the first goal for team USA, knocking a backhand past Shannon Szabados at 9:07 of the second. Just over a minute later, Kendall Coyne—a skater currently taking a postgraduate year at the Berkshire School who has professed a desire to play college hockey at Harvard—put the Americans ahead.
Canadian Meaghan Mikkelson tied the score near the end of the second period, and the teams remained tied through the remainder of regulation.
Johnston’s golden goal came 6:25 into the four-on-four overtime period.
The U.S. player of the game was another fixture on the Boston hockey scene—BC goaltender Molly Schaus, who made 49 saves to keep her squad in the game despite being outshot, 52-26.
Stone and Pucci will be back with the Crimson this week, and their return couldn’t come sooner. Harvard is reeling after a winless weekend on the road at Quinnipiac and Princeton, and Pucci’s defense in front of struggling sophomore Laura Bellamy or untested freshman Lauren Joarnt in net will be crucial in this weekend’s home-and-home series with Dartmouth.

Picture this: It’s Saturday night, and you’re at a party talking to the girl you’re been crushing on all semester. She’s listening attentively to everything you say—but then suddenly your phone buzzes, and you’re back at your desk with an unfinished p-set in front of you, the fantasy shattered.
Although it's easy to fall prey to daydreams, a recent psychology study would tell you this: a wandering mind may not be a happy mind.
This study—which was recently published in Science magazine—was conducted by Harvard Professor of Psychology Daniel Gilbert and graduate student Matthew A. Killingsworth. According to a recent article in the Harvard Gazette, the study states that most people’s minds wander frequently—but this does not make them happier when they come back to reality.
The study surveyed a random sample of 2,250 adults with a wide range of ages, socioeconomic backgrounds and occupations.  Participants were questioned through an iPhone application, which sent them text messages at random times of the day asking about their feelings, actions and thoughts, with the expectation that they would reply as soon as possible.
According to the results, 46.9 percent of the total responses reported mind wandering, or "stimulus independent thought." Unsurprisingly, most subjects daydreamed about pleasant topics rather than unpleasant and neutral ones.
However, the study indicates that good daydreams do not make people happier than staying engaged in current activities does. It also states that people are most likely to mind wander when they are resting, using the computer, and working. It is least likely to occur during exercise, conversation, and sexual activity.
So take note if you’re drifting off during lecture—those pleasant daydreams won’t make your life any better when you snap out of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Update 10:10 p.m.
Massachusetts regulators will soon restrict sales of caffeinated alcoholic beverages, including the popular Four Loko brand drinks.
WBZ-TV first reported the sale of malt beverages containing caffeine or other stimulants will be banned by the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, which had announced an inquiry into such drinks in an advisory last Friday.
The news comes after Harvard College administrators took a stand against the drink, with one calling it “badness in a can.”
In late October, University Health Services Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 and Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Director Ryan M. Travia cautioned students against consuming the drink, which they said has been linked to hospitalizations of students around the country due to its potent mix of caffeine and alcohol—as much as six beers in one 23.5 ounce can.
“Drinking alcohol with energy drinks is dangerous, given the inherent risk in mixing alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants such as caffeine, ginseng,  guaran, and other additives,” the administrators wrote in the email.  “Often, stimulants mask the depressant effects of the alcohol, allowing the person to consume even more alcohol and thus, delaying feelings of drunkenness.”
Phusion Products, which manufactures Four Loko, has consistently defended the safety of its product and said it promotes safe drinking.

Sophomores, be advised: The deadline to submit your pre-term planning information, as well as your Plan of Study, is fast approaching. Make sure to log in to the Student Planning Portal by this Wednesday, Nov. 17—otherwise you'll have to pay that $40/week late fee.
If you're at a loss for what courses to choose, consider a class in the Computer Science department. We’ve heard it takes some serious computer skills to figure out how to use the planning tool—although the Registrar has provided a tutorial you can watch.

This poster was spotted at Lamont Library around 9 p.m.
Using a smartphone camera, we scanned the code and got linked to this website, which includes a map of Harvard with numbered icons marking four locations: the cul-de-sac outside Eliot and Kirkland Houses, an area between the Corporal Burns Playground and Peabody Terrace, the Science Center, and the Lampoon building.
Below the map is the following line of text: "Have an edge on the night. We'll show you how." There is also a link to "like" the site on Facebook and to sign up for e-mail updates. The contact page lists four e-mail addresses and a New Jersey phone number.
According to a message that was sent over a few e-mail lists, it looks like Hollre is a social networking tool that allows the user to identify parties in his or her vicinity at any given moment.
"Hollre matches you geographically with what&#8217s [sic] going on. No more wandering about, no more awkward texting in the corner," reads the e-mail. Apparently, there will be "Food and Drink" at the launch on Friday. Time and place? No idea. Presumably you have to enter your e-mail address into the website to find out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A moving critique of American education, “Waiting for Superman” poignantly illustrates some critical shortfalls of our education system. The film largely focuses on low teacher quality, pinpointing tenure as a disincentive for K-12 teachers to strive for high performance and stringent union contracts as an impediment to firing ineffective teachers. From its portrayal of union leader Randi Weingarten as a rabble-rousing demagogue and past U.S. presidents as daft and ineffective policymakers, the film implicitly suggests unions and the government are to blame for the status quo. According to one impassioned interviewee, “[t]eachers unions are…a menace…an impediment to reform.”
Indeed, increasing teacher effectiveness is essential to providing all students with a quality education. But the film does not provide substantive solutions to bring high-quality instruction to every classroom; instead, it paints a dim picture of public education and plants the unrealistic hope that the model of a few highly effective charter schools can be brought to scale. In reality, our education system faces deeply entrenched challenges that cannot solely be addressed by altering union contracts and creating more charter schools. Effective systemic change requires improved teacher training and development, nationally standardized benchmarks for achievement, and additional innovations to close our race and class-based achievement gap.
A key challenge in improving American education is increasing the quality of instruction.
While top-performing education systems like those in Finland, South Korea, and Singapore recruit their teachers from the top third of college graduates, the U.S. draws most teachers from the bottom two-thirds and, moreover, fails to rigorously evaluate teacher performance. A first step to increasing instructional efficacy is establishing an appropriate philosophy of pedagogy.
A pedagogical approach that portrays learners as passive subjects—what education activist Paulo Freire called the “banking” approach to education—contradicts the modern philosophy of education, which seeks to engage students with the world through critical thinking. In his book, “Pedagogy of the Oppressed,” Freire calls the “banking” approach oppressive and dehumanizing; in the modern day, it is also problematic because it fails to teach children the critical thinking skills needed in an innovating economy. In addition to rejecting this antiquated theory of pedagogy, our education system must improve its teacher training, development, and assessment programs. Finland, Korea, and Singapore have standardized, state-run teacher training institutions that recruit top undergraduates and often fund their teacher training.
According to “The Flat World and Education,” teachers in Singapore receive 100 hours per year of government-funded professional development, and they spend 20 hours each week collaborating with other teachers. These types of highly-developed teacher training institutions and government supports for teacher development do not exist in the United States.
The lack of comprehensive national benchmarks defining and regulating student achievement also compromises educational equity. Since the federal government does not dictate holistic national educational standards and curricula, states create their own achievement benchmarks that can vary drastically. In “Waiting for Superman,” one distressing scene portrays this imbroglio with a map showing that school districts receive funding from the national, state, and local levels. This forces districts to navigate a tangle of regulations, and the lack of standardization means school districts receive unequal funding and strive for different educational benchmarks. Additionally, since states define academic proficiency differently, students across the nation can receive very different educations. In Finland, the world’s top-performing education system, national regulations and a universal curriculum guide all teachers in designing standardized lesson plans. This contributes to the nation’s remarkably small achievement gap among schools. In America, states’ disparate standards result in unequal academic achievement across the nation.
“Waiting for Superman” also briefly mentions the problematic practice of tracking, or assigning students to different academic tracks based on determinations of ability that can often be unfair or arbitrary. Among the movie’s five students entering the lottery for charter schools, an eighth-grade girl seeks to enter Summit Prep, which is unique because it does not track students and instead strives to provide all its students with the same education. According to a Summit Prep teacher, the school wants “to hold them all to the same high standard.” Interestingly, Finland abolished tracking in the 1980s, a change that researcher Pasi Sahlberg believes may explain why Finland has the smallest achievement gap of all OECD countries. Perhaps the American education system would also benefit from re-evaluating policies that separate students by ability groups.
It is evident that the American education system faces an array of challenges to improving educational achievement and equity. The work done by the handful of educational leaders who are implementing innovative policies is critical to fixing our system. But relying on the Michelle A. Rhees, the Arne Duncans, and other supermen of education is not enough. America must wholly dedicate itself to reforming academic standards, better preparing teachers, and providing all students with equal educational opportunities. Only then will we see true change.
