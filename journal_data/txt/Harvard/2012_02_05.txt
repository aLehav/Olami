After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a familiar scenario for the Harvard women’s basketball team. With a little over five minutes remaining in the game, the Crimson found its lead cut to only one point and the ball in the hands of Cornell’s fast break.
But Harvard (10-8, 3-1 Ivy) put the past in the past and managed to retake a comfortable lead, pulling out the victory over the Big Red (8-10, 2-2), 67-57, Friday night at Newman Arena in Ithaca, N.Y.
Sophomore Christine Clark had a big night for Harvard, tallying 23 points, six rebounds, and five steals.
For a moment, though, it appeared that this game might end the same way that last week’s matchup versus Yale did—a contest in which the Crimson gave up a late advantage, leading to its first league loss of the season.
So when Cornell’s Stephanie Long hit a shot from beyond the arc to bring the home team within one, 54-53, it is no mystery what was going through the heads of Harvard’s players and coaches.
But this time, thanks to nine points from Clark in the last 4:13, the Crimson went on a 13-4 run and put the Big Red—and its own late-game meltdowns—to bed.
“I think overall, the game was definitely a little shaky for us,” co-captain Brogan Berry said. “It was a little up and down. But we pulled it together towards the very end and proved that we can definitely play in the Ivy League.”
After a back-and-forth first half, which resulted in a tie game at halftime, the beginning of the second half provided more of the same. Harvard jumped out to an 11-point lead at the start of the frame only to have Cornell rebound and cut the lead down to one.
It was Clark who initially stopped the bleeding for the Crimson at this point, going baseline-to-baseline after a steal led to a lay-up. And after a two-minute no-scoring lull, Clark once again increased Harvard’s lead as she shot up a trey of her own.
From then on, it was just a matter of hitting free throws for the Crimson, a team that, before Friday night, shot 76.5 percent from the charity stripe.
First up to the line was Berry after she drew a foul on the Big Red’s Spencer Lane. Berry hit both shots, earning her 11th and 12th points of the game.
Following Berry’s makes, Cornell was unable to score and was once again forced to foul. This time, Clark was sent to the line, and she promptly sank both attempts. Clark was followed by junior Emma Golen, who made Harvard’s sixth and seven consecutive free throws and extended its lead to 12, capping off an 11-0 run for Harvard.
Taylor Flynn and Kristina Danielak hit two straight buckets for the Big Red, but those were its last scratches on the scoreboard. A foul on the other end sent Clark back to the line, and she sealed the game, 67-57.
“We’ve been working a lot on last-second shots and scenarios in practice,” Berry explained. “That has really given us a lot of confidence going into these close games that we know what to do and shows that we’re thinking about how to win the game both mentally and physically.”
Junior Miriam Rutzen agreed with her co-captain, emphasizing the importance of numerous players and their contributions down the stretch.
“I think a lot of different individual players stepped up with big plays,” Rutzen said. “[Berry] really handled the pressure with ball-handling, Clark had some really big shots, and the forwards had a lot of big rebounds, but there wasn’t one specific play. It was just a matter of consistency and making sure we finished our shots and finished our rebounds.”
Along with its timely free throws, the Crimson defense was an integral part of its success down the stretch. In the last five minutes of the game, Harvard held its opponents to only four points, a statistic that goes against the grain of its recent late-game defensive lapses.
“We definitely have turned our focus to defense in the second half of the season,” Berry said. “We know how important defensive stops are and realized that they aren’t important just for defense, but that our offense also springs from our defense. That’s what we focused on late in this game.”
Neither the Crimson nor Cornell shot the ball well from the field, only managing to put up percentages of only 39 and 38, respectively. Despite its woes, Harvard finished off the game shooting 80 percent from the line.
But for the Crimson, it ultimately all came down to some basic fundamentals.
“Defense and rebounding are going to win games for us,” Rutzen explained. “That has been our mentality all year, and we’re just trying to bring that to fruition every game. In [Friday’s game], that took a little longer than preferred, but we ended up playing good defense and pulling away with it—it was definitely a good win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the No. 23 Harvard men’s basketball team clinging to a two-point lead with 2:39 to play, the Crimson relied on its biggest strength yet again: its defense.
With Columbia close to evening the score after trailing throughout the second half, Harvard came up with back-to-back stops down the stretch, helping the Crimson secure a 57-52 win over the Lions Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
Defense was key for Harvard all night, as it held the Lions to 52 points—12 points below their season average and their second lowest offensive output of the season—on 37.5 percent shooting.
Columbia guard Brian Barbour, who entered the game averaging 20.8 points per game in Ivy League play, was limited to 15 points on 4-of-13 shooting.
“Holding a team to 52 points—I would take that every day of the week and twice on Sunday,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose team never trailed throughout the night. “I thought our defense was probably as good as we could expect against a team like that that spreads the floor and tries to dribble-drive against us.”
With the win, Harvard (20-2, 6-0 Ivy) improved its home winning streak to 24 games—the fourth-longest in the country—and is currently off to its best start in program history.
“We’re very pleased to get this win over a team that battled very hard and was very hard for us guard,” Amaker said. “Second night, it wasn’t easy for us; none of these games are going to be.”
The Crimson, a team known for its offensive balance, received very little on Saturday, as three players—co-captain Keith Wright, junior Brandyn Curry, and sophomore Laurent Rivard—combined for 82 percent of the team’s scoring. Rivard led the way, matching a season-high 20 points on 11 shots.
“He has ways that he can score the basketball,” Amaker said. “Certainly his shot sets a lot up for him. We need that.”
Wright and Curry added 15 and 12 points, respectively.
Barbour had 15 points on the night, making him the lone Lions (13-9, 2-4) player to score in double figures.
Harvard’s bench combined for just one point—a free throw from rookie Steve Moundou-Missi—in 37 minutes of play.
“It wasn’t what it has been,” Amaker said of his second unit’s production. “But we talked about that before—there are probably going to be moments where we’re not going to get as much as we like out of some of our guys, being young players. We rode with the veterans as this game went on, and I thought that was the right call and the right decision for us.”
All five Harvard starters saw the court for at least 30 minutes, led by Curry who played 36 minutes.
After leading by three at the half, the Crimson extended its lead to seven with 14:04 to play after junior Kyle Casey, who had five points in the contest, stuck a baseline jumper. But Harvard was never able to gain separation, partially because of its struggles from the free-throw line, where it went 21 of 32 (65.6 percent), its third worst mark of the season. Columbia pulled within three off back-to-back layups from Mark Cisco and Blaise Staab before Harvard extended its lead to eight—its largest of the game—with 6:51 to go.
But the Lions made one last run, as Columbia’s Van Green and Alex Rosenberg knocked down two three-pointers. Rosenberg made it a two-point game moments later, finishing an and-one layup on Casey.
“I think we did well defensively, but they made a lot of tough shots, and we have to give credit to them,” Rivard said.
Wright answered on the other end, finishing a layup off a pass from Curry, and the Crimson’s defense took over from there. Harvard forced a turnover and a missed shot on the Lions’ next two trips up the floor, and co-captain Oliver McNally extended the Crimson’s lead to six with 1:11 to play off a pair of free throws.
Rivard, Curry, and McNally went five for six from the line in the game’s final minute, and Harvard came away with the five-point win, its closest conference matchup of the season thus far.
In the early going, it was Rivard and Curry who helped the Crimson build an early seven-point lead, as Harvard went up 16-9 off a Curry layup with 13:34 to go.
But with the Crimson’s second unit in the game, Harvard’s offense stalled, failing to score over the next 4:38 of play. The Lions capitalized, going on a 7-0 run capped off by a Chris Crockett triple to knot the score at 16.
Wright answered, putting back a Kyle Casey miss and then swatting a Staab layup attempt on the other end. The Crimson recovered the ball, and Wright extended Harvard’s lead to four, scoring a layup on the left block.
Rivard extended the Crimson’s lead to seven moments later—sticking a triple off a Curry drive-and-kick—but the Lions bounced back once again, pulling within three by the end of the frame off a Staab tip in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While a missed field goal kept 14-year NFL veteran Matt Birk '98 out of uniform in Indianapolis this weekend, the two-time All-Pro center managed to end the season on top in a different way.
Birk was just named the NFL's Walter Payton Man of the Year and will be honored at the Super Bowl before the start of the contest.
Traditionally, the award is given to a player who combines superb play on the field with significant community service accomplishments off of it.
Birk, a six time Pro-Bowler, was honored for the work he has done through his H.I.K.E. Foundation, which works to promote education among at-risk children in the Baltimore area.
The H.I.K.E. Foundation, which will earn $20,000 thanks to the award, stands for "Hope. Inspiration. Knowledge. Education.,” and has two programs: "Ready, Set, Read!" and "Read and Rise." While both focus on encouraging literacy, the two take different approaches.
"Ready, Set, Read!" is a program that works with Baltimore-area public schools to encourage children to read at home. The program offers incentives such as Ravens tickets to motivated children, and Birk serves as a spokesperson for the program.
"Read and Rise," meanwhile, focuses on working with families, communities, and schools to encourage reading.
On the field, Birk was just as impressive. While he had trouble stopping the Patriots' Vince Wilfork, Birk was unflappable for most of the season.
Birk and the Baltimore offensive line helped running back Ray Rice finish second in rushing yards among NFL running backs, and as a team, the Ravens were seventh in rushing overall.
Baltimore finished the regular season second in the AFC and nearly took the New England Patriots to overtime in the AFC Championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
February may be the shortest calendar month, but it is not lacking in the big-game department. Here is a look at some of the games that could make or break seasons for squads with big postseason aspirations.
February 6 and February 13: Men’s Ice Hockey in Beanpot tournament
The Beanpot is the pinnacle of collegiate athletic traditions in a town that has been dubbed Sportstown USA. Since 1952, Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern have come together on the first two Monday nights in February to showcase their game on the biggest stage Boston has to offer, TD Garden. The Crimson, which has been crowned champion 10 times in the history of the tournament, will face off against 29-time champion No. 3 Boston University at 5 p.m. on Feb. 6. Win or lose, Harvard will play a second round game on Feb. 13. Can the Crimson keep its six-game point streak alive? Tune in to find out.
Note: The women’s consolation game will take place on Feb. 7 against Boston College at 5 p.m.
February 10 and February 25: Men’s Basketball vs. Penn
This home and home series should prove pivotal in an uncharacteristically strong Ivy League this year. Penn and No. 23 Harvard are the two remaining undefeated teams in the conference, so both games will have major implications. Harvard escaped Penn in overtime last season behind a clutch lay-up from co-captain Oliver McNally and strong overall play from then-sophomore Kyle Casey and co-captain Keith Wright. Don’t look for a similar result this year as the Crimson, a more deep and mature team, has not given up more than 70 points in a single game this season. The backcourt will however have its hands full with Zack Rosen, who leads all Ivy League point guards with 18.8 points per game.
February 11: Women’s Basketball at Princeton
How about a little love for the women’s basketball team? Despite losing key prospect Temi Fagbenle due to a technicality, the Crimson currently sits at 4-1 in Ivy play. The only conference blemish so far is a loss to Yale at home after surrendering a 10-point halftime lead. The Crimson will likely go into the match against undefeated Princeton on a four-game winning streak (depending on Friday night’s game with Penn). The matchup to watch is junior forward Emma Golen and Princeton’s Niveen Rasheed, who leads the Tigers with 16.7 points per game and 172 total rebounds. Plus, it’s a rivalry game, so watch out!
February 12: Men’s and Women’s Squash at Yale
In a large part of the country, it is unheard of to have a set of squash matches at the top of anybody’s must-see list. But here in Cambridge, we do things a little differently.
With its victory over Trinity, then-No. 2 Yale snapped a 252-match winning streak that was unparalleled in the history of intercollegiate athletics. And although the Bulldogs recently dropped a match to No. 3 Princeton, Harvard still has a daunting task ahead of it in a league showing more parity than ever before. This match should be fun for all involved.
On the women's side, the roles are reversed. The No. 1  Crimson has dropped just 11 individual matches on the way to a perfect season so far, and undefeated, second-ranked Yale will have to settle for the slight underdog role. But let's not forget that the Bulldogs squashed Harvard's dreams of a second straight national championship at the end of last season. One thing's for sure: this contest is sure to be a dogfight.
February 18: Men’s Basketball v. Yale 
This game was supposed to be the headliner last month as well when Harvard came into a hostile Payne Whitney Gymnasium. But the battle turned into the biggest blow to Yale’s spirits since Harvard destroyed Yale, 45-7, in The Game (honorable mention to women’s hockey, which also beat up on the Bulldogs by a score of 8-0 on the same night as the basketball game). But hey, you never know. Yale’s big men, Greg Mangano and Jeremiah Kreisberg, could show up like they were supposed to the first time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On one magical night at Madison Square Garden, Jeremy Lin ’10 finally got his chance.
And under the world’s brightest lights, going head-to-head with one of the best point guards in the world, the former Harvard standout shined.
With his team desperately in need of a win, it was Lin who delivered, recording a career-high 25 points, seven assists, and five rebounds in 36 minutes while playing lockdown defense on Nets star Deron Williams.
“This night just really hasn’t sunk in yet,” Lin said in his post-game press conference, where he was reportedly mobbed by 30 media members. “I’m still kind of in shock about everything that happened, but I’m just trying to soak it all in right now.”
Coming into the contest, the Knicks had lost 11 of their last 13, and when the home team fell behind by 12 in the first quarter, the Garden faithful had already broken into chants of “Fire D’Antoni,” referring to the Knicks embattled coach.
In came Lin, and by the end of the night, the home fans were still chanting—but this time, they were cries of “Je-re-my! Je-re-my!” for the second-year guard.
“He picked us up offensively; he played great defensively. We fed off his energy tonight down the stretch,” Carmelo Anthony told reporters after the game. “We put the ball in his hands, and he won the game for us.”
Anthony is normally the Knicks go-to guy, but on one Saturday, at least, it was Lin who stole the show.
He entered the game with 3:34 to go in the first quarter, and—other than a brief rest at the start of the third—did not return to the bench.
Lin began filling up the stat line in the second period. With the Knicks still down 12, the point guard hit a layup, had a steal, and found Toney Douglas with a lead pass in transition to begin bringing his team back.
“I just want to be able to make plays,” said Lin, who was in the D-League just two weeks ago. “You just go with what the defense gives you, and you see what happens.”
That was what Lin continued to do all night long. With 2:46 remaining in the half, the point guard broke down the defense for another layup and then fed Tyson Chandler an alley-oop to tie the game at 46.
“It was unbelievable what he was able to come in and bring,” Chandler said after the contest. “He brought that spark off the bench, and that’s really what we’ve been needing.”
Lin struggled with his shot for most of the third, but the crowd stayed behind him. With three seconds to go in the period, he finished an and-one to bring the Knicks with in two.
“The biggest thing is that he has a point guard’s mentality,” said D’Antoni, who noted that Lin would be seeing a lot more playing time in the future. “He has a rhyme or reason to what he’s doing. He gives us a good feel. And you can play off that.”
In the fourth quarter—on a team with two of the league’s top-five scorers last season—it was Lin who took over.
The point guard gave the Knicks the lead with a jumper over Williams early in the fourth, and put the Knicks up four on a pretty reverse layup later in the period.
With 2:02 to go, Lin split two defenders and got to the rim again, capping another and-one with two fist pumps and a bow from Anthony. He scored his 12th point of the quarter moments later as the arena roared with excitement.
“I didn’t do a good job containing Jeremy Lin,” said Williams, an all-star in each of the past two seasons. “Our game plan was to help off him, and he just started knocking down shots and got confidence, and he was relentless taking it to the basket.”
At the game’s conclusion, the Harvard grad could not contain his smile as he was mobbed at center court by his teammates, who looked almost as happy as Lin did.
The point guard could not have chosen a better time to break out, as time had been running out on his chances with the Knicks. Lin’s contract will not become guaranteed until Feb. 10, meaning he was in serious jeopardy of being cut before that date—until now.
“I’m just thankful to God for everything,” Lin explained. “Like the Bible says, ‘God works everything for the good of those who love Him,’ so I’m just thankful I’m able to be here with this team.”
The opportunity to have a night like that was a long time coming for the point guard.
After receiving no Division I scholarship offers coming out of college, going undrafted and receiving just one summer league offer after his four years at Harvard, and then being waived by two NBA teams, Lin has been fighting his whole career just to prove he belongs.
After playing sparingly—mostly in garbage time during blowouts—for the Knicks since he signed with them before the season began, Lin finally got his opportunity thanks to the struggles of the point guards initially ahead of him on the Knicks depth chart.
He moved his way ahead of Mike Bibby first, and after recording nine points and six assists in 20 minutes against the Rockets one week ago, jumped past the struggling Douglas as well.
With his job potentially on the line and the Knicks postseason aspirations in early jeopardy, D’Antoni turned to Lin.
Two hours later, the point guard was the talk of the country, a trending topic in the Twitterverse on the eve of the Super Bowl as Pearl Jam's “Jeremy” was blasted throughout the world's most famous arena. Lin's face was on the front page of the website of the worldwide leader in sports and plastered on the back page of the morning newspapers.
He had become a hero in the city that never sleeps, the place where “if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.”
On one spectacular night, at least, Jeremy Lin finally made it.

Even at a school where students watch live TV about as often as they might do reading that's marked as "optional" on a syllabus, the Super Bowl is a big event.
In a regular year, the campus seems to take a break from its general Sunday-night routine of homework and brain break to watch America's most popular television program—even if it's just for the commercials.
But expect Super Bowl XLVI to draw more interest than usual. Tonight, the New York Giants take on the New England Patriots in a rematch of the 2008 Super Bowl, when the Giants upset the Pats and handed them their only loss of the year.
Consider the fact that Boston is a sports-crazed city, the New York-Boston rivalry is among the best in sports, and seemingly half of the Harvard campus is from either Massachusetts or the Big Apple, and you're looking a showdown on the field, in the bars of the Square, on the streets, and in your JCRs.
Just as it was in 2008, this matchup shouldn't be close. The Patriots finished the regular season with a 13-3 record, earned a first-round bye, and defeated the seemingly-invincible Tim Tebow to make it to the Super Bowl. They may have gotten a little help from the Ravens kicker in the AFC Championship Game, but hey, it still counts.
The Giants? The Big Blue finished 9-7 during the regular season, which isn't even good enough to make the playoffs some years. But the Giants already beat New England on Nov. 6 and stunned the football world by taking down Green Bay on the Packers' home turf to earn a trip to Indy.
Many of the players weren't around for the last Pats-Giants Super Bowl face-off, but both of the quarterbacks were.
Tom Brady, one of the league's best passers and the heartthrob of ladies throughout New England, has already led the Patriots to three Super Bowl titles during what will be a Hall of Fame career.
Eli Manning, the little brother of Colts quarterback Payton, may not be the player that Brady is, but his resume speaks for itself. With a Super Bowl MVP award under his belt, Manning has, for the second time, led his team to the Super Bowl. But this time, he goes into the game as more than Payton's kid brother.
Flyby's prediction: Patriots 35, Giants 24.
 But who knows? The last time these two teams met up, the Giants pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history. We'll see if the Manning magic lasts.
E. Benjamin Samuels is the president of The Harvard Crimson. He might want you to be aware that links to photos of Tom Brady were added by the editor of this piece, and he has in no way consented to their appearance here.
