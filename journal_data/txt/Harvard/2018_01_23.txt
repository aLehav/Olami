After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was in elementary school, teachers would write home saying I was a bright kid but had trouble staying in my seat. My eyes would glaze over during tasks. I had a “lack of control.” My classmates would laugh when I raised my hand to ask a question the teacher had answered a sentence ago, and while I pretended to think it was funny too—all part of a joke—I would secretly wonder why I couldn’t just “get” it like my peers did. I didn’t understand why I was different.
Over time, I grew too embarrassed to ask questions, and my grades suffered. When my parents decided to get me professionally tested, the result confirmed their suspicions: I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The psychiatrist recommended I take stimulant medication, but, like many parents, mine were initially hesitant to accept this option. Every headline they had seen circulating about how Adderall is over-prescribed and potentially harmful for developing brains was likely on their minds, causing doubt. It’s hard to make the choice to spend hundreds of dollars on a treatment accused of causing meth addiction, among other things. However, the psychiatrist was able to assuage these fears and convince my parents of the treatment’s safety, and they eventually accepted a prescription for Adderall.
Taking that one little pill in the mornings had an immediate effect. Suddenly, I could concentrate for longer and remember what had been said more than two minutes prior. Periods of clarity, before a luxury, became common. I stopped interrupting people and started listening more, and the jokes about my memory gradually died out. It was like I had been struggling to breathe my whole life, and Adderall handed me an oxygen mask.
This story isn’t new, and I’m not the first one to tell it. Stimulant therapy’s efficacy in treating the 6.4 million children who suffer from ADHD nationwide is well-documented. Still, it remains a highly controversial treatment, rejected by many in the field. Some claim that ADHD simply doesn’t exist, that it’s just an excuse for undisciplined kids to act out. Others who acknowledge the existence of ADHD argue against using stimulants to treat it because they say the drugs do more harm than good for developing brains. They fret about medications being over-prescribed and taken advantage of by those just trying to get ahead in school, and they feel that ADHD can be treated with more parental attention—“dangerous” psychoactive substances need not enter the picture.
Here are the facts. Research has shown no long-term negative effects of prescription stimulants on the developing brain. Children treated with stimulants are 1.9 times less likely than their non-medicated counterparts to develop substance use disorders later in life and exhibit lower levels of physical aggression. Most importantly, stimulants are also extremely effective at treating the inattention, lack of focus, and impulsivity that are the hallmarks of ADHD.
To those who say that medications are unnecessary, and that children are better off without them, consider this: one out of every two kids with ADHD will face widespread peer rejection. One in three individuals with ADHD will develop depression, and almost one in two will develop anxiety. We are 2.5 times more likely to develop a substance use disorder and a whopping seven times more likely to attempt suicide. This is not just a different way of thinking. It is a treatable mental illness.
Stigmatization of prescription stimulants may be based on myths, but it has very real consequences for the millions who suffer from the disease. Passage of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 put stimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin in the Schedule II category. As a result, patients have to bring a new prescription to the pharmacy every 30 days. This is burdensome for those living far away from their psychiatrist, who often have to wait several unmedicated days for the prescription to arrive in the mail.
Unsurprisingly, the effects of this stigma weigh much more heavily on those from lower-income backgrounds. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars are needed to get a professional diagnosis of ADHD, and many health insurance plans won’t cover the price of stimulant therapy. As a result, many people with ADHD cannot access affordable treatment—they cope by themselves.
We need to focus on addressing these issues and not on stigmatizing the children who rely on stimulants to function and the parents who buy their prescriptions. We need to stop supporting costly, unnecessary restrictions that prevent millions from accessing treatment for this debilitating illness. We need to end the pointless controversy over medicating children and start shifting the conversation to how we can improve the solutions. Until we do, millions of people like me will have to continue to endure ADHD, but unlike me, they will not have a way out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hey! Are you interested in joining  Harvard College Faith and Action?”
The voice is so eager and enthusiastic that I'm almost guilted into taking the proffered flyer before I remember—no, I’m not actually interested in joining. Right. Cheeks flushed, I avert my eyes and mutter an apology as I skirt by my well-intentioned assailant into the warm asylum of Annenberg. A frown tugs at my face as I wonder if I hurt her feelings, and then I'm caught up in the chaotic rush of card swipes and she disappears into a dusty corner of my memory.
Until the next day or two, when I find myself in a very similar situation. If not Harvard College Faith and Action, it's an a capella concert, vegetarian society, improv show, or even “glow party” (whatever that means). The plethora of these offerings is indicative of just how much is happening on campus.
When my day carries me out of the Yard and into the Square, however, I find myself being approached for a much more serious reason. I see people surrounded by their possessions, clustered on benches, seated outside the T—so ubiquitous that they seem almost as much a part of Harvard as the red brick. And they see me, too. With words, cardboard signs, and tired, knowing eyes, they ask me for cash, food, and change.
I feel the same twinge in my heart at every one of these requests, but I rarely honor any of them. After walking by a homeless person, I'm lost in thought, compelled to help but not knowing how to do so effectively. But again, inevitably, I'm distracted by the next leg of my day and the moment fades from my mind.
On a certain level, these two situations could not be more disparate. One is publicizing a fun event or student group; the other is seeking the means to meet basic necessities. One asks you to take; the other asks you to give. But both offer an important reminder of how privileged we are as Harvard students. And I've struggled to know what to do in either case.
Sometimes, when I know I don't want to involve myself, I feel the urge to simply withdraw. But there are few things worse than being ignored, and I don't want to inflict that feeling on anyone. I worry that too much eye contact will send the wrong message and not enough will be considered cold.
Where does that leave me? Lately, I've been working to simply acknowledge the value of the other person’s presence. If it’s someone handing out a flyer, I can take a moment to say “No, thanks” instead of just pretending they're invisible. If it's someone asking for change, I can give them a word of support rather than a dollar.
But as meaningful as words are, they don't solve the larger problems at hand. If I don't pay attention to a publicizer outside Annenberg, the worst I do is momentarily offend a peer. If I don't pay attention to a homeless person on the street, I'm guilty of reinforcing a culture that turns a blind eye to those in need. The more grave of these two offenses is undoubtedly the latter.
For that reason, I'm looking into volunteering opportunities at the youth homeless shelter Y2Y and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. But there's only so much that I can do as a single student. Helping Cambridge’s hundreds of homeless individuals get back on their feet will require time and money far beyond what I can provide.
A previous Crimson staff editorial suggested that this is where institutions with massive reserves of resources and manpower, such as Harvard, should come in. I believe it is immoral for Harvard not to redirect some of its considerable wealth towards the homeless if doing so would not detract from the school’s immediate well-being. In fact, by both supplementing student efforts at Y2Y and HSHS and addressing one of the root causes of homelessness, Harvard could augment its own integrity and productivity with thoughtful donations to those in need.
After all, if Harvard has the money to put on event after event, surely it can spare some of those funds to help the homeless. There is certainly value in the extensive programming available to Harvard students, but I would be happy to give up a few concerts and parties if I knew that more people were being helped. If we seek to realize real change, we must fight our inclinations to forget and disengage. Some solutions will be more easily implemented than others, but none at all will present themselves unless we stop ignoring the problem. If we all gave a little more and took a little less, there just might be more to go around.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 23, 2018 at 10:20 p.m.
The National Labor Relations Board recently dismissed Harvard’s appeal of its original decision to hold a second vote on the question of if eligible students should be able to unionize through the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers. As a result, a re-vote will be held, and both sides of the debate are gearing up for yet another campaign.
We understand that the revote will require additional resources from the University. Nevertheless, we believe that the expenditure of Harvard's resources is the only way to ensure a fair election that is free of suspicion. Given that Harvard appealed the NLRB’s original decision to hold a second vote, it would behoove the University to avoid any semblance of impropriety by putting the maximum effort possible into the new election. Additionally, Harvard’s non-compliance with voter list requirements in the original unionization vote heighten the need for a well-funded election process.
Simultaneously, by spending a large amount of resources on the debate preceding the vote, Harvard can make the discussion surrounding student unionization clearer and more substantive. As it stands, student unionization can be a polarizing issue. This severely affects conversations on unionization and can turn them into charged debates which lack a focus on substance. Unfortunately, this sort of discourse leaves little room for clear or open debate.
We thus believe that University resources should also contribute to ameliorating the  conversation surrounding student unionization. Indeed, those overseeing the election should do everything in their power to facilitate a free yet clear exchange of ideas between those in favor and against unionization, perhaps by holding a public debate or through other measures.
As we have previously opined, unionization will not solve all the problems eligible students currently face, but it will have a large impact on their lives should it pass. Regardless of how the University chooses to act concerning the election, graduate students and eligible undergraduates therefore should carefully weigh the arguments for each option.
Some believe that the positions that are eligible for unionization—such as teaching fellows and research assistants—should not be considered jobs or working positions, but rather integral parts of academic scholarship. Others state that they are being unfairly treated by the University with respect to their work and their compensation for it. They also feel that the limited number of studies that exist on the subject, such as one from Cornell University, point in favor of the argument that graduate student employees who are unionized report higher earnings and more professional support.
The merits of the issue aside, if students do not know whether they are eligible to vote, the most important thing they can do is find out. Furthermore, if they are eligible, we urge them to educate themselves and then exercise their right to vote, no matter which side they support. Democratic institutions are powerless if people do not engage with them. And when it comes time for eligible students to vote, we hope that the election will be the final one on the matter.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Jan. 23, 2018
The editorial was updated to reflect the fact that Harvard has not publicly voiced concerns about the cost of the unionization revote.

Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Boston Children’s Hospital will receive a $100 million donation from Boston-area philanthropists Robert Hale Jr. and Karen Hale, the Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals announced Monday.
The $100 million gift will be split between the two hospitals, with each receiving $50 million from the couple. The funds will support the hospitals in their current  research, expansion efforts, and patient care.
“Their gift will help us deliver even more of the best care for so many families, from the most complex and fragile children from around the world to the most essential primary and preventive care in our community, close to home,” Sandra L. Fenwick, president of Boston Children’s Hospital said in the press release.
In response to the donation, both hospitals plan to name buildings after the Hale family. Brigham and Women’s will name their newest building, finished last year, the Hale Building for Transformative Medicine.
Boston Children’s Hospital gained approval in 2016 for an 11-story, $1 billion building that will feature a neonatal intensive care unit and heart center. When it is finished in 2021, it will also be named for the donors.
Robert Hale Jr. is CEO of Granite Telecommunications, a Massachusetts-based company that provides internet, data, and other telecommunications services to businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Hale and his company have previously donated to Connecticut College, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and several other New England charities.
Both of the Hales have had ties to the hospitals for years. Karen Hale sits on the Cancer Research and Care advisory board at Brigham and Women’s. Both serve on the Trust Board of Boston Children’s and have chaired fundraising campaigns at Brigham and Women’s.
The Hales’ donation comes after a year of financial difficulty for Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The hospital bought out 1,600 employee contracts last year in an effort to reduce mounting labor expenditures.
Around the same time, proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health placed financial pressure on the hospital, which is among the top recipients of federal funding. University President Drew G. Faust lobbied Congress in October to maintain NIH funding for Harvard research facilities.

Broad Institute President and possible Harvard presidential candidate Eric S. Lander twice said he remains devoted to his posts at MIT and the Broad Institute in the past two days—but he  did not directly deny involvement in the University’s presidential search.
Since the summer, a presidential search committee—comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—has been seeking a successor to University President Drew G. Faust, who plans to step down in June 2018. The Crimson reported in December that the committee had narrowed the number of candidates under consideration to fewer than 20 names.
Last month, Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said he thinks Lander is “almost certainly on that shortlist.” But in recent emails to The Crimson and the Tech, MIT’s student newspaper, Lander said he is passionate about his current job.
“While I’m flattered by Dean Daley’s comments to The Crimson, I love my job running the Broad Institute and have a lot more I plan to do in this role,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson Monday. “It’s an amazing time in biomedicine, and I get to work alongside the best scientists in the world here in the Boston area.”
Lander was slightly more blunt in an email sent to the Tech Sunday. He said he was “surprised” by Daley’s suggestion he might be a contender for the University’s top job.
“I was surprised to learn that speculation by someone who said they had no knowledge of the process was even being reported,” Lander wrote in an emailed statement to the Tech. “For my part, I fully expect to be teaching 7.012 at MIT next fall and continuing to be doing science!”
Lander did not directly answer a question Monday asking whether he is involved in Harvard’s search process.
Lander’s public comments seem to match denials given by candidates in previous searches. Past contenders have often refused to comment on the search or have insisted they are focused on their current posts—maneuvers designed to leave wiggle room should the search committee indicate interest down the line.
In Harvard’s last presidential search in 2007, a spokesperson for then-candidate Elena Kagan said Kagan was “focused like a laser beam on being dean of the Law School.” In that search, Kagan made it to final-round interviews. Other candidates—including the presidents of Brown and Princeton—insisted they would never leave what they called “the best job” in higher education.
The committee in the last search did not take candidates’ public denials into account, The Crimson reported in Jan. 2007.
Lander, 59, led the successful completion of the Human Genome Project in the 1990s as the head of Whitehead Institute. He also served on the Council of Advisors on Science and Technology under President Barack Obama.
This is not the first time Lander’s name has come up as a contender for the Harvard presidency. The Crimson previously reported the geneticist made the 2007 search committee’s shortlist in Harvard’s search for its 28th president.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Pardis C. Sabeti, who has known Lander for years, wrote in an email last week that she thinks Lander is a “visionary” who has “helped nurture the careers of countless individuals.”
Asked about Lander’s possible candidacy, Sabeti wrote she thinks the geneticist would make a lasting mark at the University.
“He is also one of those rare human beings that excels and deeply understands a large variety of fields,” Sabeti wrote. “He could make a profound and lasting impact at Harvard University.”

UPDATED: January 25, 2018 at 4:07 p.m.
Nan Goldin, a photographer who has several works housed in Harvard’s art collection, recently called on the Harvard Art Museums to refuse donations from the Sackler family in light of their stake in Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid OxyContin.
The Sackler family funded the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, which forms part of the Harvard Art Museums.  First opened in 1985, the Sackler Museum houses Harvard’s collection of Asian, Islamic, and Mediterranean art.
The Sackler family name has come under increased scrutiny in recent years due to the national opioid crisis. Though family members directly descended from Arthur Sackler do not hold shares in Purdue Pharma, descendants of his brothers have occupied positions on the company’s board.
Goldin, who is undergoing treatment for addiction to OxyContin, sparked a campaign on Twitter using the hashtag #ShameOnSackler in an attempt to encourage Harvard and other institutions to disown the family.
Goldin’s advocacy group, called Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, or P.A.I.N, is calling on art museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum to refuse donations from the Sackler family. They are also asking the Sacklers to fund initiatives aimed at combating opioid-related deaths.
“When I got out of treatment I became absorbed in reports of addicts dropping dead from my drug, OxyContin. I learned that the Sackler family, whose name I knew from museums and galleries, were responsible for the epidemic,” Goldin wrote in an online petition encouraging museums to disown the Sacklers.
“This family formulated, marketed, and distributed OxyContin. I have decided to make the private public by calling them to task,” she wrote.
In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control found that overdose deaths from prescription opioids like OxyContin have quadrupled since 1999. From 2000 to 2015, drug overdoses killed more than half a million Americans.
In a statement to the Boston Globe, Elizabeth A. Sackler, the president of the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation, said she admired Goldin and sought to distance herself and her immediate family from Purdue Pharma.
“The opioid epidemic is a national crisis and Purdue Pharma’s role in it is morally abhorrent to me. I admire Nan Goldin’s commitment to take action and her courage to tell her story,” Sackler said. “None of his descendants have ever owned a share of Purdue stock nor benefitted in any way from it or the sale of Oxycontin. I stand with all angry voices against abuse of power that harms or compromises any and all lives.”
And in a statement to The Crimson, a Sackler Foundation spokesperson noted that Arthur M. Sackler passed away eight years before OxyContin came into existence.
"His brothers, Mortimer and Raymond, purchased his one-third option in Purdue Frederick from his estate a few months after his death," the spokesperson wrote. "Oxycontin was never a part of Dr. Sackler's body of work or his estate. None of his descendants have had any involvement with, nor ownership of, Purdue Pharma or benefitted from the sale of Oxycontin."
Purdue Pharma also provided a statement to the Globe affirming the company’s commitment to addressing the opioid epidemic.
“We are deeply troubled by the prescription and illicit opioid abuse crisis, and we would welcome an opportunity to sit down with Ms. Goldin to discuss her ideas,” Purdue Pharma said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 voiced optimism for their upcoming year in office in an interview Sunday, reaffirming their focus on issues highlighted in their campaign, including gender-neutral bathrooms, mental health initiatives, and sexual assault prevention.
“We’re so excited about this year because we have so many things that we want to do,” Zhang said.
In their campaign, Zhang and Boucher pledged to work with administrators to expand gender-inclusive housing and gender-neutral bathrooms, and offer the UC as a resource center for sexual assault, mental health, financial, and religious concerns. The duo also said they wanted to represent student voices on controversial campus issues.
More than a month after the Harvard Corporation voted to formally adopt the penalties on single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, Boucher said he and Zhang are heavily involved in shaping the implementation of the policy, which prevents members of single-gender social groups from serving as captains of varsity athletic teams, holding campus leadership roles, or receiving College endorsements for certain fellowships.
The two said they have met with multiple Office of Student Life administrators, including Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, and said they are attempting to convey student feedback they received during their campaign.
“Right now we have this directive that comes from the top of what the policy will look like from a high level,” Boucher said.  “What we don’t have is what it’s going to look like in terms of the specific procedure, the specific logistics of how information will be passed.”
Zhang and Boucher also expressed their “unconditional” support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and its approximately 800,000 recipients whose temporary legal protections were revoked by President Donald Trump in September. Last week, University President Drew G. Faust sent a letter to Congressional leaders asking for “immediate attention” to secure protections for DACA recipients, several dozen of whom are Harvard students. Lawmakers have yet to reach an agreement on DACA.
The new UC leaders met with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana late last semester to discuss their campaign proposals and how they intend to follow through on them.
“I think one thing we tried to make clear is that we have a lot we’re going to do this year,” Boucher said. “And I think to administrators at first, it comes off as, ‘You have a lot you want to do this year’ and I think we want to make sure that the message is ‘We have a lot we’re going to do this year.’”
According to Zhang and Boucher, the UC will roll out its new website in the coming weeks. Among other features, the updated site will allow students to track the progress of the duo’s 39 campaign proposals, as part of a push by the Council to increase transparency.
The UC will convene for its first general meeting of the year this Sunday.

The College will not debut its long-awaited new system of General Education requirements until fall 2019, a full year later than expected, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Monday.
The roll-out will be the culmination of over three years of scrutiny of the College’s distribution requirements, which were deemed to be “failing on a variety of fronts” in May 2015.
In an email to the College, Khurana wrote that “the extra year will allow the revitalized Program in General Education to launch with a larger number and broader range of exciting new courses.”
The College has been working to restructure General Education requirements since a committee of professors reviewed the program and published an unfavorable report in 2015. Following the report, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to form a committee, headed by Philosophy Department Chair Edward J. Hall, to review and “recommend” changes to the program.
In March 2016, the Faculty voted to approve a new system, overhauling the General Education requirements.
Under the new program, instead of taking one class in each of eight categories, students must take one class in each of four categories: Aesthetics & Culture; Histories, Societies, Individuals; Science & Technology in Society; and Ethics & Civics.  In addition, students must take three departmental requirements in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Sciences/SEAS, and an additional course that “demonstrates quantitative facility.”
The last requirement is yet to be finalized. Last spring, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who will step down at the end of this academic year, introduced a plan for the requirement, now named “Thinking with Data.” Courses would be either shaped from pre-existing Statistics department classes or created from scratch.
The proposal met with resistance from some faculty members, including math and social sciences professors. The Faculty has not yet approved a version of the requirement, and, in an interview last month, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said he did not think it necessary to debut this requirement at the same time as the rest of the General Education changes.
While the new General Education requirements are in flux—now for another year—students graduating before fall 2019 are able to choose to graduate under either the old or new General Education programs. In the past, this has caused a mix of confusion and relief for juniors and seniors.
In his email, Khurana said the choice will remain for juniors and seniors. He directed students to the Program in General Education’s website, which offers advice for students in each class year.
Individual staff members in the Program in General Education could not be reached for comment Monday. In an emailed statement signed only “Program in General Education,” they declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Light showers and heavy crowds descended on Harvard’s campus Monday morning,as students in the College flocked to classes on the first day of the semester.
Classes were packed across disciplines, with students clamoring for seats in courses like the perennially popular Economics 10B: “Principles of Economics” and the newer Theater, Dance, and Media 110: “Foundations in Acting: Viewpoints.”
Several students said they had to leave large lecture halls due to a lack of space.
“There was like a huge line out the door, you couldn’t even get through,” said Deedee R. Jiang ’20, a Crimson Design Editor who had wanted to attend Societies of the World 38: “Pyramid Schemes: The Archaeological History of Ancient Egypt” in Science Center Hall D. “We just didn’t push to get to the front, so we got screwed over.”
Students said that classes as varied as Computer Science 181: “Machine Learning,” Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science,” Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 130: “Biology of Fishes,” and Philosophy 20: “Happiness” faced similar problems with crowding.
Some professors did more than present the syllabus on the first day of class. Astronomy Department Chair Avi Loeb took the students in his freshman seminar, Freshman Seminar 21G: “First Stars and Life in the Cosmos,” to see the Great Refractor—the largest telescope in North America when it was built in 1847—in the Harvard College Observatory.
Preceptor in Scandinavian Agnes Broomé surprised her students in Swedish AB: “Beginning Swedish Language and Literature” by bringing in her dog.
“At the end, she brought in a puppy, a German Shepherd puppy. It was absolutely adorable,” Nichlas G. Vranos ’20, who attended Broomé’s class, said. “It was really nice and a good way to start my week.”
Students do not finalize their course roster for the semester until Friday, allowing them to casually survey classes before committing.
Raj Karan S. Gambhir ’21, a Crimson arts editor, wrote in an email that after sitting in on a certain class at last year’s Visitas program—the College’s welcome weekend for admitted students—he had been eagerly looking forward to taking it in the spring.
“Finally, the lecture starts, and I begin to realize that this class is not for me. I made the mistake that many make when entering a relationship—I jumped the gun,” Gambhir wrote. “Meanwhile, my once skeptical friend is as fervently in love with the course as I was just minutes prior. I’m glad we have shopping week. It gives us time to fall out of love with the wrong courses, and fall in love with the right ones.”
For others, such as Brandon N. Wachs ’18, the first day of classes was a more casual affair.
“We figured since it’s our last first day of school as seniors, we woke up early and intended to go to class. But then we had also planned to drink in the morning, and that just continued to a morning-long drinking session while looking at classes on the Q Guide,” Wachs said, referring to the online course catalogue. “But then around noon, people did decide to start going to classes.”
“It was a good bonding experience to kick off the last semester we have here,” Wachs added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allstonians raised concerns that Harvard’s plans for their neighborhood privilege automobile over pedestrian transport during a meeting Monday with University representatives.
Harvard filed plans for the neighborhood—a 14-acre portion of the University’s larger holdings in Allston—on Dec. 7. The filing remains under review with the Boston Planning and Development Agency, the city’s urban planning body.
The BPDA recently extended the public comment period for the plan to Feb. 2, ensuring Allston residents can give feedback on the document. One form of feedback came Monday night at a meeting of the Impact Advisory Group, a body of Allston residents meant to help guide Harvard’s vision for the 14-acre plot. The group meets weekly to discuss the possible environmental and social effects of the University’s construction plans.
On Monday, the group met specifically to address issues surrounding mobility and streets in Allston. Harvard representative Joe G. Beggan detailed the University’s proposed transportation plans at the meeting.
Harvard plans to include 400,000 square feet of offices and labs, 250,000 square feet of hotel and conference center space, 250,000 square feet of residential space, nearly 900 parking spaces, and around 600 new bicycle parking spaces in the 14-acre portion, according to its filings with the BPDA. The segment forms part of a larger 36-acre plot, dubbed the “Enterprise Research Campus,” on which Harvard proposed a center for entrepreneurship in Allston.
Beggan spoke in part about plans to construct new streets called Stadium Road and Cattle Drive. The new roads will better connect North Harvard Street to Harvard Square; the former road will include one bus and shuttle-only lane as well as a two-way bicycle path, Beggan said.
Beggan also discussed expanding public and Harvard-specific transit to serve a greater portion of the Cambridge and Allston population. He particularly noted that the Harvard shuttle currently servicing Barry’s Corner, a 9.3-acre slice of Allston at the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue, will eventually be extended to reach the enterprise research campus.
But some impact advisory group members said they were concerned by the plan Monday. Attendees criticized what they called Harvard’s undue prioritization of automobile transport.
“If you drew a circle [on the map of the plans] with the end of my pen, I count seven, eight parking lots. And if you were to do a land area comparison, just by eye, it’s looking like 65-35 parking lots to buildings—too many parking lots,” attendee Tim McHale said.
“When I look at this, I see vehicular traffic being hugely privileged over pedestrian traffic,” fellow attendee Max Rome said. “To bring 1,700 new people in and out every single day in a neighborhood that has absolutely no real transit connection—that seems like tons of people are going to be coming out of the Pike, and we all know how much of a hellhole that is.”
Some members also said they wanted to see more “direct and visible” Massachusetts Department of Transportation and Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority participation in Harvard’s broad Allston planning process.
Allstonian and attendee Anthony P. D’Isidoro said he particularly wished MassDOT and the MBTA would give greater input on Harvard’s vision for its enterprise research campus.
“For some reason, I get a feeling that there is a huge leap of faith here,” D’Isidoro said. “It’s like, ‘Community, we’re going to get going with this,’ and now we’re saying, ‘No, we’re doing a little something now, but down the road, it’ll get a lot better, and we’re just going to swallow this for the next ten years or so.’”
In response to attendees’ concerns, BPDA senior project manager Gerald Autler—who attended the meeting—said he will ask a representative from one of the two state agencies to come to a future impact advisory group session. In addition to Autler, Beggan and other Harvard representatives also fielded questions and addressed residents’ worries throughout the meeting.
In upcoming weeks, the impact advisory group plans to discuss issues related to sewage water, traffic, pollution, retail opportunities for small businesses, and urban design, according to members.
Autler said he hopes Allston residents do not see the approaching end of the comment period as the “end of any conversation.”
“I’m happy to schedule as many meetings as are necessary,” Autler said. “Whenever this approval happens, we’re not going to have resolved every issue that’s been brought up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 24, 2018 at 2:07 a.m.
Five Harvard Baseball alumni who are now top Major League Baseball executives discussed their careers and the baseball industry at a question-and-answer event hosted at the Harvard Club of Boston on Monday evening.
The panelists included Michael L. Hill ’93, David L. Forst ’98, Peter N. Woodfork ’99, Jeff T. Bridich ’00, and W. Ben Crockett ’02—all of whom had donned Crimson uniforms on the diamond years ago.
Hill is the current president of baseball operations for the Miami Marlins, Forst is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, Bridich is the senior vice president and general manager of the Colorado Rockies, and Crockett is the vice president of Player Development for the Boston Red Sox. Woodfork is the senior vice president of baseball operations for Major League Baseball.
The event was moderated by Jon Paul Morosi ’04, a former Crimson sports editor who currently reports for MLB.com and the MLB Network. The panelists also fielded questions from the audience afterwards.
During the event, which was co-sponsored by Friends of Harvard Baseball and the Harvard Varsity Club, the panelists frequently brought up the impact of their experiences at Harvard in shaping their baseball careers.
“It ultimately started here,” Forst said. “We all got an opportunity to get where we are because we were able to play [for Harvard baseball]…It’s hard to overstate what this program has meant to us.”
Hill echoed Forst’s remarks, emphasizing defining moments, both on and off the field, during his time at Harvard.
“As a freshman, I got the opportunity to play left field [in the Beanpot],” Hill said. “I’m an 18-year-old kid and I’m playing left field at Fenway Park, and I’m like, ‘you gotta be kidding me.’”
The panelists also talked about transitioning from Harvard to the professional baseball scene, ascending to their front-office roles, and the challenge of cutting professional players. Woodfork spoke about steps by the MLB to improve diversity in baseball.
When discussing major league trades, the panelists emphasized that trust plays a large role in teams’ interactions with each other.
“There has to be a give-and-take. When you’re dealing with one of your colleagues, there has to be a foundation there,” Bridich said. “It is one of the more enjoyable parts of what we do, getting to talk to 29 other clubs.”
Towards the end of the event, audience members asked questions on team chemistry, advice to college students entering the MLB, and tanking in sports.
Attendees of the event included the current Harvard baseball team, Head Coach Bill K. Decker, and Harvard Corporation member Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67.  O’Donnell and Decker gave closing remarks, ending the event by gifting the six guests with Harvard baseball apparel.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: January 24, 2017
A previous version of this article indicated that the baseball panel was hosted by the Harvard Club of Boston. To clarify, the baseball panel was hosted at the Harvard Club of Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Escaping the Boston cold, the Harvard men’s tennis team kicked off its spring season with a dual match in Texas this past weekend. The Crimson squad did not disappoint down South, claiming a 4-3 victory over Southern Methodist University on Friday and a handy 6-1 win over University of Texas, Arlington, on Sunday.
“The team competed really well this week,” co-captain Jean Thirouin said. “Being the first match of the season, it was expected that everyone wouldn’t be playing their best tennis, but the team fought hard and showed how much work they’d put in over break.”
Highlights of the weekend included strong doubles play in both matches, with Harvard earning both doubles points, and undefeated singles play from senior Grant Solomon, sophomore Logan Weber, and rookies Robert Wrzesinski and Constantin Zoske.
“We played tough opponents and the work we all put in in the offseason really showed,” junior Andy Zhou said. “I think the guys were very fit and match ready and that paid dividends under pressure this weekend.”
HARVARD 6, UTA 1
The Crimson claimed the doubles point with a sweep from both its first and second pairs. Senior Kenny Tao and Weber defeated their UTA (0-1) opponents, No. 48 doubles pair Mauricio Del Rio and Guanarteme Nuez, 6-3, at the No. 1 spot. The duo of Thirouin and Zhou earned an uncontested 6-0 win at second doubles.
On the singles side, Harvard won all of its points against the Mavericks except at first singles. Zhou and Weber found success on the court for the second time that day, both earning straight set victories at No. 2 and No. 6, respectively. Solomon, Wrzesinski, and Zoske also took home straight-set wins for the Crimson, all three of them ending the weekend 2-0 in singles play.
HARVARD 4, SMU 3
Harvard had an exciting season opener on Friday in a close matchup against the Mustangs. SMU (1-2) entered the match with a win already under its belt, a 4-0 seep of Abilene Christian University earlier this season.
The Crimson came out strong in close doubles matches. Tao and Weber clinched a critical 7-6 tiebreaker at first doubles, saving the team four match points. Thirouin and Zhou earned a 7-5 win at the second doubles slot, while Solomon and junior Chris Morrow fell to SMU’s third doubles pair, 6-1.
Harvard went on to secure its victory with wins from Wrzesinski at No. 4 singles, Zoske at No. 6 singles, and Solomon at No. 3 singles. Solomon earned a critical tiebreaker in the first set, giving him the lead 7-6, 6-3.
“Obviously it feels great to start the season off with a couple of wins, but I think this makes us hungrier for more,” Zhou said. “It’s an awesome beginning and the guys can do even better, so I’m excited for our next matches.”
With two wins under its belt, the team has good momentum going into its spring season.
“We’re all going to need to put in more work, in the gym and on the court, and definitely put in some match time as well,” Zhou said. “There’s only so much drilling that you can do once the season is underway, and our fitness and mental readiness during competition will help us a long way.”
The Crimson will host Auburn, Wichita State, and Utah this weekend.
“Our main focus is to keep building from week to week, keep our bodies healthy, and make sure we are having fun,” Thirouin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, Harvard wrestling capped winter break with a trip to Central Pennsylvania. The region is home to Bucknell, Franklin & Marshall, and the start of EIWA competition.
Friday brought disappointment, as the Crimson dropped a 21-10 affair against the Bison. But Harvard (3-1, 1-1 EIWA) rebounded in style by blasting the Diplomats, 30-6.
HARVARD 30, FRANKLIN & MARSHALL 6
This season, Harvard has the luxury of experience.
The roster sports eight seniors, more than any other age group. Five veterans each have weathered more than 50 matches. And seniors often compete in the five heaviest weight classes, which means that the Crimson can rely on experienced athletes in tight situations.
Last weekend at Franklin & Marshall, though, it was a pair of juniors that sparked Harvard. Nolan Hellickson and Ryan Friedman wrestled at 125 pounds and 133 pounds, respectively. By the time they were finished, the Crimson held an 8-0 lead.
The Diplomats would never get closer. Harvard dropped only two matches en route to a 30-6 victory.
Special credit went to Friedman and sophomore Hunter Ladnier, who won by technical falls. Competing at 149 pounds, Ladnier bulldozed his opponent in a 21-6 victory.
Credit also went to hapless Franklin & Marshall (1-9, 0-6), which has yet to grab a conference win. Since downing Virginia Military Institute on Dec. 2, the Diplomats have dropped eight straight matches, with an average margin of loss of 24 points.
The Crimson provided no solace. Two Harvard wrestlers picked up major decisions. At 184 pounds, co-captain Kanon Dean earned a 12-4 victory. And at 197 pounds, fellow senior Logan Kirby captured a 15-7 result.
Franklin & Marshall nabbed points in two weight classes—157 pounds and 285 pounds. In the former, Emmett LiCastri trumped over freshman Brock Wilson in an 8-3 decision. Harvard senior Angus Cowell provided more resistance in the heavyweight category. The veteran kept pace with Antonio Pelusi but suffered a 3-2 result.
After Wilson lost at 157 pounds, Harvard seniors ripped off four wins. Tyler Tarsi grabbed an 11-8 decision at 165 pounds, and Dean and Kirby won their major decisions.
In the middle of that sequence was a 3-2 victory for co-captain Josef Johnson. The senior entered Saturday tied for the most wins of any Crimson wrestler. Johnson faced a battle against Joshua Young, but the Harvard leader squeaked out the one-point victory.
Evidently, the Crimson would have won without the early victories by Hellickson and Friedman. But those matches built a relaxing cushion for Harvard.
Hellickson especially has started well this season. Boasting a 13-5 record, he sports the highest winning percentage on the season of any Harvard wrestler. That number stands at .571 for his career. Only Johnson and sophomore A.J. Jaffe rank higher.
BUCKNELL 21, HARVARD 10
On Friday, Bucknell and Harvard entered Davis Gym both searching for a first conference win. The difference was that the Bison had already completed—and lost—two EIWA contests. The Crimson, meanwhile, was opening league competition.
At the end of the evening, it was beleaguered Bucknell (2-9, 1-3) that emerged with the win. The Bison secured the victory when Chad Reese topped freshman Cliffton Wang in a 5-3 decision. Reese, who last competed in November, overcame an early 2-1 deficit.
That match capped a spirited comeback for Bucknell. After Crimson rookie Brock Wilson claimed a 3-0 decision at 157 pounds, the visitors held a 10-6 lead. But the Bison claimed the next five matches to carry the contest.
The evening featured high drama, with two bouts going to overtime. Bucknell won both. At 133 pounds, David Campbell topped junior Samuel Goldman, 3-1, in the first bonus frame. At 174 pounds, Nick Stephani went a frame-and-a-half before securing a 2-1 victory over co-captain Johnson.
The 184-pound matchup did not require overtime, but Drew Phipps and Dean still staged a battle. A 4-4 tie held with 20 seconds left, but Phipps earned a takedown and 6-5 win. Similarly, at 165 pounds, D.J. Hollingshead came up clutch for the Bison. He scored a late takedown to snatch a 9-6 finale.
Not all contests involved such excitement. No. 14 Tyler Smith (141 pounds) furthered a spotless dual record with an 8-2 decision over Crimson sophomore A.J. Jaffe. Further, the match began and ended with low-stress affairs. At 125 pounds, Hellickson picked up early points for Harvard with a 6-0 win. And at 285 pounds, Brandon Stokes limited Cowell in a 4-1 decision.
Between those poles, though, the two squads went back and forth. With the final result, Bucknell denied the Crimson a perfect start to conference play.

Shopping period is underway. Cue the frantic anxiety and late-night emails to professors begging to be let into their class. It’s easy to get swept up in the hype of shopping week and end up choosing classes that you’ll regret later in the semester. To help you, Flyby presents its third semesterly “Most Savage Q-Guide Comments” so you know what classes to avoid. Don’t worry, there are some wholesome gems in here as well if you’re looking for a class to fill your fourth slot.
The Savage

SCILIVSY 17: Human Physiology: From Personal To Public Health

“You know why you’re taking it.”
“Do. not. take. this. Class.”
“DO NOT TAKE THIS” In case you missed it. 
“This class is a flaming pile of garbage...My 6-year old cousin made a powerpoint on boa-constrictors for his kindergarten class last week. His slides were more aesthetically pleasing and better put together (less typos, for sure) than the lecture slides for this course, which consisted of google images shoddily copied and pasted in and Powerpoint’s basic default template. I nearly fell out of my chair when one of the Professors switched her slide background to blue (so bold).” Excerpted from a response which took up almost the entire page of reviews. Props to the reviewer for working in his 6-year old cousin and boa constructors in a review of a class on personal and public health!
Expos 20 Edition

Paradox in Public Health:

“I was under the impression that Expos is a good place to meet people, which it is. I was hoping to get to know girls through Expos, but my section was nearly all guys! So be wary of that when choosing your section topic. Apart from that, Expos is on-and-off in terms of weekly workload, and my preceptor was amazing and very helpful.” Looks like this student didn’t get their first choice of Femme Fatale.
Faking it to Make It:

“These aren't assignments you can do in one night to get an A.” Aren’t there enough memes about this already? The class is literally called Faking it to Make It. Procrastinating seems like a prereq.
Why Shakespeare?:

“We only had to read 2 plays (well, technically 4…)” Someone clearly isn’t going to be a math concentrator
“What is Wilson looking for? Nobody knows.” Big Mood
Wholesome Honorable Mention

HIST 1457: History of American Capitalism
"One of the most coherent and thoughtful courses I've taken at Harvard, Hist 1457 will help you understand how things economists take to be timeless and universal are contingent upon a set of peculiar and relatively recent historical events. The readings are excellent, Beckert is a teaching god, and the TFs are committed; if you're at all historically inclined, you'll come away with a rigorous background on the vast and complex system that has shaped this country and the world for several centuries. If you're an "ec bro," you may not enjoy it, but only because you won't get it."
And finally, the Supposedly Complimentary Comments Written By Self-Congratulatory Hardos to Undermine the Confidence of Q-Guide Browsers

SCILIVSY 19: Nutrition and Global Health

"Prepare to sit in long, passionless lectures where pseudo-intellectuals chime in just to make the learning process more painful." Written by a real intellectual.
“Tests aren’t as easy as they seem. Must study for at least one day.” If having to study for one day for a test is stand-out enough to make up an entire Q review, I’d like to take some study lessons from this master test-taker.
EC1010A: Intermediate Microeconomics

"A beginning to a serious economist career, and more generally, a successful and productive life." You know JP Morgan is just looking at your resume, not your Q-Guide comments, right?  
EC10B: Principles of Economics

“I think Ec10 should be a required course for all Harvard students.”
“Everyone should know the basics of economics.”
“You have to take this course to be a knowledgeable citizen of the world.”
These comments just make it that much harder to convince your high school friends that not everyone at Harvard is elitist.

Shopping week is not exactly retail therapy. In fact, we often need therapy after the trials and tribulations that come with a whole week of making decisions. Balancing concentration requirements and Gen Eds is enough of a struggle, so why must we also deal with other stressors? The ER requirement is rude enough. Flip to page one of the syllabus for an outline of even ruder shopping week missteps.
Giving real content in the first lecture
We only got out of bed for this 10 a.m. to see if the “gem” rumors are true. You’re off to a bad start if you pack actual course material into the first lecture. And there’s really no need to use the full hour and a half—we just want to get in, grab a syllabus, judge the gem-ness of the class, and get out.
Booking too small a room for a popular class
We refuse to be crammed into the corner of a tiny Sever classroom again, especially if you know that your class will draw a crowd. Since we shop many more classes than we end up taking, it should be obvious that you will have more shoppers than actual students. Please plan accordingly and upscale your classroom.
Making homework due during shopping week
This move is so rude that it barely merits an explanation. We don’t even know if we’re taking your class yet, and we’re probably juggling it with the ten other classes in our Crimson Carts, so spare us the agony. It could be a good strategy, though, if you’re looking to drastically reduce your class size. Rest assured no one will be coming back next week.
Releasing lottery results after shopping week is over
We’re Harvard students. We don’t like uncertainty. We want to have our schedules locked down as early into shopping week as possible, so please don’t wait until the weekend to let us know if we lotteried into your class. Put us out of our misery by Wednesday—Thursday at the latest.
The transition from break to school life is always brutal, so we beg you: don’t make it harder than it needs to be. If we see you committing one of these shopping week faux pas, don’t be surprised to hear us (respectfully) say: (Professor) Dude, that’s rude.
