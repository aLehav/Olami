Petting snakes, walking Central American Beaches, traversing Scottish Highlands, and holding Scarlet Macaws in the middle of a Costa Rican evergreen forest — these are all typical activities for David Attenborough, one of the foremost naturalists in the world. In Netflix’s recently released “Life in Color with David Attenborough,” Attenborough takes the audience around the world to see the role that color plays in the lives of a multitude of animals. In the three-part docuseries, species from Cuban Painted Snails in Central America to ptarmigans in the Scottish mountains are all explored in vivid detail.
With David Attenborough at the helm, “Life in Color” begins and plays out as a classic nature documentary. There’s the iconic and well-known face, the beautiful landscape, and the subjects of the show itself — in the introductory example, the colorful Macaws — to create an atmosphere of excitement for the material of the series. By taking this comfortable and familiar approach to introducing the show, in many ways “Life in Color” establishes itself in the tradition of Attenborough’s other nature documentaries.
The first two episodes follow an almost identical approach to addressing their respective titles, “Seeing in Color” and “Hiding in Color.” The series goes so far as to repeatedly reuse film from different perspectives: in one example, they show the same scene both through the lens of a predator with excellent color vision and then, without color, through the eyes of its prey. Due to that repetitiveness, it feels as if the docuseries is trying to mitigate the incredible difficulty of capturing high-quality film of animals in their natural habitats around the world rather than taking the time to record a variety of interactions. As a result, “Life in Color” almost comes off as a cheap attempt from Netflix to slap a well-loved name — David Attenborough — on a mediocre documentary.
One bit of repose comes at the end of the third episode — which in and of itself comprises another interesting approach to re-using previous film by putting another new spin on it — when Mr. Attenborough is talking over some astounding yet troubling footage of the Great Barrier Reef. As he speaks about the dangers of climate change and the effects on these vibrant, colorful ecosystems, a deeper meaning finally emerges. Not only is the documentary about the wonders and curiosities of our colorful world, but it takes a moment to acknowledge that on our current path, our corals will all become bleached, our forests will be bare, and our animal populations will dwindle. Unfortunately, Attenborough spoke about these pressing problems for only a fraction of the time he should have.
With a show so wholly focused on all of the beauty and mystery surrounding the stripes on a Bengal Tiger and the value of the vibrance in poison dart frogs, the driving forces eliminating all this beauty should be a central point of conversation. If “Life in Color” had incorporated this more comprehensively, it would have added a much needed bit of depth and scope to the show. As it sits, the series is entertaining and offers viewers a chance to watch and listen to the sounds of the jungles and seas, but that’s it. It needed an additional spark to hold audiences’ interests, but fell short.
Lack of depth aside, with its dizzying tiger chases and glimpses of male lizards dancing around each other as they try to make their ways to a feast of flies, “Life in Color” does succeed as a bit of elegant escapism. Voiced by a respected British naturalist, it’s a joy to put on and have play in the background. With only a little bit of tweaking and the incorporation of David Attenborough’s clear passion, it could have been astounding. As Mr. Attenborough stated, “We can use color to protect the natural world for all future generations.” The series misses an opportunity to show viewers how more animals, not just the coral off the coast of Australia, have been trying to use color to survive and adapt to an ever-changing world.

This review contains spoilers for Season One of ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.’ 
After a rocky season of episodes that struggled to achieve the perfect pace, the finale of Marvel’s “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” finally cracked the code. The series’ last episode, titled “One World, One People,” struck the perfect balance between dialogue and action, packed with both touching moments and epic fight scenes.
The episode dives straight into the action with Sam’s (Anthony Mackie) Captain America debut in a suit that combines the Falcon’s wings with the iconic stars and stripes. This moment is euphoric, giving fans the Captain America they deserve after having to watch the uninspiring John Walker (Wyatt Russell) carry the shield. Each fight scene follows the classic Marvel formula, combining action, suspense, and a little bit of comic relief.
Walker once again makes an appearance in his wannabe Captain America uniform, likely prompting groans of “Ugh, this guy again?!” from viewers. Much to everyone’s surprise, however, he sets his ego aside, choosing to rescue a truck filled with hostages. When his plan goes awry, it opens up the opportunity for Sam to swoop in and get the job done, establishing himself as the superior Captain America.
Walker’s presence this season incited backlash from fans over his desecration of the Captain America name. Despite the outrage that he prompted, Walker’s villainous and erratic personality creates crucial nuance in the storyline, showing that the labels of hero and villain do not always hold true. The other antagonist, Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman) becomes elevated in contrast to Walker, breaking from the traditional villain stereotype. She is arguably the most complex and interesting character of the entire season, largely due to Kellyman’s brilliant performance as a powerful female lead. One can’t help but feel bad for her, carrying a massive movement on her young shoulders while navigating the post-Blip world.
For every action-packed moment, there was one that pulled at the audience’s heartstrings. The most painful was Karli’s death. Although it was foreshadowed in her conversation with Bucky (Sebastian Stan) earlier in the episode, her death still comes as a shock when Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) pulls the trigger from offscreen. The shot of Sam carrying her limp body out of the building is both beautiful and tragic, his wings creating an angelic silhouette.
After Karli’s death, Sam gives a momentous televised speech. In an excellent performance from Anthony Mackie, Sam publicly steps into the role of Captain America, recognizing the adversity he will face as a Black man with no superpowers. Here, he delivers the standout line, “The only power I have is that I believe we can do better.”
The finale also neatly ties up the storylines of Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) and Bucky. Sam recognizes Bradley’s struggles as a Super Soldier test subject with a statue honoring him at the Captain America exhibit, and Bucky gets necessary closure by confessing to his neighbor Yori (Ken Takemoto) that he killed his son as the Winter Soldier. A joyful montage at the end of the episode shows Bucky bonding with Sam’s family in Louisiana, finally at peace.
Unfortunately, the finale does not give every character a satisfying conclusion. A few scenes near the end of the episode seem misplaced, like the sudden shift to Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) in his jail cell, watching the bombing of the remaining Flag Smashers that he coordinated. While this is an important plot point, eliminating the option of a Flag Smashers return, the scene feels like an afterthought. Walker’s official recruitment by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) as “US Agent,” is also odd. His transition into this new position of power is far too easy, leaving his emotional issues unaddressed.
Continuations of the storyline will undoubtedly focus on Sharon Carter, who is finally revealed to be the Power Broker. The plot-twist is not at all surprising, considering her character’s suspicious behavior ever since she was first introduced in episode three. In the post-credit scene, Carter is granted a full pardon and reinstated as an agent — a perfect set-up for Marvel’s next all-powerful potential villain, now with access to government secrets.
“The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” followed the blueprint of its Marvel movie predecessors, paling in comparison to the creativity of “WandaVision,” which took risks that more substantially paid off. However, just because the show lacked originality doesn’t mean it wasn’t enjoyable to watch. Adaptations of the trademark Marvel structure work for a reason, beloved by fans who keep coming back. The show has been a nice source of entertainment in the pandemic, and there are many promising directions in which Sam and Bucky can go next.

“Zero,” Netflix’s new superhero series, follows the life of Omar (Giuseppe Dave Seke), also known as “Zero,” as he navigates his power and bonds with his new group of friends in the Barrio, a neighborhood that Zero comes to love and cherish. When vandals and thieves threaten to ruin the neighborhood that Zero calls home, he and his ragtag gang of friends are prepared to fight tooth and nail to save it.
Continuing the theme of realistic superhero fiction established by classics like “Daredevil” and "Jessica Jones," “Zero” approaches the genre through the lens of banal, everyday life. What would happen if that neighbor down the street could suddenly fly? What if the little grandma in her garden had laser vision? What if a working-class teenager could miraculously turn invisible? By not instantly becoming another Marvel hero with incredible power and inexplicably well-established connections, Zero stays accessible, with none of the typical Hollywood glam. For the first time, this isn’t unique. With the recent release of Season Three of “The Boys” and “Invincible” — both Amazon Prime originals — it seems audiences are getting a realistic look at what happens when real people, rather than Tony Stark or Steve Rogers, get superpowers.
Filmed completely in Milan with a group of mostly unknown actors, “Zero” was a new venture into foreign-produced superhero franchises for Netflix. In many ways, their lack of marketing abroad for the series seems like their single greatest mistake. “Zero” might be unconventional for the American market because it’s filmed in Italian, but with the rise in popularity of anime, more Netflix users are willing to watch subtitled content (which, compared to the dubbed English edit, comes across more naturally).
One of the greatest assets of the show is its score, which comes across subtly at first and always rises to meet and emphasize the emotions on screen. By utilizing the variety of sounds and emotions that a synthesizer can produce when paired with on-screen action, music supervisor Marco de Angelis managed to manufacture powerful emotions, creating a sense of harmony between the actors and the music. For example, when Shariff (Haroun Fall) sees his brother taken away in handcuffs, he and his mother come together in a tearful embrace, and the swelling orchestration builds a moving moment.
With a new cast and a lead actor with little prior experience, it seemed that Netflix's gamble has paid off. While there were moments where elements weren’t executed perfectly, “Zero” capitalized on what each actor could bring to the table and ran with it. With its focus on life in Milan’s Barrio, “Zero” is also notably a great show to watch to gain a greater understanding of migrant struggles anywhere in the world. By highlighting an Italian-language project starring newer actors, hopefully “Zero” can set the stage to allow new talent and perspectives onto Netflix’s mainstream.

In the first episode of Showtime and A24’s new variety series “Ziwe,” which premiered on May 9, host and creator Ziwe Fumudoh’s sharp humor, poignant commentary, and glossy style give new life and relevance to the talk-show format, offering hope for a fresh phase in the late-night space. As the premiere bounces between Fumudoh’s interviews with author Fran Lebowitz and activist Gloria Steinem, a music video directed by Quinn Wilson, a discussion with several white women named Karen, and satirical commercial breaks, every element is tied together by wit and hilarity that should appeal to comedy fans, late-night viewers, and ultimately anyone interested in watching a brilliant comedic voice make her network TV debut.
Fumudoh gained widespread recognition for her dynamic, often cringe-inducing Instagram Live interview series, in which guests ranging from Caroline Calloway to Alison Roman stumbled to answer questions like “how many Black friends do you have?” and “qualitatively, what do you like about Black people?”. Fumudoh’s willingness to challenge her guests and audience with straightforward questions is on full display in her new show, but she’s also skillfully utilizing a variety of other media to delve into issues of identity, race, gender, class and privilege. For much of the premiere episode — titled “55%,” for the percentage of white women who voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election — “Ziwe” examines white women’s role in supporting and perpetuating racism. After a charming, “Daria”-esque animated title sequence, the episode jumps into Fumudoh’s interview with Lebowitz, which begins on a playfully antagonist note when Lebowitz refuses to make a standard entrance around the back of the stage and immediately sits down, noting that she’s not interested in “games.”
“Is that standard for white women to come onto a show and dictate how it’s supposed to go?” Fumudoh asks; with staggeringly little self-awareness, Lebowitz responds that “only Black women think white women are in charge of things.” As the episode progresses, it challenges this pervasive white-feminist idea that white women are not instrumental in white supremacy, from the campy music video for “Lisa Called the Cops” (a showtune-inflected original song about a white woman who frequently calls the police on Black people) to a fake commercial about white women buying American Girl dolls from the “Imperial Wives Collection.” While the show takes an unflinching look at an urgent reality that, as Lebowitz’s interview shows, white women still need to accept, it’s not focused on calling out individual guests’ racism. Rather, the show weaves interviews into a broader discussion of issues affecting today’s America, always imbued with humor by Fumudoh and co-writers Jamund Washington, Michelle Davis, Cole Escola and Jordan Mendoza. “It’s not about getting anyone cancelled,” Fumudoh told Janelle Monae during a premiere event for the show, “It’s about having lighthearted conversations about serious topics.”
She noted that viewers see her guests and herself grow and change their perspectives in real time, and that she worked closely with editors to find a distinct editing and graphic style for each interview. The two conversations in “55%” have completely different atmospheres, with Lebowitz’s longer interview taking place on a lush, pink-drenched set and Steinem’s moving quickly via video chat. Both are laugh-out-loud hilarious, though, from Fumudoh’s dramatic reading of Cardi B’s “WAP” for Steinem (“When you hear these lyrics, do you feel empowered as a lady?”) to her questions for Lebowitz about why she agreed to the show (“I don’t have the slightest idea who you are,” Lebowitz deadpans, “Someone who worked for you was incredibly persistent — incredibly persistent.”). Like any great late-night talk show host, Fumudoh is hyper-responsive to guests with her questions and creates a sense of spontaneity, even as they discuss a range of connected topics — and it’s to her credit as a comic and commentator that, despite her guests’ sometimes bizarre or tone-deaf answers, the conversations are as nuanced as they are interesting and leave viewers with multiple takeaways. For those who don’t usually watch talk shows, “Ziwe” will not only be a worthwhile watch, but one that flies by, making for great binge-watching when the episodes are all out.
Adding to the show’s immersiveness is its distinctive visual style, which is cohesive across the set design, music, editing, costuming, and cinematography. From the main interview stage — a bubblegum-pinked fake living room decorated with urns of giant feathers — to the glittery, Old-Hollywood style music video, “Ziwe” embraces a poppy, glamorous aesthetic that feels more “Euphoria” than “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” The show’s hyper-feminine design elements are also unique on the landscape of live TV: As Fumudoh noted to Monae, “A lot of time women have to tone down femininity to be taken seriously,” and she hoped to counter that norm with her vision for the show. The graphics and music cues hype of the drama of each moment, underscoring tense moments and amplifying funny back-and-forths. The show is also tightly edited to pack many different segments into a 25-minute spot, but never feels like it’s cutting away from any one segment too soon. “Ziwe” is a welcome relief from late night’s cityscape backgrounds and navy suits, and it’ll appeal to fans of A24’s distinctively-stylized feature projects.
Ultimately, “Ziwe”’s debut spells new promise for the talk-show genre, raising the bar through its seamless, mesmerizing combination of interviews, sketches, and music. It’s all pretty — as Fumudoh would say — iconic.

This year, Harvard alumni Graham A. Sack ‘03 and Jennifer 8. Lee ‘98-99 recently received the Sloan Sundance Grant for their episodic TV project titled “The Harvard Computers,” a show Lee is producing and Sack is writing. They are excited to keep developing the show, which retells the groundbreaking true story of female astronomers at Harvard in the 19th century.
Both Sack and Lee studied STEM fields as undergrads. Sack concentrated in physics and Lee in Applied Math and Economics, and their new series brings them back into the world of Harvard science.
Sack and Lee first met through an email list that Lee made for Harvard alums in New York City. Sack, who grew up acting professionally on Broadway and in movies, had been active in the performing arts community in college. Sack’s career as a screenwriter began when his first script, co-written with another Harvard alum, won the Big Break screenplay competition. He then sold a script that was featured on the 2015 Black List, an annual collection of Hollywood’s best unproduced scripts.
Lee got her start in journalism, serving as the Vice-President of The Harvard Crimson and working as a reporter for the New York Times before starting to produce documentaries.
Sack and Lee’s first collaboration was a virtual reality film called “Lincoln in the Bardo“ with The New York Times that was shortlisted for an Emmy award.
Speaking on their inspiration for the Harvard Computers project, Sack said, “the earliest kernels came while I was an undergrad… I went to lectures at The Harvard Observatory. It started in earnest around the time Jenny and I met.” He notes that authentically portraying science presents a challenge for science fiction films, and movies tend to focus more on the personal stories at play. “What’s the right balance to take to keep it compelling?” Sack says. Striking a balance between telling the personal story and the science is of great importance for Sack and Lee on this project. As a history buff, Sack was interested in finding compelling stories that dealt with the issue of gender-based discrimination in the scientific community, a search that was amplified around the beginning of the #MeToo Movement. These events “set off a series of neurons” for Sack that inspired this multi-generational story of women in the STEM world supporting each other.
Sack described the origins of the computer as a tale with a “multi-generational ensemble,” so Sack and Lee decided a television series would be the best medium to portray the story. The series will center on Williamina Fleming, a Scottish immigrant who was abandoned while pregnant in Boston in 1878. She worked as a maid for Edward Charles Pickering, an astronomy professor at Harvard. When Pickering took over the Harvard Observatory and set out to photograph and map the night sky, he hired Fleming to work in his lab. At the time, women were beginning to graduate from Radcliffe, but the opportunities available for female professional scientists were still few and far between; The Harvard Observatory became one of the few places that hired women as researchers. Fleming and her female peers, including astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt, began making incredible scientific advances in the Observatory. This historical saga forms the basis of Lee’s and Sack’s project.
Sack explains that, as a character and a focus of the series, Fleming is “amazing and is dealing with all these urgent, very visceral challenges.” The series is also animated by the charisma and connections of its characters; “They have banter and wit that softens the heaviness of the day to day science, and these huge social forces that are unfolding.” Indeed, the story kicks off during the early days of the women’s suffrage movement, the labor movement, and The Second Great Migration.
The series also covers the beginning of big data. “Astronomy is one of the first sciences to go through the transformation to big data,” Sack explains. “At the beginning of this story, it’s basically people staying up all night staring through telescopes and taking notes on what they see.” Pickering realizes the inadequacy of this method and creates a map of the night sky with his photographs; when people can stare at the same sky, new information becomes available. This shift gave the women scientists their nickname: “The Harvard Computers.” The Observatory scientists needed people to go through this vast expansion of astronomical data, and they could inexpensively hire female researchers to process it. “You have this intersection of big data and the labor that it creates,” Sack notes.
On her collaboration with Sack, Lee says, “there’s an emotional therapy and cheerleading role as a producer. You’re the first believer in a creative project, in something that’s a very lonely endeavor. You’re taking something that springs from your own mind and putting it out into the world.” Sack added that, with a project so many years in the making, having Lee as an ally to go through the ups and downs with has been critical.
Moving forward, The Sloan Grant will enable Lee and Sack to bring on an additional science advisor as the show moves toward finding a home at a TV network.
Sack and Lee are tremendously grateful for the support of The Sloan Foundation, and are ecstatic about telling a story that intersects with their alma mater, STEM background, and a groundbreaking moment in the history of women’s contributions to scientific discovery.
