What are the similarities between Dante Alighieri and Steve Buscemi? First time writer and director Hue Rhodes may be the only one. Loosely based on Dante’s “Inferno,” “Saint John of Las Vegas” follows a reformed gambler’s trip to his own personal “hell” as he is led on his first investigation of insurance fraud. However, though the performances are uniformly strong, only viewers who are already deeply familiar with Dante’s poem will be able to understand how the film functions as an adaptation, which is unfortunately a critical element in appreciating the movie as a whole.
Steve Buscemi plays John Alighieri, a quirky and uncomfortable man fighting a gambling addiction and moving up through the ranks of a mundane insurance agency. When he finally works up the courage to ask his boss (Peter Dinklage) for a raise, he instead offers him a shot at investigating the potential fraud of a stripper named Tasty Delight (Emmanuelle Chriqui).
Dispatched to guide John on his first mission is Virgil (Romany Malco), an A-list fraud buster who takes his job very seriously. The two embark on a trip to Las Vegas, John’s own personal Hades, with its endless gambling temptations.
John and Virgil’s encounters over the course of their investigation become increasingly bizarre. Among them are an absurdly erotic encounter with the wheelchair-bound Tasty Delight, and a naked confrontation with a gung-ho protector of a “nature compound.” As the seemingly random journey progresses, John begins to feel increasingly tough, adopting the attitude of the street-wise and fearless Virgil.
Now, if you’ve recently spent a few high school or college classes with you nose forcibly buried in the “Inferno,” then maybe, just maybe, you will pick up on the subtle allusions to the work of Dante.
The only real hints given are Virgil’s name, as well as John’s; he shares a last name with Dante. Without the knowledge of that framework, Rhode’s interpretation will seem like an arbitrary compilation of stories loosely pasted together under the pretense of a road trip gone horribly wrong.
Though the film overall feels choppy and nonsensical, there is certainly entertainment value to be found in the characters and their misadventures. Steve Buscemi delivers yet another excellent performance, imbuing John with a quirky yet weary demeanor. Romany Malco, known for his role in “The 40 Year Old Virgin,” makes Virgil perfectly indignant and mysterious, mocking John more than helping him. The two have excellent on-screen chemistry, and convincingly play off each other with sarcastic wit.
Sarah Silverman stars as John’s coworker Jill, with whom he becomes involved with after an office quickie. Her character can best be described as psychotic, with a fetish for smiley faces and the color yellow. But Silverman is not her usual offensive self, at least not in an obvious way, which is actually very refreshing. It’s nice to know that she can actually act, and not just affront people with a straight face.
The brief performances of the many people John and Virgil encounter are certainly memorable as well. Perhaps the best is delivered by a masked John Cho, who spends his exchange with John engulfed in flames. Likewise, Peter Dinklage’s portrayal of a typical nobody who thinks he’s a big shot gives his character the same kind of sass he displayed as Miles Finch, the “South Pole elf,”in “Elf.”
Rhodes lucked out with his selection of actors, because their performances are the only thing that gives the film any merit. The overarching message of the film is actually incomprehensible unless the viewer has the critical prior knowledge that the film is based on Dante’s “Inferno.”
Aside from that somewhat unfair assumption, it’s also clear that the first-time director and writer tried a little too hard with his adaptation of a staple of classic literature. He throws in random voiceovers that attempt to be insightful, but instead prove to be more distracting than helpful. There are also frequent flashes of clips that come without warning and are at first hard to decipher—are they dream sequences, flashbacks, or glimpses of things to come?
“Saint John of Las Vegas” is a classic case of great characters thrown into a second-rate plot. For amusing but plotless performances, see the film. But for a story that actually makes sense, stick with the poem.

Ladies, get your red wine and ice-cream ready for the perfect blend of break-ups, make-ups, awkward moments, sex, new love, Queen Latifah, old love, Abercrombie models, tears, and Ashton Kutcher.  “Valentine’s Day” may not live up to the high-points of other ensemble romantic comedies such as “Love, Actually” or “He’s Just Not that Into You,” it will likely please you in a way that only Leonidas and Jake Sully can please my manly, manly soul.
Men, if you’re reading this review, first thank you, second, it’s a pretty solid Valentine’s Day choice; your date will be happy, you won’t be miserable, you’ll laugh multiple times, but try your best to suspend your disbelief and not attempt to figure out the plot twists, such as they are.  Though “Valentine’s Day” works well as a fluffy date movie, from a critical standpoint, not even a great cast can elevate the insubstantial and thoroughly contrived storyline.
A film focusing on a single day in the lives of 21 people is bound to have poor character development.  All of the characters are one-dimensional, except for the surprisingly excellent Ashton Kutcher.  As the film’s central character, Kutcher undergoes the most changes over the course of the day and gradually wins over the audience with his combination of charm and down-to-earth attitude.  In a film directed by the menopausal king of chick flicks, Garry Marshal (“Pretty Woman,” “Runaway Bride,” “Overboard,” and “The Princess Diaries”) it’s nice to see at least one character who isn’t a slimy, cheating scumbag.
Apart from Kutcher, Jamie Foxx, Bradley Cooper, and Queen Latifah all deliver strong performances, especially considering the extraordinarily limited amount of screen time they have to work with.  The rest of the A-list ensemble, however, are somewhat poorly chosen, seemingly cast in the movie only for name recognition.
For example, Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” is arguably a great song, not just for country fans or tweens, but for the earth. Yet, though Swift may be the songbird of our generation, she is a terrible actress.  Cast as a ditsy and shallow high school senior, a job that shouldn’t be too much of a stretch for Swift, the squinty-eyed blonde delivers forced line-readings and is generally far too over the top.   Her boyfriend is played by real life boyfriend Taylor Lautner, who surprisingly displays more range as a werewolf.  Suffice it to say that this film does little for the “US Weekly” power-couple.
Other actors fare equally poorly.  Anne Hathaway, the Hasty Pudding Theatrical Society’s newly beloved Woman of the Year, is somehow both weird and unattractive.  Hathaway, whose character moonlights as an unsympathetic accent-swapping phone-sex operator, should have had the opportunity to flex her acting muscles­—as she did in “Havoc” when she loses her top and has group sex with Hispanic gang members, thus shedding her persona as “Princess Diaries” sweetheart.  Hathaway can do much better, and so could the veteran Julia Roberts—she’s not even trying in “Valentine’s Day,” but she’s Julia Roberts, so she can coast on her star status.
No matter how many critics bash this movie, chances are that hordes of romantics are still going to go see it, even if “Love, Actually” is ten times better.  Though the latter film has as big an ensemble cast, it somehow manages to connect to a viewer, likely because the movie’s plot does not unfold over such a limited time-span.
Hollywood took a hint from Hallmark—if you call your movie “Valentine’s Day,” people are going to happily fork over cash to see it, no matter how forgettable it is.

The best word to describe “Red Riding Trilogy” is “epic.” Clocking in at five hours (not including intermissions) the trilogy is emotional, stimulating, beautiful, and haunting. Based on the noir novels by David Peace, “Red Riding” is actually three movies directed by three different directors with three distinct plots, but all of them are connected by central and overarching conflicts.
Set against the backdrop of shocking serial murders in a particularly poor section of England, the films tell the story of the West Yorkshire Constabulary and the corruption that has been eating away at the small police force for ten years. Spanning that decade, the audience is presented with a complex, moving look at this strange little place, the fear of three ruthless serial killers, and the desperation of having literally nowhere to turn in a town so filled with corruption.
In “Red Riding 1974,” there have been a rash of kidnappings in small, impoverished West Yorkshire. Ace reporter Eddie Dunford (Andrew Garfield, in an excellent performance) has made it his mission to get to the bottom of it all, but along the way runs into something much more complex and sinister than a serial killer. John Dawson, (Sean Bean) a prominent business man, has been bribing policemen and officials for years and when a young girl is found dead and brutalized on his land, he is willing to go to any length to keep Dunford from prying.
“Red Riding 1980” begins six years later with the appearance of the Yorkshire Ripper, a serial killer who has been raping, mutilating and murdering prostitutes in Yorkshire for years. The Constabulary has been forced to call in a special team to hunt down this killer, led by Peter Hunter, (Paddy Cobsidine) a cop who has already made enemies in the tight-knit, corrupt West Yorkshire Police force. Digging deeper into the conspiracies discovered by Dunford in 1974, Hunter is met with the same resistance and violence in his attempt to catch the murderer.
In the third film, the year is now 1983 and there has been another kidnapping in West Yorkshire, which is strikingly similar to those of 1974, forcing the police to accept that they may not have apprehended the right man. A washed up public defender John Piggott (Mark Addy) has taken on the case and strikes yet another blow at the white-collar crime that pervades the Police Department.
The plot of all three films leaves something to be desired on occasion. It is a typical noir story and sometimes the heavy-handed conspiracy elements and over-the-top violence become a tad obvious.
For example, the third movie begins with a trip to a psychic who mutters heavy-handed hints to the audience, and any time a female character is introduced, it is a matter of minutes before she enters into a torrid affair with the main character of the moment.
However, the directors (Julian Jarrold, James Marsh, and Anand Tucker, in charge of 1974, 1980 and 1983 respectively) work well within these genre conventions. This is not a movie that is meant to shock audiences with an eleventh hour twist—it is instead a horrific journey that slowly unfolds.
Despite its plot, “Red Riding” is not a story about serial killers or brutal murders—it is about all of the things that surround them: the parents, the police, the newspapers, and the communities all trying to make sense of these brutal events.
The acting is superb across the board, as characters wrestle with knowledge that the audience won’t get to know for hours, but somehow don’t come off as confused or thick. Robert Sheehan puts in a particularly moving performance as BJ, a gay prostitute who also finds himself caught up in these mysteries, inexplicably tied to each death across the three movies. Other stand-outs include Rebecca Hall as the grieving mother of a missing girl and Sean Harris, one of the many corrupt cops of the West Yorkshire Constabulary.
While audience members have the option to see only one of the films, the Kendall Square Theater is also offering marathon viewings where all three movies will be shown back-to-back. While each is good on its own, it is in the sheer length and breadth that the story has the most power.
Be warned, “Red Riding” is not a movie for the faint of heart, as there is some truly gratuitous violence, and the directors spare no detail of the gory deaths. The opening image of the first film, for example, is a dead child with swan wings stitched to her back. But this image, like the trilogy as a whole, is both horrifying and haunting, a combination that makes the endpoint well worth the five hours it takes to get there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Painting, poetry, film, sculpture, humanitarianism, experimentalism and curiosity about the black, curving infinity that lies beyond—these concerns underpin the life and work of Aldo Tambellini. On February 22 at 7:00 PM the Harvard Film Archive (HFA) is running a rare screening of a series of his “black films,” which Tambellini will introduce in person. It will be a remarkable opportunity to discover the work of an artist and filmmaker who has been rather private in the past. “Over the years I made my own art for myself, and I was more interested in developing it and seeing it move forward than showing it off. I just started exhibiting recently,” says Tambellini.
The HFA will screen the filmmaker’s experimental short films, each ranging from three to fourteen minutes with the titles of “Black Is,” “Black Trip,” “Black Plus X,” “Black Trip 2,” “Blackout,” “Black TV,” and “Moonblack.” But what makes the color, and the concept, of blackness so important to Tambellini? In his own words, “The theme of black—it’s racial, it’s artistic, it’s cosmic.”
Using black is Tambellini’s way of evoking the infinite space that surrounds our planet. The Russian cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov, the first man to walk in space, wrote, “Before me—blackness: an inky-black sky studded with stars that glowed but did not twinkle; they seemed immobilized. Space itself appears as a bottomless pit. Such intensity of black does not exist on earth.” When Tambellini read these words in 1965, he realized that he has already been striving for a similar effect with his art and films. His work is also marked by a fixation with curved surfaces, because “everything in space is circular.”
One of Tambellini’s poems begins with the words, “Nothing in space is a square or a cube.” This focus on the spherical design of natural forms is evident in many of his creations, but it also functions as a small part of a larger theme. Through his art, Tambellini seeks to access that which is beyond the global, while maintaining a genuine concern for the social and political issues around him.
Tambellini, born in Syracuse, New York to an Italian mother and a Brazilian father, has always identified with black culture. The artist will turn 80 on April 29—“It’s the same date as the birthday of Duke Ellington. I’m a big fan of jazz,” Tambellini says. He grew up with his mom and his brother in a working class area of Lucca, a town in Tuscany. At age three he started painting (“I was born an artist,” he says) and at age ten he began studying at the Lucca Art Institute. Tambellini’s town was bombed when he was thirteen, on January 6, 1944, the day of the Italian children’s holiday Befana. “I was on the street on my bicycle when the bomb came. It was a miracle that I survived. Since then I have written a lot of poetry on it,” Tambellini says. He remembers that frightening period of Italian history, when the government forced women like his mother to give up not only the pots and pans in their kitchen, but also the wedding rings on their finger to be melted and used for the war effort. Toward the end of the war, Tambellini recalls, “we were liberated just outside Lucca by an American black soldier.”
For all his life Tambellini has associated himself with African Americans, especially intellectuals, who he connects with because of their plight. “A lot of injustice has been done to black people. A lot of injustice is also done to artists,” he says. When his black series was made in New York in the 1960s, the films communicated a profound social and political message. His archivist and manager Anna Salamone says, “Aldo is a man who lives and creates by what he believes. There is just no grey about it; you either believe in it or you don’t and if you believe it, you live your life by it.”
Tambellini cites Byzantine art and Dante’s “Inferno” as other important early influences. Meaningful later influences include Sergei Eisenstien, Jackson Pollack and Andy Warhol. When Tambellini was sixteen, he moved to Syracuse, New York, where he attended art college. In 1959 he moved to Manhattan, where he co-founded and opened the Black Gate Theater to show experimental films in 1967. In 1976 he moved to Cambridge. For eight years he served as a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he specialized in media. According to Tambellini, “All media has something to do with art. Television is an art which often isn’t used as an art. Film is, above all, the modern medium for the creation of art.” Just three years ago, the mayor made him an honorary resident of Cambridge and gave him the keys to the city in recognition of his cultural contribution.
And that cultural contribution is, indeed, significant. In addition to making films, Tambellini is also a painter, sculptor, choreographer, and poet, and will perform a poetry reading in the Pierre Menard Gallery in Harvard Square on March 7th. To him, all the arts are interrelated, with one complementing the other. Tambellini employs this philosophy when making films; instead of using a camera, he paints directly on the leader of the film strip. He then mixes the leader with words from his poems and prerecorded news strips, as in his film “Black TV.”
And Tambellini is also well-aware of how critical the college experience is to the development of a young artist’s mind. He says, “Studying on your own, having a personal interest and developing it, is the only way you’re going to learn anything.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTIONS: February 22, 2010
An original version of the Feb. 17 arts article "Tambellini Discusses Blackness at HFA" incorrectly stated that Aldo Tambellini will conduct a poetry reading in the Hurst Gallery in Harvard Square. In fact, the reading will be held at the Pierre Menard Gallery.
The article also incorrectly stated Anna Salamone's name as Anna Tambellini, and called her Aldo Tambellini's wife. In fact, she is his archivist and manager.

“I am ‘full up’ with atrocities and horrors,” wrote Roger Casement in a letter to the British Foreign Office in March 1911. Casement, a diplomat and activist, had just returned to London from the Amazon jungle, where he had spent several months investigating the rumoured exploitation of Barbadian workers—at that time, British subjects—by a rubber manufacturing company. The Peruvian Amazon Company, Casement found, was abusing not only its Barbadian employees, but also enslaving and terrorizing the local Indian population. In the years following these revelations, until his death in 1916, Casement worked tirelessly to bring the man he considered responsible—the Peruvian rubber baron, Julio César Arana—to justice. In “The Devil and Mr. Casement,” British historian Jordan Goodman offers a dispassionate account of Casement’s struggle to expose and put an end to the atrocities wrought by Arana’s company in the Putumayo River Basin of northern Peru. But while Goodman’s chronicle of colonial-era corruption is admirably detailed, Goodman fails to identify the ethical complexities of Casement’s humanitarian project.
In the same way that details of the violence committed by and against the employees of the Peruvian Amazon Company surfaced slowly in the British press in the three years leading up to the Casement’s 1912 report, Goodman deploys his sources gradually, amassing eyewitness accounts alongside official reports. Goodman cites descriptions of gang rape, the torture of children (by burning their hands and feet until they betrayed the whereabouts of their parents), and deliberate regimes of starvation—all tactics to maintain an atmosphere of terror in which the Indians would not dare to fall short of the rubber-collecting quotas.
The egregiousness of Arana’s crimes is most bluntly expressed, though, in a single statistic from Casement’s report: between 1906 and 1911 the Indian population of the Putumayo region declined from 50,000 to 8,000. These deaths were not part of a systematic extermination campaign, but were the products of a deep vein of institutionalised violence symptomatic of colonial subjugation.
“The Devil and Mr Casement” succeeds in bringing the principal players of the story to life in brisk, unadorned prose, and with frequent recourse to historical sources. We cannot help but share Goodman’s obvious admiration for Casement, who had established his humanitarian credentials in 1903 with a report exposing the wholesale abuse of the native population—again, in the name of rubber production—of the Congo Free State under King Leopold II of Belgium. “Wherever he went and whomever he met, Roger Casement rarely failed to make a deep, lasting, highly favourable impression,” Goodman tells us. He quotes a fellow activist, Edmund Morel, recalling his first impressions of Casement: “I saw before me a man, my own height, very lithe and sinewy... A long lean, swarthy Vandyke type of face, graven with power and withal of great gentleness.” Casement emerges as a brave and sensitive campaigner with a strong sense of moral purpose, dogged in his pursuit of Arana, who, having driven out all competition for rubber-production in Iquitos by 1907, had succeeded in “turning the Putumayo region into his personal fiefdom.”
Goodman’s account of these events is commendably clear, but he often presents the story and its characters in reductively simple terms. As the book’s title suggests, Goodman frames Casement’s clash with Arana as a battle between good and evil, between defenders and abusers of human rights, between heartfelt humanitarianism and ruthless capitalism. This is, to an extent, justified, given the enormity of the crimes committed against the native population of Putumayo by the Peruvian Amazon Company in the name of Europe’s ever-increasing demand for rubber.
However, Goodman’s sources betray the murkier moral landscape of the era of high imperialism—the book’s subtitle, “One Man’s Battle for Human Rights in South America’s Heart of Darkness,” makes explicit allusion to Joseph Conrad’s famous novella, especially apt given the fact that Conrad and Casement met in 1889 in the Congo Free State. Casement’s own description of Arana recalls “the unseen presence of victorious corruption” that Marlow senses in Colonel Kurtz. “There is no doubt the brute has courage—a horrid, fearful courage, and endurance, and a cunning mind too... This is an educated man of a sort, who has lived long in London, knows the meanings of his crimes and their true aspect in all civilized eyes.”
The worrying lack of “civilization” in the Putumayo basin crops up repeatedly in Casement’s correspondence and in his 1912 report. Troublingly, though, Casement’s vocabulary goes unremarked upon by Goodman, who appears not to notice that Casement, at least in the early stages of his investigation, did not view Arana’s dealings in the Putumayo in opposition to some universal ethical standard, but to the imperial “mission civilisatrice.” Casement is dismayed, for example, that “there are no civilized authorities in that part of the country,” because it means that Arana’s agents are able to “conquer and subdue the Indian, who is a grown-up child.”
It is important to recognize Casement’s immanence within the imperial system, even as he was enraged by the abuses it engendered, and pointing out this ambivalence would not undermine Casement’s achievement as a campaigner, nor cast doubt on the authenticity of his humanitarian sentiment, but simply illuminate the complexity of his predicament and character. Instead, Goodman misses the opportunity to present Casement’s story as emblematic of the conflicted, traumatized, and transitional consciousness of colonial operators in the early twentieth century. Furthermore, in attributing to Casement an unalloyed concern for “human rights,” Goodman simplifies where he should have complicated: while the Putumayo revelations contributed much to the burgeoning discourse of human rights, the movement would not gain momentum until the Interwar years and beyond, as a product of the agonized transitions to independence made by many former colonies, and, of course, the fallout from the nakedly imperialist ambitions of the Third Reich.
The strength of “The Devil and Mr Casement” lies in the thoroughness of Goodman’s research and his assiduous fidelity to the historical record. But the tension of Goodman’s narrative ultimately slackens under the weight of his facts, which are deployed too densely, and without enough reflection, to make “The Devil and Mr. Casement” as satisfying and challenging as it could—and should—have been.

Hiding in the greenhouse of a lavish apartment on the Upper West Side of New York, the protagonist of “Eight White Nights” sees his life flash before his eyes as he tastes a spicy hors d’oeuvre. This moment appears to be directly inspired by Proust’s episode of the madeleine—in fact, André Aciman’s entire second novel reads like an exercise in bringing a feverish Proustian narrative to twenty-first century Manhattan. This novel, which blurs the boundaries between supermarket romance and literary fiction, mainly relies on Aciman’s ease at spinning together long, hypnotic sentences to fuel the heavily psychological and minimally plot-driven narrative. However, the same characteristics that give Aciman his writerly credentials—his finely tuned cultural references and the delicate register of his artistic understanding—are trivial ornaments that cannot disguise the stagnant quality of the central love story. Though the characters are undoubtedly clever and sardonic, their emotional interplay fails to conjure the feeling of sublimation that Aciman is striving to evoke.
The plot is unabashedly gimmicky, clashing with Aciman’s rhythmic and ornamented sentences. “Eight White Nights” opens with a (heavily repeated) hook—“I am Clara”—with which the main love interest introduces herself. It then breaks into an eight-part narrative, in which each part chronicles a different night that the unnamed narrator spends with Clara. He meets her while lurking behind the tree at a Christmas party and is instantly and fatally drawn towards her. Smart and mean, Clara scintillates with brilliance and bristles with animosity and fragility. She and the protagonist constantly dance around each other as they try unsuccessfully to achieve intimacy.
The bulk of the narrative follows the protagonist and his longings, desires, and solipsistic rants as he yearns after Clara and analyses her every gesture. Though laden with the narrator’s passionate obsession for Clara, “Eight White Nights” chronicles an essentially chaste love. Aciman denies the reader the full range of the sensuous prose that he unquestionably mastered in his first novel, “Call Me By Your Name,” and consequently creates a more emotionally tentative work.
Aciman is attempting to pin down the feeling of imminent loss; the moment of insane delirium one feels while balancing on the edge of a precipice. For Proust, that loss surrounds mortality and the desire to mentally ward it off at all costs; for the narrator, it is simply a question of “lying low” and warding off the cruelty of lovers. Yet the protagonist and Clara, caught in their self-involved and unspectacular web of emotions, are too banal for Aciman’s trick to work, and the protagonist’s dense, slogging thoughts form a thicket of angst that paralyses the narrative. He despairingly thinks, “It occurred to me that rehearsing loss to dull the loss might bring about the very loss I was hoping to avert.” This constant act of stagnant, empty rehearsal is emblematic of the psychological development in the novel—the characters constantly strain towards expression, retracting or repeating statements, but never move towards a new idea or significant development.
The only dynamic motif in “Eight White Nights” is the coded language that the lovers invent in order to communicate with each other. One of Aciman’s more inspired devices, it infuses the relationship between Clara and the protagonist with the warmth and poignancy of two kindred spirits attempting to invent a hermetic universe for themselves. They invent the terms “otherpeoples” and “Shukoffs” in their very first conversation, referring to the mass of boring, unimaginative humans who surround them. Their conversation continues, full of earnest jargon about “trenches,” “lying low,” and “pandangst,” which is supposed to encode their feeling of deep emotional vulnerability. Clara and the narrator escape concrete thoughts and feelings by inventing these hollow terms, constantly side-stepping each other in a never-ending verbal jousting match. Building a universe out of words, secret terms and code phrases is a compelling and imaginative way to portray a love affair. However, when the narrator deploys phrases as ridiculous as ‘Vishnukrishnu Vindalu moment’ with absolute earnestness, the story begins slipping off the emotional precipice on which Aciman wants to balance.
In order to give context to the disembodied desire of his two lovers, Aciman references a bygone European past, but manages to trivialize it by reducing it to a simple, romantic picture of the Old Country. Both Clara and the protagonist come from an Eastern European, Jewish background and move about in a world with scattered references to Dostoevsky, Rilke, Rohmer, St. Petersburg, Bellagio and Byzantium—one that is faded around the edges like a sepia photograph.
Aciman’s shower of allusions is too perfunctory to do justice to the ideas and places he is evoking. The nod to a different cultural context is shallow, but additionally becomes disturbing when Aciman uses metaphors reminiscent of the pain and trauma caused by World War II to describe the main character’s somewhat unconvincing anguish at Clara’s rejection. He morosely declares, “I’ll always hate you for this, for bringing me to the abyss and forcing me to stare down, the way they force a detainee to watch the brutal execution of his cellmate.” His metaphor not only fails spectacularly, but also has troubling ethical and historical implications.
Aciman’s effort in “Eight White Nights” to imitate Proust and constantly dwell within thoughts, metaphors, code-phrases, and imagined scenes of passion is misguided. The prose is feverish and obsessive; though his writing occasionally reaches lyrical heights, the banality of his subjects often overpowers. It particularly raises the question of whether the flowery, (pand)angsty voice of the narrator isn’t just Aciman’s projection of how he believes women want men to think, feel and obsess over them, since there doesn’t appear to be much emotional impetus for the narrator to act on beyond the overwhelming longing and fear he feels for Clara. Ultimately, “Eight White Nights” is too artificial on all its fronts to fulfill Aciman’s ambition of creating an evocative, transcending love story.

Despite its length, its poetic turns and its monumental status, “The Odyssey” follows a simple premise: man departs, man gets lost, man arrives safe and sound at destination.
“The Lost Books of the Odyssey,” Zachary Mason’s mesmerizing new novel, takes Odysseus’s homeward bound journey and riddles it with uncertainty. Ithaca could be the hero’s home or it could be an illusion. Odysseus himself may be the author of his own story; his heroic deeds could be merely his own invention. There’s no one end, no one story. Mason’s tale doesn’t just wander—it writhes.
Mason’s task is a bold one. After all, few read Homer’s “Odyssey” with the nagging feeling that something is missing from the story, and the epic is a touchstone for tales of travel and homecoming. As early as the first century BCE, Vergil was borrowing from the Greek epic to tell his own “Aeneid”; Leopold Bloom’s very different wandering in “Ulysses” set the bar almost impossibly high for modern adaptations. Mason’s book, then, faces its own Scylla and Charybdis—on the one hand, the menace of literary forerunners whose adaptations are now classics themselves; on the other, the possibility of merely echoing a tale already sung.
But Mason is himself a bold writer, and “The Lost Books” moves deftly and confidently out of the realm of adaptation into its own imagined ground. His sentences, brawny and lithe, add their own muscle to Homer’s verse. “When he was drunk, Achilles would take his knife and try to pierce his hand, or, if he was very drunk, his heart, and thereby were the delicate blades of many daggers broken,” he writes of the reckless hero.
Mason’s stories are brief and flavorful. In a short introduction to the book, he presents his vignettes as recently discovered fragments containing alternative versions of “The Odyssey.” One story has Odysseus (here named “Mr. O.”) living in a sanatorium, where he spends his days trying to remember a distant war. Another has him as Agamemnon’s prized assassin, faced with the unfortunate order of killing himself. Sticking with the pretext of fragmentation, Mason never fully fleshes out the action in each tale. As a result, his stories elude simple interpretation.
At times, Mason takes up the epic’s loose ends, giving voice to Homer’s minor characters. The Cyclops, who in Homer’s tale finds himself blinded and beguiled by Odysseus’s wit, tells his own account of the hero’s visit here. As he traces his loss of sight, the Cyclops sheds light on the duplicity of appearance. He says of his offender, “He had not uttered a single true word, of course, but we are all revealed in our lies.”
But mostly the book circles around the craft of truth itself. Mason is a computer scientist by training, and codes and mazes pattern his stories. In one tale, Theseus, famed conqueror of the Minotaur, slays the beast only to wander forever in a labyrinth. In another, sirens seduce Odysseus not through their beautiful tunes, but through the promise of wisdom. “As their songs crescendoed I had the sudden conviction that... behind everything... was a subtle pattern, an order of the most compelling lucidity, but hidden from me, a code I could never crack,” the wily-eyed hero recalls. As Odysseus searches for a definite solution, so too does the reader constantly comb the pages for a nugget of fact.
Critics have aptly compared Mason to the experimental novelist Italo Calvino; the looping path of “The Lost Books of The Odyssey” calls to mind the continual beginnings of Calvino’s “If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler,” and the distorted views of Venice in “Invisible Cities” find their match in Mason’s ever-refracted portrait of Odysseus. Both authors leave the reader with the task of sorting through their sketches. Like Calvino, Mason trades in shadows.
Also like Calvino, Mason prefers puzzles to set truths. For that reason, his novel goes beyond a simple adaptation of a classic text. In his essay “Why Read the Classics?” Calvino once wrote, “A classic is a book which with each rereading offers as much a sense of discovery as the first reading.” Mason’s reimagining takes such discovery to heart. He himself may be aware of the similarities between his and the Italian author’s work. Many of his plot twists recall Calvino’s own piece, “The Odysseys Within ‘The Odyssey,’” which opens by wondering, “How many Odysseys does ‘The Odyssey’ contain?” Mason’s shifting variations seem to ask the same question.
By exploring the source material’s hidden uncertainties, and exploiting their destabilizing potential, Mason both enlivens and enriches the original text. As a collection of stories, “The Lost Books of the Odyssey,” is an entertaining and enthralling read. Placed in dialogue with Homer’s original, it is a nimbly crafted testament to the power of storytelling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the opening scene of “Tampopo,” a man dressed in a white tuxedo and seated in a theater looks into the camera and says, “So you’re at a movie, too. What are you eating?” This line is befitting of ‘Food at Twenty-Four Frames Per Second’ (‘Food at 24fps’), the free film festival which “Tampopo,” an ode to the ramen noodle, opened last Monday in the Adams Pool Theatre. The line is fun, light, and unexpected—and it immediately makes the stomach rumble.
In a time of economic uncertainty, a film festival focused on the pleasures of food might seem to be a luxury. ‘Food at 24fps,’ however, is more than an escape from the necessities of college life. It is a reminder of one of the basic—and sometimes forgotten—joys of existence: the joy of a good meal with friends. By presenting audience members with several films related to food throughout the months of February and March, the organizers of ‘Food at 24fps’ have set out to bring together people of all walks of life, united by their common love for a satisfying meal.
Principal contributors to the festival include Vaughn Y. Tan ’05, currently a Ph.D. student at Harvard Business School; Professor Corky White, an anthropology professor at Boston University and a Japanese studies researcher at Harvard’s Reischauer Institute; Gus E. Rancatore, owner of Toscanini’s Ice Cream; Huan Zhou ’11, a resident of Adams House; and Robert V. Fitzsimmons ’10 of Pforzheimer House.
Before the screening began, Rancatore—owner of Toscanini’s Ice Cream in Central Square and one of the people behind ‘Food at 24fps’—said that the festival would show “movies that we thought other people would like or should see.” Fellow speaker and MIT professor Thomas Levenson added, “Food is a path into all of the concerns that each of the filmmakers might have.”
Rancatore also mentioned that “Tampopo” quickly became a cult hit after its release in the United States in 1987. The film had a long run at the Brattle Theatre, a celebrated independent cinema on Brattle Street in Harvard Square.
“Tampopo,” by Japanese writer-director Juzo Itami, is a meditation not only on the art of cooking and the pleasures of eating, but also on the link between food and sexuality. Throughout “Tampopo,” food itself is treated as a sort of lover. The film examines these themes in a series of vignettes that supplement the main narrative, which follows an inexperienced restaurant owner named Tampopo on her quest to master the art of making the ramen noodle.
“One aim of the movie is to explore the question of the morality of art...through the noodle-making process,” Professor Levenson said in his introduction.
In order to foster discussion about the film, the organizers hosted a reception afterwards where bowls of instant ramen noodles were served. ‘Food at 24fps’ plans to provide themed foods, such as beer and cheese, at upcoming screenings as well.
A number of factors came together to make the festival possible, from the arts initiatives spearheaded by Harvard University President Drew G. Faust to Boston’s growing slow-food culture. In addition, without volunteers, free venues, and the enthusiasm of the organizers, the festival would likely not have happened.
One of these organizers, Professor White, said that she hoped the festival would be fun and not too heavy. Regardless of whether or not the mood of the festival is light, attendees can be sure that their stomachs will be heavy with food after the screenings—a fitting complement to the fare that they saw on the big screen.

I don’t understand football. Not that it hasn’t been explained to me—many times, in fact—but my knowledge of downs and flags and penalties is like a house of cards, obliterated by the mere breeze of a linebacker running past. But my interest in the sport was finally piqued when the Nielsen Company trumpeted Super Bowl XLIV—with its 106.5 million viewers—as the most watched American television broadcast in history, besting the series finale of “M*A*S*H,” which captured 105.97 million viewers in 1983.
Let’s put these numbers into perspective: in the last five years, the World Series has averaged less than 20 million viewers per game. The most recent State of the Union was seen by 48 million, divided amongst 11 networks.
But something’s wrong here. I’m not questioning the accuracy of the Nielsen numbers—I’m questioning the accuracy of the interpretation they invite. We must consider that the television-watching population of the United States is vastly higher than it was in 1983.  “M*A*S*H” won approximately 60% of households, whereas the Colts and Saints took only 45%.
60% is a profound majority. It’s an affront to “M*A*S*H” to toss its crown so casually to a yearly sporting event identified only by a generic Roman numeral. This is a series that won 14 Emmy Awards, and in the decades since it went off the air, has been homaged on everything from “The Simpsons” to “Sesame Street” (and twice in this season of “Community” alone). A few hundred thousand Super Bowl viewers shouldn’t let us devalue the importance of “M*A*S*H” to television history.
“M*A*S*H” took place during the Korean War, following the doctors and soldiers stationed at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in South Korea. A thinly veiled allegory for the Vietnam War, the show pioneered the “dramedy” genre. Its producers were famously among the first to fight against the use of a laugh track. “M*A*S*H” ran on CBS for eleven years, outlasting the Korean War itself by eight years. And given the obstacles faced, it really should’ve been awful.
First was the diluting effect of second-degree adaptation. The franchise first manifested as “MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors,” published by Richard Hooker in 1968. Two years later, Robert Altman’s tremendously well-received film version premiered. Two more years later, and TV’s “M*A*S*H” was born. When I think of a show-based-on-a-movie-based-on-a-book, I don’t imagine a cultural icon.
Plus, 1972 wasn’t exactly a banner year for new American television. It saw the premieres of “Maude,” “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,” and “Sealab 2020”—influential for their time, certainly, but I don’t think you want to order those DVD box sets any more than I do. However, “M*A*S*H” holds up, and beautifully.
Following its initial success, the series faced a seemingly insurmountable problem: unbelievable turnover within the main ensemble. By season four, it had been objectively gutted; two of the three primary characters had departed. Yikes.
Thankfully, what remained was the television show’s greatest asset: Benjamin Franklin “Hawkeye” Pierce, played by Alan Alda. Hawkeye, the camp’s head surgeon, was gently insubordinate, quick-witted, and altogether adorable (Mr. Alda, if you’re reading this, I’m still interested). As the series—and the Vietnam War—progressed, “M*A*S*H” grew increasingly serious in tone, and the character of Hawkeye increasingly liberal.
By portraying the individual’s struggle to cope with the atrocities of combat, the show—as light-hearted as it could be—delivered a profoundly resonant anti-war message. “Goodbye, Farewell and Amen,” the two-and-a-half-hour series finale, was predicated on an event so traumatic as to drive Hawkeye into a mental hospital. In this sense, “M*A*S*H” was radically ahead of its time—“Good Morning Vietnam” was arguably the first Vietnam comedy overtly about Vietnam, and for that release, Touchstone bided its time until 1987.
If there’s a criticism of M*A*S*H worth making, it’s the undercurrent of sexism that sneaks its way into almost every episode.  But before you dismiss the after-hours philandering of Hawkeye and friends as hopelessly retrograde, I’d encourage you to watch the infamous Dodge Charger commercial that aired during this year’s Super Bowl. Reinforcing gender stereotypes is one thing, but doing it by means of mediocre copywriting is unforgivable.
In fairness, the Super Bowl-“M*A*S*H” comparison is intricately complicated. Those of us privileged to watch television in 2010 have many more channels (not to mention the Internet) vying for our attention than was the case in 1983. Yet, I can’t help but feel that the success of the Super Bowl is not a victory for television, at least in the traditional sense; it is a victory for the advertising-industrial complex.
“M*A*S*H” helped to define not only the trajectory of television comedy, but the way our country processed the incomprehensibilities of the war in which it was engaged. I wouldn’t deny anyone their Constitutional rights to buffalo wings and the ritualistic spectacle of rocking halftime shows, but I only ask that you appreciate “M*A*S*H” for what it was: a television show of the finest kind.

February 19-27
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Megan E. O’Keefe ’11
Produced by Michael W. Zellman-Rohrer ’10
Tom Wingfield is no hero, no magician, no businessman. Tom is no writer; he has little save a cigarette. But, what he does have is a story: there was Laura, the painfully shy sister; Amanda, the worried mother; Jim, the gentleman caller; and there was Tom. Tom Wingfield has his memory.
Thus begins Tennessee Williams’ famed four-character play, “The Glass Menagerie,” a touching tale about the struggle to support a fragile family, the disappointments that one encounters in this endeavor, and the difficult decisions one must face when trying to keep these loved ones secure.
“It’s a beautiful, bittersweet story. In its simplicity, it’s more touching—a play about the dynamics between a somewhat overbearing but loving mother and her son and daughter, and their interaction with the appearance of the much-awaited gentleman caller,” director Megan E. O’Keefe ’11 says. “Their problems, when reduced, are just about meeting expectations and failing those expectations. And that is similar to all of us.”
Apart from the dramatic component of the production—led by David J. Smolinsky ’11, who plays Tom—a large-scale sculptural work crafted by Sara J. Stern ’12 will also be incorporated.
“The installation will be composed of clear, hand-sewn acetate animal forms and their shadows, sheer fabric, and plexi. It will also rely heavily on a special lighting design,” Stern says. “I chose to work with shadows because, like shadows, reenacted memories are never the thing itself, and they are only witnessed when captured, such as in the space of a theater or upon the pages of a book.”
O’Keefe intends to reflect faithfully Williams’ nostalgic story, drawing the audience into the Wingfield family’s plight. “We can set up their world and invite the audience into it,” she says. “If we can keep it fresh and spontaneous for [the audience], then we have done our job.”

An illuminated white line bisects the endless black of the Boston University Theatre’s Stewart F. Lane and Bonnie Comley Studio 210. Simple and stark, this white line is the lone scenic element in the Boston Center for American Performance’s minimalist production of Paula Vogel’s “How I Learned to Drive”—yet, any further set would have been needless in this superbly acted, provocative memory play, which runs through Feb. 27.
At times, the line functions as the road on which narrator Li’l Bit (Alicia Hunt) takes driving lessons from her Uncle Peck (Mark Cohen) in 1960s rural Maryland. However, when the relationship between the two quickly turns sexual, the white line suggests more of a boundary—one that should not be traversed. It is reminiscent of one of Li’l Bit’s early encounters with Peck at the age of thirteen, when she tells him, “You’ve got to let me–draw the line. And once it’s drawn, you mustn’t cross it.”
Unfortunately, this line becomes blurred through Li’l Bit’s scattered recollections of moments with her uncle. Sometimes, Li’l Bit seems the helpless prey in Peck’s twisted game of pedophilia and incest; other instances, however, reveal a more complex reciprocated relationship between the two, driven by their mutual outsider tendencies.
The play’s success in examining this complicated relationship and its repercussions, then, hinges on the audience’s ability to empathize—even if only slightly—with Peck. Cohen achieves this with his haunting performance, making the abusive uncle more man than monster. His Peck is undeniably creepy, especially when delivering lines with his slow Southern drawl, but he is also unexpectedly kind and gentle. It is not hard to see why Li’l Bit—often dressed as Peck’s visual counterpart in one of many clever and appealing outfits by costume designer Adrienne Carlile—might have found companionship with this damaged man.
Cohen’s performance is especially moving in a one-sided conversation he delivers recalling an exchange with Li’l Bit’s cousin, Bobby, while teaching him how to fish. While he reassures the unseen boy that it is acceptable for men to cry, Cohen exudes a tenderness that renders him both pathetic and heartbreakingly sad.
As the object of Cohen’s affections, Hunt emanates an intensity and strength that suits the older, jaded Li’l Bit, specifically when she is narrating outside of the action. Hunt’s Li’l Bit is like the ostracized, yet infinitely cool chick that populates every teen movie—she knows more about the painful realities of the world than her frivolous classmates, even though that world-weariness came at a cost. However, when Li’l Bit is at her most vulnerable, Hunt cannot escape the fierceness that steers the rest of her performance. Otherwise poignant scenes are made less so by Hunt’s inability to act weak, distressed, or anxious.
Of the three actors who round out the cast, forming the versatile Greek chorus that morphs into various ensemble roles, Danya Cousins stands out, especially as Li’l Bit’s mother and Aunt Mary. Her increasingly drunken instructions for ladylike alcohol consumption are charming and comical, yet Cousins also delivers one of the most moving monologues of the play as Peck’s distressed wife Mary, counting the days until Li’l Bit leaves home.
Instances like Cousins’ drunken motherly advice highlight the many missed opportunities for dark humor throughout the show. The production’s sometimes-sluggish pace would have benefited from taking advantage of these wittier moments, rather than downplaying them to focus instead on Li’l Bit’s turbulent maturation. Still, director Tara L. Matkosky goes full throttle by the play’s final scenes, ending the show on a powerful, riveting note.
“How I Learned to Drive” is ultimately not about crossing ethical lines, but what happens after they are crossed. Matkosky handles this difficult material deftly, leaving ambiguous the true consequence of the incestuous relationship. Although the line is drawn across the stage, the road is wide open.

Celebrity jazz concerts are often dreary affairs—museums of dusty music where real jazz goes to die. Think of beige nights at Lincoln Center, the players wearing stiff suits, anxious to showcase their cool virtuosity while neglecting to tell a story with their music. By comparison, Thursday’s performance of the Monterey Jazz Festival On Tour at the Berklee Perfomance Center, one of 36 nationwide concerts that will take place from February 5 to May 1, was a pleasant surprise. The show, which featured Kenny Barron on piano, Regina Carter on violin, Kurt Elling on vocals, Russell Malone on guitar, Kiyoshi Kitagawa on bass, and Johnathan Blake on drums, featured a beautiful display of some of the best mainstream jazz musicianship on today’s scene. The concert wasn’t hip, and it certainly didn’t draw the young audience the organizers had hoped for, but the atmosphere was upbeat and the musicians, at their best, swung mean and low.
Carter and Elling produced the most interesting sound of the night as they practically interchanged positions, Carter channeling Billie Holiday’s mournfulness with her violin, Elling mimicking the sound of a trumpet. This was obvious on “When I Grow Too Old To Dream,” a 1935 tune which Elling quickly belted out, as if to get the words over with, then carefully leaned into notes, producing a searing, rich sound like an alto saxophone. Carter, on the other hand, rollicked over her melody with a slight glissando. At the same time, her raw, grainy sound evoked the subtle sadness and melodic cry of the human voice, which provided a nice counterpoint to Elling’s precise pitch placement.
Carter’s duet with Barron to “Georgia on My Mind” was one of the high points of the evening. They began with tense, elastic pauses, counterpointed by Barron’s minimalist stride piano underpinning. Carter emerged pure and sonorous, producing a cascading arpeggio of longing notes that caressed the classic tune. Barron interspersed her melody with clear notes, striking the keys to produce an insistent urgency. Barron and Carter weren’t so much in synthesis as symbiosis, each thoughtfully responding to the other in a manner that gripped the entire audience.
Barron himself led an ensemble within an ensemble, performing an original composition, “New York Attitude,” with Kitagawa and Blake. It was pure, muscular, sparkling, straight-ahead jazz—Blake shone throughout the night, but here he produced an especially lively, just ahead-of-the-beat, sound interspersed with snapping rolls and cymbal brushes that propelled the frenetic tune along. Kitagawa, with his calm demeanor and walrus mustache, evoked a Mingus-like sprightliness in his bass playing, switching between slow and fast in a messed-up blues solo. Barron himself remained a steadfast leader throughout, grounding the trio with bluesy riffs and rippling over the higher range of notes in a frenzy.
It wasn’t until his solo piece that Malone fully showed what he was capable of, performing an Alex North tune that perfectly showcased his limpid sound reminiscent of Grant Green, coupled with evocative acoustic guitar skills. Throughout the evening, he steeped the ensemble in 1960s soul jazz chords, but here his gentle, rippling notes hit a new mode. He played with a precise poignancy, spinning out an all-encompassing sound that mesmerized by itself, but otherwise delicately underscored the ensemble’s playing. However, he never completely came into his own on other pieces, oscillating otherwise between soul jazz and more straight-ahead playing without hitting the sweet spots of either modes.
Elling, a lounge lizard with a pink pocket handkerchief and slicked-back hair, unquestionably played the role of entertainer and host throughout the night. He makes a point of arranging poems to transcribed musical improvisations, and he did not disappoint with a version of Robert Pinsky’s “The Broken City” set to Wayne Shorter’s haunting “They Speak No Evil.” His voice, a piercing jet of sound, flew over the jagged melodics, weaving them into a blindingly rapid melody, as Malone and Barron easily grounded him in a modal swing. On the other hand, his rendition of the 13th century mystical poet Rumi’s “I Like The Sunrise,” set to a Von Freeman sax solo, told a melodic story in which his voice fully rounded out, replicating the searing, insistent quality of repeated notes on a saxophone.
With such a group of stellar musicians, the Monterey Jazz Festival On Tour is a clear recipe for success—instead of throwing together a few virtuosic performers with overinflated egos, it showcases a clear model for interactive, thoughtful and creative jazz. Though the concert was rather safe, with a ‘high art’ undertone that went against the grain of the music itself, the interplay between the musicians was inspiring and fresh, providing hope for big jazz concerts to come. Let’s hope they swing this hard the next time around.

Peter Cook stood on the center of the stage, the audience circled around him. He pointed to the left side of the room and twenty pairs of arms immediately went up in the air. He pointed to the right side of the room and twenty other pairs of arms flew up. While it might not be obvious to the casual passerby, the audience members were tossing an invisible beach ball across the room under Cook’s direction.
This one exercise in channeling a person’s imagination, however, was just the beginning. Cook proceeded to entertain the audience for the next hour and a half with animated personal stories about his first kiss, his time at school, and his American Sign Language students, among other anecdotes—all without saying a single word.
Cook, a prominent deaf storyteller-poet, performed at the Agassiz Theatre on February 12 to close out Harvard College’s “Deaf Awareness Week.” Coordinated by the Committee on Deaf Awareness (CODA), the event aimed at “promoting and understanding the deaf community.”
”It is a really important life lesson to meet people from different backgrounds,” said West A. Resendes ’12, the director of CODA. “The deaf community is relatively unknown. But the unique experiences of deaf people should be shared with everyone.”
The various events, which took place February 8-12, included a lecture by deaf politician Kevin Nolan, a panel discussion entitled “Growing Up Deaf,” and a social “Snack n’ Sign” event in Ticknor lounge. According to Resendes, Cook’s performance, was the “anchor” to these string of programs.
“People will come for Peter Cook,” Resendes said. “In the deaf community, he is the man.”
Cook’s act did provide a unique glimpse into the deaf community and culture. His stories, such as one about learning how to dance, provided interesting insight into the lives of deaf people.
“People don’t know that deaf people can dance,” Cook signed during his performance.
Using a mixture of facial expressions, gestures, and ASL, which was interpreted for non-ASL speakers, he amused the audience with descriptions of his gym teacher pounding a large stick on the ground so he and the other deaf students could feel the beats of the music. As his story showed, deaf people can dance; they just have to do it in different ways, whether it involves using their pulse to detect the rhythm of the music or feeling the pounding beat with the aid of an overly enthusiastic gym teacher.
For non-ASL speakers, the performance itself was interesting in its own right. For once the tables had turned, as they were now the ones who depended on the interpreter to understand what was being said. At times, this was difficult. When the room would shake with laughter and applause, the punch line of the joke would often disappear in the wake of the noise, leaving non ASL speakers at a loss.
While at one point in the show Cook assured his audience that his act would be “a very visual story,” some audience members still found it difficult to follow along with the action. For example, one little boy sitting in the back row would repeatedly ask his mother in a loud whisper to explain what was going on.
“You have to use your eyes,” she said. “Use your eyes to see the story.”
Cook touched upon this idea of adjustment with his last anecdote, a sad story about his second kiss. He explained how a girl he liked as a kid turned him down because, as she said, they “couldn’t communicate.”
But what Cook successfully points out is that there are many ways to communicate, and the problem only arises when a person is not willing to make the necessary effort to adapt.
“It takes two to tango,” he signed.
After all, Cook himself has adapted the art of storytelling for deaf audiences. The stories he tells does not become imbued with life through the way he speaks but with the way he moves.
“The beauty of Peter Cook is his ability to capture emotions… [he is] able to express them in a way that is unspoken, but is still accessible to everyone,” Resendes said.

“Eyelid Movies” is driven by simple, catchy parts—each enjoyable on its own terms—thoughtfully layered together to produce a truly impressive debut album. Electro-rock band Phantogram, hailing from Saratoga Springs, NY, is comprised of Josh Carter on guitar and Sarah Barthel on keyboard. Though dominated by its singles, “Eyelid Movies” still manages to present a satisfying introduction to the up-and-coming duo.
The album starts off strongly with the group’s two previously-released singles, “Mouthful of Diamonds” and “When I’m Small;” by far the two best songs on the record. The former flaunts an orca-esque squeal and is driven by a warm, droning synthesized bass line that, when isolated at the beginning of the verse, creates a beautifully hazy atmosphere. “When I’m Small” follows, sounding like a less dramatic or soul-infused Portishead cut. Though somewhat rhythmically monotonous, the song is carried by the strong, pulsing bass line and Barthel’s excellent vocal performance.
The placing of these two songs at the beginning of the album gives “Eyelid Movies” a thrilling opening, and does an effective job of introducing what’s to come. Carter’s sleek, overlapping guitar lines on “Mouthful of Diamonds” are repeated many times throughout the LP. It seems as though he barely strums a whole chord, but his finger patterns are always effective and atmospheric. Barthel’s “oohs,” which first appear on  “When I’m Small” are repeated on many other songs, injecting life into some of the record’s less engaging moments.
Some of the depth of “Eyelid Movies” comes from Phantogram’s rather transparent attempt to roughen up their songs through the use of lo-fi production elements. On “When I’m Small,” background crackling makes it sound as though the song is being played on a cheap vinyl record player. This attempt to avoid the crystal clarity of electro pop and set Phantogram apart from similar groups like Postal Service makes the album less accessible than it might have been. It does, however, succeed in livening up the album’s repetitive beats and melodies, which otherwise could become rather sterile and bland.
Though the second half of the album is clearly no match for the opening, it does contain some gems. “Running From the Cops” has Carter singing through garbling effects similar to those found on Aphex Twin songs. Though these effects can be grating, they do add some variety to the vocals in their oddity. “You Are the Ocean” is the only track with Carter on lead vocals that truly succeeds in being an emotional and catchy tune, proving he can be an effective lead singer, not just a guy playing around with production gimmicks.
“As Far As I Can See” is probably the most interesting track on the later portion of the album. The beat, which sounds like something J Dilla might have put together, draws heavily on samples and chopped vocals. It would be incorrect to say Barthel sings over this track, as it really feels like her voice is incorporated into the beat. The lyrics are ambiguous yet clearly melancholy, with Barthel, declaring, “As far as I can see / Nobody loves me / As far as I can tell / Nobody loves you with her.” These lines are somewhat representative of those on the whole album. At no point are the lyrics particularly substantial, but they do at least usually depict vague sentiments of love, loss, tension, and frustration, while rarely remaining grammatically coherent for longer than a line or two.
The best features to be found on “Eyelid Movies” are the bass lines and Barthel’s vocals. Carter’s guitar playing also occasionally shines, particularly on the album’s quieter songs. The album’s lyrics, while only hooking the listener occasionally, certainly do not hurt any of the songs. This neutrality is as much as the record needs, as its other aspects provide plenty of highlights. Although not remaining stellar throughout, this album provides a great overview of what Phantogram are capable of accomplishing. Based on its singles alone, “Eyelid Movies” is a considerable success, and the quality of the record as a whole shows that more can be expected from these two in the future.

Field Music is a band striving for reinvention. After a self-imposed three-year hiatus, the group has returned with new members and a new sound for their latest album, “Field Music (Measure).” Afraid of boxing themselves into an indie pop corner, Field Music has taken their new record as an opportunity to explore a wider range of style and sound. While the effort to diversify certainly helps develop a degree of ingenuity and surprise, the album’s almost schizophrenic nature is at times confusing and strangely unsatisfying, despite its undeniable musical complexity.
With the 2005 release of their self-titled debut album, Sunderland, England’s Field Music instantly drew comparisons to their townmates the Futureheads, as well as bands from further afield like the New Pornographers. That record’s success was piggybacked by the group’s sophomore effort, “Tones of Town,” in 2007. Characterized by their harmonic arrangements and melodic, hooky arrangements, Field Music gained early praise as having the potential to become one of the decade’s best indie pop bands.
After keyboardist Andrew Moore left the band, the remaining members, brothers Peter and David Brewis, were joined by Kevin Dosdale and Ian Black to record the group’s third album. This change in personnel may be the cause of this record’s shift from the group’s earlier work. Angry, angsty, and attempting to avoid categorization, “Measure” is a 20 track album defined as heavily by its amorphous style and musical outbursts as its invention or ingenuity.
The attempt to incorporate new sounds and avoid being pigeonholed as an indie pop band can be seen from the album’s very beginning. “In the Mirror” opens the album with heavy synth overlays which compete with a clear melody and upbeat harmonies. The song’s defining musical conflict—between rock and indie pop—is exemplary of a trend that pervades the album. Fittingly, and perhaps with a twist of irony, the song whines, “I wish I could change and make new rules / And love myself better.”
“Measure”, the album’s fourth track, incorporates a hefty string section into a complex, upbeat and rhythmic song, whose simple, harmonic vocal arrangements seem to channel the Beach Boys. Choppy strings and a prevalent rhythm section give the track a uniquely clean and peppy feel, making it one of the album’s most enjoyable tracks.
By contrast, “First Comes the Wish,” the album’s 15th track, is defined by heavy guitar riffs, haunting vocals, and synthesized bells. It marks a stark departure from the upbeat but restrained music that defined Field Music’s earlier career, while standing out from the rest of the album with its rock-oriented directness.
In yet another vein, the down-tempo, almost ballad-like “Curves of the Needle” surprises listeners with its dark, powerful, and harmonic vocal arrangements and simple keyboard parts. The generally morose feel—“Oh, to be young again / To be loved again”—is occasionally energized by spurts of heavy rock where the song’s emotion truly bursts out. The album’s most striking song, its intensity provides a peak for the album’s emotional span.
The record concludes with the overlong but fittingly detailed “It’s About Time.” Here, the strings, keyboard, guitar, and vocals all blend together to form a suitably dramatic ending to an eclectic album, although it’s questionable whether the song really needs ten minutes to achieve this.
Though “Measure” is full of complex, catchy tracks, each offering a slightly different twist on an old indie pop sound, as a whole the album falls short in its inability to unite such disparate songs into a satisfying record. At over an hour in length, “Measure” struggles to remain cohesive. The band’s decision to explore and indulge all of their musical interests prevents Field Music from putting together what could have been a great record. Nevertheless, the group’s raw talent and invention will certainly identify and define the group amidst its indie pop peers.

Devonté Hynes can best be described as a dabbler. His upbringing shows signs of it: Hynes was born in Texas, raised in England and now lives in New York City. Within his artistic career it’s even more apparent. Hynes, also known as “Lightspeed Champion,” a name culled from a series of comic strips he once drew, has performed in just about every genre of music imaginable. His last group, Test Icicles, performed a combination of dance and punk, but now he performs his own blend of folk and indie rock, along with occasionally random sidesteps like an album entirely devoted exclusively to Green Day covers.
This variety makes Hynes’ newest album, “Life is Sweet! Nice to Meet You,” difficult to classify. It is too emotionally charged to be relaxed, but too relaxed to be emotionally moving. Hynes has settled down from the first Lightspeed Champion album, 2008’s “Falling off Lavender Bridge,” in which quiet and underwhelming music masked angry self-loathing lyrics. However, “Life is Sweet! Nice to Meet You” is a confused record. It is comprised of angry break-up ballads and swelling choruses interspersed with gentler piano sonatas and strummed ukuleles. The album’s lyrics are often predictably regular, which is disappointing given the innovative songwriting.
The musical variety is the greatest strength of “Life is Sweet! Nice to Meet You.” No two tracks sound even vaguely similar and this serves to liven up a lyrically simple album. When this music isn’t enough to carry the song, though, the lyrics are too thin to pick up the burden, and the track quickly falls flat. Most choruses are excessively simple—eight or nine word phrases that are repeated over and over again for the length of time necessary between equally short verses.
The best tracks are those where the musical background is sufficiently engaging. In track three, “There’s Something Underwater,” Hynes enters with ukulele chords, leading into a swelling chorus that feels hymnal, reminiscent of an epic Sufjan Stevens’s song. It’s a simple composition, and while the lyrics are as predictable as on the rest of the album—Hynes seems to be striving the use the phrase “I miss you” a record number of times for a four minute song—it is a thoroughly enjoyable slice of nostalgia nonetheless.
Following on from this is “Intermission,” 39 seconds of unconnected, vaguely musical noises, which somehow work within the structure of the album. There is so much variety within the musical styles that this diversion seems appropriate, showcasing yet another side of Hynes’ musical smorgasbord.
On the fifth track, “Faculty of Tears” Hynes brings in yet another delightful instrumental element with the appearance of a violin, plucked lightly under the otherwise a capella chorus and sweeping above the verses. Mixed together with the otherwise simple percussion and guitar background, the violin elevates the track, making the final instrumental minute and a half just as enjoyable as the rest of the song.
By contrast, “Madame Van Damme” lacks any of this musical intrigue, and without it the focus falls on the lyrics. The chorus of “Kill me baby / Won’t you kill me,” is somewhat charming at first, but when it is repeated for the final 55 seconds, it loses its resonance and feels trite.
This failing is also apparent on “The Big Guns of Highsmith,” a track whose chorus is the confused, and eventually annoying “Hurts to be the one who’s always feeling sad / Oh just stop complaining, Oh just stop complaining.” Left alone with nothing but a bare piano accompaniment, the lyrics feel whiney and self-indulgent instead of meaningful.
One of the final songs, the instrumental “Etude Op. 3,” reiterates how Hynes’ talent for creating exciting and highly detailed melodies is the key to the album’s success. Fluttering higher scales are transposed over nostalgic lower chords reminiscent of spring days, a testament to the beauty Hynes’s music can achieve when left alone, with no lyrics to distract from its elegance.
“Life is Sweet! Nice to Meet You” is an enjoyable album with moments of true elegance and beauty. The instrumental numbers—which comprize four out of the 15 tracks—are all lovely, and when Hynes focuses on this aspect of his music, the album is exceptional. Unfortunately, when the instrumental innovation falls away, the lyrics rarely have the depth or character to engage, and Lightspeed Champion sadly slips into the shadows.

“I’ve lost the use of my heart / But I’m still alive,” sings Sade Adu on the titular track from “Soldier of Love,” Sade’s first album since 2000. For an impressively constructed album based on and made for “love,” this line seems more of a curious apology from the band than a testament to love from a wayward lover.
Impressively, Sade have managed to generate ten new song titles, which is seven more than there are distinguishable songs on the album. Most tracks on “Soldier of Love” hit the same low-tempo, somniferous groove that repeats until it stops, briefly, as if for convention’s sake, and then resumes in another key. The rhythm section, the core of any decent R&B group, sounds too often like the drum and bass GarageBand loops characterized by seamless, emotionally-bereft rhythmic accuracy and a robotic inability to feel—it’s hard to imagine human beings creating this record. This is particularly problematic seeing as “Soldier of Love” eschews pure electronica and trip-hop for more traditional instrumentation—guitar, piano, drums and bass are at the heart of the record—which would intuitively present a more natural and human presence. This lack of feeling is not helped by the fact that Sade write obvious, vacuous shells of songs and then attempt to save them through intricate production which, while impressive, only serves to increase the emotional divide between the band and the listener.
Despite this, however, the production is the album’s most interesting element, creating rich arrangements that almost prevent the songs from becoming overly repetitive. The title track is the most impressive production feat: instruments cut in and out with a staccato aggression and Adu’s overdubbed voice hits multiple registers, weaving a tapestry of interlocking vocal snippets that drive the song’s dynamics from the arid determination of the opening to the rising chorus of wandering lovers. Distorted guitars and synthesizers howl like frigid winds through the track, slicing Adu’s distant vocals and keeping the song from becoming repetitive.
Adu has a uniquely withdrawn yet powerful vocal style. Unfortunately, many of the songs are so mindlessly bland that it is easy to mistake her tasteful emoting for unfeeling coldness. “Morning Bird” is one of the few tracks which highlights and supports her unique vocals. The song traces a staggering piano figure down the sinewy and reserved melodic fragments that Adu shakes down with melancholic elegance. Here, her lack of obvious emoting benefits the song and her voice sounds more powerful than on most. The percussion is minimal—a tambourine shivering over the steady heartbeat of a kick drum. However, on most of the album’s tracks, particularly “Long Hard Road,” and “Bring Me Home,” the production isn’t enough to compensate for the weak songwriting and over-processed instruments, and the listener is left with an unoriginal track that feels vacuous and forced. Adu’s nuanced vocal performance seems, in the context of these songs, emotionless and bored.
“Be That Easy”— which ironically may be the best song on “Soldier of Love”—reveals the album’s deepest flaw.  Despite an improvement in dynamic songwriting, the overly processed instruments and production which, in context of the stronger songwriting, is overbearing, keep the song from reaching the emotional peaks for which it aspires. A smoky upright bass pattern lightly supports the Sunday-afternoon strumming of the laconic acoustic and the waves of organ that sweep through the wide-open spaces of the song like wind in fields of grain. Adu pulls off some memorable melodies, making use of her powerful and malleable voice, but the track somehow feels distant and merely pleasant. The instruments still sound prepackaged and the chord changes, while effective, remain obvious. The production, though nearly flawless, places more of an emotional divide between the band and the listener than there should be on what could have been such a relatable song.
The unoriginality of the songwriting is not enough to fully account for the shortcomings of “Soldier of Love.” The album is an impressive study in subtle vocal performances and multi-layered production. However, Sade’s most heinous shortcoming is their surgical extraction of almost all the soul from music that, if nothing else, should be powered by emotion, no matter how trite. On “Babyfather,” Adu sings, “So love, they say, makes you feel this way.” In the cold context of the album, the line sounds uncertain and second-hand. It seems as if Sade is attempting to hedge their bets with unfeelingly vague definitions of love and safely dulled versions of love songs, but, even in a digital age, these mechanically executed tracks don’t quite cut it.

At a cursory glance, “Falling Down A Mountain,” the eighth LP from British group Tindersticks, seems to embody the helplessness its title evokes. Track titles like “Piano Music,” “Harmony Around My Table” and “Peanuts” imply an almost diminutive cuteness; frontman Stuart Staples’ baritone warblings often tremble with a mix of emotion and uncertainty, as if he’s on the verge of tears but isn’t sure why; and the minimalistic piano melodies often hesitate just enough to be charmingly off-beat. Yet, after a thorough listening, Tindersticks prove to be fully in control. “Falling Down A Mountain” is a delightful album, impressive in its eclecticism, accessibility, and innovation.
“Falling Down A Mountain” opens with the title track, immediately introducing the multi-layered, complex arrangements which characterize the album’s best songs. Subversive bass lines, syncopated drum beats and a tambourine lay down a solid foundation upon which wild trumpet riffs and trippy synths soon take over, creating an alternately jazzy, new-age feel. Stuart Staples’ oft-commanding vocals seem to politely refrain from overpowering the melodies, neatly weaving themselves into intricate tapestry of disparate sounds. An engaging prelude to the rest of the album, the title track exemplifies what makes the best songs on the record successful: the many layers of Tindersticks’ instrumental elements merge into a unified whole which eludes any all-purpose labels.
Several other pieces, such as “She Rode Me Down,” follow in the title track’s motley footsteps. Sharp winds and crashes of a thunderstorm give way to flamenco guitar strumming and maracas, mixing with the quirky tinkle of a glockenspiel, hand claps and a spirited jazz flute. The somber growling of a cello intimates the lyrics Staples croons (“She rode me like a storm / Like a soaking brooding storm”), while the clear, brassy peals of the horn section end the track on a vigorous note. It’s easy to ignore the significant compositional skill required for such a seamless blend of disparate parts, but a careful listening reveals the group’s subtle musical craftsmanship.
While most of the album is immediately likeable, the few songs which do fall flat tumble headfirst. Track two, “Keep You Beautiful,” is a disappointing departure from the more audacious tracks. The weak drum beats and timid, painfully repetitive guitar loops invoke a stupor perhaps appropriate to some hazy, dim-lit lounge, but they fail to sustain the energy of the opener. “Keep You Beautiful” also lacks the diversity of the album’s better tracks; while a vibraphone and triangle rescue it from complete monotony, the song pales in comparison to the assortment of musical morsels available elsewhere on the album.
“Peanuts,” the fourth track, vacillates between minimalism and complexity, epitomizing how “Falling Down A Mountain” fares best when Tindersticks employ more, rather than fewer, of the elements at their disposal. Female vocals provide a pleasing contrast with Staples’ unmistakable baritone, as do the piano and loose, bluesy guitar, but the bare aesthetic risks alienating fans of the band’s multi-instrumentalist approach. Thankfully, synths, strings and horns come to the rescue halfway through, filling out the song’s meager build and preventing it from going the tedious way of “Keep You Beautiful.”
Despite such somewhat flawed experiments, “Falling Down A Mountain” contains many songs that will appease long-time fans. The notable “Harmony Around My Table” boasts toe-tapping drum beats and a sportive tambourine, providing solid accompaniment to jaunty piano reminiscent of Belle and Sebastian. Vibraphone and hand claps, as well as the background “doo-wops” and “la-la-las,” imbue the song with genuine charm. It doesn’t quite match the innovation of the more experimental tracks, but it does prove a memorable addition to Tindersticks’ vast repertoire.
“Falling Down A Mountain” consolidates Tindersticks’ rightful place as one of the most talented groups in British indie music. Rife with romantic orchestrations, intrepid percussion, daring experimentation and the quavering lilt of Stuart Staples, the album challenges the band’s status quo while continuing to produce songs that could fit on any of their previous albums. “Falling Down A Mountain” demonstrates one more commendable stage in the band’s evolution, proving that Tindersticks, far from plummeting, have ascended to the peak of musical maturity with only a few stumbles along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Artists are often perceived as reclusive, resentful of society, so adamant about their privacy that the public becomes all the more interested in violating it. They may even be seen as egocentric or possessed by a monomaniacal devotion to their work. The archetype can be justified; some artists flaunt their lack of regard for what their fans think of them, for instance. Anyone who has attended a Bob Dylan concert, for example, knows that he changes the rhythm of his delivery to frustrate audience members audacious enough to sing along.
Yet the artist still begs a reception, and can involve himself deeply in the social and political issues of the public world. Instead of alienating audiences, performers can attract and unite audiences in emotional empathy. In the wake of January’s catastrophic earthquake in Haiti, artists from the Harvard community seem to follow this last tradition. Poets and performers alike are banding together to raise money and awareness by inspiring audiences to understand the scale of the Haitian tragedy, and to empathize with the people affected by it.
On February 23, for example, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers (HUCTW) will co-host an event called “Poets for Haiti” in association with Lamont Library’s Woodberry Poetry Room. The event, which will feature former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky among others, will take place at Longfellow Hall at 7:30 PM. “Poets for Haiti” is just one in a string of events around campus raising funds for the Haitian earthquake victims.
Last Friday evening, too, artists as diverse as the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, the Harvard Caribbean Dance Team, and the Harvard Glee Club gathered in Sanders Theatre for the “Harvard for Haiti” benefit concert. The event, whose proceeds were given to Partners in Health (PIH), also featured a slate of speakers including PIH Executive Director Ophelia Dahl. Last Saturday, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club also made their contribution to the fund-raising effort by collecting donations at a benefit performance held in the Loeb Experimental Theater.
Outside of these benefit performances, other Harvard artists are donating ticket sales to assist the victims of the Haiti earthquake. Two of the a capella groups on campus, the Harvard LowKeys and the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, donated 15% of their earnings from last Saturday’s “Frankly My Dear, I Don’t Give a Jam” concert to PIH. From the 6th to the 11th of February, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals also decided to contribute 25% of their proceeds from group discount tickets to Harvard for Haiti. However, Producer Stephen L. Rola ’11 is disappointed by the lack of participation. “Unfortunately for the first three shows, people haven’t really taken advantage,” he said.
A CONCERTED EFFORT
Certainly, these performances have other goals besides raking in cash; providing an entertaining program for the audience is an obvious example. While performers alone may not define success in commercial terms, the main measure of a benefit concert is the dollar amount on the check they send to charity. Thus, a great deal of the energy expended in organizing such concerts is devoted to maximizing profit.
In order to maximize profit, coordinators must minimize costs. Unless the organizers of a benefit can find subsidy money for an event, production costs will subtract from the proceeds they send to charity. Particularly with a large-scale event like “Harvard for Haiti,” these costs are quite significant. Fortunately, the costs of the concert were covered by the University in conjunction with the Office for the Arts. In addition, the performers at the benefit concert worked pro bono. Of course, this is to be expected—every dollar that goes to a performer is a dollar that does not go to charity. However, the effort involved in performing at the benefit is substantial; groups with upwards of eighty members gathered on short notice to learn new music.
Equally as important to maximizing net income is, of course, maximizing the proceeds. One way to do this is through advertising. For instance, in the run-up to the “Harvard for Haiti Benefit Concert,” publicity utilized digital avenues like Facebook, the “Harvard for Haiti” website, and email lists. Information about the benefit was also reported in the Harvard Gazette and on bulletin boards all over campus.
Poets for Haiti’s publicity strategy mirrors that of the Harvard for Haiti benefit. Internet marketing can effectively target specific groups and, according to Jim Henle, a poet and co-organizer of the event, much of the Poets for Haiti publicity is transmitted via email sent over various lists in the poetry community. Henle added that, like the Harvard for Haiti Benefit Concert, information was also distributed through local newspapers and flyers.
Other groups are content to rely primarily on good old-fashioned word of mouth. HRDC Publicity Coordinator Isabel Q. Carey ’12 said, “I want the performers to come from as diverse a population in the arts community as possible, so that they will draw as many diverse friend groups as possible within the arts community.” Thus the construction of the program can be a form of publicity itself.
However, making people aware of an event isn’t enough. There is also the matter of getting the audience to lighten its collective wallet for a good cause.
The HRDC benefit did not charge at the door of the Loeb Ex; the association wanted to continue the venue’s tradition of free admission. The benefit, therefore, depended entirely on the good will of its audience members. The suggested donation was five dollars. Likewise, admission to the Poets for Haiti event is free with a requested donation of ten dollars.
For the “Harvard for Haiti Benefit Concert,” audience members did have to pay to get in. However, that wasn’t the only source of income for the event. B.A. Sillah ’12, a member of the Harvard Glee Club and executive producer of last Friday’s benefit, said, “There’s a set ticket price. We’re also selling t-shirts that [the Harvard] COOP and the President’s Office donated, and on top of that, we are just asking people to donate.” The benefit concert was also broadcast online at the Harvard for Haiti website, allowing those who missed the concert a chance to share in the experience and donate as they wished.
COMPASSION THROUGH CULTURE
Asking for donations and selling merchandise may be quick money-making strategies, but the lasting impact of an artistic performance can add something else to a fundraising enterprise.
Sillah said of the organizers of the benefit concert, “We were thinking overall that since there’s so much artistic talent at Harvard, [the arts are] a good way to engage the entire community.” Selling merchandise may be one way to raise funds, but one can buy a t-shirt alone. “Harvard for Haiti” filled Sanders Theatre as successfully as the convocation for the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’54, or the first lecture of the popular course Moral Reasoning 22: Justice.
Vicki E. Yeh ’12, the Kuumba Singers’ Director of Publicity, feels that art can inculcate compassionate altriusm in audiences. “You put on a t-shirt and you forget about it, but I feel art is really in the moment. You have to actually be there to experience it, and hopefully it’ll leave a lasting impression on those who attend, [and] you’ll continue to keep on giving.”
To this end, last Friday’s “Harvard for Haiti Benefit” was framed by speeches on the tragic recent events. Sebastian Velez, Assistant Resident Dean of Kirkland House, closed his speech with a quote from photographer Sebastiao Salgado: “How can we claim ‘compassion fatigue’ when we show no sign of consumption fatigue?” he said. The sentiment that we who are lucky should share our good fortune ran through the event. One particularly resonant image from the PIH slide show featured at the concert was a child amputee in a wheelbarrow, being pushed through the streets of Port-Au-Prince by a more fortunate Haitian man.
The event also emphasized the brutality of the earthquake’s aftermath. The slideshow was a stream of shocking pictures of earthquake victims. In one picture, a Haitian teenager lay on a thin blanket weighed down by large rocks in a makeshift hospital for the wounded; in another, a street was flooded waist-deep with bodies of the dead pushed aside to make room for cars. PIH made the suffering of Haitian earthquake victims manifest, and immediate, in order to inspire empathy.
But the focus of the benefit was not solely on grim realities. Though some pieces were not derived from the Haitian culture per se, the performers’ passion conveyed a profound sense of community with the people of Haiti. One of the most virtuosic displays by Ryu Goto ‘11 was a violin solo so ferocious that hairs from his bow broke off while he was playing.
Other performances, like The Drummers of the Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble’s “Drum Call,” were directly influenced by Haitian art. In one thrilling performance, Sidi M. Camara paced back and forth across the stage while he drummed with inexhaustible charisma. The piece was a medley of vigorous Haitian rhythms, displaying the vitality of Haitian culture. While watching the performance, one got the irrepressible feeling that the energy that animates Haitian culture is still alive and well. Edwidge Danticat, as quoted by Dean Evelyn M. Hammonds, said of the Haitian people, “We are ill-favored, but we still endure. Every once in a while, we must scream this as far as the wind can carry our voices: we are ugly, but we are here! And here to stay.”
As Yeh had hoped, the event bolstered not only the sense in the audience that something must be done, but that much can be done. Put differently in an email from the Haitian Artists Assembly of Massachusetts Co-Director Charlot J. Lucien, “the authenticity and the emotion these works carry will help people around the world connect with Haitians as people, with their culture, and ultimately through this culture, engage Haitian friends in the rebuilding of Haiti for the long term.”
TO EASE THE PAIN OF THE LIVING
There remains, however, the issue of whether the reclusive or selfish impulses associated with artistry create a tension within those who perform at these public benefits. Sillah said that what truly mattered was the artists’ desire to thank the world that supports them: “we’re doing this because we know this is a good cause and this is our way of giving back.”
Poets for Haiti co-organizer Jim Henle said that, while it is unusual for typically solitary poets to make public appearances, it should happen more often. “I think it’s a good thing for the poetry community to think of itself as having a public face. We can play a role in helping people, in galvanizing sentiment, even action, around the world,” he said.
Henle identifies with a poetic tradition reaching from Walt Whitman’s concern with the Civil War to Allen Ginsberg protests during the Vietnam War. It is all the clearer now that the Harvard arts community too identifies with the artistic tradition in which these poets are situated, a tradition of involved artists who could take as their motto these words of compatriot Allen Ginsberg: “I’ll do the work—and what’s the Work? To ease the pain of living/ Everything else, drunken dumbshow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week alone, both Lowell House and Winthrop House instituted new dining restrictions that border on cruel and unusual. With the institution of these new rules, seven of Harvard’s 12 Houses—interestingly enough, the seven most conveniently located ones—now enforce dining restrictions in some capacity, a trend that should trouble Quadlings and River residents alike.
During lunch, dinner (up until seven o’clock), and Sunday brunch, a guest may only eat in Winthrop if accompanied by a resident; in Lowell, the same rule applies, except that dinner restrictions lift 15 minutes earlier and there are no rules on Saturdays.
While we certainly understand that students have the right to eat in their own Houses, we feel that discrimination against those upperclassmen living farther away from Harvard   Square outweighs the relatively minor inconvenience of a crowded d-hall. Since many students in Mather, Dunster, and the Quad work and study in the immediate vicinity of the Yard each day, they should be able to eat where they choose. Restrictions pose a problem partly because they create a vicious cycle: As soon as one House restricts, others become overcrowded and begin to follow suit. Soon enough, a Cabot resident must wander through the frozen Cambridge streets facing rejection after rejection. To avoid this, no restrictions whatsoever should complicate where Upperclassmen take their meals, save that they continue to remain out of Annenberg.
Quite frankly, Harvard  College is not a plural noun. It is a single community, not the sum total of 12 independent institutions that happen to be located in the same zip code. Enforcing restrictions, including but not limited to the new policies at Lowell and Winthrop, only serves to fracture the College into House units—distinctions randomly assigned in freshman spring that should determine only a student’s address, not the quality of his or her overall Harvard experience. While House pride can add a positive dimension to the undergraduate experience, it should derive from more than just exclusionary dining policies.
With regard to freshman dining restrictions, we support the College’s efforts to cultivate “freshman community” within the larger campus. Still, we believe that freshmen should be allowed to eat outside of Annenberg in those Houses not immediately adjacent to the Yard. While opening Adams or Quincy to freshmen would undeniably encourage many first-year students to abandon the ’Berg, decreasing potential meal-time bonding, they should still be able to eat in some Upperclassmen dining halls in order to participate in student organizations and get a taste of what life will be like after the Yard.
Clearly, the presence of multiple athletic teams in certain River dining halls has contributed to the perceived need for restrictions. Although we recognize the importance of a shared team meal, problems (including overcrowding and insufficient quantities of food) arise when more than one team arrives in the same place at the same time. To address this issue, we encourage teams to each select a “home” d-hall and coordinate with one another to ensure that these do not overlap. If captains continue to ignore the impact their teams’ presence makes on seating and food, we then urge the College to place specific restrictions on where whole teams can eat.
Ultimately, students who live in Houses closer to the Yard enjoy many benefits by virtue of sleeping where they do. They should accept the consequences of their Houses’ convenient locations along with the perks and open their dining hall doors to those less fortunate.

The snowstorm that just breezed through Boston has served to remind many people of last week’s storm that wasn’t. Most Harvardians breathed a sigh of relief when the widely predicted blizzard—supposed to dump over a foot of snow on the city—failed to materialize; some students (i.e., those without a car) even felt cheated when all the hype amounted to was less than one inch of the white stuff.
The result, however, was that dining-hall-tray sledding enthusiasts turned to their second-favorite pastime: complaining about the dead-wrong forecast and the seemingly know-nothing weathermen. In fact, last week, the grumbling reached such a high pitch that we feel compelled to respond—in defense of meteorology.
It is certainly understandable to be frustrated with last week’s inaccurate prediction, and it was certainly the most notable meteorological screw-up in recent memory. However, to claim that the weatherman is “always wrong”—as we have heard it said—is simply unfair and untrue. Meteorologists make accurate predictions on a daily basis about things less exciting or salient than a major snowstorm (but no less influential to our daily lives): temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more. Even with major weather events such as blizzards or hurricanes, they are more often right than they are wrong. It is easy to forget this, exactly because we have come to take weathermen for granted.
What’s more, meteorology is necessarily an imperfect science. If it were possible to know the current conditions in every cubic centimeter of the atmosphere at any given time, meteorologists would be able to predict the weather months in advance with perfect accuracy. However, that wealth of data is just not realistic, and so, like the rest of us, weathermen do the best they can with what they have. Considering that a microscopic shift in wind direction—in the right context—can drastically change the conditions we experience on the ground, we should instead be impressed with how often they get it right.
Complaining about inaccurate forecasts may seem harmless and not worth writing about. However, such behavior can have real consequences, since pressure from the public sometimes takes scientists out of the vacuum in which they should be working. Knowing that they will be harshly criticized if a storm is worse than expected, for example, meteorologists often hedge their bets and forecast the direst possible scenario—absolving themselves of blame at the cost of knowingly withholding their real best guesses.
The direst possible scenario also tends to be the most sensationalistic one—and, again, sometimes this is a purposeful manipulation of the data. The commercialization of weather-forecasting agencies may be leading some meteorologists to intentionally gussy up their forecasts to be more exciting—therefore driving more traffic to their website. These trends are deplorable, and we blame both the weather companies and the overeager public for taking the neutrality out of yet another science.
Whether this exaggeration was at play in last week’s forecasts is impossible to prove. However, if only from the snowfall totals in nearby cities to the south, it is probably safe to conclude that there was no indication last week that Boston was not going to be walloped. In light of this, we support both the meteorologists in their predictions and everyone else who listened to them. Schools and businesses around the area did the right thing in closing for the day, even if it turned out to be unnecessary; we are all better off safe than sorry. Similarly, we are pleased that the government honored the terms of the technical snow emergency, even if there was no emergency in practice: Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino should be commended for his understanding in waiving 3,353 parking tickets and agreeing to reimburse 229 citizens whose cars were towed during the “storm.”
Precautions such as these remind us why meteorologists are valuable. It may be easy to knock them, but they deserve our gratitude as well. When tornadoes are forming in Kansas or a blizzard is dropping down across Canada, they rarely miss it, and their expertise often spares lives. Hopefully, as yesterday’s widely predicted storm blankets the memories of last week, we can spare the meteorologists, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All of the avid board game fans out there will probably be able to relate to a recent experience I had. As we dedicated players know, Monopoly games can become brutal; they are a merciless battle of wits, a test of strength, and a harbinger of future success. The values of Monopoly: shrewd money managing, heartless business dealings, and greedy, ceaseless expansion would make Captain Industry extremely proud.
After one particularly long game with Harvard students on a late night, to which I came out on the losing end, I began to see some parallels between the results of the game and events in world history, specifically the Cold War. Was I reading far too much in between the properties? Perhaps. However, the lessons a group of freshmen took away from this elementary board game can be seen as good indicators of how much our society has internalized the Cold War.
As the game progressed, it became clear that some players were accumulating properties more quickly than others. As usual, a dearth of money appeared as those quickest to the monopolies began racking up huge, price-gouged rents. Yet, curiously, well into the game, there was an unusually generous exchange of money between two players, who covered each other as they landed on particularly large rents and were short on money.
Clearly, there was some illegal colluding going on between the players, which they defended as ‘gotcha back-ing’. For the next few turns, these two players began giving each other low-interest loans whenever the other was short on cash, helping each other build up houses and hotels, while giving each other safe havens.
Fortunately, the other players refused to allow such egregious cheating go unanswered. Three other players decided to form a collective team, which they—coincidentally—dubbed the “Communist Team.” In their scenario, the three players pooled all of their money and properties together, openly and willingly paying for all of the debts owed as the three characters made it across the board. This seemed like a good counterweight, one large conglomeration responding to a pair of cold-hearted venture capitalists.
As the Communist Team soon discovered, money was short. Despite holding onto prized properties, they consistently lacked the money to build new hotels, since they had to cover costs of three members, who quite unsurreptitiously landed on well-built properties.
Where was I, you might ask? I controlled my monopoly of the Oranges, a small but profitable area, and stayed neutral. One onlooker even congratulated me for my independence and rooted for me, the incorruptible, fair-playing nation.
Yet, this not-so-subtle allegory of the Cold War turned out to be sadly accurate. My hard-earned money quickly fell to the capitalists who had the most rapid development and the largest cash reserves. I was like the India of the 1960s, attempting to chart my own course yet constantly being pulled in two directions. After I fell, the Communist bloc quickly dissolved too, burdened by the costs and failure to expand, much like Soviet Russia and Red China were by vast populations and energy but a lack of capital. Like the result of the Cold War, the Monopoly capitalists used fearless consumerism and merciless business activity to squash communism and control the board.
The fact that my friends and I recreated the Cold War says something about how much we have internalized and moved on from this history. What was once a vivid and real ideological division is now a trifling conceit for board games. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, two years before most of us were born, and we take for granted that it happened and that the free marketers won. Communism has been reduced to a losing strategy, from the day we can say “free parking” or “go to jail.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year was supposed to be the most transformative year in American public life since the sixties. Far reaching legislation seemed assured. Economic recovery, healthcare reform, a cap on carbon emissions, and financial regulation. What a difference a year makes. A failure to get any of these things done is blamed in part on dithering, undisciplined Democrats and their leader, Barack Obama. They’ve got 59 votes, and yet it’s as if the Republicans are in firm control of the legislative branch. Liberal pundits panicked and turned on their own. Too much hope, not enough audacity. Obama was naïve to think Republicans ever had any interest in bipartisanship, they said, and showed his inexperience in believing Democrats were any better.
These are all valid criticisms, but they fail to capture the real source of Americans’ frustration. Whatever the bad rap on Obama and the Democrats, were it not for the filibuster and lock-step Republican opposition, the President would have emerged from his first year in office with three—if not more—major legislative victories. The major disability of American democracy is not Democratic fecklessness so much as the pervasive and intensifying feeling that our legislative process is broken. Yet, in spite of the swelling public exasperation with a plainly dysfunctional system, there is virtually no talk of actually doing something about it.
To be sure, the filibuster is not, in principle, a bad idea. In an era of hyper-partisanship and 24-hour news cycles, even a legislative body as inherently deliberative as the Senate is in need of some sort of braking mechanism, for when those built into a system of checks and balances don’t suffice.
However, the minority is abusing it to stymie every legislative initiative without ever allowing an up-or-down vote on the merits. Republicans flat out refuse to play ball. The filibuster becomes a rallying point for the minority whose remaining moderates are under house arrest. Feeling its extraordinary power, the partisan majority puts overwhelming pressure on the few moderates in its ranks to hang with the caucus, surrendering corrupt concessions to keep them on board.
Both parties bear some responsibility for the filibuster’s increased use, which has been facilitated largely by “Rule 22,” which allows opponents to threaten a filibuster without ever having to execute it, sparing the minority of many of the political consequences of stalling legislation while getting to characterize the other side as ineffectual. But its dramatically increased use over the last three years coincides with the arrival and firm entrenchment of European-style, party-bloc voting by the Republicans, such that the filibuster has become a major impediment to the conduct of even routine Senate business.
Halfway through the current 111th Congress, the filibuster has already been invoked 74 times, putting it on pace to surpass the 110th Congress, which set the high mark with 139. That was more than double the mark set by the Democratic minority in the previous Congress, 68. By comparison, there were only 70 filibusters in the entire period between 1919 (when Senate rules were changed to allow supermajorities to end a filibuster) and 1970.
The result of this increased use has been that in 2009, the Senate spent more days in session than in any other year in the previous decade. It held more Saturday and Sunday sessions than any Congress of the past 20 years. Altogether, Congress spent 1,420 hours in session—the third busiest year dating back to 1991. And yet, it passed fewer measures and public laws than in any year of the previous decade, with the exception of 2001.
Healthcare spending in 2009 rose to $2.5 trillion, a global summit on climate change came and went, and, a year out of the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, we still aren’t regulating derivatives. Nothing got done.
There are a number of interesting proposals floating around for how the rules should be changed. One suggestion is that the votes necessary to invoke cloture—ending a filibuster—incrementally decrease the longer the bill is held up, incentivizing greater engagement among members of the minority party whose influence over legislation would diminish as time went on.
But as badly as the rules need to be revised, there are many things standing in their way. The logistics of actually effecting a rule change are daunting. Changing Senate rules usually requires 67 votes, all but impossible to come by in the current Washington climate. The only way around this is the constitutional option, also known as the “nuclear option,” which technically only requires 51 senators to vote to alter the filibuster rules. Republicans threatened to go nuclear in 2005 in response to Democratic filibusters of a few of President Bush’s judicial nominees. For technical reasons, however, the constitutional option can’t be exercised until the start of a new Congress in 2011, thus offering no near-term solution to Democrats.
This fall, Democrats will run against the Republicans as the party of “no.” If the Democrats emerge from the 2010 midterm elections battered but holding on to their majority, such a change would be highly implausible. (It would be extremely difficult to muster a simple majority for the change even in the current Congress.) If the election results are non-disastrous to the point of showing the tide turning in the Democrats’ direction, but (as is inevitable) the election still reduces their already inadequate majority, then they could try to strike a deal with Republicans to change the rules, using the nuclear option as leverage.
Merely to attempt such a maneuver would draw Republicans’ profound resistance and only heighten partisanship in the beltway. But if Obama maintains any aspirations of passing the significant portions of his agenda, what alternative does he have?

The most interesting result of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court case that struck down limitations on corporate political advertising, may not be the growth in corporate political action it spurs. Indeed, it is unclear that such growth would even occur. Before Citizens United, corporations could spend unlimited amounts of money on ads blaring, “Candidate X is an immoral, incompetent liar.” Because of Citizens United, those ads can now say, “Candidate X is an immoral, incompetent liar. Vote against him.” The difference is real, but not transformational.
The more important consequence of the decision has been a remarkably vibrant discussion of how best to get money out of politics. Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig has called for a constitutional amendment reversing the decision combined with public financing of elections. Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Senator Chuck Schumer have proposed requiring corporations to subject all political spending to a shareholder vote, which would presumably cause such spending to grind to a halt. Yale professors Bruce Ackerman and Ian Ayres suggest denying federal contracts to corporations that engage in political spending, and Ackerman and Congressman David Wu have formulated a bill giving $50 campaign contribution vouchers to every taxpayer to balance out corporate influence.
These proposals’ prospects vary widely. Both of Lessig’s are subject to supermajority requirements in the Senate–67 votes for an amendment, and 60 to break a filibuster on public financing–where minority leader Mitch McConnell has been a staunch opponent of all campaign finance reform efforts, and so chances are dim. Same for Ackerman and Wu’s bill, the cost of which should alienate swing Republicans. Van Hollen and Schumer’s and Ackerman and Ayres’ more modest suggestions could attract more support, though it’s always safer to bet that Congress will find an excuse not to act. But all are worthy, and all would shrink the influence of money in politics more than Citizens United grew it.
The question is whether they’re enough. Experts have for years tried and failed to prove a relationship between the strength of campaign finance laws and levels of corruption and public trust in government. Some of this is no doubt due to the subtleties of how money infiltrates the political process. Outright corruption, though real, is less common than implicit quid pro quos or even looser expectations of reciprocity. However, if the bills have failed to reduce corruption, which is easier to study and identify, how likely is it that they have significantly clamped down on means of influence that are harder to pin down? Especially given the amount of effort campaigns and their donors have spent finding loopholes in even the most comprehensive campaign finance reforms, it is not unreasonable to conclude that merely limiting the influx of cash does not stop it from dominating the process.
It may be time, then, to stop money from entering at a different point in the process. As its name suggests, campaign finance reform is premised on the notion that legislators’ actions are largely influenced by who donates to their reelection committees. This is true, but not the whole story. Another equally troubling entry point for corporate influence is in the lawmaking process itself. Interested parties do not merely participate by donating to campaign committees. They hire lobbyists to argue their case with Congress by session. These lobbyists do not convince just due to force of their arguments. Sometimes, yes, they offer help with reelection or threaten to back a challenger. Other times, they provide information other sources cannot and become an asset to Congressional offices.
Lobbyists’ most important means of influence, however, is personal. Lobbying firms and organizations are overwhelmingly composed of former House and Senate staffers of both parties and even former Congressmen and Senators. Take the health care debate as an example. The Senate health care bill was largely the baby of Senator Max Baucus, who, as Finance Committee chairman, had jurisdiction over the issue. Health industry interests, including pharmaceutical and insurance companies, hired a total of seven former Baucus aides to lobby him, including at least two of his former chiefs of staff. In total, the Washington Post counted at least 51 former staffers connected to the Finance Committee working as health care lobbyists. It is one thing for the committee’s members to take the industry’s money and vote against them. It is another for them to talk to close friends and colleagues and proceed to reject them.
Limiting this phenomenon, perhaps by banning staffers from registering as lobbyists until their member has left Congress, has not been tried, and I cannot predict its effectiveness. But with campaign-based reform faltering, a new method is needed to prevent corporate cash from further eroding our democracy.

When I walk into Boylston Hall and turn left, I’m confronted with a table; the moment I’m within the threshold of Ticknor Lounge, two school officials ask me, monotone, for the first letter of my last name. I say “C.” I look around. The place is filled with sunny silence. Dotted around the room, among the couches and deep-cushioned chairs, there are students with their heads down, some scribbling furiously, others underlining passages on the pages in front of them. There are boxes of pizza in one of the corners. I’ve found myself at the 2010 Financial Aid Thankathon Open House.
Over the past decade, Harvard has increased its scholarship aid to students by 155 percent, according to the FAO website. This year Harvard is awarding a record-breaking $145 million in need-based scholarship assistance. There cannot be enough said about the University’s middle-income initiatives, or the fact that it waives fees for families earning under $60,000 a year. Harvard is perhaps the most generous university in the world, and it has led other universities to similar levels of generosity. I, for one, would never have been able to attend Harvard 10, 20 years ago, and that’s true for many other students.
A good portion of this financial aid assistance comes from the generosity of individual donors who establish scholarships for various slices of the student body—in other words, they give money to students like me. The Thankathon is an event at which we show our appreciation for these benefactors, many of whom are shadowy, sometimes anonymous figures whose names come up only on the bill every term.
When you walk into Ticknor, one of the two officials (presumably associated with FAS Donor Relations) hands you three pieces of paper after carefully marking down your attendance; one sheet has information about your particular donor, the second has example thank-you notes, and the last is blank, scrap. Then they motion to the boxes full of cards and envelopes and the boxes of pizza. Take one, take one, they say about both.
All the exemplary letters seem to be written by graduating seniors. I sit down by the window. On page two: “These small accomplishments, of which I am very proud, are in no way just my accomplishments; they are also yours, for you have given me the opportunity to pursue my dreams.  For this, I thank you deeply.” In the preceding paragraphs the writer talks about said accomplishments: traveling to the Rift Valley in Kenya, the experience of establishing five mobile malaria testing and treatment clinics. At the very bottom of the instruction sheet, in perky alarming bold, it says, “Please leave your envelope open so that we can make a record of your participation for the FAO!”
My donor is Jeff Tarr, who established the Frank Tarr Memorial Scholarship in honor of his father. Frank Tarr didn’t graduate from high school (sheet number one tells me) but he believed in the importance of education. He was very pleased that his son attended Harvard. Jeff Tarr was in Winthrop House when he was here—as am I—and he played on the freshman and Winthrop football teams. He was active in the Dems.
I was lucky enough to meet Mr. Tarr in person over winter break. He and his family organize an annual banquet in New York City to meet and keep in touch with new and old Tarr Scholars, a group made up of Harvard students on financial aid from New York or Maine. I was the youngest person in the room by far, my peer scholarship recipients either out of town or otherwise busy, and I felt out of place. I talked to an I-banker about math courses. I scanned the room.
Then Mr. Tarr came over, and he took me by the shoulder and beamed at me, asked me all about myself. I told him about playing baseball. He told me about the football, and that he played baseball too, that he’d actually even tried out for the Major League once in his playing days. He’s older now, but you can see in his thick back, his curved fingers, once he must have been able to take a tackle, to turn a double play. We marveled together about how different the school was. I pictured him walking through Winthrop. He made sure I sat next to him when we started eating, and he made sure to introduce me to everyone: politicians’ aides, economists, doctors, entrepreneurs. The conversation was smart, and in lulls in the political discourse, we could always return to joking about the Core or playing House intramurals. It felt, at the end, like a family.
I tried to write my letter to Jeff Tarr. I looked through the sample phrases—things like, “I am grateful for my opportunities.” “I could not have done it without you.” I am. I couldn’t have. I am extraordinarily lucky.
But I also wouldn’t be here without my real family. I reread the explanatory letter. Frank Tarr believed in the importance of education. He was very pleased that his son attended Harvard. I picture my own father, my mother, my brother, and our twin heritages.
The feeling that I was stumbling around had a word, and it was “obsequious,” with all its ugly and uncomfortable connotations. And also “ungrateful,” shameful overtones in tow. The thank-you writers seemed to make full use of the scrap paper, just so they could meander the line between the two words carefully.
Even in meeting Jeff Tarr once I know that he is a person of the very best order: a kind man, a good one. That day in Ticknor I wrote my thank-you letter to him happily, if dutifully. His generosity and that of those like him make this school, and its squadrons of alumni, feel like a family. We take care of our own. But I can’t shake the feeling that this notion of money is dirty, as is indebtedness. And sometimes the Harvard family makes it easy to forget that we came from somewhere before.

Cambridge resident John L. Mehl, 57, was apprehended by Cambridge Police Department officers Feb. 4 on Church St. at approximately 10:48 p.m. for breaking and entering into a blue Volvo sedan parked on Garden St. to steal a TomTom GPS navigation device.
Mehl was charged for breaking and entering into a motor vehicle as well as drug possession, as several prescription drugs that did not belong to him were found on his person.
Mehl was spotted earlier that evening by a witness who noticed shattered glass falling to the ground as Mehl pulled away from the car window, according to the Cambridge Police Department’s incident report.
The report stated that Mehl proceeded to threaten the witness, saying “What are you looking at? Get the [expletive] out of here.”
The witness then walked away and immediately called the Harvard University Police Department.
Shortly after Mehl left the scene, HUPD detained Mehl, the Cambridge Police placed Mehl under arrest when the witness identified him.
Cambridge Police officers also found the prescription drugs Methadone, Suboxone, and Neurontin on Mehl’s person, and the report added that he had neither containers nor prescriptions for these drugs.
According to a 2008 Cambridge Police Department report, the number of larcenies from motor vehicles in 2008 was higher than the average over the past five years. The spike is due in part to a significant increase in the number of stolen GPS devices, which account for 43 percent of all thefts.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Emily N. Wright said she advises residents to put away not only all electronics—especially GPS devices—but also any chargers or window mounts, as these can signal the potential presence of electronic devices in parked motor vehicles.

Consuming milk and a high dietary intake of vitamin D while pregnant may lower children’s risk of developing multiple sclerosis later in life, Harvard researchers find.
The findings, released online last Tuesday by the American Academy of Neurology, suggest that vitamin D and milk may help prevent the onset of debilitating autoimmune disease starting from gestation.
Over the course of 16 years, a team of researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health tracked a pool of 35,794 female nurses and analyzed the dietary habits of the subjects’ mothers while they were pregnant. Of the nurses followed in the study, 199 developed MS.
Nurses whose mothers drank at least four glasses of milk a day were 56 percent less likely to develop MS than those whose mothers drank less than three glasses per month, according to the study’s lead author, Fariba Mirzaei of the School of Public Health.
Mirzaei and her colleagues found a similar correlation between vitamin D intake and the risk of developing the disease.
The researchers said that they plan to continue studying the link between vitamin D and MS to identify the threshold at which vitamin D consumption maximizes its preventative effect on MS.
“This would be of particular interest to women who have multiple sclerosis because they might have a solution to prevent their offspring from developing multiple sclerosis,” Mirzaei said.
The team will also examine the possibility of using vitamin D to treat those already diagnosed with MS.
The researchers’ recent findings corroborate a growing body of evidence that points to a correlation between the consumption of vitamin D and the onset of MS.
Kassandra Munger, a research associate in the School of Public Health’s department of nutrition also part of the research team—conducted an earlier study on the link published in 2004.
Munger’s study—which examined the diet and vitamin D levels of more than 180,000 nurses and members of the U.S. military over several decades—found that women taking the recommended dose of vitamin D exhibited a 40 percent decreased risk of contracting multiple sclerosis.

The number of undergraduate students seeking treatment for alcohol intoxication or poisoning at University Health Services is likely to rise for the second straight academic year, according to data provided by the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services.
In total, 102 students sought medical attention for alcohol-related sickness at Stillman Infirmary last semester—and the number will likely reach roughly 200 by the end of the spring term, according to AODS Director Ryan M. Travia.
If the figure hits that benchmark, it will represent a 43 percent rise over the past two years—marking an upward trend after a period of stabilization from the founding of AODS in 2005 until 2008. Prior to the creation of AODS, the number of hospital cases had increased nearly nine-fold over six years.
Travia said it has been difficult to credit the recent spike in hospitalizations to elevated incidences of high-risk drinking or to increased willingness among students to seek medical attention for their friends.
“There’s a greater awareness about the amnesty policy, and thus a greater willingness to ask for help,” Travia said, referring to Harvard’s policy that grants disciplinary immunity to students who seek medical assistance for intoxicated peers.
But simply attributing the rise in hospitalizations to heightened awareness of the amnesty policy is an “optimistic outlook,” Travia said.
He pointed to a number of confounding factors in the hospital data as reasons to suspect that several factors contributed to the increase in Stillman admissions.
In previous years, male and female undergraduates have come to the infirmary for alcohol-induced illness in roughly equal numbers, but nearly 64 percent of those hospitalized this year were male, according to Travia.
He also said that while freshmen remain the highest risk group—comprising nearly half of this year’s hospitalizations—Stillman admissions have actually risen in number among all four class years.
Director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling Paul J. Barreira said he was also uncertain what caused the spike in hospitalizations, given that UHS mental health screening has revealed no rise in the incidence of depression and anxiety—which often spur alcohol abuse—among students.
But the economic downturn may play a role in students’ drinking habits, Barreira said.
“Last year and this year...the total chaos in the economy has put enormous strain on families and students,” he said. “In the general population, the rate of depression, the rate of suicide, and the rate of drinking has risen enormously. Why would the student population be immune?”
President of the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisor program Cullen D. McAlpine ’11 called the Stillman data “disturbing” and said he will be discussing the increase in hospitalizations with the 30 other DAPAs during their next monthly staff meeting.
McAlpine said he hopes to make an impact in the immediate future by planning alternative social events for the night before Housing Day, a traditionally alcohol-soaked event.
“Our focus right now is on River Run, which is basically a combination of alcohol and fire, which is never a good idea,” McAlpine said.

Massachusetts’s number two health insurance carrier Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has tapped Eric H. Schultz, head of a rival health insurer, as chief executive starting March 1.
Schultz, 50, will replace Charles D. Baker, who recently stepped down in July to launch a bid for the Republican Party’s nomination for governor, Harvard Pilgrim’s board of directors announced Thursday.
After serving as chief executive of Fallon Community Health Plan in Worcester for a decade, Schultz will soon lead a much larger company, as Harvard Pilgrim provides insurance to more than 1 million people in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.
Schultz, who oversaw Fallon’s expansion from a local health insurance provider to the state’s fourth largest health insurer, said in an interview with The Boston Globe that he would work to make health care more affordable for Harvard Pilgrim’s members.
Fallon spokesperson Christine Cassidy praised Schultz’ leadership skills and relevant experience.
“In addition to his experiences within the health care system, Eric also is a dynamic leader and provides an informed, articulate voice on Massachusetts and national health care reform,” Cassidy said.
When Schultz arrived at Fallon in 1999, the company had lost $21 million in 1998 and $18 million in 1999, according to a 2002 article in the magazine Managed Healthcare Executive.
To rein in Fallon’s finances, Schultz raised premiums, cut administrative costs, severed select provider contracts, and retreated from underperforming markets, according to the article.
W. Patrick Hughes, a division president at Fallon, has been named interim president and CEO. Fallon’s board will brainstorm ideas for a permanent successor at a meeting in March.

In an effort to assist applicants from Spanish-speaking families during the admissions process, Harvard has recently begun offering informational materials in Spanish and may expand these offerings in the future, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
In light of the nation’s growing Latino population, the Harvard admissions staff is considering creating a Spanish version of the College’s main admissions brochure, Fitzsimmons said.
“This is something very important going forward,” he said in an interview Thursday. “In the next ten to 20 years, there’s going to be a very, very significant increase in Latino students as a proportion of high school seniors.”
At the moment, the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative offers an information page in Spanish to help parents understand Harvard’s aid policies. In addition, several admissions officers—as well as student volunteers who participate in the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program—communicate in Spanish with parents of potential applicants, Fitzsimmons said.
Similarly, other schools such as Bryn Mawr College, Smith College, and Wesleyan University offer Spanish pages on their admissions Web sites, and admissions officers at the University of Pennsylvania have conducted information sessions in Spanish during recruiting trips.
“It sends the right message about an institution,” said Karen Kristof, senior associate director of admissions at Smith. “We want to send the message that we think access is really important at Smith.”
“We want to send the message that we think access is really important at Smith.”
Several Harvard students who come from Spanish-speaking families expressed enthusiasm for these universities’ efforts and said that they would have found such materials helpful when applying as high school seniors.
Despite her parents’ desire to help in the admissions process, Maricruz Rodriguez ’12 said she found the procedure “frustrating” because her parents could not understand the application materials.
“It’s such an important decision in your child’s life,” said Rodriguez, the first in her family to go to college. “And you want to be a part of it.”
Nancy E. De Haro ’12 said that her parents were initially unsure about her decision to attend Harvard over a college in her home state of California. A promotional brochure about Harvard in Spanish would have been helpful in validating her college choice, she said.
“I wouldn’t have had to explain to my parents why Harvard, Yale, or MIT is far superior to USC,” De Haro said. “It would have been much easier.”
Upon learning his parents received a Parents’ Handbook for Harvard students, Jesse G. Sanchez ’13 said he was “really excited” for his mother to become more involved in his college life.
Sanchez said he promptly called to ask for a copy of the handbook in Spanish, only to be told that one did not exist.
“Because it was only provided in English, it was pretty much useless to her,” Sanchez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those passing by the Science Center yesterday caught sight of a large, white sign emblazoned with blue letters, “Support White Ribbon Against Pornography.”
“Pornography, let’s go!” One passerby said. “Oh, against pornography. Never mind!”
This week, True Love Revolution, Harvard Knights of Columbus, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Catholic Students Association have come together to celebrate White Ribbon Against Pornography Week with a series of talks including last night’s featuring the case of pornography.
“We want to raise awareness about the harmful effects of pornography and speak out against it,” said Leo J. Keliher ’10, co-President of TLR. “It’s a good time right after Valentine’s Day, because pornography really does tear at relationships, especially on college campuses.”
Keliher introduced yesterday’s speaker, J. David Franks of St. John’s Seminary, a theology professor with a background in civil society.
Many of Franks’ arguments against pornography invoked broader ideas of equality, human freedom, and human dignity. Specifically, Franks argued that the making and watching of pornography objectifies women, that pornography may be responsible for sex crimes, and that masturbating to porn increases the risk of becoming a sex addict.
“Is there a right to watch porn?” Franks asked the audience.
Without skipping a beat, Franks spent the next hour explaining that no, pornography is not a right.
“Anybody who loves this nation has got to look at that and say, ‘Oh God—it’s not Thailand, it’s not Russia, it’s the United States!’” Franks said, pointing to child pornography and violence and degradation of women featured in what he called “hardcore pornography.” “This is bad. It’s criminal. It’s evil!”
A self-proclaimed leftist who declined to give his name to The Crimson raised the question of regulating the pornography industry.
“There is a developing sex doll brothel industry in China where people can act out violent scenarios on dolls manufactured to look like women or children. How do you regulate that?”
Though Franks said  he had not heard of the industry, he said that a society that allows such industries to thrive would only “increase the impulse” for “more deviant material.”
An audience member who asked to remain anonymous because he did not want to be affiliated with TLR said that Franks was avoiding debate by using vague theories to justify his point.
“This is a conversation for people who already decided on moral grounds to hate porn or for people who are interested in batting around the intellectual ball,” he said. “And why everyone else is at home watching porn.”
Christina M. Giordano ’10, TLR treasurer, said that she hopes the event opened a dialogue about the topic of pornography.
“We’re trying to... get people to actively engage in the issue rather than hide it away, and get guys who are addicted to porn think about that addiction and what it means,” she said.
Keliher was found continuing the debate with the anonymous leftist after the talk ended. When asked whether he felt the event was a success, he replied, “I‘m glad that it stimulated a lot of discussion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent merger of the Office of Career Services and the Office of International Programs under a new umbrella organization may seem like a reversal of the College’s decision to separate the two offices eight years ago.
But current and former administrators suggest that the restructuring reflects a College-wide change in attitudes towards international experiences over the last decade.
Before former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences William C. Kirby created the OIP in 2002, the College’s policies “discouraged”—and even “criminalized”—term-time international experiences, Kirby wrote in an e-mail.
At the time, many faculty members were “suspicious” that study abroad “probably represented some plot to evade the benefits of a Harvard education,” said John H. Coatsworth, who chaired the committee charged with reviewing and approving students’ petitions to study abroad.
Students wishing to study abroad had to submit “immense quantities of paperwork” requiring multiple signatures from different offices as well as an essay detailing the academic necessity of the proposed international experience, Coatsworth said.
Prior to the OIP’s founding, the Study Abroad Office—which comprised a small part of OCS—organized the College’s international academic offerings.
“It was quite literally buried in OCS, both physically and administratively,” Kirby said.
In 2001, Kirby created the OIP to increase study abroad opportunities. The newly created OIP reported directly to the Dean of Undergraduate Education rather than to OCS.
Kirby said he placed the OIP in University Hall as a “signal to undergraduates” of the increased support for international opportunities.
“I think OIP was a symbol that [the previous] attitudes and policies were changing,” Coatsworth said.
But now, after almost a decade of operating separately, OCS and OIP have once again become part of the same umbrella organization—the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities. The new organization will be headed by Robin Mount, former interim director of the OCS.
Current and former administrators agree that the OIP and OCS no longer need to remain separate, as studying abroad has become both more acceptable and accessible.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, the number of students studying abroad has increased two-fold since OIP’s inception—not including the growing numbers of students who go abroad during the summer.
“We are out of growth mode and more in maintenance mode,” he said.
Both Harris and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds have emphasized the increased efficiency the merger provides for students and administrators.
The new office structure provides “one-stop shopping” who are considering a broad range of activities abroad for the summer, Harris said.
Even Kirby, who separated the two efforts, said he could see why the merger makes sense.
“I think there’s a certain half-life to administrator restructures that assumes they should be looked at on a regular basis,” Kirby said. “[The OIP] made an enormous difference in a very, very short period of time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The handcuffs that will remain linked to the controversial arrest of Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr., professor and director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Studies, are now part of the new National Museum of African American History and Culture at the Smithsonian.
Gates told the New York Times Magazine in an interview published Sunday that he met with Sergeant James Crowley, the Cambridge police officer who arrested him this summer, in October at River Gods, Gates’ favorite Cambridge pub. Crowley gave him the handcuffs over a friendly drink.
Gates’ decision to donate the handcuffs to the Smithsonian drew mixed reaction from the Harvard crowd, though much of the hubbub following the July arrest has died down.
“He did the right thing. He’s eager to get [this] beyond him,” said African-American studies professor Glenda R. Carpio, who had recently discussed Gates’ personal decision over dinner with him.
“We need to regard this story in the many layers it already has, including the media’s investment in blowing [it] of proportion,” Carpio added.
But the response from the Harvard community has not been uniformly supportive.
“Perhaps they will exhibit the handcuffs with Sergeant Crowley’s whip,” Yiddish literature professor Ruth R. Wisse said in an e-mail yesterday.
At the time of Gates’ arrest, Wisse penned a sharply worded open letter to Gates in The Crimson, criticizing her colleague’s actions following the arrest.
“You played him for a racist cop and treated him disrespectfully,” Wisse wrote in her July 30 letter.
“Had you truly feared bias, you would surely have behaved in a more controlled, rather than a less controlled, way.”
Worth magazine editor-in-chief and author of “Harvard Rules” Richard Bradley panned Gates’ donation on his blog.
“No one can transform a painful experience into shameless self-promotion better than Skip Gates,” Bradley wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in eight years, a freshman has been named the men’s basketball Ivy League Player of the Week.
The honor was bestowed upon Harvard forward Kyle Casey, who averaged 23.5 points and 8.0 rebounds per game in the Crimson’s road sweep of Yale and Brown this past weekend­—the team’s first Ivy weekend road sweep since the 1999-2000 season.
“I take it in stride,” the modest freshman said. “It’s definitely an honor. I’ve got to give a lot of credit to my teammates for creating plays and finding me in open spots.”
Casey scored 20 points and had seven rebounds against the Bulldogs and followed that up with a 27-and-nine game against the Bears. They were his second and third 20-plus point games on the season, which puts him just one game behind co-captain Jeremy Lin for most on the team.
Casey was also named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week, the fourth time he’s received the accolade this season. Thus, it only seemed a matter of time before he would join the league’s elites in winning the conference’s highest weekly honor.
“He’s a stud,” said Lin, who has won the award three times this season himself. “He’s a freshman but he plays like a senior. He’s gotten a lot more comfortable since the beginning of the year. He’s just playing out of his mind right now and we’re lucky that he’s on our team.”
Casey’s rare combination of size (6’7) and athleticism (he has a 42 inch vertical leap) is part of the formula that has allowed the freshman to succeed at such a young age.
It was weekends like this one that head coach Tommy Amaker must have envisioned when he landed Casey, who many called Harvard’s biggest men’s basketball recruit in history. The forward reportedly had strong interest from major-conference schools such as Vanderbilt, Stanford, and Providence, but opted for Cambridge in the end. And Amaker couldn’t be happier about Casey’s decision to play for him.
“For a freshman to have the kind of weekend he’s had has been pretty darn special for us,” the coach said. “Without him I’m not sure that we’re in the position that we’re in right now.”
Most importantly, Casey seems to have hit his stride at just the right time. With three key Crimson frontcourt players—senior Doug Magnarelli and sophomores Keith Wright and Andrew Van Nest—down for the weekend with injury, Amaker needed somebody to step up. And Casey, ignoring the extra weight placed on his shoulders, took his place in the starting lineup and exceeded all expectations.
“I wouldn’t say [there was] extra pressure,” Casey said. “We were very limited this weekend in the frontcourt, and it was on our whole team to step out of their [usual] roles and fulfill the role the team needed to get the win.”
Casey, who is third in the Ancient Eight in field goal percentage at 59.2 percent, has been a consistent force in the paint all season. But perhaps most impressive has been his three-point shooting, which has greatly improved of late. This weekend, he was 6-9 from behind the arc.
“I’ve been working on my rhythm a little bit,” Casey said. “[But] I think the shots are just finding me. I’m a little more comfortable with the offense since the beginning of the season.”
Casey was also extremely successful from the charity stripe, where he was 15-17 this weekend. That included a 4-4 stretch in overtime at Yale, carrying his team to a win when Harvard had to use four freshmen and a sophomore in its lineup after Lin and others had fouled out.
In addition to knocking down his own free throws, Casey was also able to stay out of foul trouble when his team needed him most, something he had struggled with at times earlier in the year.
“I felt strongly that I needed to be on the floor,” he said. “Preparing to play defense before my guy got the ball and playing with the energy and awareness that my coach wanted definitely helped me stay out of trouble.”
Casey’s offensive prowess will make the entire team even better in the future, as it will cause opposing defenders to focus more on stopping him—thus allowing Lin, who is almost constantly double-teamed, to have more space to work with on the floor.
“There’s so much attention on Jeremy Lin and so Kyle is being the beneficiary of that and he’s been able to cash in,” Amaker said. “He gives it inside and out. Kyle is a pretty mature kid to be a freshman. I’m very pleased with his maturity level and [his] taking good shots and playing within the flow of our offense. It was there for him and he cashed in.”
Continued strong play from Casey could go a long way towards helping the Crimson earn its first ever Ivy League title this season.
And don’t be surprised if he keeps it up for another three years after that. Because in many ways, the forward is like an obsessive gambler—he just keeps cashing in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tom Williams’ Bulldogs were fighting for more than victory in the 126th playing of The Game last November. They were also fighting for relevance in the minds of the Crimson student body. For though Harvard-Yale weekend is historic in its own right, the Bulldogs can no longer be considered the Crimson’s most hated foe.
That enemy would prove to be Cornell, Harvard’s biggest rival in men’s basketball and men’s ice hockey. The newfound rivalry between the Big Red and the Crimson is more current, more competitive, and much more focused on the actual game at hand. And Friday’s upcoming games in both sports have the Harvard student body in a kind of pre-game fervor that November’s football game can’t match. This time, the attention focuses on the contests themselves rather than on which house will sport the best tailgate.
While the Crimson puts a big red X on its calendar for both home contests against this school, it would be a mistake to call the Harvard-Cornell clash a single rivalry. One is based on history; the other is a new invention. One features prominently in Love Story; the other is somewhat covered by ESPN. And last Thursday, students had to choose which rivalry they wanted to see when it came to reserving tickets for either game.
When the Big Red skates onto the ice at the Bright Hockey Center this Friday at 7 p.m., it will mark the 132nd clash between the programs, a rivalry with no shortage of bad blood.
Or livestock.
Cornell still hasn’t forgiven the Crimson fan who threw a dead chicken at its goalie, Dave Elenbaas, in 1973. The Big Red ended that game with the upper hand by all measures. Not only did it knock off the then-top-ranked Harvard en route to an eventual NCAA berth, but Cornell fans got more animals on the ice that season as well. Later that month, Big Red fans threw dead fish onto the ice and tied a live chicken to the Crimson goal later that month. But Cornell still wasn’t satisfied, and the two teams have been going at it ever since.
Erich Segal didn’t help Harvard out when he included a Harvard loss to the Big Red in Love Story. The movie’s theme song is now a frequent taunt at Lynah Rink.
The basketball rivalry is a much more recent phenomenon, fueled not by tradition but by relatively recent emergences of both programs.
Neither is a traditional hoops powerhouse in a league historically dominated by the “Killer Ps”—Penn and Princeton. Cornell didn’t become the top dog until two years ago, and Harvard hasn’t threatened to take the title until this year. Now the hoops rivalry between the two Ivy League institutions has taken center stage on campus and has been recognized across the nation as well.
Crimson co-captain Jeremy Lin has become a household name this year thanks to a feature in Sports Illustrated, 30 points against UConn, and a current second-place standing in the fan voting for the Bob Cousy Award.
But as Harvard found out the hard way last month, the Big Red’s got a pretty decent team as well. Cornell sent a shock throughout the nation when it took Kansas, ranked first in the nation both then and now, down to the wire. The team has cooled off a little as it recently suffered an upset at the hands of Penn, a team the Crimson beat by 14. But the Big Red had more than enough firepower against Harvard last time, beating it by 36. On Friday, we will find out if the loss to the Quakers was a simple speed bump on the road to March Madness or if it was the beginning of the end of Cornell’s reign.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, which saw its season take a setback with the injury of sophomore Keith Wright, Cornell has plenty of depth in case one of its stars goes. Junior Mark Coury, a starter for Kentucky last year, has only started one game for the Big Red. Apparently starting for the Wildcats isn’t enough to compete for a starting spot against seniors Ryan Wittman and Jeff Foote.
The hockey teams have their fair share of stars as well—including 12 NHL draft picks between the two of them.
Harvard freshman Louis Leblanc highlights the group. The 18th overall pick in the 2009 draft, Leblanc was the first Quebec native to be selected by the Montreal Canadiens in 21 years. Another future NHL player is Cornell junior forward Riley Nash, picked 21st two years prior by the Edmonton Oilers. The Crimson boasts five more former draft picks—captain Alex Biega, senior Doug Rogers, junior Matt McCollem, sophomore Alex Killorn, and freshman Alex Fallstrom. (Alex seems to be a good name for Harvard hockey players.) Meanwhile, the Big Red have five more draft picks after Nash.
Both star-studded games. Both huge rivalries. Both starting at the same time?
That doesn’t seem right. One would expect the Crimson to schedule the games at different times, so action-hungry fans could double-dip when Cornell comes to town. Perhaps there was some confusion because the rivalries have such different traditions, such distinct histories.
Maybe it’s time we bring the two together and treat them as one fierce rivalry.
Forget Yale.
The Big Red is definitely Harvard’s biggest rival right now.

It may not have been home sweet home for the Dartmouth ski team, but the Big Green didn’t seem to care, as it won its relocated home carnival by over 50 points, leaving ninth-place Harvard far back in its snowy wake in Stowe, Vt.
But amidst the sea of green was the continued emergence of freshman Alena Tofte and the women’s nordic team, which placed sixth in the women’s 15k classic mass start race. The weekend before, Tofte had placed 18th in the classic event despite falling over. Nordic coach Chris City ’94 had estimated that she would have placed 13th or 14th had she stayed on her skis.
It seems that he was right, as Tofte finished 14th this weekend in the classic event in a time of 51:22.9, the first of two Crimson skiers to make the top 15 after zero had placed that high the weekend before. Tofte beat out classmate Esther Kennedy by less than a second.
“Throughout the race, Esther kept moving up and Alena was always a little behind her,” City said. “Alena passed her somewhere in the woods, and as she passed her she said ‘Come on, let’s go!’ She finished just a few strides ahead of Esther. It was really exciting to watch.”
Finishing third and fourth for the Crimson were senior Audrey Mangan and junior Cara Sprague, who placed 30th and 35th respectively. Their performances helped Harvard knock off Williams and St. Lawrence, regional powers whose campus layouts are far more compatible with the sport.
The women’s nordic team looked to build off its strong performance in the relay event before falling to ninth.
“It was 75% of a good race,” City said.
This time, it was Mangan leading the charge.
“She scrambled for us,” City said. “She was keeping up with the top skiers. Esther kept us in the same spot, Alena picked up a spot and ran out of gas—she’d given her all the day before.”
If the Crimson hopes to knock off schools such as Williams and St. Lawrence in more events and ultimately in the overall standings, the women’s nordic skiers will need more help. Harvard finished no higher than ninth in an event after the sixth-place finish in the 15k classic.
Luckily for the Crimson, it has a strong core of improving underclassmen who could help Harvard make that leap. Freshmen have stepped up early in their collegiate careers for a Crimson team that is looking to close the gap on the regional powers. Their performances and those of their teammates have helped Harvard coaches City and Tim Mitchell attract a strong recruiting class for next year.
“A lot of our skiers are young—underclassmen,” freshman Anthony Ryerson said. “So it’ll be exciting in years to come.”
One of these such freshmen was alpine skier Catherine Sheils who followed up her 18th-place finish in last weekend’s giant slalom with another strong performance. This one coming in the slalom, where Shiels took 22nd in both the first and second runs of the event. The freshman didn’t match the promise she showed in last weekend’s exhibition, where she placed third out of the collegiate field, but her performance was the strongest individual result the team had outside of the women’s nordic team.
Ryerson is another freshman who keeps improving. The Vail, Colo. native placed 41st in the 20k classic race.
“That was the best race of the season for me,” Ryerson said. “I started strong and then faded a bit. The last 12k or so I picked it up. I pleased with it.”
Ryerson bolted out of the start, racing with skiers who placed in the 20s. The freshman may have been overly ambitious, as he spent much of the first half recovering from the early push. But a small recovery was enough to rejuvenate him as he spent the second half of the race moving up through the competition.
“It was fun to watch him reel in skiers,” City said. “He was catching people who were tired.”
While the freshmen led many of Harvard’s events, it was a senior who paced the men’s Alpine team. Co-captain Chris Kinner had the Crimson’s highest finish in both events, placing 25th in the slalom and 41st in the giant slalom.
Meanwhile, the battle at the top remained between Dartmouth and University of Vermont, who traded events throughout the weekend. Middlebury, who finished third, managed to sneak in a victory in the men’s 3x5k freestyle relay, but it finished almost 200 points behind the league juggernaut Big Green, which could go undefeated for the second season in a row.
Dartmouth, which sends skiers to the Winter Olympics every four years, remains leagues ahead of the Crimson, but if the rest of Harvard’s skiers can match the performances of its women’s nordic team, the rest of the pack may not be so far off.

As the Harvard women’s hockey team enters the final weekend of its regular season entangled in a tight race for postseason home-ice advantage, five of its alumnae are playing for a different kind of hockey prize.
The Olympic women’s hockey tournament opened on Saturday in Vancouver, and Americans Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, Julie Chu ’06-’07, and Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 and Canadians Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03 and Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 are skating for Olympic gold.
The Americans and Canadians are far and away the top two teams in the world and are both heavily favored to advance to the gold-medal game—though as the US team learned in 2006, being favored is not enough, as the Americans were upset by Sweden in the semifinals and had to settle for bronze. But through three days of competition, both squads are living up to the hype.
Canada set the tone in front of its hometown crowd on Saturday with an 18-0 shellacking of Slovakia, the biggest offensive output in Olympic history. Vaillancourt had a goal and two assists against Slovakia and followed up that performance with a goal and an assist in a 10-1 win over Switzerland yesterday.
Botterill added an assist on the Canadians’ final goal in Saturday’s rout.
Not to be outdone, the Americans cruised to a 12-1 win over China on Sunday afternoon. Harvard players bookended the scoring for the US squad, with Ruggiero opening the game with a breakaway backhand early in the first before Chu capped the game with a tally off a rebound from American captain Natalie Darwitz.
Chu also had two assists on the afternoon.
The US team takes on Russia this afternoon at 5:30 pm Eastern time. Both the Canadians and the Americans still have their toughest preliminary matchup ahead of them—Canada plays Sweden tomorrow, and the US plays Finland on Thursday. Those four teams are favored to advance to the medal round.

If football season seems like it took place a decade ago, or if you can’t understand the multiple tie-breaker scenarios in men’s basketball, here’s something to get excited about: men’s lacrosse.
After four straight losing seasons from 2005-2008, Harvard coach John Tillman led his squad to an 8-5 overall record in 2009, including a signature win at No. 5 Duke in the season opener. While last year the Crimson may have had the fortune of flying under the radar, every squad will have its date with Harvard circled on this season's calendar. The Crimson is ranked No. 12 in Inside Lacrosse’s preseason poll, but it won’t catch any breaks throughout the season, as Ivy foes Cornell, Princeton, and Brown also broke the top 20. If you haven’t noticed yet, this is one of the only sports in which the Ivy League can lay claim to being the nation’s premier conference.
With the season opener just ten days away, look for Harvard to have a breakthrough offensive year to help its young defense and alleviate the loss of goalie Joe Pike. Sophomore attack Jeff Cohen was the Crimson’s leading scorer last season with 34 goals, good for seventh nationally in goals per game. Junior attack Dean Gibbons was right behind him with 21 goals, and the freshman duo of Jack Doyle and Peter Schwartz, part of a top-three national recruiting class, will be expected to make an impact early.
The Crimson will host Canisius in its season opener Saturday, February 27th, at Cumnock Turf.

Did you set foot anywhere near the Yard this past weekend? If so, then you probably saw the crowds of dressed-up high school kids scampering around  taking  photos, playing football, and reveling in Harvard’s grandeur. Of course, none of these fawning high schoolers could have been  mistaken for one of us world-weary college students facing the fourth  week of psets and  paper deadlines.
So why were they here? To prove their mettle in the fierce competition of the 36th  Annual Harvard National High School Invitational Forensics  Tournament—and perhaps boost their  resumes so that one day they too might be able to  march through Boylston gate as proud students. (Maybe you were once one of them.)
Held from Feb. 13-15,  the tournament consisted of five sub-tournaments: the  policy debate  competition, the public forum competition, speech competitions, the   Lincoln-Douglas competition, and the Harvard National Student Congress.
With some competitors flying for 14 hours from Alaska to partake in   this clash of intellects, the competition was a true reflection of the   oratory skill of the nation’s best high school students. Seul “Kathy” Ku ’13, who judged the  policy  debate rounds held at at the Student Organization Center at  Hilles, told us  that the elimination rounds, in which 32 of the  best teams of the competition challenged each other, were “really close.”
Yet in the end, only a few teams and individuals could take home trophies . For the full results and ballots for all the rounds (and perhaps to reminisce about your storied high school past),  click here.

An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to the Lincoln-Douglas competition as the Lincoln-Douglass competition.

Prices are down and markets are hurting. Some might think it’s a buyer’s market out there (we couldn't tell you—we're barely passing Ec 10). So what has Harvard been investing in? Well, BJ Services, for one. Marvel comics and Chipotle burritos, too.
BJ Services, which markets itself on its Web site as specializing in “pressure pumping…stimulation and coiled tubing services worldwide,” has captured over $24 million of Harvard’s money. We sure hope that investment brings explosive returns.
Harvard also helps support the financiers of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. We own over $45 million worth of shares in Marvel Entertainment. (Now, if only Superman could fix our endowment woes in between defeating Lex Luthor and saving Metropolis…)
Harvard has $4,000 dollars invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill, which makes you wonder about how in touch Harvard’s administration is with the gastronomic elements of Cambridge. While Chipotle is good, we all know that Felipe’s and Noch’s come through for that "midnight" snack at 2 a.m.
Maybe Harvard would be better off gambling its endowment on horse races, or by purchasing 1,458,209 stocks of a Web site that lets you gamble on horse races online, like Youbet.com. Oh wait...we’ve already done that.
Feel free to check out what other stocks Harvard owns here.

Sex, drunks, guidos! The new episode of “On Harvard Time” has it all. Initially, we were confused by the decision to devote the first third of the show to the search for a new anchor. But after this deviation from their normal script, the show turned to its regular formula.
Here are some of our favorite moments:
-After a record-breaking number of freshman class visits to UHS for alcohol poisoning, the Drug and Alcohol Peers Advisors’ new water bottle statistics aren’t quite what you would expect. For example, “2 handles of vodka on Wednesday nights” is the new recommended amount.
-"Johnny Harvard" is the “the original JWOWW,” according to “Vinny Guadagnino” of MTV’s "Jersey Shore," who originally might have been a Harvard Law School applicant?
-“At MIT sex is like absolute zero, it exists in theory, but we don’t know how to reach it using the equipment we have," says the first of “MIT student” David Brescia’s string of nerdy sex jokes. Compared to the results of a recent Yale poll, this makes us feel much better.

We love America and all, and we’re just as patriotic as the next college newspaper blog. But we have to admit: this news from the Harvard Nieman Journalism Lab just might make the Republic of Iceland our new favorite nation.
No, it’s not because we love Sigur Rós (though who doesn’t like that DVD of the Icelandic pastoral paradise?), nor is it because we adore Iceland’s lovely arctic fox. Our newfound love of Iceland is due to the protection that this volcanic island country may soon be offering people like us—you know, journalists.
On Tuesday, the Icelandic parliament proposed the strongest journalist-protection legislation on the face of the earth. If the measure passes, it would be the most robust combination of source-protection, freedom of speech, and libel-tourism protection known to man.
That’s right, this lovely island in the North  Atlantic may become the investigative journalism hub of the world.
So for those of you still interested in journalism, brush up on your Icelandic and get ready to make the trip north—because the industry could be moving to the land of elves and cod wars!
