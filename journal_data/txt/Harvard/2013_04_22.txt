After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “The Righteous Mind,” a magisterial 2012 work on the moral psychology of political ideology, New York University’s Jon Haidt dishes out some unwelcome news to his predominantly liberal readership: By the numbers, liberals don’t seem to get much about the conservative mind. The political reality at Harvard more than occasionally bears this out. However, in his attempt to push back against the prejudices of an overwhelmingly liberal field, Haidt all too often glosses over the pathologies and blind spots of the right.
In March 2010, a poll conducted by Harris revealed that 67 percent of Republicans surveyed thought President Obama a socialist, despite very ample evidence to the contrary. In light of this, the president has kept remarkably mum about his law school alma mater over the course of the last few years, lest he be tarred and feathered for association with the much-maligned “Kremlin on the Charles.”
But after three years of appreciating that the reddest thing on the Charles is the brick-faced business school, it’s clear enough to me that if anyone needs a reality check as to what goes on behind enemy lines, it’s the conservatives. Inasmuch as Harvard is a solidly liberal place, campus socialists operate under just as much scorn as their religious conservative peers. On a campus where Obama walloped Romney by a 60 percent margin and self-identified Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly five-to-one, students live remarkably conservative lifestyles, flock to the financial services sector, and avoid radical protest like the plague.
My intention is not at all to burn the liberal mainstream and apologize for the far left. On the contrary, I would like to set the record straight for conservatives who conflate Barack Obama with Saul Alinsky, Harvard with Haight-Ashbury, and Rachel Maddow with Emma Goldman: The liberal and the leftist are distinctly different species—ideologically, culturally, and cognitively. If the defining challenge for the opposition in the Obama era were compromising with Lenin, the paranoid intractability of the contemporary Republican Party might be justified. But with true leftists considered in perspective, the oft-bemoaned chasm between American conservative and American liberal narrows to a crack, manageable with a bit of political backbone.
Living among the liberals, I can begin by dispelling one particularly stubborn conservative myth: that liberals hate capitalism, the American way of life, and—most incongruously—freedom of choice. Contrary to this narrative, moderate liberals are an extremely common scene on Wall Street trading floors and are the rule, rather than the exception, in Silicon Valley start-ups. In “Coming Apart,” conservative libertarian Charles Murray’s account of the cultural chasm rending middle-class America asunder, the statistics show that Ivy League elites—the scourge of “Real America”-type conservatives—are the demographic most likely to get married, stay married, and follow the arc of the classic American dream. In a matter of a few decades, these will be my Harvard classmates. Though less inclined than conservatives to hold institutions like “the market” and “family” sacred, they are actually more likely to participate in them.
The leftists, a loud but tiny minority at Harvard and an effective rounding error in the American arena at large, have little patience for traditional institutions. If they voted for Obama at all, it was with a deep sense of trepidation and ambivalence. More recently, while the conservatives kvetched to no end about the threat to the institution of marriage posed by the liberal campaign for marriage equality, hard leftists from the other side of the spectrum took to mocking Human Rights Campaign’s red equal-sign as well, rejecting marriage as “un-queer” and proclaiming, “Assimilation is not liberation!” When leftists criticize corporate greed, it is not in the gentle, “mend it, but please don’t end it” tone offered up by Beltway Democrats—but rather with the overthrow of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mind.
This is not to say that Harvard liberals are all a bouquet of roses or that the ideological left leaves nothing to be admired. Unlike Harvard’s leftists and conservatives, who deserve credit for welcoming controversy and stirring the pot on a daily basis, liberals in Cambridge haven’t the need for an ounce of courage—they will always be part of a majority, supported by myriad resource centers, bureaus, and ideologically naked professors. By comparison, whether by disposition or by numerical circumstance, the leftists among us are forced to make bold statements—some productively challenging, and some annoying.
By now, it should be evident that “Kremlin on the Charles” is as inaccurate an epithet as would be “Phalange on the Charles,” that Barack Obama is an establishment liberal and not a radical socialist, and that Americans liberals are at least as far from the hard left as they are from the right. Taken together with Professor Haidt’s insight that liberals don’t get conservatives, these basic conclusions suggest a severe dissociation lurking behind America’s mounting political dysfunction: We all fundamentally misunderstand each other. It’s high time that we start listening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like any young child, the discussion on campus surrounding the Government 1310 cheating scandal has aged with time. It began its life in shock as it explored the scandal’s juvenile limitations. It quickly grew bigger on the national stage. Then it had some teenage crises about email searches, and then mid-life crises regarding lying about those email searches. And finally now, as it focuses on the scandal’s legacy with a proposed honor code, the discussion has become the monologue of an elder, reflecting on the past with a grimace.
People speak of academic integrity as a once universally present virtue that has disappeared from campus. According to many, “Veritas” has lost its formerly rich meaning. Honesty and genuine academic interest was here during the “Golden Years,” when coins and America had values. But, as grandparents will tell you, kids today are too busy playing beer pong on their Ataris and helping trees instead of people to know what integrity is. Learning is pre-professional. Honesty is lost. The fight for academic integrity has become the fight to return to those old values we once cherished and lived by in “the good old days.”
The thing is, though, I don’t remember the “good old days.” And I shouldn’t. Because Harvard’s whole academic history (especially during the last two centuries) hasn’t been all that good. And remembering it as such is destructive to any progress we make in the wake of the scandal.
The popular Crimson feature “The Fall of Academics at Harvard” is a good example of how the comparison of academics to times of old falls prey to nostalgia. It uses more anecdotal evidence than facts and disproportionately focuses on classes, such as Ec 10, that seem to support its thesis of students and teachers caring about future finances rather than learning. It extensively quotes just a few older, outspoken professors.
In the end, the article’s notion of a “fall” from the past, while containing some truth, amounts to an overstatement. First off, the past, as writer Al Martinez put it, “was sepia-toned, not golden.” As Julie Reuben, professor of education and historian at the Graduate School of Education, reminded me, academic interest at Harvard historically has not been as high-minded as people may believe. In the late 1800s, the College transitioned its academic program from a required load of classics classes and a few electives to all electives with one required composition course. It basically became like Brown today, but without concentrations and people who think high-fiving is a varsity sport. Because of the change, students began picking classes based on ease, afternoon lectures, and the entertainment value of the lecturers. This “fallen” state mandated a reinstitution of more requirements under President Lowell.
More recently, the Kennedy family—the idealized faces of “Harvard men”—had their fair share of questionable academic pursuits. John F. Kennedy admitted to focusing on athletics much more than classes until he wrote his thesis. Ted Kennedy was involved in a cheating scandal and expelled from the school until he could reapply. And it’s not just the Kennedys. A New York Times op-ed by Rebecca Harrington ’08 provides multiple examples of cheating from the last two centuries at Harvard.
The discussion also mischaracterizes the present. Professors quoted in the “Fall of Academics” mention the influence of Wall Street and pre-professional degrees on undergraduate pursuits. Yet they fail to mention the intrinsic interest in climate change, recession, and technologic innovation that drives many students’ devotion to their studies. The article uses Ec 10 as an offending example, but classes like Computer Science 50 (which the article does mention) and Philosophy 151z: “Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics” have enrolled more students this school year than ever before, despite high difficulty ratings. For every student I know who may fit the article’s description, I know many more who are genuinely (if not overly) interested in the subjects they study. We forget that students report that the policies on collaboration in Government 1310 were not consistently enforced, and we immediately assume the worst of our peers.
And this perception of our peers is not only inaccurate, but also harmful to progress. A comprehensive 1993 study on the effectiveness of honor codes found that it wasn’t the presence of written honor codes, nor severe punishments, nor the certainty of getting caught that most deterred academic dishonesty among more than 6,000 students across 31 universities. No—it was a positive perception of the academic integrity of peers that most effectively prevented cheating. The recently proposed honor code is just a piece of paper. No matter what its provisions are, it will only make a difference if students think they are surrounded by motivated and honest learners. The distorted comparisons have to end, and the University must begin discussions among students and faculty to make known and burnish the academic zeal that exists.
Because if the discussion of academics continues glossing over the diverse goals and ideals of the student body in one bitter, nostalgic glance, that piece of paper will never have a chance at influencing what students choose to write on theirs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1789, two future presidents faced off for the honor of representing Virginia's Fifth Congressional District in the first-ever United States Congress. Federalist James Madison ran against pronounced anti-federalist James Monroe in what would become one of the more interesting congressional elections in our admittedly short history. According to some scholars, Patrick Henry attempted to rig the election by designing a contorted district that would ensure Madison's defeat. Although Madison ultimately won the election, many point to this as the very first example of political redistricting in the United States.
Whether or not Patrick Henry did in fact redistrict in Monroe's favor remains a point of contention among historians, but such manipulation has since become widespread. Now called gerrymandering (after the Boston Gazette deemed one of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry's new districts salamander-shaped in 1810), the practice is disturbingly common on both sides of the aisle and has had consistently unsettling implications for democratic legitimacy. In order for elections to accurately reflect the will of the people, redistricting must become a fair and nonpartisan process in all 50 states.
Today, districts gerrymandered based on party affiliation, race, and other influential criteria have resulted in congressional district maps that would put Jackson Pollock to shame. Districts are required to be reapportioned once each decade to ensure approximate population equality, and in many states the majority party takes advantage of this to split opposition voters—or, since the 1965 Voting Rights Act, minority groups—across district lines. Over time, repeated redrawing has led to disproportionate representation of various states' majority parties in Congress—"representation" which in fact does not properly represent the wishes of their citizens.
Several states in particular stand out as blatant examples of the extent to which redistricting has been abused. In a recent study, geospatial software firm Azavea found that two of Maryland's eight districts rank in the top 10 least compact (read: most absurdly distorted) in the nation. The grand prize, however, goes to North Carolina's 12th district, which is 120 miles long but only 20 miles wide at its widest point. It contains small sections of both Charlotte and Greensboro and follows Interstate 85 in such a way that traveling between the two cities requires crossing in and out of the district four times.
Such districts, sadly, are not uncommon. Although some states happen to be worse offenders than others, the problem is spread out fairly evenly across the country in red and blue states alike. Of the top eight states with the lowest district compactness scores, four are majority Democratic and four Republican. Nearly all states whose district reapportionments are controlled by the majority party exhibit gerrymandering to some degree. Even states that rank lower on the “least compact” list, such as Minnesota and New York, contain some interestingly gerrymandered districts.
But the ubiquity of gerrymandering as a practice does not in any way make it more acceptable: At its core, it is effectively a form of disenfranchisement. Thousands if not millions of voters are packed into strategic districts in such a way that in each election cycle their votes are rendered obsolete. Among its many other undemocratic effects, gerrymandering gives a decisive advantage to incumbents and increases partisan polarity: Representatives who do not have to worry about reelection are far less motivated to negotiate or work with the opposition to enact constructive legislation.
Many other countries (such as the U.K., Australia, and the Netherlands) have taken steps to eliminate gerrymandering, but the rigidity of the two-party system in the United States has long hindered efforts to do so here. However, some states have begun to work toward a fair solution to the reapportionment problem. Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, and Washington have all formed non-partisan redistricting committees in an attempt to reduce the partisan bickering and unfairness.
There exist several alternative solutions to the gerrymandering problem, all of which should be seriously considered if our elections are to remain fair and uphold our democratic ideals. Courts have long criticized the constitutionality and fairness of gerrymandering but have neglected to act on their criticisms, at least in part out of deference to states’ rights to draw their own district lines. Placing that ability in the hands of the courts instead could be one way to mitigate the unfairness of majority-controlled reapportionment.
Perhaps more practically, nonpartisan reapportionment committees could be established in all 50 states, with a judicial procedure in place for partisan gerrymandering. A ballot measure to form a nonpartisan committee failed in Ohio last November, but with stronger campaigning and increased awareness such measures could be brought to the table in many more states. Such nonpartisan commissions have been successful abroad: For instance, redistricting in the U.K. is handled by the Boundary Commission.
For over 200 years, gerrymandering has played a persistent role in determining representation. Politicians and their parties over the centuries have used it to cling to power and undermine the democratic process we hold so dear. It is critical that we as citizens and voters take matters back into our own hands, eliminate gerrymandering once and for all, and reassert control over those who ostensibly represent us.

At 3:23 p.m. on Monday afternoon, less than one hour after two devices exploded near the finish line of the Boston marathon, the Red Cross of Eastern Massachusetts announced that no blood donations would be accepted anymore. So much had been given already that stocks were amply replenished. This extraordinary occurrence was to be the mere beginning of a week of altruism, humanity, and kindness in the midst of anguish.
As much as the marathon bombings and Thursday night’s shooting of MIT police officer Sean Collier showed the severity of the pain that we can inflict on each other, the actions of countless community members in greater Boston put on display the best sides of our communities. We congratulate and warmly thank Boston’s law enforcement officers, Harvard staff members, and citizens in the broader community for their unyielding resilience throughout a week of tragedy and fear.
Thousands of police agents swept the streets of Boston on Friday in search of suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, believed at the time to be armed and dangerous, while an entire city contributed to the policing effort with admirable and almost martial unity. The empty streets of Boston testified to the trust that citizens put into Boston’s leaders and law enforcement agents, ceding to no panic or political squabbles.
Workers who were called to their tasks did not hesitate to respond dutifully as the entire city shut down. At the request of the police, select cafes and restaurants remained open throughout the day to provide for officers and emergency workers. Here at Harvard, University Dining Services and Campus Services workers toiled to serve the needs of the student population without wavering for a moment.
The Boston Police Department and Cambridge Police Department published dozens of updates via their Twitter profiles beginning early Thursday night. The police’s use of social media during Friday’s manhunt was crucial not only in keeping people constantly up to date with the events, but also in soothing nerves and fears.
At a time when the shock and horror at the happenings of Monday might have made us wary of one another, we all instead came together—and an act of terrorism prompted not fright, but compassion and empathy. Those who ran toward the blast on Monday afternoon to aid the wounded, and those who rushed to donate their blood, were but the first to display the spirit, the bravery, and the fraternity of a hurt city.
The unity with which our communities confronted this week’s happenings deserves credit and praise. Police officers, emergency personnel, and the people of Boston have demonstrated incredible resilience and strength—a true cause for celebration.

Friday’s city-wide lockdown prompted seven Harvard varsity teams to postpone or withdraw from competition.
Athletic department communications director Timothy J. Williamson said that the athletic department acted with the safety of its student-athletes in mind as it followed the University’s decision to suspend activities.
“Obviously the situation was extraordinary in terms of the safety of our student athletes. It’s a lot different from other situations we’ve been in,” Williamson said. “As soon as the school was closed, the athletic department also followed similar protocol.”
On Friday afternoon, the Harvard and Columbia women’s lacrosse teams decided to postpone a scheduled Saturday game to April 28. The game will serve as the Crimson’s season finale and Senior Day.
For the coaches, the decision hinged on Columbia’s ability to practice before the game. The final decision was not made until 3 p.m. on Friday afternoon, according to Harvard coach Lisa M. Miller.
The men’s and women’s tennis teams pushed back their matches with Brown from Friday to Sunday and men’s heavyweight crew and women’s lightweight crew teams moved their Saturday races at Princeton to Sunday.
Coed sailing withdrew from its weekend regattas, which included the MIT Tech Invitational, which was canceled, and the Thompson Trophy at Connecticut College. As the commissioner of the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association, sailing coach Michael O’Connor made the decision to postpone the women-only New England Championships at Tufts. O’Connor waited until hearing about other regattas to make his decision.
“Once I knew that the girls weren’t going to be allowed to compete that weekend, that made it simple,” O’Connor said.
The regatta will determine which teams from the conference advance to the national competition.
Miller commended her athletes for staying focused despite the week’s series of distractions.
“It’s [been] a very difficult week,” Miller said. “It was nice to see all of my players on Saturday morning.”

Dressed in red saris and adorned with flowers, two South Asian women met in front of the Science Center on Sunday afternoon to be joined in pretend wedlock.
“May my mind move your mind in love.... My life is linked to your life, my mind with your mind, my vows with your vows,” the two women, Sasanka N. Jinadasa ’15 and Kirin Gupta ’16, said to each other during a mock same-sex Hindu wedding.
The event was organized jointly by several campus diversity organizations, including Harvard Dharma, the Harvard South Asian Association, Harvard Queer Students and Allies, Harvard Gay Lesbian or Whatever, and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
The ceremony, entitled “Suhaag: A Hindu Same-Sex Mock Wedding,” was one of the first student events to take place in the newly renovated Science Center Plaza, transforming the concrete common space into a colorful scene of celebration.
Against the white and gray backdrop of the new plaza, the brides and their pretend family members, all adorned in brightly-colored saris and tunics, lit a ceremonial fire that represented light, power, and purity.
The ceremony began with a swirl of dancing as Dharma representatives invited the crowd to participate in the entrance processions for the two brides and ended with onlookers tossing red and pink petals upon the newly-married brides.
“A Hindu wedding has so many great parts to it. The only thing we’re missing is a groom arriving on a white horse, although I guess we could have had a bride on a horse,” said Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies Diana L. Eck before the ceremony, eliciting laughter from the crowd.
Dharma, Harvard’s Hindu Student Association, has staged mock Hindu weddings for the Harvard community in the past but has not done so in recent years.
Nishin Nathwani ’15 said the decision to make this year’s ceremony same-sex was made in response to the ongoing debate over gay marriage in the United States. The coordinators also hoped the event would serve as a recognition that homosexuality is a far from a foreign concept in South Asia, he added.
“This idea that same-sex marriage is a new concept from the West is incorrect,” said Nathwani, noting that many ancient Hindu texts allude to same-sex relationships.
Jinadasa and Gupta, the two brides who both self-identify as queer, said both their sexuality and ethnicity were fundamental components of their identity.
Jinadasa, who is currently on the board of the South Asian Association, and Gupta, who described herself as a part of the queer community at Harvard, said they appreciated the opportunity to celebrate both of these communities through the event.
“Kirin is bringing her South Asian into her queer. I’m bringing my South Asian into my queer,” Jinadasa said.

Hundreds of prospective Harvard freshmen, many eager to see the College for the first time, had their plans interrupted by the lockdown in the Boston area Friday which forced Harvard officials to cancel the annual spring weekend for admitted students.
For several dozen admitted high school seniors that meant they got their first taste of Harvard in Terminal E of Boston Logan International Airport.
There, a flock of Harvard officials met with over 100 students and parents, greeted by Harvard officials including Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
“We’ve all just kind of bonded over this mutual event, so to speak,” West Bloomfield High School senior Hamna M. Nazir of Michigan told The Crimson from the airport on Friday. “I feel like when we go back to campus in the fall and see each other, it will be a lot nicer because we’ve had this experience to go through together.”
Harvard officials canceled the annual Visitas weekend as Boston faced a lockdown and police officers conducted a manhunt for the second suspect in Monday’s Boston Marathon bombings.
Harvard paid the hotel and meal fees for families who needed to stay the night in Boston and will also cover the costs families pay to change their flights, according Fitzsimmons.
“We wanted to make sure that in this very difficult circumstance that Harvard was reaching out,” Fitzsimmons said.
Disappointed that they would not host admitted students, zealous undergraduates decided to turn to the internet to offer advice to prospective freshman.
On Twitter, undergraduates, alumni, and some faculty offered guidance to admitted students using the handle #virtualvisitas.
“We wanted the students to feel supported,” said Jayshlyn D. Acevedo ’14, who is a co-coordinator for Visitas weekend.
One Tweet from a prospective student asked whether Harvard professors put their graduate students ahead of undergraduates. In response, a 2012 graduate of the College tweeted about an art history class that she took with just one other student.
For the admitted students who did make it to campus, some current undergraduates offered up their rooms and showed admitted students around campus.
Dozens of prospective freshmen and their families showed up for unofficial tours that they learned about from a Harvard Class of 2017 Facebook group.
Although Theodore A. Peng ’13 is not a usual weekend tour guide, he transformed into a Harvard spokesman for the weekend, guiding more than 20 students around the Yard Saturday and meeting with others over lunch.
“As a senior, you look back and remember being in that position and having a great time at Visitas,” Peng said. “Visitas was one of my greatest factors choosing Harvard.”
Peng said he thinks that is why Harvard students stepped up to fill the void left by the cancellation of Visitas.
“We were able to do our part and have genuine conversations,” he said. “They deserve their chance to get Visitas.”

The morning after the Boston Marathon bombings, Undergraduate Council representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 began to draft legislation firmly criticizing what he termed the University’s “flop” in communicating with students in the hours after the deadly attacks.
But the legislation he ultimately presented at the UC general meeting on Sunday night took a starkly different tone. The more tempered final product reflected what he and others believe was a marked improvement in Harvard’s emergency communication with students during a nearly 24-hour period that began with a terrifying Thursday night and stretched into an anxiety-ridden Friday. As police chased the bombing suspects late Thursday night and then searched for the second suspect during a lockdown that paralyzed the greater Boston area on Friday, students received 14 MessageMe emergency alerts and a series of emails from administrators.
Biebelberg’s legislation, which passed unanimously, included clauses requesting that UC members be allowed to join administrators in reflecting on the College’s response to last week’s events and asking administrators responsible for MessageMe emergency alerts to work with students to review the system’s effectiveness.
Biebelberg, who represents Crimson Yard and serves on the Harvard Campus Safety Committee, said in an interview after the meeting that overall, he and his peers were happy with the way the University communicated with students during the manhunt on Thursday and Friday. He said the few complaints he heard came from students listening to the Boston Police scanner—complaints he discredited on the grounds that Harvard’s emergency alert system is not meant to “ease the fears” of people misinterpreting the radio traffic.
Still, he conceded that the University’s communications were absolutely not perfect and there was room for improvement.
“We will work on how the working of the messages can be improved and consider in what situations and timeframes it is best to disseminate appropriate information,” Biebelberg said.
UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and UC Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 indicated at Sunday’s UC meeting that they will discuss the MessageMe system with Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds at an upcoming meeting Wednesday.
Raghuveer said she was generally pleased by how the community had responded in a time of crisis.
“We found our Harvard community stronger than we’ve ever seen it,” Raghuveer said. “I think the word ‘community’ at Harvard gets thrown around a lot, and there isn’t really a solid definition for that, but I think what we saw in the past week was the incredible amount of caring that Harvard students have for one another.”
Also included in the legislation was the UC’s expression of solace for those affected by the tragic events, which included a clause showing solidarity with “our peers at the Massachusetts Insitute of Technology.” MIT Police Officer Sean A. Collier was shot and killed in the confrontation with the bombing suspects late Thursday night.
A second piece of legislation concerning last week’s events was also adopted by unanimous consent at Sunday’s meeting. “The Harvard University Police Department Appreciation Act” expresses the UC’s “profound appreciation” for all HUPD, Securitas, and Boston police officers.
Currier House Representative Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who co-sponsored the legislation with six other representatives, said that it was important that the Council recognize the heroism and the dedication of HUPD.
“As you all know, they put themselves on the line every single day of the year,” said Goffard. “But this past week especially they were there for us, working extra hours, making sure that we all feel comfortable.”
The legislation declares April 24 through 26 HUPD Appreciation Week and calls upon individual House Committees to work in conjunction with their House UC representatives to organize acts of appreciation for security officers.
The legislation also resolves that the UC will set up a “Thank You Wall” to allow students to write notes of gratitude to HUPD officers and Harvard security personnel in a public space on campus. In addition, it calls on the UC to compile photos of students holding up handwritten thank-you messages on whiteboards and to film brief videos featuring UC or general student body members expressing their thanks.

UPDATED: April 22, 2013, at 8:32 a.m.
Aside from the near constant, piercing sound of sirens, the normally vibrant Harvard Square lay silent.
Students, who on any other day would be racing from class to class or dodging tourists in the Square, instead found themselves indoors, huddling around laptops in dining halls while the region was menaced by a suspected terrorist on the loose.
A violent, day-long manhunt turned much of greater Boston into a ghost town on Friday. Following the killing of a MIT police officer and a dramatic chase upriver through Cambridge into neighboring Watertown, Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 asked residents to “shelter in place,” prompting Harvard to cancel classes for the third time this year.
With the University shut down, students sought out friends and neighbors to help pass the time and think of things other than the week’s violence.
“What’s going on outside is atrocious,” said Medha B. Gargeya ’14, who had organized showings of movies including Peter Pan and Aladdin in Adams House. “But luckily, Houses are fortresses of friends and family.”
Around 30 people attended the screenings held in the Adams Junior Common Room, which was one of the many similar events involving movies, board games, and conversations with friends and neighbors that convened across campus.
“It’s nice because it’s taking people’s minds off of what’s going on outside,” Gargeya said.
Even with the in-House support, the passing hours took a toll on the patience of students accustomed to packed schedules.
“I think that students might be getting a little bit stir-crazy, but at the end of the day, I think we will remember the fears we had last night,” Tara Raghuveer ’14, the president of the Undergraduate Council, told The Crimson Friday. “I think it’s very surreal for a lot of people, myself included.”
Those fears, even to the extent that they remained, did not stop some from venturing beyond their dorm’s doors.
“It’s such a nice day. Why waste it because some guy is trying to mess with our lives?” said S. Jumai Yusuf ’16, who was kicking a soccer ball in Harvard Yard on Friday afternoon. “I feel like it’s better to stay with people I know, having fun, than staying in my room and freaking out.”
A boombox blared as Yusuf and some 25 other students played soccer, catch, Frisbee, and Spikeball as the afternoon dragged on.
For some, seeing friends and classmates moving around outside gave them the boost of confidence to do the same.
“I wasn’t going to go out because I thought that no one was,” said Abel Deandreis Colina ’16, who was also in the Yard. “But then I stepped outside and saw all these people.”
On the River, numerous upperclassmen had the same idea.
Ian E. Ochs ’15 spent much of the afternoon in Eliot courtyard, figuring that the gated area would be safe while still allowing him and his friends to avoid the “feeling of being cooped up and helpless.”
The danger that remained in other parts of greater Boston was not lost on Ochs and his friends, who kept abreast of the news through Twitter, Reddit, and even the police scanner on their phones and computers.
Despite the anxiety created by following the news, Ochs said he appreciated the “really nice day.”
“It was definitely more relaxing to get outside,” he added.
When the drama created by the manhunt culminated shortly before 9 p.m. Friday with the arrest of 19-year-old Dzhokar A. Tsarnaev, who was hiding in a boat in Watertown, students at Harvard—just a few miles away—breathed a sigh of relief.
In contrast to the flag-bearing crowds who took over Boston Common in celebration Friday evening, Harvard Square remained relatively quiet. Catharsis, not jubilance, marked the day’s end.
“I think it was more relief than celebration,” said Ochs, who watched the end of the manhunt with a group of around 20 people gathered at Eliot Grille. “After all, it was very sad.”
On Saturday morning, after the dust from the day-long manhunt had settled, University President Drew G. Faust sent an email to the entire Harvard community expressing gratitude towards law enforcement and sympathy towards the victims of the marathon bombing and the chase for its suspects,
“Even as we confront the horror of what humans can do, we see as well the majesty of what people can be, as they take risks and make efforts for others and for something beyond themselves,” Faust wrote. “The trauma of this violence so close to home will not quickly fade; it will affect each one of us in ways we must face together.”
In her email, Faust thanked the Harvard University Police Department for assisting local police during the lockdown.
“Times like these test our resilience and call forth our humanity,” she wrote. “To the many people across Harvard who have worked under extraordinary circumstances to maintain the University’s operations, to secure our campus, to console and assist others, and to keep our community strong, I offer thanks from us all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst the urbanity of Jamaica Plain, Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum—considered one of the University’s premier science museums—is a plant enthusiast’s haven. From conifers to crabapples, it is home to all manner of flora and fauna, both foreign and indigenous.
Sustaining these plants are many bees—but one in particular is of special interest to researchers. Latched to a wooden track, it is equipped with a UV camera linked to a classroom computer, enabling students to see the Arboretum through the eyes of one of its most important inhabitants.
The Arboretum’s experiment is one of the many examples of how technological innovation has found its way into Harvard’s museum spaces. Supported by the work of metaLAB (at) Harvard, a research center focused on bridging the humanities and technological innovation, Harvard’s museums, both indoor and out, are seeking to create a more digitally-enhanced viewer experience.
“Someone can still look into this meadow and see it’s beauty or its ugliness, but they can be armed with more knowledge,” says Kyle T. Parry, one of the project’s researchers. “There can be this compulsion to look closer.”
As the renovation of the Harvard Art Museums nears its completion this fall, the new space offers many opportunities for including technology.
“The role that digital initiatives will play in this museum will be much more present,” says Director of Harvard Art Museums Thomas W. Lentz. “We hope that people, when they walk in, will go, ‘Yes, this is the museum that I remember, but it’s so much better.’”
Museum innovators are not waiting until the new building opens to experiment. The opening of the Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art at Harvard’s Arthur M. Sackler Museum in January, for example, marks the first time Harvard Art Museums has used augmented reality technology.
For some, however, a traditional encounter with a work of art in a museum is necessarily devoid of a device like an iPad. And as Harvard’s cultural collections come of age in the digital era, curators and other museum administrators must straddle a fine line between enhancing their collections and distracting from their original purpose.
FOGG 2.0
With its main building under renovation, Harvard Art Museums is undergoing a makeover. The building—an empty giant on Quincy Street—is more pregnant with possibility than ever before.
The completion of the renovation, which was first conceived almost ten years ago and broke ground in 2010, has been delayed by almost a year due to structural problems and unexpectedly high levels of asbestos. But by the time the building is set to open in late 2014, Lentz says the museum should be “state-of-the-art.”
“This isn’t going to be simply a very expensive, static treasure house,” Lentz says. “We fully expect this museum to much more effectively and imaginatively serve all of Harvard.”
According to Lentz, the existing structure of the building is easily adaptable to new technological additions. Although museum administrators stressed that all plans for the new space are preliminary, there are many ideas for how to bring the galleries into the digital age.
One project currently under consideration, for example, is a digital “screen-wall” on which visitors to the museum could use gesture-based navigation—harnessing body movements rather than touch to trigger the screen—to explore digital resources, according to Jessica L. Martinez ’95, Director of Academic and Public Programs.
Additionally, the new museum will feature three 1000-square foot “curricular galleries” to be used for teaching. By coupling exhibit and classroom space, the museum will become a tool for classes that may be better suited to an object-based syllabus than a text-based one.
In light of the new emphasis on interactive pedagogy, museum administrators are interested in a metaLAB project called “Teaching with Things,” which aims to develop a virtual representation of an artifact’s shape and size in order to facilitate annotation, says metaLAB creative technologist Cristoforo Magliozzi.
“[The technology] is becoming a lot cheaper, a lot leaner, and a lot more mobile,” Magliozzi says. “More and more museums and institutions of that sort are having these capabilities in-house.”
Magliozzi also highlighted the potential value of digitizing content that is in storage, since the Harvard Art Museums will only be able to exhibit “the tip of the iceberg” of its full collections when it opens.
“Index,” Harvard Art Museums’ magazine, is looking forward to a digital transition as well. Originally a print magazine, the publication will eventually become entirely digital.
“We’re tinkering and experimenting and rolling it out in all these different venues,” Steward says. “We’re making connections between what you can do in the gallery and what you can do at home.”
ENGAGEMENT ANEW
What the Harvard Art Museums hopes to do is already underway in Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum. Curators have equipped the 250-acre garden with technology aimed at bringing the plants to life digitally. As a result, the Arboretum has served as a laboratory for the kind of technology the metaLAB is looking to introduce in Harvard’s artistic collections, and a blueprint for what a digitally-equipped art museum could look like in the future.
Working with Nuvu Cambridge—an innovation center attended by high school students who take a semester off to collaborate on projects with experts from MIT and Harvard—the metaLAB designed a series of digital modules for the Arboretum.
In one module, for example, students built a robotic flower that simulated conditions at the Arboretum by opening, closing, or changing color. Another module tasked them with building a birdhouse with several hidden sensors. Using a single-pixel camera, the birdhouse was able to measure the light hitting the tree, which in turn fed into a visualization of how a tree perceives light.
The purpose of the new modules is to gather and display “metadata”—the cloud of information surrounding each artifact. It is data about data, according to Yanni A. Loukissas, metaLAB senior researcher, and it could represent an exciting new path for museums.
“Our sense throughout this whole project has been that, if you do it right, you can create this interesting ecology of experience... from encounters with the raw physicality of the collection to encounters with the metadata of the collection,” says Parry, the metaLAB researcher experimenting with digital videography at the Arboretum.
For museums, the potential to unlock supplementary digital information about an object could help visitors understand artifacts in new ways. “People are used to having navigation and search at their fingertips,” Loukissas says. “I think the museum... kind of begs for that.”
For example, the ability to digitally view three-dimensional objects from all possible angles could help museum-goers overcome the physical constraints of galleries. Even seeing a video of someone handling an object, according to Loukissas, psychologically enhances understanding of three-dimensionality.
Annotating objects digitally is another method of producing metadata. For example, Houghton Library houses artifacts called “ostraca,” pottery fragments that were used in ancient Athens to vote in banishment trials. Loukissas and other innovators think that a researcher examining the shards should be able to reference informational material about the object through digital annotations.
“We’re in a new means of engagement,” he says.
HERE TO STAY
For developers at the metaLAB, this integration of technology across disciplines is the next step in unlocking the latent possibilities of a collection. But as developers brainstorm how to integrate cutting-edge technologies into the museum experience, they are meeting resistance from those hesitant to move away from the traditional museum encounter.
Harvard Art Museums administrators, however, suggest that they do not see technology as a threat. They are careful to emphasize that their first priority is what Martinez calls “deep and prolonged looking.”
“We have a deep, strong, almost religious feeling that nothing replaces the objects in the museum,” Lentz says.
In Jamaica Plain, Parry has already encountered resistance from the public regarding technology in the Arboretum. Some people, he says, are worried that the presence of devices like iPads will steal the spotlight from the plants themselves.
“A lot of people, when we talk about this project, are concerned that we’re taking a site that offers you something other than the urban experience and muddying it,” he says.
This kind of worry is not exclusive to a natural museum like the Arboretum. In discussions with art museum administrators, Loukissas says that he and other developers have spent a lot of time considering how people can “divide their attention between the material artifacts that have historically been the focus of attention and the clouds of metadata that have encircled them.”
According to Parry, one possible solution is the incorporation of sound into galleries. Listening—rather than reading or watching extra material—while viewing exhibits could increase immersion while minimizing distraction. Although audio tours have been a common fixture in the museum scene for years, curators at Harvard are thinking beyond the traditional format.
At an exhibition in the Sackler Museum called “Jasper Johns / In Press: The Crosshatch Works and the Logic of Print,” curators used a device called a “sound dome,” a reverse cone-of-silence that projects sound downward so that only the person standing below it can hear the audio.
And at the Arboretum, researchers are working with soundscape artist Teri Rueb to produce an oral history accompanying a path through the Bussey Brook Meadow, a wetland section of the Arboretum.
“The technology is here to stay, and we have to deal with it,” Loukissas says. “That’s not to say that we should accept the current manifestations of the technology. One thing we know for certain is that these types of interfaces will change and we have the chance to shape them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both Radcliffe crews emerged victorious this weekend, extending stellar seasons on the water for the women rowers.
The Black and White heavyweight crew traveled to Syracuse, N.Y. to take on Syracuse and Ivy rival Dartmouth, while the Radcliffe lightweight crew defended the Charles River against Princeton, BU, and reigning national champion Stanford.
Out of the seven races held this weekend, the Black and White crews dropped just one and won both title races—the first varsity eight battles—continuing the lightweights’ undefeated season.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
After the O’Leary Cup was postponed  due to heavy winds, the Radcliffe heavyweights defended last year’s win to bring the O’Leary Cup, named after the Black and White’s head coach, Liz O’Leary, back to Weld Boathouse on Sunday morning.
“This is the first time in a long time that we won every single race, so it was a really good day for us,” O’Leary said. “I certainly don’t want to lose the Cup. I want to keep it in our house; I want it in our boathouse, and in a little way, that’s sort of an incentive. You can’t help that.”
The first varsity eight raced last on the river and followed up where the previous Radcliffe boats left off, grabbing an early lead and then hanging on, finishing the two-kilometer course in 6:47.9 as Syracuse and the Big Green battled it out for the second spot.
“It probably wasn’t an easy race, in terms of technical skills, but power-wise and outcome-wise, it was obviously just exactly what we wanted,” O’Leary said. “We were lucky to get out in the second 500, we got out 3/4 of a length. Between Syracuse and Dartmouth, the two of them were having quite a race for second and third. Whenever you’re in a three-boat race and two boats are having a tight race, if you’re the crew that’s ahead of that race, you have to be careful because that race can catch up to you. ”
The third varsity eight opened up a quick six-seat lead over the Orange at the 500-meter mark, eventually besting Syracuse by 14 seconds. The varsity four ‘B’ fared similarly, finding open water over the Orange in the middle 1000 to cross the finish line 18 seconds before Syracuse.
The two other NCAA-qualifying crews showed positive results for the Black and White as well, with the varsity four ‘A’ pulling out an eight-second victory after a false start delayed the race. The second varsity eight represented Radcliffe’s closest race of the day, as the Black and White crew edged the Orange by two seconds.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe lightweight team welcomed some of the best in the nation to the Charles River Lightweight Invite as Wisconsin and Stanford, two of the top rowing teams in the nation, were scheduled to come. Wisconsin failed to make the trip due to the week’s events, which also put a wrench in the Black and White’s training leading up to the Invite.
“It’s been a really challenging week,” said Emma Lukasiewicz, sixth seat of the first varsity boat. “We were really glad that Princeton and Stanford still made it out there, and BU was willing to come up and race as well, but we didn’t have a normal week of practices so the girls had to all be flexible and adapt to things. We had some lineups changing around as everything was going on, so I think it reflected well on us that we managed to pull it together given how tough a week everyone had.”
The second varsity eights started the racing on the river, with Radcliffe toughing out heavy winds to best the Tigers and Stanford by eight seconds. The novice fours followed in the sole race that the Black and White lost. BU, a new lightweight program, took the victory, passing the line 17 seconds before two Radcliffe crews.
In the first varsity eights race, the Black and White extended an eight-seat lead after 500 meters and didn’t look back, rowing the course in 7:05.7, six seconds faster than the Cardinal.
“It feels phenomenal [to top Stanford],” Lukasiewicz said. “It’s really exciting. Stanford’s always really good, they’re a really strong program, and just to be up on them and keep them behind us was really thrilling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, the women’s 4x400-meter relay team turned in a stellar performance to set a new school record in the event. Three members of that squad—freshmen Autumne Franklin and Christi Scott and sophomore Gabrielle Scott—joined forces with sophomore standout Erika Veidis on Saturday to take a crack at the all-time mark.
Pitted against national-caliber competition at the LSU Alumni Gold Meet in Baton Rouge, La., they crushed the record. The team crossed the finish line in 3:38.79, nearly two seconds faster than the previous best mark. The performance earned third place for the Harvard track and field team.
“It’s exciting to see two freshmen and two sophomores running times that have never been seen in Harvard history,” Saretsky said. “It was a strong race for them…but I think they all came away from the race knowing that there’s more there. It really bodes well for the championship part of our season.”
The Crimson squad split up once again over the weekend, competing at Princeton’s Larry Ellis Invitational and the Mt. Sac Relays in Walnut, Calif., in addition to the LSU meet.
LSU ALUMNI GOLD MEET
The squad turned in several other strong individual performances at the LSU invitational, including Veidis’ impressive showing in the 800-meter run. The sophomore covered the two laps in 2:06.67, less than a second slower than her personal-best time, which she set at the Harvard-Yale dual meet last weekend.
“Her disposition and her demeanor off the track might give you the wrong impression,” Saretsky said. “When that gun goes off, she has a real passionate and competitive nature.”
Franklin, who has established herself as one of the Crimson’s strongest sprinters in her rookie season, also turned in a couple of strong performances against the deep field at LSU.
The rookie finished in fourth place in the B section of the 100-meter hurdles with a time of 14.14 and finished in sixth place in the 400-meter hurdles.
“My 400 hurdles time I was very happy with—the actual race itself, I wasn’t.” Franklin said. “When I came across the line, I thought my time was going to be bad…but then I looked at the board and was like, ‘That’s a 58, oh my gosh!’”
LARRY ELLIS INVITATIONAL
With the Heptagonal Championships just two weeks away, Harvard’s throwing corps proved that it could be a dominant force in Ivy competition.
The men’s team’s “big three” of junior Dustin Brode and sophomores Ben Glauser and Igor Liokumovich took home the top three spots in the shot put. Glauser led the way in the event, being the only competitor to eclipse 17 meters with a 17.15-meter heave. Brode earned second place and Liokumovich was third.
“In such an individual sport like track and field, chemistry and the team dynamic can sometimes be overlooked,” Saretsky said. “But with that throwing group...there’s no question they’re pushing each other to be the best that they can be.”
MT. SAC RELAYS
Four of Harvard’s top distance runners traveled to the Golden State over the weekend to compete in the 55th annual Mt. Sac Relays. Juniors Maksim Korolev, James Leakos, and Morgan Kelly, along with senior Samantha Silva, competed against some of the nation’s best in the 5000-meter run.
On the men’s side, both Leakos and Korolev ran sub-14 minute races, as Leakos finished in 13:57.24 and Korolev came in at 13:58.51. Korolev now sits just behind Leakos with the fifth-best time in school history.
Kelly and Silva also impressed at the meet, turning in top-10 all-time Harvard performances. Kelly ran the fourth best time in Crimson history, crossing the finish line in 16:28.98 to earn 12th place. Silva was not far behind, finishing in 16:34.09, which was good for 17th place.
A number of Harvard athletes were slated to run at the MIT Spring Invitational this weekend, but the meet was cancelled due to the shooting that occurred on the campus Thursday night.
“Obviously, it’s been a tumultuous week, [but] I was really proud of the athletes that had the opportunity to compete,” Saretsky said. “We had some really outstanding performances overall.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 2-2 in the Ivy League, the Harvard women’s tennis team came into the weekend two games behind the league-leading Yale Bulldogs (then 4-0 in the Ivy League). After having its match against Brown postponed to Thursday, the Crimson (11-6, 3-2 Ivy League) came out on Sunday and moved within a game and a half of the league leaders (16-3, 5-1) with a 5-2 victory. With the win, Harvard snapped a two-game losing streak against the Bulldogs.
The Crimson won four of six singles matches after winning the doubles point with revamped lineups at the first and second lines. While the team’s two senior co-captains fell in singles action, two underclassmen—freshmen Amy He and Hai-Li Kong—pulled out three-set wins to clinch the victory for Harvard.
“This was a big win for the team,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We have been working very hard in practice and we prepared well. We take our hat off to Yale and they are an excellent team, but we played better today.”
Green said that the team, which scrawled “Boston Strong” on each of their arms before the match began and made stickers for their jerseys to pay tribute to those affected by the Boston marathon bombings, played with a fire against their rivals.
“One of the keys in today’s match was our hearts,” Green said. “We played with a lot of heart today. We came out in the doubles on fire and in singles we believed all the way through.”
“Today it felt like we were playing for something bigger than Harvard,” freshman Amanda Lin added. “The Harvard-Yale match is always an important match for the team and we all really want to win because of the rivalry, but this year was extra special.”
The Crimson started by splitting up co-captains Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton, who were 7-3 on the season as a team, in doubles. Tachibana played with freshman Lin and defeated the Bulldogs’ top line of Elizabeth Epstein and Hanna Yu in a tiebreak, 9-8 (9-7). Norton partnered with sophomore Sylvia Li, who usually plays with Lin, in taking the second line, 8-6, to clinch the doubles point for Harvard despite an 8-6 loss by Kong and junior Hannah Morrill at line three.
“We consider our lineup to be very fluid,” Green said. “At any given time, our team knows that any of us can step forward and do well.”
In singles, Lin surrendered just one game in making quick work of Yale opponent Courtney Amos, 6-1, 6-0. It was Lin’s 13th win in a row for the Crimson, running her overall record on the season to 24-3; five wins more than the next best Harvard player. Lin has not lost a single match at the fourth, fifth, or sixth line all year long.
“Amanda is a bundle of energy and an amazing player all the way around,” Green said. “It is a pleasure to work with her day in and day out. She brings a lot as a freshman to our team.”
Yale fought back quickly with straight-set wins over Tachibana and Norton to even the score at two-all. But Li fought off Amber Li in straight sets at line five after a double-break first set, 6-2, turned into a more competitive second set, 7-5. With the Crimson on the edge of victory, the team turned to He, who fought back from deficits all day.
After dropping the first set, 6-4, He battled back to take the second set with a pair of breaks, 6-1. For the second time in the Ivy League season the match came down to a final-set tiebreak, as He and Bulldog Madeleine Hamilton battled to a draw in the first 12 games of the second set. In the tiebreak, He saved two match points before taking an 8-7 advantage and forcing a Hamilton error that gave Harvard the victory.
Lin said that the win, which was the Crimson’s first against a top 35 opponent this year, was crucial. According to the freshman, while the team had come close only to fall just short earlier this year, it retained confidence in its abilities and was rewarded on Sunday.
“We have always believed that we were right up there with those top ranked teams but we have always fallen just short of beating them,” Lin said. “Today was a big step in proving to ourselves that we can really do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After sweeping Brown in a doubleheader Saturday, Harvard returned to the field in Providence, R.I., Sunday to complete its four-game series against the Bears. The Crimson, having won the first game, appeared well on its way to a second win before losing a lead late to end up splitting the second doubleheader.
Although the Crimson did not win out this weekend, it still controls its own destiny in the conference. If Harvard goes 3-1 in its four-game series with Dartmouth next weekend, the Crimson will head to the Ivy League Championship Series.
“We have to trust in our preparation,” junior third baseman Kasey Lange said. “We need to know that we can win. We are really excited. It will be a really good series and it’s exciting to know that everything is in our own hands.”
BROWN 5, HARVARD 4
The Crimson took the field at the Erickson Athletic Complex to defend a 4-1 lead in the bottom of the seventh. However, the Crimson slowly erred its way into trouble, loading the bases due to an error, a walk, and a single. The Bears proceeded to score on an error and two consecutive bases-loaded walks to tie the game at 4-4.
Freshman Morgan Groom came in to relieve freshman Jamie Halula and salvage the game, but her first pitch skipped passed the catcher and the Bears scored the game-winning run on the wild pitch, her only pitch of the game.
“We didn’t really have the focus we needed to have to finish the game,” Lange said. “It was ours to take and we just didn’t take it.”
Save for the last inning, the Crimson played well in the second game. Both sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz and Halula pitched well, splitting time during the game. Ruiz gave up one run in three innings of work and Halula gave up no earned runs over her three and 2/3 innings of work. But, she picked up the loss. The defense also played well, surrendering no errors until the final frame.
Stephanie Regan had two hits and batted in a run. Lange also drove in a run, extending her Ivy League leading total to 39 for the season.
“There were a ton of bright spots, and a lot of spectacular plays on defense,” Groom said. “We just couldn’t bring it together in the end.”
HARVARD 6, BROWN 2
The Harvard freshmen had a big day once again as Groom pitched a two-hit complete game and Haley Davis hit a two-run home run to secure the Crimson victory.
Groom surrendered the first runs of the game in the second inning, giving up two runs on two singles.
But she did not give up another hit the rest of the game and allowed the offense to go to work. Groom finished with eight strikeouts.
She dropped her earned run average to 2.41 over weekend, bringing her to fourth in the Ivy League and top among freshmen.
The Harvard offense had Groom’s back. It immediately scored four runs in the top of the fourth inning on three hits, including Davis’s home run. The Crimson also received a little help from the Brown defense, which surrendered two errors in the inning.
“I had a couple decent outings, but I really felt support behind me,” Groom said.
Harvard never lost its lead, pushing across two more runs in the seventh after a leadoff triple by freshman Zoe Galindo to seal the game.
Regan also had two hits in this game and sophomore Katherine Appelbe had two RBI to match Davis’ team-high in the contest.
“Haley is seeing the ball really well,” Kasey Lange said. “The same thing for Stephanie Regan.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Travelling south to cloudy Providence, the Harvard softball team stayed hot, sweeping a doubleheader against Brown to extend its winning streak to a conference-high 10 games.
The Crimson (21-18, 11-5 Ivy) made easy work of the Bears (8-25, 2-14) in 4-0 and 3-1 victories that kept Harvard tied for first in the North Division before Sunday’s games.
Though Harvard only scored a combined seven runs, it benefited from two complete games from its freshmen pitchers. Morgan Groom shutout the Bears in the first game, and carried a no-hitter through six-and-two-thirds before giving up a two-out single in the bottom of the seventh.
Jamie Halula held Brown to one earned run on three hits, behind a solid defense that did not commit a single error on the day.
“Our infield defense was solid during the preseason,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We had some lapses in there, but they’re bringing it back now. Our outfield has come a long way and has been much more consistent from the second half on.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
Led by a productive top of the batting order, the Crimson scored early and was able to withstand a comeback attempt from the Bears, who tied up the game in the third.
For the second time in as many games, junior third basemen Kasey Lange led off the scoring in the first, plating senior designated player Stephanie Regan with a sacrifice fly to right field.
Halula gave up her only run of the day in the third, when freshman third baseman Trista Chavez hit a two-out solo homerun in the bottom of the third. The freshman walked the next batter but got out of the inning on a hard-hit ground ball to sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz.
Although Harvard continued to get runners on base—leaving seven on in the game—the Bears were able to quiet the Crimson’s offense until the top of the seventh.
With one out, Regan doubled to left center. Junior captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson brought her home with a double of her own, and she later advanced two bases to score on two wild pitches, putting Harvard on top, 3-1.
“Given the events of this week and not being able to get any hitting in yesterday, we were mentally a little fatigued,” Allard said. “We knew Brown was a scrappy team, but we had confidence that we could score more runs than them. We just needed to stay with the process a little bit more.”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 0
Behind Lange—who leads the team in every major statistical category—the Crimson got on the board early and scored all four of its runs in the first four innings.
Regan got to the Bears right off the bat, finding left field with a lead-off double in the first. After Olson flew out, Regan took third on a wild pitch, and Lange picked up her first of three RBI with a double to the same spot as Regan’s.
In the bottom of the first, Groom hit Chavez and allowed her first of six base runners, but she pitched around the mistake and ended the inning on a soft grounder to Lantz.
Lantz walked to lead off the second, but Harvard could not get on the board again until the third. With no outs and Olson on first, Lange stepped to the plate and blasted one out of the park to put the Crimson up 3-0.
“I was just seeing the ball really well,” Lange said. “We were happy to score a couple runs as a team.”
Harvard’s final run came in the fourth, when Regan laid down a sacrifice bunt to bring home freshman centerfielder Zoe Galindo.
The Bears and the Crimson traded scoreless innings until the bottom of the seventh. Groom got the first two outs—including one of her seven strikeouts on the day—but got into trouble when she gave up a walk and hit the next batter. With two on and two out, freshman pinch hitter Jamie Pospishil singled on a liner to left, but sophomore catcher Katherine Appelbe tagged out the lead runner at home—on a rocket from freshman left fielder Haley Davis—to end the game.
“[Groom’s] stuff was breaking well,” Allard said. “The mistakes she made were because her pitches were moving too much, not that she was leaving over the plate to be hit.”

In tribute to the photography blog "Humans of New York"and its recent stint as "Humans of BostonFlyby decided to take its own photographic tour of the Harvard community.
Of course, the pictures in this gallery only scratch the surface of Harvard life. If the original "HONY" blog has taught us anything, it's that there's always more to see. We'll be looking.

In this series, Flyby Staff Writer Olivia M. Munk identifies, dissects, and discusses ideas, articles, and opinions found in popular media and popular culture. She's here to inform you and to make you think—about what's out there, what it means to us, and what it might mean for you.
WHAT IT IS
In case you've been living under a rock and you don't already know, gun control laws are a hot topic in the United States right now. Although the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, many contend that, in so doing, it facilitates mass murders such as those that occurred in Aurora, Colo. in July of 2012 and  Newtown, Conn. in December. Some argue that we should institute laws stipulating that background checks be run before someone buys a gun in order to bar those with a history of violence or mental instability from being sold a firearm. On the flip side, others argue that the government ought to make it easier to buy guns so that people can protect themselves from the other violent people who are also buying guns. Either way, guns exist, and the unfortunate fact is that, as long as they do, people will use guns to hurt each other. So how do we regulate these weapons without violating our inalienable American rights?
WHY IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
If you happened to retreat even further under said rock in the past week, you may have missed the fact that on Thursday morning the Senate rejected a bill proposing expanded background checks prior to firearm purchases. Just hours later, shots were fired on the MIT campus, fatally wounding officer Sean Collier. Across the globe, people watched with rapt attention as the Boston Police Department and other law enforcement teams scoured the city for nearly 24 hours to locate Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings of April 15. His brother Tamerlan, also a suspect, was killed in gunfire during the course of the night. Further shots would be fired, injuring MBTA police officer Richard Donohue, Jr. Though neither of the brothers held a valid license to possess handguns, somehow the two were able to to obtain the firearms they used in the conflict. 
The concurrent timing of the Senate's decision and the Tsarnaev brothers' actions begs for intelligent debate on the methods by which firearms are distributed in the United States. According to the National Rifle Association, in the state of Massachusetts, gun laws state that a person with the proper firearm identification may "possess, purchase, or carry only a non large capacity rifle or shotgun and feeding devices and ammunition therefor. The [ID] card 'shall be issued' by the police chief to a person residing or having a place of business within his jurisdiction, unless the applicant has: a disqualifying conviction or juvenile adjudication; been confined for mental illness or confined or treated for drug addiction or drunkenness; is a fugitive; is subject to a domestic protective order; is an alien; is under 15 or is more than 15 and less than 18 and does not have parental or guardian permission."
It is unclear whether or not either Tsarnaev brother was disqualified from purchasing or possessing a handgun based on any of the above criteria. Authorities have not released a complete account of the men's arsenal, and we may never know how they were able to obtain the guns they used in addition to other weaponry; but it appears that they could have very easily gone about purchasing certain handguns legally.
 
In the case of Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter, it has been speculated (but not confirmed or officially diagnosed) that he suffered from a mental illness. Regardless of whether or not this was the case, as an adult, he would likely have been able to purchase guns anyway. (He ultimately used his mother's gun supply to commit his crimes, which included taking her life and his own.) James Holmes, the man who opened fire in an Aurora movie theater this past July, was taking pharmaceutical medications intended to treat mental illness at the time of the shooting. Still, he obtained firearms legally.
 
Since December, much of the country has expressed outrage at this seemingly unfettered access to guns, prompting lawmakers to propose the Firearms Bill, which would have expanded background checks on prospective gun buyers. The fact that the bill's defeat coincided with the tragic violence perpetrated by the Boston Marathon bombers poses a morbidly intriguing conundrum for Washington: How many gun-related tragedies will it take to curtail the number of guns in legal circulation in the U.S., especially when too many of these guns are ending up in the wrong hands?
 
SO WHAT?
 
In light of the recent incidents of mass gun violence across the United States and the failure of the Firearms Bill in the Senate, many pro-gun control groups have taken to the media to push for tighter restrictions on gun sales. Last week, advocacy group States United to Prevent Gun Violence produced this thought-provoking commercial, just after Canadian group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America came out with print ads depicting two children, one holding a firearm and the other with a comparatively innocuous object that has been banned in public schools. A commercial sponsored by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group backed by scores of mayors across the United States, shows the families of victims of the Newtown shootings speaking about the loss of their children and friends, and implores citizens to support comprehensive background checks, a limit on high capacity magazines, and the institution of an assault weapons ban. In Arizona, the city of Phoenix has decided to remove fifty advertisements from bus shelters proclaiming "Guns Save Lives."
On the other end of the spectrum, some pro-gun advocates have used this week's horrors and political decisions to voice their points of view on the matter. Nate Bell, a Republican lawmaker from Arkansas, tweeted, "I wonder how many Boston liberals spent the night cowering in their homes wishing they had an AR-15 with a hi-capacity magazine? #2A." (He later apologized for the "poor timing" of this tweet.) Interestingly, the value of gun company stock in Massachusetts actually went up following Friday's manhunt.
Guns clearly enabled much of the violence and tragedy that occurred last week in Boston, last year in Newtown and Aurora, and at countless other times and places in Americans' recent collective memory—but does it make sense to fight fire with fire?
THE TAKEAWAY
 
It's doubtful that the federal government will ever completely illegalize the trade of guns in the United States. However, given the amount of senseless violence that has happened in the past few months alone, it is clear that something must be done to better regulate who gets guns, and how much ammunition they are given. While everyone deserves to feel safe and protected at all times, several recent polls indicate that a vast majority of Americans believe that background checks are crucial step in the sale of guns and ought to be mandatory. One issue that is sure to arise in further legislative pursuit of mandatory background checks is how to factor mental illness into the gun trade. A study from Duke University concluded that seven percent of people who had a diagnosed serious mental illness exhibited violent behavior, compared to two percent of the general population. This is not a large enough disparity to deny people who have a diagnosed mental illness their Second Amendment rights. However, thorough background checks are a necessary and likely inevitable step in the quest to legally allow only people who truly need a gun for comfort—not criminal activity—to possess one, thus bringing our society one step closer to preventing the further loss of innocent lives. We can only hope it won't take more lockdowns, manhunts, or funerals to acquire the necessary legislation to keep our country safe. On this, most everyone can agree.
