After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We all love the first few days of the semester, right when school begins and no one’s terribly busy. (“Busy”: The greatest excuse we have at Harvard, but also the saddest word I’ve heard here.) You run into friends, blockmates, linkmates, and House acquaintances you haven’t seen since the spring in the dining hall. It’s curious how it seems as if you’ve been gone for much longer than a few months, especially as you both begin to recount the experiences you had interning at Google, studying abroad in Japan, or backpacking through Italy.
As much as I love the summer, and the respite and insight it affords me, there really is nothing like returning back to Harvard in the fall. Sure, the weather has been abysmal in the way only New England can make it (seriously, Cambridge: rain?), but the idea of Harvard life starting all over again as it gets crisp in the fall, to misquote F. Scott Fitzgerald, fills me with hope.
I spent the summer interning at a company where my team and professional network was comprised of individuals much older than me. And as much as I appreciated the chance to do so — I’ve always felt that I bond with older people much more easily than with my peers — I missed the connections with my peers that only college can provide. After all, isn’t that part of the transformative college experience that Harvard College (or at least its dean) always tries to promote?
Upon returning to school and reconnecting with my best friends, though, I’ve spent a lot of time contemplating Harvard life, especially its social aspects. I’ve been struck by a few conversations I’ve had with friends about the social life here — particularly its tendency to be disingenuous.
One of my friends, who spent a few weeks this summer in Asia, told me how the bonds he established with the people he met there were much more genuine than many of the ones he’s formed here. In response to this, another of my friends cynically remarked that no one at Harvard truly cares about each other. This view, repeated by one of my fellow Crimson editors, isn’t a new one, nor is it completely inaccurate. But for me? I can’t say that’s entirely true given my experience. Yes, there are many disingenuous people on campus — the archetype of the inveterate social networker comes to mind, searching for connections everywhere he can find.
But I’ve been incredibly lucky — my blockmates and friends form some of the most solid, genuine relationships I’ve had in my life. But not everyone is as fortunate as me — we all know that loneliness remains one of this campus’s greatest issues. And even personally, I know there are many budding friendships I could build upon if I weren’t so centered upon my work. We all suffer a challenge of connection — unsure of what, if anything, to do with each other.
Maybe I’m too optimistic, but I firmly believe we could form closer relationships, if we just tried, with the right people. We’re a campus that often describes itself as awkward and antisocial, but I feel we’re secretly much more social than we let on. For me, as curmudgeonly as I can be at times, I love talking to people, and genuinely learning from them: It was something I loved doing at my work this summer, and something I love doing here.
So, here’s my connection challenge to you, Harvard. (Don’t worry, I’m planning to do this too. I won’t hang you out to dry.) Pick up your phone right now, get on Messenger or GroupMe, and send a message to someone you’d love to talk to more. I mean genuinely talk to, someone that you wouldn’t mind spending two hours with chatting about life, the universe, and everything. After all, “let’s grab a meal sometime” is the largest missed opportunity in a campus full of students who love nothing more than opportunity. Instead, let’s build and strengthen the bonds of friendship we need, on a campus that often has greater potential to isolate than connect us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many times, when I tell people that I am Korean, their reaction is to tell me how much they love Korean BBQ or kimchi. I am very proud that these foods have gained as much popularity as they have, but the rarity of instances in which people name even one other food betrays a monolithic understanding of Korean cuisine that has taken hold in America.
In fact, beef is extremely expensive in Korea, and as a result bulgogi, galbi, and other similar foods so ubiquitous in Korean-American food are only for special occasions in Korea. Additionally, I suspect that a lot of what contributes to the popularity of K-BBQ is its relative familiarity to an American audience — America’s fascination with meat means that no Korean barbecue place will offer flavors too far from what you might find at a regular steakhouse or even an American equivalent. Even kimchi is functionally a spicy sauerkraut. Truth be told, Korea’s most exciting and truly distinct flavors are mostly lost on the rest of the world, and this should not be the case.
The foundation of Korean cuisine is its fermented sauces, also known as jang. Ganjang, or soy sauce, is quite familiar to many around the world now, but gochujang, or fermented chili paste, and doenjang, a fermented soybean paste, are the two elements truly constitutive of a Korean meal. These two pastes serve a whole host of diverse purposes — they can serve as marinades, sauces, soup bases, part of a braising liquid, or condiments.
They also do not have any flavor analogs in any other world cuisine. America has been obsessed with spice and hot sauces — jalapeno, sriracha, and Tabasco are mainstays on tables from Peter Luger’s to McDonald’s — but to reduce gochujang to just another hot sauce would be a grave injustice. It offers a unique blend of sweetness, spice, nuttiness, and numerous flavors that escape description in words, those which come from months of careful fermentation. Additionally, gochujang has untapped culinary potential that could expand the American definition of what is culinarily acceptable: Gochujang-smoked ribs could bring the deep, smoky sweetness that is familiar to so many, but add a dimension of spice and make them that much better. Given that it seems like anything can be made into an “aioli” and slapped onto a burger, why shouldn’t Shake Shack take a flyer on gochujang with its next sauce?
Doenjang is another ancient pillar of Korean cuisine, with a world of unexplored possibility for the American culinary scene. For thousands of years, Koreans have been perfecting the art of fermenting and brewing soybeans. As a result, we have also learned how to use them in stews, pancakes, sauces, and just about anything else under the sun. Doenjang brings saltiness, sweetness, and a unique depth of flavor that can only be described by the Korean verb “gusuhada,” which has no exact English equivalent, but roughly is approximated by “nutty” — think of a much stronger miso. However, exposure to doenjang in the West is minimal — relegated to an accompaniment for K-BBQ that often goes untouched, unless the customers know what they should be looking for.
Ultimately, though, what a larger understanding of Korean food generally and these two specific components offers extends beyond our dining habits. In a time when America has become divided, perhaps more than ever, finding points of agreement between an increasingly diverse number of cultures and ethnicities will only grow more and more important. And while it seems simple just to try some new foods, what you gain is a sensory experience of culture, and hopefully a delicious one at that. Tasting the complexity of flavor present in the doenjang and gochujang you have just read about offers a glimpse into the importance of patience in Korean culture more generally, and the benefits that that aspect of our culture offers.
This idea doesn’t stop with Korean food — to the extent that no matter who we love, what we look like, where we come from, or what we believe, we still all eat, and we can all do better to reach into somebody else’s pantry the next time we’re eating out, and offer a place on our tables to new foods, no matter whether we are comfortable with them or not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a result of the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit, internal studies about the College's admissions policies circulated among top administrators in 2013 have come to light. The studies, which found Asian-American applicants saw "negative effects" in the College's admissions process, were not previously made public, and SFFA alleges that administrators did not act upon the findings. The College’s choice to not take further action on such troubling statistics is unacceptable.
Harvard has tried to contest the accuracy of the studies by claiming the data set used was “incomplete” since it did not include personal essays, teacher recommendations, or factors such as legacy status and athletic recruitment. However, this incompleteness does not disprove the existence of discrimination against Asian-American applicants. Indeed, the College’s apparent failure to further look into the matter — despite having had five years since 2013 to do so — constitutes a systematic failure on its part.
As a leading academic institution that has inscribed the pursuit of truth into its motto, Harvard should have had the courage to investigate whether it truly disadvantages Asian Americans in its application process. Instead, it appears to have disregarded its own reports — severely damaging the trust of its Asian-American students, the University’s reputation, and affirmative action itself.
Despite Harvard’s error, it should not be used as a cudgel against affirmative action. As we have stated in the past, affirmative action is an important project that helps to correct the systematic inequalities and disadvantages that may come with the color of one’s skin. The experience of being part of a diverse college class is also crucial to success in an increasingly globalized, diverse, and close-knit world. Therefore, even if Harvard is found to have discriminated against Asian-American applicants, we reiterate our support for affirmative action and its implementation in the admissions process.
Furthermore, many like to believe that college admissions is a completely meritocratic process that is entirely based on one’s qualifications. This is simply not true. Factors that have nothing to do with one’s qualifications to attend any particular college, including the wealth of one’s family and where you live, all matter. Sometimes, as in the case of affirmative action, these non-meritocratic factors are justified. Other times, as in the case of legacy preference, they are not. The admissions lawsuit has offered Harvard a chance to critically analyze its own admissions process, and reevaluate the systems by which students are admitted. Harvard should seize this opportunity, and analyze its admissions process as a whole while arguing this case.
In failing to further investigate whether it discriminates against Asian Americans in its application process, Harvard ditched educational values and its own motto — “veritas.” We strongly condemn the College for its failure to pursue the truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A co-owner of Central Square's Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub has resigned following a series of sexual misconduct allegations that the venue's owners say are false.
Middle East announced co-owner Joseph Sater's plans to retire in a Facebook post on August 28. Sater had managed the nightclub, a Cambridge musical mainstay since its founding in 1974, for 44 years.
“Admittedly, it’s been challenging to find an appropriate way to respond to unsubstantiated third-party claims on social media,” Middle East's management wrote in the post. “We can say, unequivocally, that the allegations being spread online are absolutely not true and that just being publicly accused is absolutely devastating.”
The post noted that the restaurant’s goal is to create “a warm, respectful, safe — and, as a music venue — fun work environment.”
“We always strive to do better and we sincerely apologize if any current or former employees have not had a positive experience or have felt unsafe,” it read.
Neither the restaurant nor its owners could be reached for comment.
Rumors of sexual misbehavior first surfaced about a year ago. In fall 2017, a DJ wrote an online post alleging that one of the Middle East's owners had assaulted multiple women.
The details were and have remained murky. The post named no names. No victims subsequently came forward with stories. And the Cambridge Police Department has not received any complaints about Slater, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
Still, the allegations generated backlash. Some musical groups canceled their performances and offered statements of protest, though at least one organization — the organizers of "Grassfed Disco" parties — acknowledged in their statement that "we have no real insight or knowledge about these allegations."
Things went quiet for a few months. But over the summer, the issue arose anew when Alex Pickert, a former Middle East employee, penned an explosive Facebook post dubbing the work environment at the restaurant "toxic."
Pickert wrote in the August 18 post that he quit working at the restaurant because he'd given up hope of changing things for the better. He wrote that he and a few others in the restaurant had pushed internally for improvements including the removal of the accused owner and the undertaking of sexual harassment trainings with the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.
These efforts ultimately failed, Pickert wrote. BARCC terminated its services and Sater, who had taken a leave of absence from Middle East following the online accusations, returned to the restaurant four months later.
“I was wrong to have gone along with the company as long as I did, but with the hopeful facade of them taking the situation seriously, I stayed,” Pickert wrote. “I realize that I have been complicit in my silence and wanted to detail and share my experience."
Sater previously told the Boston Globe that his decision to take a leave was "in the best interest of the business at that time." He also told the Globe that he is retiring so as to cease distracting the business and "the staff I care so deeply about."
More musicians distanced themselves from the Middle East in the wake of Pickert's post.
Boston band Walter Sickert & the Army of Broken Toys announced on Twitter on August 23 that it would donate all its profits from its show with Negrito on August 29 to the BARCC. Other bands have canceled or moved shows at Middle East, including The Hotelier, The Courters, and The Worriers.
Heather McCormack, a member of the local band Boston League of Wicked Wrestlers who books the group’s events, said she became aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against Sater in Nov. 2017. Though Pickert sought to convince the group to keep their reservation, pointing to the BARCC trainings, McCormack ultimately pulled the plug, citing safety issues for performers.
“My main concern was at that point, they had not made any sort of public statement acknowledging that these issues had come up,” McCormack said.
McCormack also said she thinks Sater's resignation will do little to fix the situation at Middle East.
“I think it’s totally abating the issue, and it’s not taking any sort of systemic, structural step to prevent issues like this from arising in the future,” McCormack said. “Even if this one individual is denying his involvement, there were significant structural and systemic failures at the Middle East that came to light as a result of these allegations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
July and August can be sleepy and stifling in Cambridge — but the hot weather didn't deter University President Lawrence S. Bacow from a frenzied round of activity in his first two months as Harvard's 29th top leader.
Even before he officially assumed the presidency in July, Bacow got busy. Over the summer, he held scores of meetings with Harvard affiliates across campus, quickly filled top administrative posts, and wasted no time in fulfilling his earlier promise to serve as an advocate for higher education on the national stage, making at least one trip to Capitol Hill.
Immediately tasked with finding a successor for previous Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, Bacow began meeting with faculty and staff across FAS to find a new leader before he took office. Bacow appointed Claudine Gay, who became the first African-American and first woman to lead the school, in July.
Bacow’s selection of Gay followed the historic appointments of two other female, African-American deans: Tomiko Brown-Nagin at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and Bridget T. Long at the Graduate School of Education.
Bacow also announced Harvard Business School’s Bharat N. Anand ’88 as the University’s next vice provost for advances in learning last month. Though the brand-new president has yet to find a replacement for Tamara E. Rogers, vice president of alumni affairs and development, he is “spending lots of time” on the search, according to University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson.
In addition to finding and appointing new administrators, Bacow spent a “fair amount of time” in the past two months discussing Harvard's plans for its Allston campus with Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp and workshopping issues of academic planning with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Jackson said.
Somewhere in there, Bacow found time to meet with the deans of each of the University’s schools. And he held several planning retreats this summer, one with his leadership team and another with the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body, on which Bacow served prior to his presidency.
In late July, Bacow headed to the nation’s capital, where he spoke to students performing public service internships at a Harvard Kennedy School event. There, Bacow reaffirmed his commitment to championing higher education, telling attendees that the values of colleges and universities have “enabled the American dream for so many of us” and that is it “important that we not let that dream die.”
Bacow also continued Faust’s tradition of meeting with legislators in Washington during her trips to D.C. He met with members of the Massachusetts delegation, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck E. Schumer ’71 (D-NY), U.S. Senator Mike D. Crapo (R-ID), and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA).
Near summer’s end in August, Bacow stepped further into the political realm when he signed a letter to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler that opposed a draft rule that would require the federal government to make all data used to support scientific studies that inform its regulations available to the public. Bacow and his fellow signatories argued that the new rule would “cripple” scientific studies because many require the use of confidential patient data.
Bacow will officially be inaugurated Harvard’s president on Oct. 5.

Harvard's brand-new graduate student union may soon face University administrators across the bargaining table.
Justin Bloesch, a member of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers bargaining committee, wrote in an email that organizers are “currently in the process of refining our comprehensive bargaining agenda and expect to start negotiating with Harvard early this semester.”
If HGSU-UAW does begin pushing for a contract this semester, it will cap off an eventful — and historic — year.
In Jan. 2018, following two years of legal battles, the National Labor Relations Board invalidated the results of Harvard’s first unionization election — held in Nov. 2016 — and mandated that the University hold a second election that spring.
When the polls for that election closed on April 19 after two days of voting, a slight majority — just under 56 percent — of graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants had voted to unionize. It was the first time this had happened in Harvard's more than 380 years of existence.
After 11 days of uncertainty, former University President Drew G. Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced Harvard intended to honor the vote and bargain in good faith with HGSU-UAW.
Following that announcement, the union was free to begin preparing to negotiate with Harvard in earnest. In May, students elected a 13-member bargaining committee. Union affiliates also formed a committee focused on combating sexual assault — dubbed "Time's Up" — and a committee meant to protect workers’ civil and human rights.
Through the end of the semester and into the summer, all three committees kept busy. Bargaining committee members developed and sent out a survey quizzing students on what they hoped to see result from negotiations. Respondents rated the importance of approximately 50 potential bargaining goals ranging from childcare subsidies to free dental and vision insurance. Bloesch wrote that “hundreds of student workers” from “across the globe” filled it out.
The Time’s Up committee and the civil and human rights committee, meanwhile, held town halls and listened to student feedback.
In making these preparations, the HGSU-UAW bargaining committee is wading into relatively new and untested waters for student unions at private-sector institutions. Though graduate students at Brandeis reached a contract with their university administrators in August, that contract is not yet certified, making NYU’s graduate union — Graduate Student Organizing Committee-UAW — the only union to successfully complete a round of negotiations at a private university.
The Brandeis and NYU contracts both feature increases in compensation, improved access to mental health services, and access to dental care.
Anne E. Pasek, a former contract negotiator and spokesperson for GSOC-UAW, said universities and graduate unions each possess the tools to set the tempo of negotiations.
If they want to slow the pace of talks, she said, administrators can argue certain demands do not fall under the umbrella of negotiable topics or can purposefully make it difficult to schedule time for negotiating sessions. And if the union wants to fight back, it could use public pressure like a threatened strike to push for a speedy end to the bargaining process, Pasek added.
“Negotiations often follow the rhythm of a school year, so a strike authorization vote when papers are going to be graded at the end of the year is a powerful tool,” she said.
Bloesch wrote that, in addition to surveying its members, HGSU-UAW has been “researching best practices from existing collective bargaining agreements negotiated by unions across the United States.”
William A. Herbert, who directs the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, City University of New York, wrote in an email that HGSU-UAW will likely prioritize goals that organizers highlighted in the run-up to the April election as negotiations with Harvard move forward.
“Among the strategic questions will be which proposals are primary, and which are secondary,” Herbert wrote. “It is likely that HGSU-UAW's strategy will be based on the issues that were raised during the organizing campaign, and based on survey responses from members of the bargaining unit.”
Issues the union has raised in the past include teaching stipends, housing, and childcare. Bloesch also cited “protections for survivors of sexual harassment” as a potential negotiating demand.
Before negotiations begin, HGSU-UAW members will vote on a bargaining agenda culled from survey results. Bloesch did not comment on when the results will be released.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stanford University, arguably the most selective institution of higher education in the United States, will no longer report its acceptance rate starting fall 2018, the school announced this summer.
Harvard — arguably the second-most selective institution of higher education in the United States — won't be following suit. Experts say it probably won't make a difference to eager college hopefuls across the country.
Stanford used to publish details about the incoming class — including statistics regarding academic interests and geographic makeup — in a press release every spring. The university stopped reporting Early Action acceptance rates beginning with the class of 2021, and, starting with the class of 2023, will cease releasing admissions data altogether.
The decision sets Stanford apart from the rest of America's top-tier colleges and universities, most of which annually release their admissions data. University spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard will continue adhering to this tradition.
Stanford Provost Persis S. Drell wrote in a press release that the school chose to stop publicizing admissions data because it did not want its low acceptance rate to dissuade prospective students from applying.
“We want students to know that when we encourage them to apply to Stanford, it’s not because we wish to be known as a most competitive university with a low admit rate,” Drell wrote. “It is because we want promising students of all backgrounds to seriously consider the educational opportunities and possibilities at Stanford.”
“By focusing on the admit rate, talented students who would thrive at Stanford may opt not to apply because they think Stanford seems out of reach. And that would be a shame,” she added.
But the point may be moot. Stanford has to release its admissions data to the federal government, which will make those numbers public anyway.
Not only is Stanford still required by law to report its data to the National Center for Educational Statistics, it will continue to share its data with the Common Data Set, a program that facilitates data collection among member universities.
College consultant Anna Ivey said she thinks Stanford's policy change is unlikely to have a significant impact .
“Applicants to Stanford typically know that it's one of the hardest, and often the hardest, college to get into. The same goes for Harvard,” Ivey wrote in an emailed statement. “If both schools stopped reporting admit rates, people wouldn't all of a sudden be confused or ignorant about the fact that they turn away most applicants.”
Acceptance rates for both Harvard and Stanford have trended inexorably downward for at least the past five years. Stanford was the first to see its admission rate dip below 5 percent with the Class of 2020, but Harvard followed where the California school led with its Class of 2022. Last year, Stanford's acceptance rate clocked in at 4.3 percent while Harvard saw a rate of 4.6 percent.
At times, it could seem as though the two schools were competing to see who was most selective.
College consultant Parke Muth wrote in an email that he believes Stanford knows its admissions data will continue to be released in some form.
The Palo Alto school is still very much in the “race" for selectivity, Muth wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When visitors step inside the newly opened Smith Campus Center, they'll probably walk right past green, plant-covered walls before grabbing a cup of coffee and finding a comfy seat.
What they may not know is that those plants will be maintained year-round through an automatic irrigation system that distributes rainwater collected on the Center’s roof.
Like the technology behind the living walls, some features of the brand-new Center — opened this month — are easily missed.
Others literally announce themselves. At the entrance of the building, visitors can learn about campus events at the information desk and via the interactive walls lining the left side of the Welcome Pavilion. Guests of any height — including inquisitive five-year olds — can easily double tap the floating icons, which reveal locations, dates, and times for events listed on the Harvard Gazette’s calendar, to which student groups add their events.
The living walls, on which over 12,000 plants sprout from wool pouches, are just past the information desk. UV-filtered rainwater from the rooftop of the building waters the 19 species of hanging plants. While they serve to add to the ambience of the Center, the walls also cleanse the air and make greenery a constant, even during cold New England winters.
To the left are the Harvard Commons, a multi-level open space in which students can opt to take a power nap on one of the many sofas between classes, find a study nook to work in, or enjoy a weekly concert series featuring Harvard performers around lunchtime, according to Director of the Common Spaces Julie Crites.
“The Office for Sustainability partnered with the Smith Campus Center project team and manufacturers to ensure the selected furniture and interior building materials that were used in the new space were produced without the use of harmful chemicals of concern and delivered at the same price point,” Heather Henriksen, managing director of the Office for Sustainability, wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Planners are still brainstorming ways to use the Commons space and balance its use as Harvard’s “living room” with planned events, according to Crites.
“We see this first year as an experiment – a time to see what works and what doesn’t work. We envision the space existing as a living room for a majority of the time, with exciting moments of transformation interspersed,” Crites wrote in an email.
Events already scheduled in the space include a screening of Incredibles 2 on Sept. 15 and a celebration featuring campus groups on Sept. 20.
The second floor includes offices for the Undergraduate Council and Harvard Graduate Council and a collaborative work space reminiscent of Cabot Library that is open only to Harvard affiliates.
Some spaces on the second floor, including an art room, are currently inaccessible because of continuing work. Other rooms still await doors and other finishing touches.
Heading out of the Commons, visitors encounter dividers that can only be crossed by sliding a Harvard ID. Behind these are elevators servicing the other floors of the building. A wing of the second floor connects to the offices of Harvard University Health Services.
A short elevator ride reveals some of the lesser populated spaces on the 10th floor. These spaces include several lounges and a game room, complete with a pool table and foosball.
Student groups and other Harvard affiliates will soon be able to reserve rooms for events and formal conferences.
Come winter, visitors will be able to munch on small dishes and sip on beverages at the Heights Cafe and Bar while enjoying views of the River Houses, Cambridge, and the greater Boston area.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Pembroke, Mass. woman arrested last week on the suspicion that she was responsible for a hit-and-run that left an 80-year-old woman dead pled not guilty at her arraignment in Cambridge District Court on Friday morning.
The Cambridge Police Department had charged Ashley Monturio, 41, with leaving the scene of an accident causing a death. Police identified Monturio after spotting her license plate in surveillance video of the incident.
Monturio, who has no prior criminal record, was released without bail. She could not be reached for comment.
Cambridge Police officers found Romelia Gallardo, the octogenarian victim, in the parking lot of the Cambridge Housing Authority building in Cambridgeport around midday Thursday. Police transported her to CHA Cambridge Hospital, where she was officially pronounced dead.
Monturio was driving a white Infiniti QX 60 SUV when she struck Gallardo, who was bending over to pick something up. Gallardo also appeared to be pushing a walker.
Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Maren Schrader said Monturio drove over Gallardo “as if going over a speed bump,” the Boston Globe reported. 
According to court testimony, Monturio drove around the corner after hitting Gallardo. Then she allegedly returned to the parking lot, called 911, and told the dispatcher that Gallardo may have fallen down. Monturio also said she could not stay because she had a job interview, according to court testimony.
Monturio, who works for a pharmaceutical company, turned herself in to police Thursday night, according to prosecutors. She was arrested at the station after interviewing with officials, according to the Globe.
Monturio's lawyer Patrick Reddington told the Globe that "we are deeply saddened and very apologetic for the loss of the family. Other than that, we have to let justice play out."
Monturio is scheduled to appear again in court on Nov. 27. She has three previous accidents and three speeding tickets on her driving record — and the incident last week caused her license to be suspended as an "immediate threat," the Globe reported.

A 66-year-old man was struck and killed by a Red Line train at the Porter Square station Sunday morning, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority transit police announced over the weekend.
The man— who has yet to be identified by authorities — was in the northbound tunnel when he was struck by the train at approximately 7 a.m., according to police.
Multiple transit police officers responded to calls alongside officials from the Cambridge Fire Department and EMS. The man died of injuries sustained from the impact, per police.
Officials said no foul play is suspected, though the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office has opened an investigation into the incident.
Red Line service was temporarily shut down and shuttle buses replaced trains from Harvard Square to Alewife stations. But trains were back up and running by 9:45 a.m., according to MBTA officials.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted overwhelmingly Sunday to change its voting method in an effort to simplify its election process and ensure that, when voters rank multiple candidates, all of those candidates will receive a share of the vote total.
The new method, called the Borda count voting system, gives each candidate a number of points corresponding to the number of candidates ranked below them. If three candidates were running, for example, a voter’s first preference would receive 1 point, their second preference 0.5 points, and their third 0.33 points.
Previously, UC elections relied on the Hare-Clark method, also a ranked-choice system. Under this system, if a sufficient number of candidates do not receive a particular threshold of first-place votes, the bottom candidate is eliminated and their votes are transferred to remaining candidates. It continues in this manner until winners for the position are determined.
Elections later this month for general Council seats, as well as the presidential election in November, will use the Borda method. The UC Election Commission, an independent student-run body, oversees UC elections.
The Harvard chapter of Voters Choose, a nonprofit advocacy organization seeking election reform across the country, presented their recommendations on the UC’s voting system at Sunday’s meeting.
Brandon M. Martinez ’20, founder of Voters Choose, argued that the Borda method would better reflect the will of the student body and reduce confusion. A new system, he suggested, could also increase turnout — a UC priority in the wake of a presidential election last year which saw the lowest turnout in Council history.
“This will be an improvement off of the... Hare-Clark method because those lower preferences don’t come into effect until multiple rounds have occurred, whereas every preference counts in this method,” Martinez said.  “If there’s a bottom-ranked candidate [in the Hare-Clark system], that person will be eliminated and anyone who voted for him or her will be removed from the process.”
“So there’s a major issue of disenfranchisement that is buried in some of the mechanics,” he added.
But Dunster House Representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 said he doubted a new voting method would encourage students to vote, arguing that the process by which votes are counted is less important than the election software itself. Members overhauled that technology last semester after suffering through a presidential election marred by technical issues.
“The assumption is simplifying the voting system, in terms of how votes count, will equal higher turnout,” Agbafe said. “I’m a little iffy about that.”
UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said the Hare-Clark method was so complicated that the voting software the UC put in place last year could not calculate the results.  Instead, Boucher himself had to compose code to tabulate votes, a process he called “painful.”
“What we’re trying to do is move away from a system that is not explainable at the human level,” Boucher said. “I think we have an incredible proposal here for really good reasons why we should be using a different system.”
Crimson Yard Representative Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 asked if the new system could potentially allow a candidate with fewer first-place votes than another candidate to emerge victorious.
“Is it possible, under this new system, say someone has 30 number-one votes, and the person in second has 25 votes and a ton of votes for third, could that person win?” she asked.
Pablo Rasmussen ’20, director of outreach for Voters Choose, conceded that such a situation could occur.
“The short answer is yes,” he said. “The odds of that are slim, but yes, it is possible.”
The Council ultimately passed the legislation 27-2.
Also at the meeting, UC leaders announced they would establish a student advisory committee — including a “chief of inclusion” — composed of non-UC representatives. The committee will advise the Council on administrative matters.
The Council also elected Rainbow Yeung ’19 as its new secretary, replacing Jackson Walker ’21, who recently resigned from the Council.
Correction: Sept. 10, 2018
A previous version of this article misstated the class year of Rainbow Yeung '19. It has been updated.

A recently erected art installation titled “Autumn (...Nothing Personal)” and inspired by a James Baldwin essay will remain in Tercentenary Theatre throughout the month of September, serving as a space for events, discussions, and public viewing.
The Harvard University Committee on the Arts commissioned artist Teresita Fernández to create the sculpture. The installation comprises concentric rings of long, curved wooden benches with backings made of semi-illuminated yellow and orange tubes. Planning for the sculpture, which was fully installed in the Yard August 27, began two years ago.
“I knew I wanted to create an artwork that wasn’t passive, that didn’t just get ‘plopped down’ on the Harvard campus,” Fernández wrote in an email. “I developed dialogues, met with many individuals, collaborated, brainstormed, and formed relationships at Harvard for almost two years in order to create a work that people could feel invested in.”
Fernández taught a course at Harvard entitled “Arts, Imagination, Democracy: Public Arts in Practice” in Jan. 2018 as part of the College’s Wintersession program. She wrote the course served as “preparation” for her work on the sculpture.
“The students were involved from the beginning in thinking about what it could mean to imbue a built structure with democratic practices and research,” Fernández wrote.
The project also drew on contributions from Harvard affiliates such as Amanda Figueroa, a Ph.D. candidate and an intern for the committee on Ethnicity, Immigration, and Rights. To plan for the sculpture, Figueroa said she dug into the Harvard archives to learn more about Tercentenary Theatre.
“In terms of landmarking this space, not only does the installation work in the horizontal dimensions and provide a resting space, but the poles that come up also disrupt that visual line of sight and again just make it even more of a spotlight even more of a stage, even more of a landmark here,” Figueroa said.
Fernández wrote that the installation is meant to evoke Baldwin’s 1964 text “Nothing Personal,” published in collaboration with famed photographer Richard Avedon during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement. The essay-length book examines the state of life in America at the time. Fernández wrote that she sees Baldwin’s work as containing elements of “loneliness, despair, and violence” but also of “light and trust.”
“It is Baldwin's essay that inspired my use of the vulnerable light of autumn as a metaphor for a nation still struggling so desperately with the same issues Baldwin so eloquently exposes,” Fernández wrote. “During the day, it feels like an immense zoetrope, shimmering and flickering reflections and shadows of the overhead Elm trees with people moving through it; at night there is lighting built into the work so it looks like fire in the middle of the Yard.”
Lori E. Gross, associate provost for arts and culture, said Baldwin’s references to light made it a “very important” element of Fernández’s work.
“The essay builds on itself but it ends up with the idea of light and that there’s light at the end of some things that are often dark,” Gross said. “I think that it’s actually a very hopeful message at the end of some very complicated ideas and times, both in ’64 and now.”
Chris Molinski, a research curator at the Harvard Art Museums, said the space brings Baldwin’s words to life.
“The intention is to have a series of public conversations where we will read the Baldwin text together in this space and also using the Baldwin text in course-work, in group discussions, with student groups as a jumping off point for creative responses that will continue a conversation beyond this physical structure," Molinski said.
Fernández wrote that upcoming readings of Baldwin’s essay at the sculpture are also designed to evoke a sense of “public intimacy.” She said human interaction with and around her work is a key part of the sculpture.
Prior to this one, Harvard  commissioned other art projects including “John Harvard Speaks,” a video installation in which the John Harvard Statue was temporarily animated with students’ faces and voices.
On Sept. 14 at noon, Jonathan L. Walton, a Divinity School professor and Memorial Church minister Jonathan L. Walton will lead a public reading and subsequent discussion of Baldwin's essay at the sculpture.
The art space will be open to the public and will continue to host events until its removal on October 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend at the Fairfield Invitational, Harvard women’s volleyball snapped a three-game losing streak and picked up its first win of the season in the process. The Crimson (2-4) bookended a shutout loss with victories over Central Connecticut State (2-8) on Friday and host Fairfield (1-8) Saturday evening.
Over the past five seasons, women’s volleyball has had just one losing season, and has not finished below .500 in conference play during that entire span. That lone disappointing campaign occurred in the fall of 2016, when the squad went 7-7 against Ivy teams and just 3-8 versus the rest of the field. Last season, the team showed signs of improvement, as it boosted its overall record to 13-10 and completed the fall tied for third in the Ancient Eight.
Perhaps most impressive was the Crimson’s come-from-behind win over Yale on the road on Nov. 3. The Bulldogs were a frontrunner in the conference, and after Harvard jumped out to a lead in the first game, Yale fought back to capture the ensuing two. With no room for error, the Crimson battled out two consecutive set wins of its own, both of which required tiebreakers.
Despite losing its next two matches that November, Harvard closed out its 2017 season with a 3-1 victory over Penn. Now, the Crimson’s task is to improve for a second straight year in a crowded field of Ivy League volleyball teams.
The 2018 season started slowly for Harvard, as the team dropped all three matches of the Michigan Invitational, albeit against tough competition including No. 23 Michigan. However, the Crimson bounced back at this weekend’s Fairfield Invitational as it prepares for its first home game this Thursday against Boston College.
HARVARD 3, FAIRFIELD 1
In the finale, Harvard took down the Stags on their home court and recorded its second win in as many days.
The Crimson comfortably prevailed in each of its three set wins, twice by a margin of six points and once by nine. In the last set, Harvard took 11 of the final 16 points to seal the contest and close out its weekend at the invitational. Each team recorded 42 kills, but errors are what set the two squads apart: the visitors racked up 19, while Fairfield picked up 32.
Middle blocker Christina Cornelius had an outstanding game at the net. She was credited with 12 of the team’s 42 kills and committed just one error, which came on a reception. The senior also led the team with three blocks, two of which were solo efforts, and notched the second-most digs (eight).
Cornelius has been a key contributor in Crimson for three-plus seasons. She has averaged 2.32 kills per set over the course of her career, has totaled 326 blocks, and owns an attacking percentage of .264. The start of her final season in Cambridge has been no exception. For her efforts in the Fairfield Invitational, Cornelius was named to the All-Tournament team. Across all three contests, the veteran middle blocker added 33 kills, 22 digs, and nine blocks.
Junior middle blocker Maclaine Fields added onto Cornelius’ dominance by tallying eight kills of her own, and senior libero Anna Uhr notched nearly 20 digs.
The freshman class proved necessary in this matchup. Classmates Kate Condra, Bella Almanza, and Grace Varsames combined for 12 kills and 37 assists. Three of the nine players who saw the court in the tournament finale were rookies.
Two Stags notched double-digit kills (Mayda Garcia and Laura Seeger), and Alexis Rich tallied nearly all of Fairfield’s assists (35 of 40).
MICHIGAN STATE 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard ran into a hot Michigan State team in Saturday’s opener and succumbed in straight sets to the Spartans (9-1).
The Crimson had its best showing in the second game, which it lost, 25-21. Michigan State triumphed fairly easily in the other two—it won the first, 25-13, and picked up a nine-point victory in the final set. No Harvard player recorded double-digit kills, and aside from Cornelius’ seven, no one recorded more than three. Condra posted an impressive .429 attack percentage with seven total chances, as she picked up three kills and did not commit an error.
The Spartans found a good deal of success at the net. Only Meredith Norris and Julia Hatcher posted individual blocks, but the team also had 14 block assists. On the other hand, Cornelius had Harvard’s lone individual block, and the other nine players in the lineup combined for four block assists.
Four of Harvard’s five freshmen saw the court in this contest against a formidable opponent. Almanza recorded two kills, three digs, and one block assist, and Almanza and Varsames combined for 18 assists.
Michigan State’s lone loss came in its season opener at Tennessee, where it lost, 3-1. Since then, the Spartans have only lost three total sets, including no more than one in any match. Michigan State is the owner of a nine-game winning streak—the most recent three wins came in the form of a weekend sweep at the Fairfield Invitational.
This was the second game all-time that Harvard has played against Michigan State, and it has now dropped both. The other matchup happened on Sept. 8, 2007, when the Spartans defeated the Crimson, 3-1, at the Harvard Invitational.
HARVARD 3, CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE 2
Harvard’s most dramatic game of the weekend came in the opener. Unlike its easy dispatching of Fairfield or its quick loss to Michigan State, the Crimson battled with Central Connecticut State down to the final set.
This was no back-and-forth affair, either. After Harvard lost the first two sets by a combined 10 points, it rallied to take the third by a score of 25-20. However, it appeared as though the Blue Devils had the upper hand near the end of the fourth game. With a 23-21 lead, Central Connecticut State needed two points for a win and just one to force the game to go beyond the customary 25 points.
The Crimson had other plans in mind. It quickly tied the game at 23 apiece with the aid of an attacking error and a ball handling error from the Blue Devils. Then, Almanza came up in the clutch with two kills to steal the set.
Central Connecticut State kept it close in the deciding set, but its best position of the game was a 1-1 tie. After the first two points, Harvard maintained a lead until the ultimate 15-12 conclusion. In this crucial fifth game, the Crimson did not commit an error.
For the only time this weekend, Cornelius did not pace the squad in kills. That distinction went to Fields, who totaled 20. Cornelius added 14 of her own, and the team finished with an even 60. Fields’ .486 attack percentage was the highest among all players with more than one total attempt.
Once again, Almanza set up her teammates very well as she posted 30 assists. Fellow freshman Varsames and sophomore Mindie Mabry earned two aces apiece; the team ended the match with eight total aces. Three players posted high dig totals—sophomore Sandra Zang had 12, Mabry added 15, and Uhr collected an even 20.

Going into its sixth contest of the season at Providence, the Harvard women’s soccer team had yet to record a first-half goal. It was not a matter of being in an offensive drought — the Crimson had scored six times in five previous games, including four in an outburst against Syracuse. All tallies had just come after halftime.
That finally changed on Sunday afternoon when star midfielder and co-captain Leah Mohammadi found the back of the net in the 29th minute. Receiving a pass from freshman forward Sophie Hirst at the top of the box, Mohammadi unleashed an arcing shot that snuck in between the crossbar and the outstretched arms of Providence senior goalie Shelby Hogan.
Harvard managed to control play for much of the remainder of the half, earning its first halftime lead this season. The second frame, though, was all Friars. The home side put three shots past Crimson junior goalie Kat Hess to reverse the tide and ultimately pull away for the 3-1 victory.
With the loss, Harvard fell to 2-4-0 on the season while Providence improved to 5-2-0. The Crimson now has two more games to iron things out before beginning conference play, while Providence will look to continue its torrid start to the season, which includes a perfect 4-0-0 record at home.
“We wanted to start out strong today, and we did,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “We wanted to be aggressive to start out the game and dictate the pace of play, and we were able to do that. Now, we need to extend that mindset throughout the entire 90 minutes.”
Playing in their sixth contest in 17 days, the minutes and miles the Crimson players have recorded did seem to catch up to them as the game went on. The Friars, in comparison, took the field four times during that same period of time.
Providence, however, certainly had the firepower to win the game from the beginning. The Friars had only failed to score in one of its six previous contests, a road game at No. 3 North Carolina that they dropped by the narrow margin of 1-0.
“For them to come out of the gates and win four out of six, with their only losses against North Carolina and Duke, we knew they were a good team,” Hamblin said. “We tried to contain them but in the end just gave them too much space to operate in, especially in that second half.”
Junior defender Olivia Lucia and sophomore forward Hannah McNulty provided the goals for Providence, with McNulty bagging a brace. Lucia’s goal tied things up in the 54th minute, while McNulty’s first goal in the 76th minute, which came off of a rebound in the six-yard box, proved to be the winner. She then added a well-placed finish in the 81st minute to seal the game.
“They [Friars] were a really good team and came out with a good game plan to break us down in the second half,” said Harvard midfielder and co-captain Zayne Matulis. “We had our chances to respond, but all credit to them.”
There were still positives for the Crimson, as Hirst’s assist in the 29th minute represented the first one of her collegiate career. A highly touted recruit coming out of high school, the freshman now has two goals and an assist to her name through just four games.
“I’m really proud of how Sophie has come on and immediately made an impact,” Matulis said. “The freshman class as a whole has been great. Everyone has been learning quickly and really growing into their roles on the team.”
Senior goalie Danielle Etzel also extended her shutout streak to 311 minutes with a strong performance between the posts in the first half. She made two saves to keep Providence off the board in the first half. Harvard will continue to look for contributions across its squad, from the freshmen to the seniors, as Ivy play nears.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s said that when it rains it pours. In Eugene, Ore., during the DI NCAA Outdoor National Track and Field Championships, when it rained it hailed too.
Co-captain Gabby Thomas faced the elements to compete in the 200-meter final race. She placed second—one spot better than her finish in the previous two outdoor seasons at the national meet.
“It’s an improvement, not where I wanted to be this season, but I’m happy with it, I’m happy with second,” Thomas said. “Obviously I wanted to come in first, given where my season’s been and how I’ve been doing and how I’ve progressed.”
The finish follows Thomas’ collegiate record-breaking 200-meter dash in the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships Final. With the victory, Thomas became the first Ivy League sprinter to every hoist a National title in the indoor arena.
“It’s a little disappointing coming back from indoors to get second, but again, better than my last two years here,” Thomas said. “I’m not too upset about it.”
For her efforts in the race, Thomas was awarded USTFCCCA Northeast Women’s Track Athlete of the Year.
The NCAA race represented the end of the collegiate season, and with that conclusion most track athletes went home to rest after the two seasons (indoor and outdoor) of running. Thomas went to Switzerland.
“I have had a very long collegiate season, but I’m coming off of a really successful and motivating season as well,” Thomas said in a video interview with Harvard Athletics. “My indoor season went better than I could’ve expected for myself and then I had a pretty strong outdoor season just on upward spiral, consistently PR-ing which is what you want. This summer has just be a continuing of that.”
Competing in her first ever IAAF Diamond League race, Thomas hopped on a plan to Lausanne, Switzerland. Among the field of professionals, world champions and Olympians, was Shericka Jackson of Jamaica—an Olympian that donned the bronze medal in 400-meter and the silver in the 4x400-meter relay at the game in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.
In the Diamond League race on July 5, Thomas claimed gold. She defeated the field by .21 seconds running a 22.47 race. Jackson fell to third and the next closest American, Kimberlyn Duncan, finished fifth.
The race was the beginning of a five-meet summer saga and two months of travel for the athlete that culminated in a final race in Brussels.
Next in the itinerary was a dip into Morocco. Racing in Rabat, Thomas’ second race wasn’t as golden as her first. In the 200-meter final, the Harvard co-captain competed in a heat that featured a meet-record time of 22.29. Thomas placed in fourth with a 22.70 race. The finish fell .1 seconds behind the fastest American present, Jenna Prandini.
Prandini was not just the fastest American present at the race that day, on June 24, Prandini won the USA Championships in the 200-meter dash. She is the fastest 200-meter runner in America, period.
The IAAF Diamond League London race told a more dramatic story. Thomas began the race slow, falling near the pack of the pack by the 100-meter mark. A surge on the straightaway propelled the Florence, Mass., native to the front of the pack, just in time to grab the silver medal. The 22.19 finish represents a personal best for Thomas. Only Prandini — also setting a personal best — outpaced the senior with a 22.16 race.
July turned into August and Thomas just kept running against the best in the world. Thomas finished in sixth at Birmingham and then again at the Diamond League final in Brussels — both times one spot behind Prandini.
“It’s really exciting because I didn’t actually plan on going to the Diamond League final and finishing my season so late, but I had a good bit of success in the earlier half of the summer,” Thomas told Harvard Athletics. “This summer definitely helps in terms of a lot of growth and maturity, a lot of self-reflection, a lot of growing this summer. With all this competition at all of these meets comes a lot of experience.”

As shopping week comes to a close, you might be panicking because you’re overloading on too many hard classes or haven’t found that schedule balance yet. Never fear, because Flyby is here to help! Take a look below at some of Harvard’s gem-iest (meaning easiest) gen-eds —  perfect filler classes for an easy time and a wholesome take on valuable education.
The Ancient Greek Hero: Mythology and Facing Death
With a 2.3 hour workload per week, it’s hard to find a course more gemmy than this one. For class assignments, all you have to do is write five “creative” papers, each no more than a page or two. Other than that, just sit back and enjoy the mythical teachings of this almost mythical class with the legendary Greg Nagy!
The Incas: The Last Great Empire of Pre-Columbian South America
Learn about one of the great ancient civilizations of the world while relaxing for most of the semester! With one midterm, two short mid-semester assignments, and a take-home final, this course will certainly fit well with your otherwise hectic schedule. “The Incas” fulfills Societies of the World, Study of the Past, and even United States in the World.
SWEDISH AA: Beginning Swedish Language and Literature
If you need to fulfill your language requirement, take a look at introductory Swedish! With a low hourly workload (4.2 hours) compared to other languages and a series of raving reviews in the comments section of the Q guide, you should certainly check out out this language gem. As one reviewer put it, this class is “SO GOOD, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.”
The British Empire
Want something that boasts a light workload yet provides genuinely interesting material? As the course catalogue puts it, this class “surveys the empire's extraordinary rise and fall from the American Revolution to World War II.” With so many extraordinary events and cultural legacies covered in this class, you will learn a great deal of valuable history. Beware however: The class is lotteried, so enroll quickly!

We’ve all committed these classic newbie offenses early on in our Harvard careers. But now we’re no longer so naive, and instead, we are very jaded and tired. You’ll understand in a few months. But for now, try not to be one of these rude kids:
The Sidewalk Block
You have to get to the class you’re shopping, the party your friend with the upperclassman connection tells you that you just have to go to, or one of the twelve extracurriculars you signed up for at the activities fair. We get it, there are a lot of buildings on campus and you haven’t been here for very long. But for the love of Gregory Mankiw (or as you first years think of him, God) please don’t stop in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking everyone, to discuss directions with your newly inseparable group of friends.
The Loud, the Drunk, and the Obnoxious
You’re singing when you leave the Igloo at 2 a.m. with your roomies. College is truly the best time of your life, and no one can bring you down, not while you’re at your optimal buzz. Unfortunately, people do live in the Quad and around all the other party spaces, and your spot-on rendition of In My Feelings by Drake is not exactly music to our ears.
The Keychain Carrier
You worked so hard to get into Harvard, and now that you’re here you feel the need to rep your school with the keychain that totally would never be available to people who go here. However, if you’re walking around here with a backpack, we know you go here, and using the lanyard is now the equivalent of tattooing the word freshman across your forehead. You are not at summer camp anymore, please get a new keychain or carry it in a less conspicuous spot.
So if you recognize yourself in these descriptions, do yourself, and the rest of us, a favor and stop. Let this be the last time we have to tell you: Dude, that’s rude.
