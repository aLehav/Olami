After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jon Stewart, a comedian and former longtime host of “The Daily Show,” advocated for increased support for veterans and first responders at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Friday afternoon.
Stewart has often urged Congress to pass legislation improving health care access and boosting funding for veterans and 9/11 first responders, frequently traveling to the U.S. Capitol to speak with lawmakers in person. Harvard Kennedy School students Grace Y. Park and Soren T. Duggan, who both previously served in the U.S. Army, moderated the discussion with Stewart.
Stewart said he was inspired to advocate for first responders while living in lower Manhattan, where he witnessed the work of emergency workers and volunteers firsthand during the 9/11 attacks.
“I was so appreciative of everything that they were giving and so devastated by what we were all feeling,” Stewart said. “When I found out the struggles that they were having based on this selfless giving that they had done, I tried to turn that fury into something positive.”
Stewart said he vocally opposed the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on “The Daily Show” and began visiting injured troops at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He said his trips to the hospital helped him understand that “the value of this country — in terms of its military, in terms of all of it — is in its human capital.”
“Once you begin to recognize that, you become even more certain that the decisions that are made that affect [service members’] lives and their families’ lives are sometimes made frivolously — and without concern for the cost to that human capital,” he said.
But despite Stewart’s advocacy for first responders and veterans, he said he would not label himself a “patriot.”
“I always really shy away from the types of labels that are reductive,” Stewart said. “I don’t suggest that I’m a patriot.”
“What I do suggest is, I care deeply,” he added.
Stewart also drew a distinction between supporting military service members and supporting the actions they are ordered to carry out in fulfilling their duty.
He added that the United States is often "performative in its patriotism," saying that "there is nothing that we won’t do for our fighting men and women" except take care of their needs.
A nation’s capacity to care for its servicemen is the “lowest hanging fruit” and a marker of its ability to provide for the welfare of the general population, according to Stewart.
“If we can’t do it for them, what chance do the rest of us have?” he said.
Stewart also said it was a struggle to convince Congress to pass laws supporting veterans.
“They will do almost anything, to not have to do almost anything,” Stewart said about members of Congress. “They’ll always look for little ways to back off of doing the right thing or something that might cost some extra money.”
In his closing remarks, Stewart said the government system is “incentivized to be adversarial to the people” and propped up by hundreds of dedicated legislative aides.
“You are going to be those people,” Stewart said. “You are the glue, foundation, and everything. Trust me, what you’re going to do will matter.
“So get a ‘B’ at least,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 50 students gathered outside University Hall on Sunday for a march and vigil in remembrance of the migrant workers who died during preparations for this year’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
The World Cup, which occurs every four years, began Sunday. Attendees at the protest, which was organized by Nepali and Nepali-American students at Harvard, denounced FIFA for turning a blind eye to the work conditions faced by migrant workers ahead of the World Cup.
According to a New York Times investigation published earlier this month, at least 2,100 Nepali migrant workers hired for construction linked to the tournament have died in Qatar since 2010. In that time, hundreds of thousands of Nepali workers have been employed on the $220 billion project.
During the march, students chanted and displayed signs that read “People Over Profit” and “The Ugly Side of World Cup.” The protest, which took place in Harvard Square, ended with a vigil and open mic session on the steps of Widener Library.
The gathering was spearheaded by Kashish Bastola ’26 and Ang Sonam Sherpa ’23, who said the goal of the march was both to raise awareness about the experiences of the migrant workers and to pay respect to the workers themselves.
Bastola said the tournament “brings the world together” but is built on “human rights violations and abuses.”
“There have been similar human rights violations and abuses that FIFA has tried to address through their human rights advisory board, but obviously nothing has happened,” Bastola said. “Nothing has changed.”
In a statement to The Crimson, FIFA said the organization “does not accept any abuse of workers by companies involved in the preparation and delivery of the FIFA World Cup 2022.”
“FIFA is steadfast in its commitment to ensure respect for internationally recognised human rights across all its operations and events in accordance with FIFA’s Human Rights Policy and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,” they wrote.
“With that in mind, FIFA is implementing an unprecedented due diligence process in relation to the protection of workers involved in the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022,” they added. “The robustness of this programme has been recognised repeatedly by experts and trade unions over the years reaching the highest international standards in terms of health and safety.”
Co-organizer Nabin Poudel ’24 said in an interview that the display was intended to be “more than a protest.”
“It’s a march to remember the lives that we’ve lost, and also to raise the awareness, to let the people know that the World Cup that’s currently happening — that people are celebrating — was built on the backs of literal people,” Poudel said.
Bastola said organizing the event also fostered solidarity among Nepali students at Harvard.
“There’s relatively few of us on campus in the first place,” Bastola said. “We all already know each other, but organizing and working to bring awareness to this issue has brought us, I would say, even closer and in very meaningful ways.”
Sherpa, who hails from Nepal, said it was a “very nice experience for the whole Nepali community to come together” in support of a common cause.
“It’s not really limited to the Nepali community at all,” Sherpa added. “We have reached out to the wider South Asian community, and all the responses have been incredible.”
Arjun Bhattarai ’24, who spoke at the vigil, said he appreciated the support from students in other campus affinity groups, including the Harvard South Asian Association, Harvard College Pakistani Student Association, and Harvard Ghungroo.
“We were really glad to see the solidarity,” Bhattarai said. “There are people in campus — there are people around — who want this issue to be raised.”
Correction: November 21, 2022:
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Arjun Bhattarai ’24 thanked the Harvard Saudi Student Association for its support at Sunday’s vigil. In fact, Bhattarai thanked the Harvard South Asian Association for its support.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s tenth annual Sex Week, an annual weeklong series of events featuring discussions on sex and intimacy, concluded Sunday evening.
During the last week, Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College, a student organization, hosted events on advocacy and education — opting for a more intersectional approach to the series than in past years.
SHEATH co-presidents Ash R. Johnson ’25 and Jane J. Josefowicz ’25, said they decided to shift the focus of Sex Week following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion in June. This year, Sex Week included a lecture on transgender healthcare, discussions and films on surviving sexual assault, and a mixer for queer Black students.
“It was important for us to switch the tone of what Sex Week has been in the past and what it should be in the future,” Johnson said. “We definitely took more of an advocacy and education approach this year.”
Johnson added that they specifically aimed to make the events more supportive for those whose reproductive rights have been restricted.
“We had to really go back to our roots with everything that happened over the summer and also trying to make Sex Week as inclusive as possible, especially for the LGBTQIA+ community,” they said. “We were trying to uplift the queer community and the trans community, trying to uplift intersectional communities, especially the black queer community.”
Several of the events also aimed to build solidarity, Johnson said.
“These are communities that are constantly in danger, so it is important to have unity,” they said. “We form ties, and that’s integral to having a strong community that can endure the danger that faces it.”
SHEATH kept its tradition of holding some light-hearted events, including a new introductory strip-teasing class in the Currier Dance Studio and an event on bondage, titled “Show Me the Ropes.”
Johnson also recognized the limitations that come with an advocacy-centered Sex Week.
“It can be difficult organizing when you know that you are organizing for a subset of the Harvard community and not the whole community,” Johnson said. “It’s often more of a self-selecting demographic.”
Although SHEATH organized the events, other campus organization also celebrated Sex Week. The Office of BGLTQ+ Student Life sent out daily emails for their “Queer Sex Ed” initiative, including information on sexually transmitted infections.
Johnson said they were grateful for the involvement of other campus organizations that have used Sex Week as a way to center conversations around sexual education and health.
Johnson also said they hope the events empower students and attendees to achieve a greater sense of bodily autonomy.
“Open-mindedness is the main thing that we do,” Johnson said. “We’re very ‘in your face’ type of advocacy, but I want people to walk away with the idea that other people exist in their bodies as sexual beings.”
“They’re allowed to do things that they want to do for whatever reason that they want to do them, and there’s power in that,” they added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of Harvard alumni flocked to campus to watch the Crimson take on its rival — the Yale Bulldogs — on Saturday.
While some alumni flew in from as far away as Florida, others drove less than 15 minutes to watch the 138th rendition of The Game. Regardless of how they traveled to Harvard Stadium, alumni arrived excited to relive old memories.
Darren J. “DJ” Langis ’90, whose daughter is a sophomore at the College, said it has been “wonderful to be back.”
“The University and the alumni community has been tremendous in terms of welcoming all the alumni back to the game,” he said. “It’s been great catching up with fellow graduates and teammates. I think that the atmosphere has been electric all day.”
After winning The Game in 2021 with a last-minute comeback, Harvard suffered a 19-14 loss to Yale on Saturday. Despite the defeat, alumni said they enjoyed their weekend back on campus.
Jeffrey S. “Jeff” Bartel ’88, who attended the Harvard-Yale matchup with his family, wrote in an email after Harvard’s loss that “​​the experience of The Game is more important than the game outcome itself.”
“The history of the matchup, the sense of camaraderie among and even between the schools, and the belonging one feels to come back to Harvard’s campus are palpable,” Bartel added. “It’s really a special event in my life and the lives of tens of thousands of others who attended or attend Harvard.”
Harvard has not hosted The Game since 2018, when the rival schools dueled at Fenway Park. The two schools last clashed at Harvard Stadium in 2016.
Stuart M. Johnson ’18 — who was a defensive tackle for the Crimson — said Harvard-Yale weekend is “truly unlike any other college environment that I’ve ever been to.”
Between attending the tailgates and seat-hopping in the stadium, Johnson, a student at Fordham Law in New York City, ran into several friendly faces that reminded him of his time at the College.
“You see familiar faces and it feels weird a little bit because I’m like, ‘Wow, I've been away from school for a very long time,’” he said.
“Being back here is just amazing,” he added. “It’s a little surreal.”
Karen D. “Kiki” Snyder ’92 choked up remembering the photo she and her dad, an alum, took at the stadium during her junior year in 1990.
“I’m with a bunch of friends,” she said. “It’s nice to be here.”
With limited tickets available for entry into The Game, Paul E. Mawn ’63 found his way into the stadium by returning to his post as a trumpet player for the Harvard Band.
“I couldn’t get a ticket,” he said. “So I played in the band.”
Strolling through the stadium concourse dressed in a Crimson band blazer with instrument in hand, Mawn reminisced on previous games he has witnessed at Harvard Stadium.
“I was at the ’[68] 29-29 game,” he said. “It’s the most famous Harvard football game ever played where they played three touchdowns in the last two minutes or so.
“It was mind boggling,” Mawn added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During its weekly meeting Sunday, the Harvard Undergraduate Association reflected on several recently completed projects, including a Declaration Day event and the debut of a turkey mascot at Saturday’s Harvard-Yale game.
HUA Co-President LyLena D. Estabine ’24 praised the new mascot initiative as a success, deeming it a “great catalyst” for student spirit and input.
The HUA asked passersby to vote on their mascot preferences by placing ping pong balls in labeled bins at a tailgate for undergraduates before Saturday’s game.
Options included the turkey, a lobster, and Remy the cat, a local housecat that frequents Harvard’s grounds. Students crowned Remy the winner by a wide margin.
Estabine said the HUA will coordinate with Remy’s owners and Harvard Athletics to honor the students’ wishes, though the next steps for adopting the new mascot were unclear.
HUA officers also celebrated the completion of another pilot project — Friday’s Declaration Day event — which commemorated the deadline for sophomores to declare an academic concentration.
The celebration welcomed students and faculty to the steps of Memorial Church for refreshments and photo opportunities.
Speaking at the event last week, Estabine clarified that it was not intended to replace house or concentration-specific Declaration Day celebrations, but instead serve as a “kick-off” event.
“Last night at midnight, all of the concentration declarations were due,” Estabine said. “This morning is a way to say ‘woohoo you did it!’”
Academics Officer Shikoh M. Hirabayashi ’24-’25, who oversees the team that coordinated the event, said his goal was to facilitate interaction across academic fields.
“We wanted to bring more people together from all different concentrations and allow people to meet people from other concentrations too,” Hirabayashi said.
At Sunday's meeting, HUA members also discussed proposals to reduce the financial burden of textbooks, including an idea to facilitate book donations. The HUA ultimately voted to return the proposal back to the Academic Team for further deliberation.
Only one more general meeting is slated to take place this year, on Dec. 4th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square businesses welcomed crowds of visitors last weekend for the first Harvard-Yale football game in Cambridge since 2016.
Thousands of Harvard and Yale students, alumni, and other affiliates flooded the streets of Cambridge over the weekend, revisiting staples like Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs and exploring newer businesses.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, described The Game as one of the “highlights” of the fall season.
“The weather is going to be good," she said. "It's beautiful football weather, and our businesses are gearing up."
Jillson also discussed the importance of the weekend for businesses in the Square, adding that The Game provides a “positive financial impact.”
“We need to be prepared for [game day] and as we head into the holiday season,” she said. “It’s critical. This is a big weekend, and we look forward to it.”
Adam DiCenso, one of the owners of Pinocchio’s, said the restaurant prepared in advance for the weekend by ordering more supplies and adding staff.
“Ever since restrictions have been let up and the students have been pretty much back to somewhat normalcy here, we've been much busier overall than we were prior to Covid,” DiCenso said. “Also knowing that there hadn't been a Harvard-Yale game here at Harvard since 2016 — those two factors led us to believe that it was going to be extremely busy.”
The Harvard Shop, a student-run business, prepared for a potential staff shortage by offering bonuses to students who worked on game day, per Managing Director Thomas J. Garity ’25.
“I know that it is a bit of a sacrifice to work at the Harvard Shop when all your friends might be going to the tailgates or the game itself,” Garity said. “We anticipated it might be difficult to staff, and we are eternally grateful for everybody who decided to sign up for a shift that day.”
Mimo Peres, a cashier at Wholesome Fresh, said the store saw no significant boost in shoppers over the weekend.
“It's not that much difference — just a little bit, honestly — because we are usually always busy,” he said. “The only difference is that I saw familiar faces from two years ago.”
DiCenso, who has worked at Pinocchio’s for almost 40 years, said he enjoyed reacquainting with alumni and former customers who visited the Square for The Game.
“It's really nice to see all of the old faces of the alumni,” he said. “It's just nice to see people and catch up with people and find out where they're living and see them with their children.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 138th rendition of the Harvard-Yale football game on Saturday only lasted a few hours, leaving Crimson fans disappointed by a 19-14 loss. But for Harvard students, The Game was an all-day affair featuring tailgates and turkeys.
Students and alumni alike milled about Mignone Field for the official Harvard tailgate, which served burgers, hot dogs, and several side dishes.
Lucas H. Amory ’24, who had not attended a football game since the Harvard versus Brown game in 2021, said “the energy has been kind of impeccable.”
“Between yesterday and today, just being able to run into a lot of people that I feel like I forgot existed pre-pandemic that I knew then, that’s really just been the highlight of the entire thing,” he said.
In addition to the College-sponsored tailgate, hundreds of students descended on the lawn outside the Malkin Athletic Center for an unofficial tailgate hosted by Harvard's final clubs, including the Porcellian and the Bee.
Ryan P. Tierney ’24, who attended the unofficial tailgate, said it served as a “good replacement” for Harvard’s official undergraduate tailgate, which took flack from students for restrictions on alcohol distribution.
“The MAC lawn served as a pretty controlled area where everyone could be relatively safe,” he said. “Could have been a lot worse.”
In the week leading up to The Game, students criticized the University’s restrictions on tailgating, voicing concerns that parties would just move off-campus. A Harvard spokesperson defended the restrictions, writing in an emailed statement that the University was working hard to ensure students have a safe place to engage in festivities.
Turkeys were also sighted at Saturday’s tailgates — though not Cambridge’s regular feathered friends. The Harvard Undergraduate Association piloted the turkey as a new mascot at Saturday’s game.
HUA co-president LyLena D. Estabine ’24, who was polling students on ideas for a new Harvard mascot at the tailgate, said the turkey was introduced at The Game “just to get students excited.”
“This would not replace the Crimson branding,” she said. “This is simply an extra element for student engagement and school spirit here at Harvard, similar to the Stanford tree.”
Allen Y. Zhang ’26, however, was less fond of the turkey mascots.
“I love the energy here — my only problem in this game is I see too many turkey mascots,” he said. “I’d rather have the cat as our mascot, Remy the cat.”
During The Game — which has served as the site of student protests — Harvard undergraduates representing an array of advocacy groups unfurled large banners with messages for the University to “DIVEST.”
Brit G. Shrader ’24, an organizer with the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, said the banners were meant to raise “awareness about Harvard’s implicitness in the prison industrial complex.”
“We wanted to disrupt this narrative of The Game and get people thinking about Harvard’s investments in human rights abuses and other things throughout the world,” they said.
Syd D. Sanders ’24, a member of the Palestine Solidarity Committee, added that the demonstration was “a targeted critique at specific things like land grabs in Brazil, and Israeli apartheid in Palestine, and the funding for the US military and companies that use prison labor.”
Harvard University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the protest.
Watching The Game from the stands, Talya W.K. Li ’24 offered a concise summary of the Harvard-Yale weekend.
“The people are great — the football is kind of mid,” she said.

POV: Two wayside Midwesterners with South Asian heritage are so moved by the joys of H Mart that they are inspired to become playwrights. Find Flyby’s original off-Broadway debut below:
Maya: a Flyby writer and first-year from Kentucky, has never been to an Asian grocery store other than Patel Brothers (an iconic and chaotic Indian grocery store) and is hoping to find snack paradise in Central Square.
Sneha: a Flyby writer and first-year from Indiana (and also tangentially Kentucky), has a pan-Asian grocery store back home and believes that makes her an expert on H Mart without ever having visited.
WE OPEN on a bustling Massachusetts Avenue that cuts through the heart of Central Square as two overly excited Flyby compers, Maya and Sneha, emerge from the dark depths of the T stop across from H Mart. As they jaywalk across the street, Maya and Sneha discuss their destination.
Maya: This is a general Asian grocery store right? Like a bunch of different types of Asian foods?
Sneha: Yeah, I think so.
Spoiler: It was not, in fact, a pan-Asian grocery store.
Sneha: This is way bigger than I expected. I’m getting Patel Brothers vibes.
For those not in the know, Patel Brothers is an Indian grocery store chain that sells spices and yummy snacks to the masses starving for food with flavor. It is, however, rarely owned by brothers with the last name Patel.
Maya: It’s way too organized to be a Patel Brothers. (Maya stops in front of a fridge.) SNEHA, LOOK! (points excitedly to a Yakult drink) I’m having my Lara Jean (of “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”) moment.
Sneha: (picks up Aloe water) How much aloe vera juice should you drink?
She gets no response.
END SCENE
THE TWO WANDERING FRESHMEN find an aisle in which to take aesthetic pictures to commemorate the moment. Since we last left them, Maya and Sneha have figured out camera angles and are orienting their phones to conveniently avoid capturing the other H Mart visitors in their photo evidence. Maya and Sneha are currently positioned next to jars of cabbage and hot sauce.
Sneha: POV: you beeline to find the pickle aisle.
Maya: Look!!! SRIRACHA! This is, like, everyone’s introduction to Asian culture. Imagine if you brought this into Berg.
Sneha briefly contemplates this idea and then concludes that giving the people what they want — i.e. seasoned food — would cause spontaneous combustion from happiness and give the Cambridge Fire Department more trouble than the kids in Matthews on Friday night. She’s not sure she wants to be like the kids in Matthews. She slowly places the jar back on the shelf and walks further down the aisle.
Maya: (looking around at more East Asian products) I think we’re the wrong brand of Asian.
Sneha: I know, right? I don’t know what half of this stuff is. And where’s the Maggi?
A helpful introduction for those who haven’t heard of Maggi before: Maggi is an addictive Indian ramen. Sneha is regularly berated by her friends for eating such food that damages her liver, but frankly she doesn’t care because it tastes so good.
Maya: There has to be one packet… somewhere…but we’ve already been down every aisle twice
Maya and Sneha spiral through the five stages of grief as they try and fail to find Maggi in H Mart.
Maya: It has to be here. It has to be here.
Camilla Cabello’s “Crying in the Club” plays in the background.
Sneha: Where is the Maggi? They have twenty types of pasta that’s not even Asian. They must have Maggi. There’s no way they don’t have it.
The two are still in denial.
END SCENE
MAYA AND SNEHA again get lost in H Mart. (Insert a “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” style montage here. Highlights are featured in the scene below.)
Sneha: (gesturing at a wall of seaweed) AH SEAWEED!!
Maya: But what are all these flavors?
Sneha: (attempting to Google Translate the labels on the seaweed packets) How is something sunshine flavored?
Maya: (distracted by another aisle) Wait, look at these tiny utensils!
Maya and Sneha contemplate getting tiny teaspoons they will never use. Yes, they each buy a set.
Maya: (gesturing at a section of flavored ranch): What Asian food requires ranch?
*in Spongebob voice: sOmE hOuRs lAter*
Maya finds some slimming tea, marketed “for both men and women,” and begins cackling. It’s perfectly understandable; they have wandered into this aisle ten times now.
Sneha: I think this entire place is mostly beverages.
Maya: Is soy soup a tea? Why is it next to the tea when all the other soup is in the next aisle?
Sneha: All soup is tea.
END SCENE
THE H MART NEWBIES decide that their journey has come to an end and exit H Mart, musing on their experience.
Sneha: This was like if Aldi and Trader Joe’s had a baby and raised it in Asia.
Maya: (trying her Yakult) Wait, this tastes like Gogurt but better!
As Maya looks for her Peter Kavinsky, she and Sneha walk to the T-stop and descend out of the brightness of H Mart into a dark world once more.
FIN.
