After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“She won’t say a word,” but that’s only part of why seven-year old Hanna Jensen is so creepy. In Zoje Stage’s debut, “Baby Teeth,” Hanna tries to get rid of Mommy, Suzette, so that Hanna can have all of Daddy’s love. The use of children in horror is common (“Rosemary’s Baby,” “The Shining,” “Children of the Corn,” the list goes on), but Stage adds a twist by writing half of the chapters from Hanna’s perspective. However, Hanna’s narrative voice is confusing, as it is filled with childlike metaphors, impressive vocabulary words for her age, and mature ideas. Furthermore, Stage forgoes the usual thriller trope of ending with a big bang and instead uses the last 50 pages to discuss the parents’ feelings about their child and each other rather than implementing any action.

Hanna has a twisted view of her father, believing that “when she grew up she’d marry him, and then Mommy wouldn’t be competition anymore.” But until then, Hanna wants her mother gone. At first, she tries to scare her mother off. Hanna speaks for the first time, but in a perfect French accent claiming to be a dead witch. When the scare tactics don’t work, Hanna moves on to more dire measures to physically harm her mother. Stage manages to make these moments of harm terrifying through Suzette’s perspective, even though readers already have a good idea of what will happen after reading Hanna’s preparations. However, some of the creepy things Hanna does are uncalled for and uncomfortable to read, even for fans of horror. Several times Hanna describes her parents having sex, which is unsettling to read through the lens of a seven-year old. Even more disturbing is when Suzette walks in on Hanna moaning and acting as if she is having sex with someone beneath the sheets. Suzette, horrified, asks what is going on, to which Hanna replies, “That’s how I get my power. From the devil, when he comes to me.” Although this scene succeeds in being scary, Stage has gone too far to achieve the horror by unnecessary sexualizing a child.

Hanna’s narrative voice is chilling, but after awhile, it begins to lose its effect due to its inconsistencies. For one, Hanna is able to pull off some remarkable feats: opening childproof medicine bottles, understanding that medicine capsules can be popped opened, and using the computer for research on witches and spells. There are comparisons a child would make, but written in words an adult would use, such as when Hanna feels like “the whole house was on a seesaw that wouldn’t level out.” Hanna uses words like “abyss” and “spontaneous combustion”—words that feel out of place among the constant talk of Mommy and Daddy. These words break the flow of Hanna’s chapters, making it difficult to immerse oneself in the narrative.

The most disappointing part is that by the halfway point of the novel, most of the exciting moments have already passed. Sure, there is an incident involving Hanna hurting her mother, but the last chunk of the book is dedicated to visits to a therapist and discussions between Mommy and Daddy about their relationship before and after having Hanna. There is much explaining of why, clinically, Hanna may be acting out in these ways and lots of kissing between the parents as they discuss the situation. The novel’s name and the sudden mention of teeth towards the end imply that something big, and teeth related, will happen before the novel’s conclusion. This is not so, however, and the last chapters of the novel fall completely flat.

At the novel’s peak, the excitement and the horror are excellent. Unfortunately, this is unsustainable, due to both lack of action and use of uncomfortable or inappropriate tactics. Hanna’s voice just doesn’t ring true, which makes it difficult for readers to lose themselves in the more terrifying moments of the narrative. Though at times chilling, “Baby Teeth” could have been so much more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It bemuses me that some absolve non-white people of racism. They declare point-blank, “It’s literally impossible to be racist to a white person.” “Racism against white people doesn’t exist.”
I suppose that as an Asian American, I would qualify as a recipient of this exemption. While that could be convenient, I don’t think I — or any other person of color — should deserve such an exemption. I’m sure, for example, that I can be racist (I imagine some might call me that from reading this column), and I’d like to be engaged in conversation if I mess up, perhaps by making a distasteful remark.
The debate about whether all people can be racist stems from different definitions of “racism.” One camp subscribes to the standard dictionary definition: racism is “prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one’s own race is superior.” There are no restrictions on which races can be the instigators and what magnitude of disdain counts as “superiority.”
Another camp thinks primarily of institutional racism and factors in a person’s power to use their racist beliefs against others. As one African-American lead character from the 2014 movie “Dear White People” argues, “Black people can’t be racist. Prejudiced, yes, but not racist. Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. Black people can’t be racists since we don’t stand to benefit from such a system.”
What a convoluted way to absolve oneself of possible racist fault. Under this definition, yes, black individuals can’t be racist. The system is rigged in favor of white people, who have traditionally been in power. But the strange implication of this statement is that being called “prejudiced” isn’t as bad as being called a “racist” — although racism can manifest itself as prejudice, and though prejudice surely is not desired either. So Sam’s argument achieves the linguistic triumph of avoiding the label “racist,” but that’s about it.
This argument’s main point — that minorities can’t be racist because they have no power to act on such antagonism — is also reductive. We shouldn’t have to take stock of each other’s race and relative power in society before making a judgment on an act itself. We shouldn’t have to condone prejudice or discrimination against anyone, for any reason.
Racism is individual, not just institutional. As individuals, we all have the power to hurt one another. However, though power dynamics of race in our society shouldn’t absolve some races from the ability to be racist, they should affect how we determine degrees of racism. I’d argue that, on average, a racist comment would cause a white person less harm or fear than it would cause a black person. I’m not sure how exactly one could measure that, but white people have it easier in America, and that shouldn’t be a controversial statement.
Consider the recent controversy involving Sarah Jeong, a writer of Asian descent, whose colorful tweets against white people were dug up after the New York Times’ editorial board hired her. Such tweets included: “oh man it’s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men”; “fuck white women lol”; “dumbass fucking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants.” While not condoning her tweets, The Times stood by Jeong, who also issued her own statement.
This seemed like the best resolution. I thought it was important, as the Times did, to deny the right-wing trolls who are orchestrating smear campaigns to get journalists fired and to reserve judgment of their employees for what they actually do at their jobs.
But the tweets were pretty racist. I didn’t see the point of those insisting that Jeong’s tweets weren’t racist at all and that she had nothing to apologize for, because “there was no sense of threat associated” with her jokes. After winning this round, since Jeong wasn’t fired, refusing to budge an inch and admit some wrongdoing is not a good look for the left.
Because there’s no scenario in which racism is not a bad thing. If some extremists won’t engage in good faith, we can’t force them. But at least among the rest of us, we can do better. We shouldn’t need to compare how a possible act of racism would differ if perpetrated against blacks, whites, or Asians just to understand if it’s wrong. We shouldn’t allow some people to indulge in their racism just because they may not have any power to systematically discriminate against other groups. Let’s acknowledge the existence of so-called “reverse racism” and the existence of degrees of racism. Otherwise, discourse around race will become a race to the bottom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow and several Harvard professors spoke out this week against an Environmental Protection Agency rule that proposes making scientific data public, co-signing a public letter that asserts the rule would sow “confusion and chaos.”
The letter, sent to acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler on Tuesday, criticizes a proposal dubbed “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science.” Introduced in April 2018, that rule suggests the EPA should make all data used to support scientific studies that inform its regulations available to the public.
The letter’s signatories argue this proposal would “cripple” the EPA’s ability to rely on many scientific studies because such studies often include confidential patient data. If approved, the rule would disqualify these kinds of studies from EPA consideration, the letter states.
“Without the ability to protect and respect patient/human subject privacy and confidentiality, signatories and other researchers would not be able to conduct the studies that are pivotal to their work and to EPA’s ability to fulfill its statutory duty to protect public health,” the letter said.
Harvard Law School Professor Wendy B. Jacobs wrote the letter on behalf of the Law School’s Environmental Law and Policy Clinic. She signed it along with Bacow, various Harvard professors, and doctors from several University schools and affiliated hospitals.
The letter also asserts the new rule would prevent the EPA from using past studies for which data is no longer available, as well as some studies already incorporated into EPA policies. The signatories listed several studies the EPA relied on in the past that they claim contain protected health information.
In the final weeks of her term, former University President Drew G. Faust also penned a letter to then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt decrying the proposed policy. In her letter, Faust called the suggestion “fundamentally flawed.”
Tuesday’s letter noted the proposed rule would break with years of precedent at the EPA.
“This proposed requirement contravenes five decades of EPA practice,” the letter reads. “[The] EPA has repeatedly affirmed that its mission requires it to rely on the best available scientific evidence, without ever asserting that it should exclude from consideration studies for which the underlying data were not publicly available.”
Jacobs and the other signatories submitted the letter near the close of the designated comment period for the proposed rule. That comment period ends August 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria will step down from the board of directors of Tata Sons when his term ends next month.
Nohria communicated to Tata leadership that he will not seek an extension on his directorship term, a top Tata group executive told The Business Standard. Nohria first joined the board on a five-year term as a non-executive board member in September 2013.
Tata Sons is the holding company of Tata Group, an India-based multinational conglomerate which includes companies such as Jaguar Land Rover — developers of luxury automobiles and off-road vehicles.
Business School spokesperson Jim Aisner ’68 confirmed Nohria’s decision to leave Tata’s board of directors. In an email Thursday, Aisner wrote that Business School faculty members often “have a changing portfolio of board service.”
“In addition, like his colleagues, Dean Nohria takes seriously the responsibilities of board membership, including the ability to participate in meetings in person,” Aisner wrote. “This was a concern, given the required travel to India.”
This move comes nearly a year after Nohria, 56, emerged as a leading contender to replace former University President Drew G. Faust as Harvard’s 29th President. The Harvard Corporation eventually selected Lawrence S. Bacow in February.
Nohria is also as a board member of Piramal Realty, a subsidiary of Mumbai-based Piramal Group, which owns businesses across the life sciences, healthcare, and glass packaging industries.
