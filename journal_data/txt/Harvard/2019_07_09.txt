After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This spring, the Harvard Art Museums received a gift of 70 of the late modern artist Otto Piene’s sketchbooks dating from 1935 to 2014. Piene co-founded the Düsseldorf-based collective Group ZERO in 1957 and directed the MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies from 1974 to 1994. He specialized in traditional media as well as kinetic and technology-based works, including several paintings and sculptures already part of Harvard’s collection.
“Throughout Piene’s career, sketching was a generative site for visionary large-scale projects and for material experimentation,” curator Lynette Roth said in the museums’ press release. Roth, the Daimler Curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum and Head of the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art, encountered Piene’s extensive archive while sourcing an early sketchbook for an exhibition last year, “Inventur—Art in Germany, 1943–55.”
Donated by Piene’s wife, poet and author Elizabeth Goldring, the sketchbooks also contain depictions of landscapes and family portraits. Goldring’s gift includes a variety of Piene’s markers and pens, which will aid in the sketchbooks’ preservation.
“We are really trying for the museums to be an interdisciplinary teaching site for Harvard,” said Martha Tedeschi, the Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums. “He’s a great locus for mining: an artist who was far ahead of his time in thinking about art and science and the way they feed each other.”
While the museums will appoint a curatorial fellow to formally study the sketchbooks, students, faculty, and visitors alike can interact with nearly any of the collection’s holdings in its Art Study Center by making an appointment on its website.
“One of the avenues that has been kind of a hallmark of the Harvard Art Museums for decades has been research into artistic techniques and materials,” said Tedeschi.
Working mostly in colored marker, Piene tested concepts as well as methods, sometimes over and over again.
“He allows the ink to really bleed through,” Roth said. “When you flip through them, which is something we encourage in the Art Study Center, you can see how the development of the idea continues through the pages.”
Goldring cited the museums’ educational resources as a major reason for donating to Harvard.
“Sketchbooks are intimate, so being able to look at them in the conditions in the Study Center would be very good,” she said. “I’m very happy that there will be a fellow doing research on aspects of the sketchbooks, and that they will be available online.”
Tedeschi also noted that the acquisition will allow the museum to represent the range of Piene’s work.
“When you acquire a large cache, like this very large group of Otto Piene’s sketchbooks, it allows you to see more than just a tiny glimpse into the artist’s working process,” Tedeschi said. “It’s not a matter of trying to stockpile things. We always want to be teaching from the best examples.”
Born in 1928 in Germany, Piene began sketching as a conscripted child soldier at the end of World War II. Roth highlighted one landscape as an example of Piene’s early artistic maturity: “You can imagine him out there as a young boy with his watercolors looking at the night sky. Beautiful as it is for us, whenever the sky was calm, that was actually a sign that the bombers were on their way,” she said. “That really is the definition of the sublime: the beauty and the fear of a moment like that.”
Drawings of weaponry and military aircraft reveal the start of Piene’s lifelong interest in technology and war. “The rest of his career is trying to harness that and turn it into something good and something positive,” Roth said.
Later illustrations provide insight into many of Piene’s best-known works, especially his larger installations. “He spent a long time sketching Sky Events before they happened and then after they happened,” Goldring said. “He developed ideas for his light sculptures and the installation of the Light Ballet — you’ll see them in several of the sketchbooks.”
The sketchbooks continue the dialogue within the Harvard Art Museums’ collection between Piene and his collaborators like Group ZERO members Heinz Mack and Günther Uecker, according to the press release.
“One of his great collaborators was the artist Nam June Paik, who worked with electronics in a pioneering way. We received a major gift of Nam June Paik's material, which was shown last summer,” Tedeschi said. “It's wonderful to be able to show examples of artists who are thinking about the same kinds of problems, and to show their work side-by-side.”
Though Goldring ultimately chose to donate Piene’s sketchbooks to Harvard, MIT possesses much of Piene’s archival material dating from his 20-year tenure at the institution. “Otto’s work at MIT was all about collaboration, and I see this as a possible collaboration, ultimately, between Harvard and MIT,” Goldring said.

This review contains spoilers for the fifth episode of “Big Little Lies” season two.
“You should expect everything they say to be designed precisely to get you to react,” Katie (Poorna Jagannathan), Celeste’s lawyer, advises her frustrated client. It’s the earliest stage of the child custody case that will inevitably end up getting ugly in court, but Katie’s advice could’ve easily applied way before litigation began. Like, Episode One. Mary Louise (Meryl Streep) landed in Monterey with the sole intent of antagonizing Celeste (Nicole Kidman), under the guise of grandmotherly altruism. Now, the pleasantries are over. Celeste is visibly, perceptibly, unabashedly pissed. “You’re not getting my boys,” she hisses across the table, at the suggestion of a joint custody settlement. “Not for a Saturday, not for a Sunday, not for a fucking minute.” Despite Mary Louise’s insistence that Celeste is a passable mother, just a widow turned careless by grief, it’s clear that what’s being litigated is not the children’s well-being, but Celeste’s capability as a parent — which Mary Louise also targets in Renata (Laura Dern)’s home devoid of furniture, further demonstrating her knack for identifying and promptly eviscerating any Monterey mother’s insecurities. (Mary Louise totally deserved an ice cream to the back of the head.)
Despite Renata’s best efforts, Celeste can’t ignore Mary Louise’s custody case. Rejecting a settlement and taking the case to court means that the circumstances of Perry’s death will undoubtedly come up. Celeste’s cohort will definitely be called to the stand to testify to her parental fitness. If any of the Monterey Five muddy the facts under oath, they could be in big trouble. Or as Renata grimly puts it, “It’s a fucking perjury trap.” The titular big little lie, the one that’s bonded them since the start of the season, has finally become a tangible problem.
Still, Madeline (Reese Witherspoon) is naïvely convinced that they can preserve the lie and their reputations, the same way they murdered Perry: through teamwork! “Look, we have to stick together,” she insists. “That’s the only way we’ve gotten this far. If we stick together, we’ll be fine. We’re gonna be fine!”
Narrator: They were definitely not fine. The pep talk falls on somewhat deaf ears, what with Celeste trying to juggle parenting and handling the guardianship suit, Bonnie (Zoe Kravitz) caring for her comatose mother Elizabeth — who resurfaces to consciousness for a moment, to instruct her daughter to kill her (!) — and of course, Renata attempting to bolster morale post-bankruptcy with an impromptu mother-daughter bonding day.
Even Madeline herself has emotional heavy-lifting to do: She’s road-tripping to Big Sur with Ed in tow, in desperate hopes of repairing the marriage she damaged with infidelity. It’s a bust: The marriage retreat entails an awkward hugging exercise straight out of a high school theater class. For the woman who snapped, “Don’t touch me!” to her yogi, hugging strangers is clearly not the hoped-for emotional detox she intended. Instead, she opts for a surprisingly lucid bit of psychoanalysis (maybe Dr. Reisman’s sessions finally rubbed off on her), confessing that her own personal hang-ups about marriage led her astray. “I wanna be the destroyer, not the destroyee,” she tells Ed, who’s still salty about being his wife’s pragmatic choice, not her impassioned lover. “If I fuck up again, it will not be with infidelity. All my future mistakes will be brand new ones.”
But history is doomed to repeat itself. Madeline might find herself more of a destroyee than she’d prefer, as the episode closes with a few sizzling final images. Seated at a bar (the same one where Celeste picked up the bartender?), Ed encounters Tori Bachman (Sarah Sokolovic), who’s clearly looking for more than a tête-à-tête. Both cheated on by their partners — with the other’s partner, no less — they survey each other inquisitively. Meanwhile, Madeline remembers bits of the affair through erratic flashback, which seems to be director Andrea Arnold’s signature cinematographic choice this episode. Madeline just might get a bitter taste of her own medicine.
That’s not all, in the way of last-minute plot twists. As Bonnie loiters outside the police station again, ostensibly contemplating turning herself in, she comes face-to-face with none other than sweet golden boy, Corey (Douglas Smith), shadily exiting the station. Et tu, Corey? With the quirky sartorial choices and fun facts about marine life? If Corey really is a police informant, it’s all the more brutal considering that Corey is Jane’s first re-entry into sexual intimacy after her traumatic rape. It would take a seriously cold (little) heart to ignore the severity of that betrayal.
With only two episodes left in the season, writer David E. Kelley and director Andrea Arnold have a relatively limited two hours or so to tie off a handful of loose ends. Though Madeline delivered a convincing speech, it seems that Ed’s vindictive infidelity might ruin any chance of salvaging the marriage. Meanwhile, Renata will learn to navigate proletariat life (put that Gucci fanny-pack collection up for sale) and Jane will eventually learn about Corey’s suspicious extracurriculars. Bonnie’s vision of drowning might transition from psychological to real. It would be a convenient, if predictable, finale if Celeste’s custody case manifested in an explosive final courtroom trial, during which everything came to a head. Whether truth will out is anyone’s guess.

American rock band Young the Giant performed for an audience of thousands at Rockland Trust Bank Pavilion on the summer solstice last month.
The Boston performance on June 21 was the fifth stop on Young The Giant’s 34-stop North American tour with indie pop band Fitz and The Tantrums. The tour follows the 2018 release of Young the Giant’s fourth studio album Mirror Master, featuring their single “Superposition.”
American indie pop band COIN opened the concert with performances of songs including “Talk Too Much,” “Cemetery,” and their newly-released single “Crash My Car,” which was released a week prior to the performance. COIN will accompany Young the Giant at 24 stops on the band’s tour.
Following COIN’s performance, co-headliner Fitz and the Tantrums performed a setlist stacked with their hits, including “Out of My League,” “HandClap,” and their brand new single “123456.” The release of “123456” marked the first new music from the band since its eponymous album in 2016.
As the sun finally set over the Boston Harbor on the summer solstice, Young the Giant arrived on stage around 9 p.m. to a crowd of cheering fans. They performed their first-ever, chart-topping singles "My Body," "Cough Syrup," and "Apartment” as well as songs from their latest LP, Mirror Master.
Young the Giant lead singer Sameer Gadhia told Billboard magazine in October that the band’s music has always been a “snapshot” of who they are as a band and as people. While Gadhia described the band’s 2016 album Home of the Strange as an “external record” about immigrants’ experiences situating themselves in the United States, he said Mirror Master is “reflective.”
“It’s not just where I fit into the world, it’s like where I fit into myself,” Gadhia said.
