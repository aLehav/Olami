After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mid-February is a time of year with intimate musical associations: mellow jazz piano, sultry crooners, perhaps some romantic strings. It is only logical, then, that iconoclastic Kendrick Lamar chose February 9—the day after his two long-belated Grammy wins—to drop one of his darkest tracks to date. “The Blacker the Berry,” the second single off Lamar’s as-of-yet untitled third album, reverses the infectious optimism and self-love of “i” to deal with hatred within the black community in a way that is equal parts brutal and compelling.
Evidently, Lamar is conversant with Harlem Renaissance literature; the single borrows its title from Wallace Thurman’s novel “The Blacker the Berry,” one of the first to deal with the discrimination black people commit against one another. Lamar does not shy away from handling this complex issue but instead embraces it both lyrically and musically. His rapping is harsher than on any previous release; Boi-1da’s sparse production consists primarily of a similarly intense boom-bap beat that allows Lamar’s voice to dominate the track, as it deserves to. Cleverly, Lamar distorts his vocals lower to rap, “The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice / The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot” in a dark inversion of the high-pitched voice he utilizes to represent his conscience on 2012’s “good kid, m.A.A.d. city.”
The remainder of the track is likewise lyrically unforgiving—though this certainly does not make “The Blacker the Berry” an easy song to listen to, it cements it as all the more essential. Lamar champions his blackness in the face of racism with lines like “I want you to recognize that I’m a proud monkey” and “I’m black as the heart of a fuckin’ Aryan.” Simultaneously, the song has a deeper undercurrent, hinted at when Lamar begins every verse with “I’m the biggest hypocrite of 2015.” As identified by author Michael Chabon in a surprising Genius comment, Lamar defers an explanation of this assertion until the track’s final lines, when he raps, “So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? / When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? Hypocrite!” Difficult lines to hear, certainly, particularly concerning the tragedy of Martin’s death. In delaying this mention of violence within the black community until the end of the track, however, Lamar is successfully able to call attention to anti-black racism on a first listen and introduce a novel interpretation for subsequent listens.
“The Blacker the Berry,” then, is not only a well-composed track dealing with a significant societal ill—it is also uniquely intelligent. If this and “i” are an accurate representation of the album to come, Lamar’s third release may even surpass the considerable success of “good kid, m.A.A.d. city.”

“Fifty Shades of Grey” might be the least interesting movie to ever spawn hundreds of op-eds and hours of debate. Since its release, much of the viewing public has been struggling in one medium or another to understand its simultaneous popularity and lack of quality: what the heck, everyone seems to be asking, are we supposed to make of this thing? How does substance-less, derivative pornography make over $235 million dollars in its opening weekend?
That’s not the important question, though. “Fifty Shades” is indeed boring, repetitive, and poorly acted, but it also expresses a fundamentally harmful vision of men and women in society; it hides ancient and vicious ideas about gender, sex, and power under a mask of sleek camera angles and trendy background music.
The first, most obvious problem is the portrayal of the story’s main couple, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). To describe Christian as “overprotective” would be a colossal, euphemistic understatement: he appears in Ana’s house uninvited, controls her reproductive choices, and pressures her to take part in sex acts that she shows no interest in. His possessive behavior is dismissed as for a normal BDSM “dominant” —the counterpart to Ana’s designated “submissive” role—but his actions extend far beyond the boundaries of consensual, regulated role-playing. Christian is an abuser, and by presenting such a damaged entanglement as a model of romantic kink, the movie perpetuates cultural tolerance of abuse while encouraging warped notions about the nature of healthy, safe BDSM.
Then there’s the matter of Ana’s sexuality, which proves to be fraught with dangerous cliche. Prior to her first night with Christian, Ana wears a childish jean jacket, doesn’t shave her legs, winces when her friend puts lip gloss on her, and responds to sexual advances with wide-eyed, awkward mumbling. However, a single sexual experience magically transforms this stereotypically-depicted virgin. Suddenly, Ana begins to wear designer clothes, straighten her hair, and wear makeup; she starts talking at an audible volume and returns Christian’s ribald banter with ease. By portraying virginity loss as a makeover, a gateway to confidence and nice clothes, the movie sustains an irritating cultural tic that promotes a binary concept of sex while glorifying low self-esteem and dependence.
Taken as a whole, this story has nothing to do with empowerment or sexual discovery. It doesn’t challenge conservative theories about sex but rather aggressively affirms them, framing BDSM as a consequence of abuse and an obstacle to the ultimate goal of matrimonial bliss. Ana may break up with Christian at the end of the movie, but the books promise a sequel in which everyone lives happily ever after—wedding dress, baby, and all.
Despite its significant flaws, though, the movie has amassed a large fanbase. Possibly, the movie’s fans are just starved for erotica in a world where women are not supposed to watch porn; “Fifty Shades” isn’t any good, but it’s likely the first sexually explicit book that most women feel comfortable enough to publicly admit to reading . Many viewers are also just intrigued, a fact exploited by the movie’s marketing campaign, which included the tagline, “Curious?”
But there’s a possible deeper explanation for the movie’s popularity, one that’s much more problematic. The real fantasy of “Fifty Shades of Grey” has nothing to do with sex but rather with wealth and power: Christian represents a life of total financial comfort and the security of not having to make decisions. Being his submissive means not having to choose what to eat, where to sleep, or how to do your hair, and it means helicopter rides and enormous silken beds. Were Christian completely broke, it is doubtful that Ana would have allowed him to keep her like a concubine.
And that’s not just a harmless dream or an irritating flaw, not when women around the world are desperately fighting to have their personhood recognized. We can’t accept anything that tells women to give up their agency, no matter how delicious the price, nor can we promote something that only values men in terms of wealth.
“Fifty Shades of Grey” is an inane, stupidly constructed movie, but people are seeing it and therefore giving it power. And we should stop while we can, because no one—male or female—wins here. Hopefully, though, better variations on the girl-meets-boy-and-also-whips story will appear in the future: versions in which Ana has her own apartment and terrible car, or has crazy sex with Christian because she wants to, or loves him even though he’s not rich but because he’s a fundamentally good person. Sounds pretty hot to me.

“People who think I’m some crazy liberal are always so shocked about how much I love to talk about sin,” the tattooed progressive Lutheran pastor Nadia Bolz-Weber remarks in a characteristically delightful sermon at the House of All Sinners and Saints. “I think liberals tend to think admitting we are sinful is the same as having low self-esteem. And then conservatives ... [say] that sin is the same as immorality and totally avoidable if you can just be a good squeaky-clean Christian.”
“Sin” is a word that gets a bad rap. Perhaps rightly so. The word has been used as a tool to shame the already vulnerable, calling them “sinners,” singling them out as dirty and separate. More often, the word has been used with a kind of insufferable solemnity, a resolute refusal to lighten up, an effort to immobilize mankind in one great, awkward, eternal, pompous hush of holiness.
The very idea makes one want to rebel. Small wonder that more than a few people hear the tale of Satan's Fall and identify Satan as the hero, or look at Eve's disobedience in the Garden of Eden as a noble, emancipatory act.
Live free or die... right?
I don't disagree. Live free or die. But here is how Oscar Wilde, a man of profoundly Christian imagination, puts it in “The Ballad of Reading Gaol.” The poem begins by introducing a man who must hang tomorrow:
He did not wear his scarlet coat
For blood and wine are red
And blood and wine were on his hands
When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved
And murdered in her bed.
Then the twist:
Yet each man kills the thing he loves
By each let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word [...]
Wilde presents sin as a kind of first step down the road of death. Sin is a foretaste of mortality, a little chill of death that enters the world through what we do or fail to do, whether knowingly or unknowingly.
Whose death? Wilde talks about sin as killing what or whom we love. Since we live in and through what we love, any crime against love is a little death of our own, an erosion of the soul.
Sin is a rich, nuanced, existentially real concept.
Let's spin out the analogy. Death is bad because it strips us of who we are, tears us apart from those we love, threatens to make life itself futile, and stands over us as a grim master. Sin is bad for the same reasons.
Sin presents itself as a kind of freedom: Disobey God, be free, trust yourself. Obey your own better judgement. But the choice is not presented fairly. Everyone serves someone, or something (grades, careers, reputation, “having a good time”). The real question is what in this world is fit to rule humans. A good master, a kind master—these things are hard to find. David Foster Wallace demonstrated that much in his Kenyon commencement speech “This is Water.” Serve money, serve power, serve fame, and these things, Wallace observes, will eat you alive.
Sin, then, is simply the choice to serve the sorts of things that are destructive rather than life-giving. We may serve these things by freely, deliberately prioritizing them, but equally we may just unwittingly fall into the habit of doing what's against even our own better judgement. Luther talks about sin as the “bondage of the will,” with good reason.
Sin corrupts. When things start to go wrong, in a moment of spite, they have a way of getting out of hand, quickly becoming all-pervasive, something whose consequences spill on from generation to generation. There is biblical talk about the “sins of the fathers” being handed down to their children. It's the truth of any messy family history, and in still broader cycles of violence, oppression, or greed which have become systemic and almost inexorable.
Sin is the futility that clings so close to us, the self-destruction, the self-harm, the harm done to those one loves best. It is what Francis Spufford in “Unapolagetic” calls “the crack in everything.”
In Christianity, “salvation” does not principally mean salvation from divine punishment for one's sins—it is salvation from sin itself. For sin is often its own punishment, the natural consequences of having one's own way.
This, in short, is Christianity's frank diagnosis of the human condition: That serving yourself is not to put yourself in good hands. It is of urgent importance to find something worth serving that will put life back in these dry bones.
Last Wednesday was Ash Wednesday, marking the beginning of the season of Lent. Ash crosses on foreheads remind us of our mortality. Prayer and fasting aim to draw us outside of our ingrown selves and into solidarity with the hungry and the poor. Immersing ourselves in ancient narrative, we reorient our hearts and minds in the service of the Highest—as “40 Days in Mark,” a Lenten blog project of the Harvard Ichthus, aptly reminds us.
Through these rites, the Lenten season offers the beginning of an answer to the problem of sin.
But only because it joyously looks forward, as do I, to Easter Sunday six weeks from now.
Et gloria in excelsis Deo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s when you’re in a crowded, sweaty, dark room on the fourth floor of Eliot house—with Miley’s “Wrecking Ball” invading your ears, the sight of an awkwardly few number of grinding couples invading your eyes, and the loneliness you feel invading your soul—that you realize how deeply insignificant our time on this Earth really is.
Generally, there are two types of parties at Harvard: parties that are intense and parties that want to be intense. The problem is that the latter suck and the former don’t exist.
I will admit there are several great, intense parties every year. But too many parties want to be intense and can’t live up to the potential, especially outside the Final Club scene. It’s a problem that needs a solution.
So, let’s try to understand the problem by looking at its roots.
In high school, the closest thing I did to partying was listening to a Ke$ha song, one time. The closest thing I did to grinding was rubbing my teeth together when I slept, which led to braces. And the closest thing I did to dating girls was seeing them in the halls.
While probably not as sad as me, many Harvard students have had a similarly non-rebellious experience in high school, especially in terms of drinking. A fairly recent survey found that only 30 percent of undergraduates identify as drinkers before college. That number climbs to 77 percent upon graduation, according to the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors. And when alcohol is mixed with an expectation to “go hard,” that can be a problem, especially among freshmen, who constituted the majority of alcohol-related UHS visits in recent years.
I think there are two reasons for our “party hard” attitudes: 1) A lack of experience and 2) A hard-working mentality that undervalues relaxation. So when we get to campus, where there is the expectation to party and the resources to do so, we go more ham than a pig in Arby’s. We go Hardvard.
And not only do we go Hardvard, but we often aren’t very good at it. Take a few “hard” examples: Streaking at Harvard becomes “Primal Scream,” a strangely communal event with picture-taking and, most recently, social justice protests. Public urination is turned into a public health problem. And sex becomes “sex in the stacks,” because if we had to have sex, it had to be among books.
Most importantly, our sweaty, crowded, dark parties in dorms get old pretty quickly. And yet, there is a cultural insistence that we keep partying the same way.
Thankfully, I have a solution. And it comes straight from my California roots: the kickback.
On Urban Dictionary, expert user “Chase” describes a kickback as a “small gathering between groups of friends, more than a get together, less than a party.” The knowledgeable Chase has also popularly defined terms like “tig ol’ bitties,” “turd burglar,” and, surprisingly, “Pope John Paul II” on Urban Dictionary. So I think we can trust him on this one.
The kickback is a California-bred, more “chillax” version of a party. It’s usually among friends. The music doesn’t drown out conversation. And dancing is not expected. In short, it’s a lot like a pregame; but, instead of being a precursor, it’s an end in itself.
To be more specific, I stole an archival kickback guide from a popular, fellow student of mine in high school. Here it is, with some albeit irrelevant material:
I know it may sound crazy to keep the lights on and not crowd sweatily around one another like sexually-crazed eels. But there are many benefits to a kickback, especially for Harvard students.
Kickbacks are a good opportunity to relax over the weekend, after a long week. They provide a social outlet that is safer than binge drinking. And, most importantly, they’re fun.
Of course, ragers and dance parties will have their place at Harvard, as they should. But it’s never bad to have an alternative for a different mood. Thankfully, many upperclassmen—who have a more established friend group or are tired of dorm parties—already throw kickbacks without necessarily calling them “kickbacks.” But these are more rare than they should be, especially among underclassmen. Maybe giving it a name—calling them “kickbacks”—could help spread the trend.
So I propose we take a deep breath. Relax. Turn on a light. And detach our crotches from someone else’s dancing behind.
In short, I propose that we all kick back. Because when it comes to our mental health, our physical health, and our happiness, kicking back may be just the first step forward.

For the vast majority of Harvard students, wheelchair accessibility on campus is something we do not have to personally worry about. But for those who rely on a wheelchair to get around, it makes all the difference. An op-ed published last week in this newspaper by Chanel E. Washington ’15 highlighted her personal struggles with accessibility and the feelings of exclusion that come from the lack of accessibility to many of the buildings on and around campus. Washington cites a lack of full wheelchair accessibility at Senior Bar venues chosen by the Senior Class Committee as symbolic of the issues that have plagued and detracted from her experience at Harvard. While an event held at the Cambridge Queen’s Head below Annenberg was fully accessible, events held at Tasty Burger and Uno’s suffered from a broken elevator and a lack of an elevator respectively.
On campus, the story is similar. Only three of the twelve upperclassmen Houses—Quincy, Pforzheimer, and Currier—are fully accessible for students in wheelchairs. While it is regrettable that not all of Harvard’s spaces are fully accessible, we understand that this problem is difficult to fix as quickly as we would like. It would not be reasonable to ask the University to quickly make large-scale infrastructure changes. However, despite the financial and logistical obstacles related to renovating the University’s historic buildings, all of the houses must eventually be made fully accessible to students in wheelchairs.
A 2009 report issued by the College specifically addressed the issue of accessibility in the context of Harvard’s House renewal project. Administrators require that only five percent of the suites in each House be accessible. While providing a place for all students to live is essential, this should not be the entirety of the University’s accessibility efforts; students who rely on wheelchairs are still unable to access the majority of the suites even in the designated accessible houses.
This is unacceptable. Those in charge of renovating the Houses should aim to make every room on campus, whether designed for classes or for living, easy to visit for everyone at the University, including those who use wheelchairs. When the renovated Dunster House opens in the fall, it will become the fourth fully accessible House. We applaud the University’s decision to make the first fully renovated House also fully accessible and hope this trend continues with the rest of the House renovations.
Ideally, every space on campus would be fully accessible right now, but we recognize that this will take some time to be the case. In the meantime, the burden falls on Harvard students to be more aware of accessibility concerns when planning events and in their day-to-day lives. Though many of us are rarely affected by the issue of accessibility, it is a pressing concern for many members of our community, and as such, we as students have a responsibility to help and look out for each other. Groups such as the Senior Class Committee must make accessibility one of their principal concerns, especially when planning events like the Senior Bars that are designed to bring the class together. The systematic exclusion of those who rely on wheelchairs for transportation runs counter to the goals of promoting class unity, even if the exclusion is unintentional. Accessibility is something we all must consider: It is simply the right thing to do.

After a series of winter storms, water damage to the Barker Center basement caused by melting ice and snow has prompted the Harvard College Writing Center to relocate its offices temporarily.
The Writing Center's tutors will hold conferences and weeknight drop-in hours in Lamont Library B40 starting Monday and until further notice, according to an email sent to undergraduates on Friday. This temporary location change will likely be for three to four weeks, according to Writing Center Director Jane Rosenzweig.
“The reason we said that we have relocated ‘until further notice’ is that we don't have an exact date yet when repairs will be finished,” Rosenzweig wrote in an email Sunday. “It's my understanding that the weather is a variable in dealing with leaks caused by snow and ice, and once the roof has been taken care of, they will have to repair the offices.”
Rosenzweig called the damage to the ceilings and walls of the basement “pretty extensive” and wrote that it “happened quickly.” She added that the leaks started after the storms on Feb. 9 and 10.
“By mid-day on February 11, water was running down the wall of my office and coming through the light fixture in the middle of the office,” she wrote. “The tutor offices also had water coming down on the floor and the furniture. Luckily, all of this happened during the day while we were at work, so we were able to pack everything into boxes and move the boxes out so that nothing would get damaged.”
The Writing Center shares a hallway with offices that belong to the Comparative Literature department. Those offices were also damaged, and all the offices will be repaired at the same time, according to Rosenzweig.

More than 200 members of the Harvard, Allston-Brighton, and Boston communities joined on Saturday to celebrate the grand opening of the Harvard Ed Portal's new location at 224 Western Ave. in Allston.
The Ed Portal’s new “iStudio” and common space will host performing arts events, workforce development activities, and a Harvard faculty speaker series tied to HarvardX course offerings as part of its “HarvardX for Allston” educational initiative. In addition, it will continue to offer mentoring and educational programming for children in the new space, which is located next to the Harvard ceramics studio.
The new facility and extended programming are central parts of the University’s community benefits package, which includes $8.3 million for a “suite of transformative projects” including the Ed Portal.
University President Drew G. Faust and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh spoke at the event, characterizing the Ed Portal as the next step in the partnership between Harvard and the City of Boston.
“This is where the emerging Harvard campus meets the Allston neighborhood, and it’s a place where the same spirit of discovery and partnership that inspires students and faculty in our classrooms and our labs can enliven activities here,” Faust said.
Walsh agreed with Faust, adding that he hoped the facility would make the idea and the institution of Harvard accessible and “in reach” for every Boston resident.
“Growing up, a Harvard to me [was] a place where people went and got a great education and went on to do great things—they became presidents and kings and prime ministers,” he said. “A Harvard [today] is for every single kid in our neighborhood, an opportunity for them to grow.”
In an opening speech at the celebration, Ed Portal Faculty Director Robert A. Lue emphasized that the Ed Portal’s offerings were for all community residents, regardless of age or educational level.
Music professor Thomas F. Kelly, who lectured at the event on the premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring,” gave a sneak peek of an upcoming online version of his popular course “First Nights” that will be offered through edX.
Community members praised the open and modern design of the new building, as well as the new set of opportunities available to residents.
“[The new facility] expands on already existing good work, and I can’t imagine that any kid in Allston wouldn’t be excited to do after-school programs here...and understand that education is about being creative,” said Doris Sommer, a romance language professor at Harvard who has trained Ed Portal mentors in creative literacy projects. “It’s just a great moment.”

UPDATED: February 24, 2015, at  2:15 a.m.
Actress Eva Longoria, U.S. Treasurer Rosa G. Rios ’87, and a number of Harvard students groups headlined Saturday’s Cultural Rhythms festival hosted by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations.
Longoria, who was recognized as the 2015 Harvard University Artist of the Year, spoke Saturday between student group performances about her experience identifying as both a Mexican and an American.
“I lived my life straddling that hyphen of being Mexican-American,” she said. Longoria recalled “loving enchiladas and apple pie, loving mariachi music and Britney Spears.”
“But there are so many moments in my life that were memorable to that experience of being the hybrid, of being the hyphen,” she said.
The “Desperate Housewives” star also discussed her philanthropic commitments and spoke about using education to promote understanding and development as well as the issues of diversity and oppression in society.
“The people who are known to break the chains of oppression are usually those who know what the chains of oppression feel like,” she said.
Longoria, who spoke for about 15 minutes, was just one element of a program that included a dozen student groups as well as other speakers. Rios, the honorary host of the event and one of the original founders of Cultural Rhythms, also spoke, as did S. Allen Counter, the director of the Harvard Foundation.
“Cultural Rhythms captures the true spirit and essence of the Foundation’s mission: to improve intercultural understanding and fellowship among Harvard students and faculty,” said Counter, who helped start Cultural Rhythms with Rios and who commended Rios for her innovation and far-reaching vision when founding the festival. “You are here for four years; we [professors] are here for a lifetime; Harvard is here forever.”
The first student performance featured the Ballet Folklorico de Aztlan, the oldest cultural organization at Harvard whose aim is to spread Mexican culture and heritage through traditional folk dances. The group was followed by the Harvard Wushu team, which received the only standing ovation of the show. The team performed a style of contemporary Chinese martial arts.
Subsequent acts featured Under Construction, an acapella group that celebrates spirituality on campus; Expressions Dance Company, a hip hop dance group that is student-choreographed and led; the Mariachi Véritas de Harvard, a group that is dedicated to performing Mexican regional folk music; and the Pan African Dance and Music Ensemble.
The event’s student organizers said Cultural Rhythms provides a unique platform to celebrate diversity on Harvard’s campus.
“[Cultural] gives us a unique opportunity to reflect back on 30 years of rich tradition and history and think forward to the future of this institution and the celebration of diversity on this campus,” said Irfan Mahmud ’16, co-director of Cultural Rhythms and an inactive Crimson news editor.
“We are transforming Sanders Theatre into an international and intercultural celebration,” said co-director Cary A. Williams ‘16.
After the performances, attendees were invited to a cultural food festival that featured food stations from 19 student cultural organizations.

Michael Herzfeld, a professor in the Anthropology department, began his tenure as a Changjiang Scholar at the beginning of 2015.
The title of Changjiang Scholar is often considered the most prestigious academic award conferred in China, and is rarely granted to foreigners or to social scientists, according to a Harvard press release. Herzfeld, who received the appointment through a competitive application process, is an exception in both regards.
The appointment—which lasts three years—will require Herzfeld to spend a total of at least six months in China during that time. Herzfeld said he plans to hold a visiting professorship at Shanghai International Studies University while also teaching at Harvard.
His main academic goals in China are to foster collaboration between SISU and Harvard and to cultivate interest in anthropology among young Chinese scholars. More specifically, Herzfeld hopes to encourage new Chinese anthropologists to study and conduct research on groups outside of China.
“The Chinese are beginning to branch out; they’re beginning to send anthropologists to many parts of the world,” he said. “Part of the idea here is...to have them read the anthropology of other countries and other cultures.”
Herzfeld said that the Chinese government has not expressed any intention to censor his work.
“When I would say to [Chinese authorities] that I regard anthropology as a fundamentally political discipline...this did not appear to cause any distress,” he said. “I realize that there may be issues, but, at this stage, my sense is that my charge is to do something that is totally consistent with the way that I’ve been acting here.”
To prepare for his time abroad, Herzfeld said that he is learning Mandarin as well as a local Chinese dialect.
“I do not pass any PhD student of mine until that person has given a lecture in the academic language of the country where the student works, and I hold myself to the same standard,” he said.
Herzfeld will first leave for China in May or June and plans to make a second trip in December. He said he is scheduled to be on sabbatical for one full year starting in summer 2016 and plans to spend more time in China during this leave.

Senior conservation scientist Narayan Khandekar has been named the new director of the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard Art Museums. He replaces Henry Lie, who retired this past December.
Khandekar, who first came to the Harvard Art Museums in 2001, brings a scientific background to the position. His self-proclaimed “circuitous” art conservation career began with a Ph.D. in organic chemistry and frequent trips to art galleries.
“I ended up wanting to find a way to bring art and chemistry together,” Khandekar said. “It was about halfway through my Ph.D. that I was really like, ‘This is what I want to do.’ ”
Khandekar said he is currently most excited about his work on a project featuring Australian Aboriginal bark paintings.
“It's something that has not been done before,” he said. “This is new work, so it is very exciting to be doing something for the first time."
Khandekar also hopes to expose Harvard affiliates to new perspectives on art appreciation.
“We want to make people aware of there being more than one way to look at a work of art, that art history provides one way, that understanding the process of making it a work of art and understanding the materials is another way,” he said.
Prior to joining the Harvard Art Museums, Khandekar worked at the Getty Conservation Institute, the Ian Potter Art Conservation Centre at the University of Melbourne, and the Fitzwilliam Museum at the University of Cambridge. He holds a postgraduate diploma in the conservation of easel paintings from the Courtauld Institute of Art in addition to his organic chemistry degree from the University of Melbourne.
Thomas W. Lentz, the director of the Harvard Art Museums, said in a press release that Khandekar’s role at the intersection of art and science makes him a promising director.
“With his institutional experience, deep scientific knowledge, intellectual curiosity, and naturally collaborative spirit, Narayan is the perfect choice to lead the Straus Center into its next chapter,” Lentz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 23, 2015, at 2:02 a.m.
The Undergraduate Council passed a declaration of solidarity with the Muslim community at their general meeting Sunday, in light of the killing of three Muslims in Chapel Hill on Feb. 10.
Harvard Islamic Society Vice President Hassaan Shahawy ’16 attended the meeting, speaking to the Council about reactions to the shooting within Harvard. A vigil for the victims was held last Thursday at Memorial Church, and the Islamic Society met with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana last week, according to Shahawy.
Overall, Shahawy stressed that the Muslim community at Harvard was very grateful for the support they have seen from students, faculty, and administrators thus far.
The resolution stated that “the Council publicly expresses solidarity with the Islamic Community for this senseless tragedy, recognizing that their loss is one that the entire Harvard Community mourns.”
The original resolution included a clause claiming that the media response to the shootings was “disappointingly slow” in the eyes of the Muslim community. Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 proposed an amendment to strike that language, which passed narrowly. Several representatives said they did not see significant proof that the media’s response was inappropriate.
“I don’t feel comfortable saying something where the truth isn’t clear, especially on behalf of the entire undergraduate community,” UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 said.
An additional amendment that was approved—introduced by Winthrop House representative Vimal S. Konduri ’17, a Crimson news writer—added a clause to express the Council’s gratitude to Harvard affiliates’ response to the shootings.
The Council also decided to undergo a reboot of its gender equity campaign this week, changing its name to "SideBySide." The campaign was originally called "HeForShe," indicative of the campaign’s link to the United Nation’s worldwide gender equality campaign of the same name.
“The feedback we’ve been getting was hesitance towards the 'HeForShe' name: It implied a gender binary, it was exclusive,” Mather House representative and project manager Michelle S. Lee ’16 said. According to Lee, the name "SideBySide" better represents the mission of the campaign to involve and empower all gender groups.
Lee, an inactive Crimson news writer, said at the meeting that a launch event for the campaign will be held at the Institute of Politics on March 2.
In addition, the Council unanimously passed three other pieces of legislation: an allocation of $500 towards "SideBySide," a grants package allocating $11,131.76 to student groups, and an endorsement for the Summer Playbook, a web application designed by Harvard students to coordinate social gatherings and short-term living arrangements over the summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 24, 2015, at 1:15 a.m.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association hosted the East Coast Asian American Student Union annual conference this weekend, the largest Asian American student conference in the United States with over 1,200 students participating this year.
“It’s been one and a half years of planning,” said Diana K. Nguyen ’15, conference co-director and former president of AAA. “ECAASU is the Asian-American political identity Olympics.”
Spanning from Friday to Sunday, the ECAASU conference consisted of workshops, keynote speaker panels, and socials all focusing around issues in the Asian American Pacific Islander community.
“We want to have conversations about the new Asian American,” Nguyen said. “We’re really emphasizing this intersectionality—how do sexuality, gender, and citizenship all play into these issues?”
According to Nguyen, the 2015 conference is the first time it has taken place in Boston in more than 20 years. The conference is hosted each year at a different university, and this year it was put on in collaboration with Asian American student groups from five other schools in the Boston area.
The opening ceremony in Memorial Church Friday evening kicked off with musical and spoken word pieces by Asian American artists such as DANakaDAN and Dumbfoundead as well as a performance by Northeastern’s competitive fusion dance team Rangila Rhythms.
The keynote address took place Saturday morning and featured speeches by Harvard history fellow Genevieve A. Clutario, Brandeis student Hin Hon Wong, Chief of Staff to Mayor Martin J. Walsh Daniel A. Koh, and Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana.
In his speech, Khurana described his personal background as an Asian immigrant and commended the conference’s use of workshops and small panels to encourage dialogue, urging the students to ask themselves difficult questions.
“Only a few decades ago, half of humanity was excluded from Harvard’s college education,” he said. “Large scale transformation happens when small groups change the social context.”
The workshops, consisting of small group discussions, focused on a variety of topics within the Asian American community, including mental health, gender inequality, and entrepreneurship. According to Nguyen, a goal of the 2015 conference was to emphasize intersecting social identities in the Asian American community.
Tracy Wang, a senior at Dartmouth who attended the conference, said she felt this intersectional approach to identity was important especially within Asian American communities.
“We talk about intersectionality [in college], but we don’t do that a lot within pan-Asian communities,” she said. “It is fascinating to see what people are thinking and how they are trying to label themselves, but at the same time not fit into stereotypes.”

UPDATED: February 24, 2015, at 11:29 p.m.
After January pre-testing, Harvard is finalizing its sexual assault climate survey and—given that similar surveys have historically drawn lackluster response rates—plans to heavily publicize it before rolling it out in April.
The survey, which is a localized version of an Association of American Universities survey that 28 schools will issue this spring, will ask student respondents a range of questions on sexual misconduct and affirmative consent, according to Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, a member of Harvard’s sexual assault task force who is helping spearhead the design of the national survey.
Harvard will send out its survey to roughly 20,000 students across the University on April 12.
Though a standard version of the survey will be issued to all 28 schools that participate, it will be individualized to each school in several ways, according to Laibson. Each university will generate its own responses about its individual schools, student organizations, living situations, and support and reporting infrastructures, such as Harvard’s central Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, which investigates student sexual harassment complaints.
In the survey’s student organizations section, for example, the Harvard version will specifically mention final clubs, Laibson said.
Some schools, notably Princeton, have opted out of participating in the the AAU survey so as to form their own that are more school-specific. Laibson said schools may potentially conduct supplemental, more individualized surveys in the future but said the uniformity of April’s survey will make it easier to compare different schools’ results.
"When you design a survey, the subtlest little differences like the order of the questions or the wording can make an enormous difference, and so you can't compare data,” Laibson said. “But when you design questions that are identical and implement the survey in an identical way and compensate people with identical incentives, you learn vastly more."
In January, Laibson and his team pre-tested the survey at Harvard by inviting 200 random students—100 undergraduates and 100 graduate students—to view a portion of the survey and give feedback on its most “complicated” and  “controversial” questions, he said. Students received $25 in exchange for written feedback on the survey and an additional $5 if they did an interview on the topic.
Laibson said survey organizers also solicited and heard feedback on the survey from about 15 student group leaders. He declined to specify which student organizations were contacted.
In advance of its April launch, Harvard survey organizers are also planning a publicity campaign to be chaired by Vice President for Strategy and Programs Leah Rosovsky, in hopes of garnering a large number of survey responses, Laibson said.
Although surveys usually get a 20 to 30 percent response rate, according to Laibson, he said he hoped the sexual assault survey would ideally yield at least an 80 percent response rate at Harvard. He later acknowledged, however, that the survey will more likely yield a response rate of between 20 and 35 percent.
To incentivize students to respond, Harvard will offer students $5 for completing the survey, Laibson said, while some other colleges may offer monetary incentives to only a sample of their student bodies.
After the survey is completed, the AAU will release aggregate data on participating schools’ collective responses and send individualized data to each institution. Individual schools are not obligated to make their own data public.
Laibson said he hopes to release as much information about Harvard’s responses as possible, but may not break down data by each specific school if their pool of respondents is too small to guarantee participants’ anonymity.
"We are going to share the data to the extent possible, which means absolutely prioritizing the anonymity of our respondents and making sure that we never end up with a cell size that is so small that you sort of know… something about the people that responded," Laibson said.
Organizers for Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student activist group, said they are pleased but have some reservations about the survey, which they viewed during January’s round of pre-testing. Jessica R. Fournier ’17, who participated in the pre-testing, said she was unsure how much student feedback from the pre-testing will affect the makeup of the final survey.
“It seems like it will be very difficult to actually have questions that are substantive, that everyone’s suggestions across all these schools will actually make it in in a way that will make the survey better,” Fournier said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 23, 2015, at 4:17 a.m.
It was a weekend of lasts for the No. 3/4 Harvard women’s ice hockey team. This weekend’s series marked not only the closing games of the regular season, but also the last regular season games this year’s senior class will play at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Following a string of wins last weekend over Cornell and Colgate, the Crimson (21-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) came into the weekend with a three-point lead in the ECAC conference. But after a tie on Friday night and a loss on Saturday, Harvard finished the regular season tied with Clarkson (22-9-3,16-4-2) for the top seed.
CLARKSON 1, HARVARD 0
The Crimson fell to the Golden Knights after Clarkson freshman forward Brielle Bellerive netted a goal eight minutes into the first period. Despite having the same number of points as Harvard in the ECAC, the Golden Knights clinched the top seed for the coming conference tournament given their 1-0-1 record against the Crimson.
After being outshot 10-7 and 9-7 in the first and second period, respectively, Harvard came away with 14 shots on goal in the third period. Despite the loss, Harvard coach Katey Stone remained positive about the Crimson’s effort.
“I thought the first period we were on our heels a little bit more than we have been in the past,” Stone said. “I felt like we played a little tight early and then got ourselves moving. There’s just very little margin of error in a game like today, but back and forth, the pace was great.”
Both teams failed to convert on power plays, with Harvard putting up only two shots on goal on three power plays, while Clarkson put three shots on goal on four power plays. Despite a strong push in the last period, the Crimson was unable to come out with the win.
“I thought we came out a little bit shaky and then turned it around [in the] second and third period,” junior co-captain Michelle Picard said. “We just couldn’t put the puck in the net, but I thought we worked hard.”
The loss left the two teams tied for the ECAC title, but given the Golden Knights' winning record against Harvard, it was ultimately Clarkson that took the highest seed going into playoffs.
The spirits of the Crimson squad were not dampened for long, as the team celebrated senior night immediately after the game. Senior forward Lyndsey Fry was nostalgic when reflecting on her past four seasons with the team.
“They have been probably the most impactful four years of my life mostly because of Harvard hockey and everything I’ve learned whether that be [from Coach Stone] or being part of the team,” Fry said. “It truly has changed me as a person for the better, and it’s something I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.”
HARVARD 1, ST. LAWRENCE 1
Despite the fact that the Crimson was able to put up 45 shots on goal, only one found the back of the net in a 1-1 tie with St. Lawrence (18-10-5, 12-5-4).
After a goal by the Saints three minutes into the second period, Harvard rallied with a goal from sophomore forward Sydney Daniels off the assist from co-captain Kalley Armstrong. It was a stalemate for the rest of the game, largely in part to another strong performance from junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who had 31 saves on the night.
The Crimson failed to convert on three power plays, including one in overtime after St. Lawrence was penalized for having too many players on the ice. Harvard struggled to take advantage of the power play with the game on the line, as Saints' goalkeeper Carmen MacDonald saved all seven shots on goal that came her way in the overtime frame.
With a win, the Crimson could have clinched the regular season conference championship, but instead, Harvard walked away with a tie on Friday, heading into a game that would decide the fate of the ECAC. As the second seed in the tournament, the Crimson will host Yale in a best-of-three series this weekend for the second consecutive season .
“At this point it’s playoff hockey, so [we have to make] sure we come out and not [wait] for a goal to get scored to turn on the switch," Fry said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 23, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the weekend's series were the last games the women's hockey team's senior class would play in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. In fact, they were the last regular season games the seniors will play there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going on the road against the top two teams in the conference, one of which is making a strong case for being among the best Ivy League women’s basketball teams ever, is never an easy task.
The Harvard women’s basketball team’s defense rose to the challenge this past weekend, as the Crimson (10-14, 3-7 Ivy) held Penn (16-7, 7-2) to just 35 percent shooting from the field on Friday night before traveling to Princeton (25-0, 9-0) and holding the Tigers to 30 percent shooting in the first half.
But even with the strong defensive effort, the Killer P’s were too much for Harvard this weekend, as the Crimson lost to Penn, 71-61, at the Palestra, before failing to knock off Princeton in a 78-57 loss on Saturday night.
PRINCETON 78, HARVARD 57
After a 50-point loss to No. 16/17 Princeton earlier this year at Lavietes, Harvard came out of the gates ready to play at Jadwin Gymnasium.  The Crimson jumped out to a 15-9 advantage during the first 10 minutes of play thanks to six early points from junior forward AnnMarie Healy and swarming team defense.
“I think this time we came out with really no fear,” Healy said. “Their shots weren’t falling in the first half, but I think our biggest success was controlling the boards on defense and not letting them get second and third-chance shots.”
After a first half filled with missed shots from both teams, Princeton found its offensive rhythm, shooting 62 percent from the field in the second half while pushing the pace of play.
“I think the way they run the floor is really difficult to defend against,” sophomore guard Destiny Nunley said. “That is one of the main things that gave them the win last night. Our team defense was great, but a few too many times we let them run the floor, and that was a difference in the game.”
Offensively, Healy and senior forward Temi Fagbenle carried the load for the Crimson, as each finished with 18 points while shooting above 50 percent from the field. While the inside game worked well for Harvard, the starting guards for the Crimson struggled the entire night, shooting a combined 3-for-23 from the field on the night.
PENN 71, HARVARD 61
Despite shooting just 25 percent from the field on Friday night, Harvard kept the game close for most of the contest thanks to a double-double from Healy, who finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Junior guard Kit Metoyer scored 14 points and added three assists, while senior forward Erin McDonnell finished with 13 points and 7 rebounds, five of which were on the offensive glass.
“I’m not a one-on-one player,” Healy said. “I definitely rely on my teammates. They have been great at looking inside, and I’m just grateful my shot has been falling.”
The Crimson offense sputtered throughout the night, however, and of the 18 shots Harvard made from the field, 14 belonged to the trifecta of Healy, Metoyer, and McDonnell.
With the offense struggling, it was the Crimson defense that kept the team in the game. Led by six steals from Nunley, Harvard forced 16 turnovers and forced Penn into a tough shooting evening.
“I thought that defensively our communication was key,” Nunley said. “I thought in the Penn game our defense really had a spark too it, everyone was moving with purpose.”
The Quaker starters proved too much for the Crimson however, as four of the five finished in double figures on the night and sparked a second-half run that pushed the game well out of reach. Harvard cut the lead from as much as 25 back down to 10 as the game wound down, but the cold shooting stretches for the Crimson earlier in the game were too much to overcome.
“Sometimes [a team] goes cold,” Healy said. “But instead of waiting for an easier shot later on in an offensive possession, we would just jack it up early on in the offense and settle for a worse shot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, in a tournament sponsored by the Volleyball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., the Harvard men’s volleyball team played up to the grandeur of the event, claiming the championship trophy after besting Concordia-Irvine and Springfield on consecutive nights.
Junior outside hitter Branden Clemens nabbed MVP honors as the Crimson (8-4, 2-1 EIVA) rebounded from last weekend’s split performance with a pair of four-set victories.
“This tournament came at a perfect time,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We felt a little freer to be a little bit more aggressive…and it worked out.”
HARVARD 3, SPRINGFIELD 1
With the opening set of the final matchup of the 2015 Hall of Fame Morgan Classic hanging in the balance, the hometown Pride (8-5) crowd had found new life.
Seven hundred fans, many of them Springfield partisans, had watched Harvard pull away for a 24-21 lead, but the Pride had defended the next two set points, leading to an increasingly raucous gym and a Crimson timeout.
But with a decisive kill, senior outside hitter D.J. White silenced this atmosphere. The trend would repeat over four sets as Harvard would earn the championship with a 3-1 victory.
“It was really important for us to win that first set,” Clemens said. “It put us in a good mindset…for the rest of the game because we knew that we could play well in this gym.”
Clemens and White both recorded 17 kills to lead the Crimson attack. From the setter position, sophomore Nick Bendell matched a season high of 49 assists.
After dropping the second game, Harvard again faced the fury of the Springfield crowd at the beginning of the third. However, the Crimson responded with a 9-5 start. Although the Pride fought back to tie the score, Harvard ended on a 4-1 run to take the set, 25-23.
The most lopsided game belonged to Springfield, which opened up a six-point advantage in the second set before winning, 25-21. White and Clemens combined for only four kills in the period.
In contrast, the pair notched nine over the course of the final game. Until the last point, neither team led by more than three, but the Crimson put together a tournament-ending 4-1 streak.
“I thought it was one of the better volleyball matches in terms of level of play of both teams that we’ve played this year,” Baise said. “We’ve struggled at times to close out sets this year…. We were able to do that against Springfield.”
HARVARD 3, CONCORDIA-IRVINE 1
A fast start hardly sufficed to describe Concordia-Irvine’s first-set play against Harvard.
The Eagles (7-4, 2-1 NAIA) began with back-to-back 3-0 runs, raced to a .545 hitting efficiency, and finished the game with a tidy 25-17 victory.
“We sometimes are just slow to start,” Clemens said. “We had a couple dumb mistakes early on that shouldn’t have happened.”
But thanks to a Clemens-heavy offense and a block-heavy defense, the Crimson steadied itself, taking the next three sets and grabbing a 3-1 victory.
The comeback was finalized in the final set when Harvard used a 5-1 run to erase an early-frame deficit. After breaking through a 9-9 deadlock, the Crimson never relinquished the lead, finishing the 25-19 set win with a Clemens kill.
“He’s definitely hot right now,” Baise said. “He’s been great on offense and has bailed us out of a lot of tough situations with some key kills at key moments.... Those are big contributions, and he’s been a difference maker for us.”
Despite the offensive numbers, the Harvard defense may have been the star of the game as the Crimson earned 24 blocks, including a season-high eight from co-captain and middle blocker Caleb Zimmick.
In the middle two sets, Zimmick won five points on rejections. Harvard pulled away late in both games, turning mid-frame deadlocks into 25-21 and 25-19 triumphs.
“We started to block well,” Baise said.  “We’ve been working a lot on our defense, [and] that was the difference on Friday night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three days. Eight schools. One champion.
Entering the weekend as the reigning title holder, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team ended its season Saturday at Blodgett Pool, adding on to its undefeated run through conference play with a second place finish at the Ivy League Championships.
The meet came directly after the Crimson (7-1-1, 6-0-1 Ivy) narrowly beat Yale, and tied Princeton in the annual HYP meet. These three contenders jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire, from vying for dominance at HYP to battling for the Ancient Eight title.
“Because we’ve had pretty tight meets all season and especially because we tied Princeton, we tried to go in with a calm, relaxed attitude and just roll with that momentum,” co-captain Stephanie Ferrell said.
The three teams fought back and forth for the first place slot over the meet’s first two days. The final day saw possession of first place switch between Harvard and the Tigers nearly every race. But Princeton seized its victory in the 400 freestyle relay, the meet’s final event, where its meet- and pool-record time of 3:18.25 ultimately earned the Tigers the title.
Princeton solidified its hold on the Frank Keefe Trophy with its final victory, finishing with 1423 points for the meet. The Crimson came next with 1401.5 points, while Yale earned third with 1377. Penn finished fourth, with Columbia, Brown, Cornell, and Dartmouth filling out the bottom half of the leaderboard.
“It gets hard when you get caught up over three days−it gives you time to think,” said Harvard coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92. “We overthought some of the races, and when that happens you lose a few points here and there. Unfortunately when your score is 1400 points, those points do add up.”
Despite being edged out by the Tigers, the Crimson had its own share of impressive performances. Freshman Geordie Enoch gave the team its first podium-topping finish of the meet, winning the 200 individual medley in 2:00.66. She continued her streak, winning the 400 IM, coming in third in the 200 breaststroke, and swimming on the third-place 400 and 800 freestyle relay teams.
“We are so incredibly proud of our freshmen,” Ferrell said. “It can be really tough showing up at Ivy League Championships not knowing what to expect. Being able to come in and handle that pressure and perform so well speaks to how strong our freshman class is.”
Junior Danielle Lee also came away with a set of medaled performances. She took first in the 100 and 200 backstroke, ninth in the 200 IM, and competed on four of the team’s five relay teams.
Harvard also sent out its seniors with a bang. Ferrell earned second in the 100 breast and finished her career with a time of 2:15.01 in the 200 breast, good for another runner-up spot on the pedestal. Ferrell also took third in the 200 IM.
The other Crimson swimming captain, Kelsey Hojan-Clark, made waves in the distance events. The senior took fourth and ninth in the 1000 and 1650 free, respectively. She also placed 18th in the 400 IM.
On the board, the diving team leapt its way to victory, with several competitors finishing top-eight in both the one-meter and the three-meter.
In the one-meter, Harvard swept places three through seven. Freshman Hannah Allchurch led the team, taking third with 278.15 points. She was followed by sophomore Elina Leiviska, senior Schuyler Moore, freshman Alisha Mah, and freshman Jing Leung.
“Our divers did a phenomenal job,” Morawski said. “[Diving coach Keith Miller ‘89] really had them well prepared to be at their best.”
A similar pattern arose in the three-meter. Leung closed off an impressive freshman season, coming in third. She was followed by Leiviska in fourth, Mah in sixth, and Moore in seventh.
As the season draws to a close and the seniors say their goodbyes, Ferrell is sure that the Crimson will continue to challenge its opponents.
“The team has nothing but great goals going forward, and [our girls are] going to achieve them,” Ferrell said.“They’re going to come back with a vengeance that will be great to watch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team took a trip to the nation’s capital for two road matches. The team split the contests, with the No. 46 Crimson falling to No. 67 Maryland, 5-2, in College Park on Saturday before beating George Washington on Sunday. The team was led by freshman Nikki Kallenberg. The Naples, Fla. native, playing from the first singles spot on both days, was the only Harvard player to pick up two singles victories on the weekend.
“Niki’s been playing amazing the last few weeks,” coach Traci Green said. “She’s been putting a lot of beautiful points and patterns together. We’re proud of her progress and are looking for more great things from her. She’s still a freshman so she’s still growing, but so far she’s been a gem for us.”
HARVARD 4, GEORGE WASHINGTON 0
Harvard came into Sunday’s contest with George Washington looking to end a three-match losing streak going into its first weekend of the spring season. Fueled by three convincing singles victories and a sweep in the doubles matches, the Crimson (5-4) was able to return to Cambridge above .500 after defeating the Colonials (4-3).
“Our team was very aware that the match [Saturday] could have gone either way,” Green said. “We got some rest, recharged, and came out ready to go.”
Kallenberg picked up a win in the day’s top singles match with a victory over GW freshman Teodora Radosavljevic. Junior Amanda Lin and captain Sylvia Li won from the fifth and sixth singles positions, respectively.
In doubles action, Harvard took all three contests. Sophomore Monica Lin and freshman Ellen Jang-Millsten took first doubles, junior Amy He and Kallenberg were victorious from No. 2, and Li and Amanda Lin made it a sweep from the third spot.
MARYLAND 5, HARVARD 2
The Crimson continued its challenging nonconference schedule by opening the weekend against Maryland. For Harvard, the match was the first for the team since road losses to two top-ten teams in Cal and Stanford last weekend, while the Terrapins (4-4) were coming off a 4-1 road victory over St. John’s.
After dropping her first set, 6-1, Kallenberg stormed back to take the next two to pick up a win for the Crimson. The 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory was the first-year’s second victory of the season playing from the first singles position in sophomore June Lee’s absence.
Harvard was also able to pick up a victory in the second singles position after Monica Lin bested Maryland freshman Ekaterina Tour in a closely fought, 7-6, 6-7, 10-5 marathon match. However, the Crimson was unable to pick up the all-important doubles point or a victory in the day’s other four singles matches.
“They were a good team, they were really nitty-gritty, really feisty,” Lee said. “They fought really hard and I mean so did we, we were right there. But, they executed well and we definitely learned from it.”
He also had her match come down to the wire, but with a different result than Lin’s. Harvard’s fifth singles player took the first set, 6-3, before dropping the second, 5-7, and the tiebreaker, 10-6.
Freshman Annika Ringblom, playing third singles, lost both of her sets, 6-2, while Li, playing from six, fell in consecutive 6-3 contests. Jang-Millsten rounded out the top six with a 6-4, 6-3 loss to Terrapins senior Welma Luus.
The doubles point came down to two tiebreakers, but Maryland ultimately ended up on top as Monica Lin and Jang-Millsten lost in first doubles while the freshman duo of Ringblom and Kallenberg fell at the second spot.
The doubles point has been a predictor of success for the Crimson this season. The team is 5-0 in matches when it has won at least two of the three doubles matches and 0-4 when it has not.
“I think we’re definitely going to do a lot of doubles [work this week] because the doubles point is really important,” Lee said. “Being ahead that one point makes a big difference.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the UMass men’s lacrosse team scored its 13th goal of the afternoon on Saturday, things looked bleak for the Harvard squad in its season opener. Having extended its lead to a game-high three goals in the opening minute of the fourth quarter, the Minutemen appeared poised to come away with their fourth win over the Crimson in as many years.
But fresh off its most successful campaign in recent history, Harvard got to work. Behind four unanswered goals in the final six minutes, the No. 12/13 Crimson (1-0) earned its first victory on Opening Day since 2012, storming back to defeat UMass (0-3) at a snowy Soldiers Field, 14-13.
After cutting the deficit to 13-11 with just over five-and-a-half minutes remaining, Harvard turned to a rookie and a pair of junior attackmen to close the gap.
Sliding past two defensemen, freshman midfielder Sean Coleman delivered a pass to junior Devin Dwyer, who rocketed one past Minuteman goalie Zach Oliveri from the left post to bring Harvard within one with 3:51 to go.
Seconds later, Coleman was at it again. After gaining control of the ensuing faceoff, junior midfielder Jack Breit sprinted up the right wing, eventually finding Coleman in the slot. Rather than rip a shot on goal, the rookie continued to move the ball to the left, finding junior Deke Burns.
And on a day when the third-year attackman seemingly could not miss, Burns never hesitated. The junior ripped a shot over the left shoulder of Oliveri, giving Burns a career-high seven goals in the contest, and more importantly, pulling the Crimson even.
“All week we were working on situations like this, winning close games,” junior midfielder Sean McDonagh said. “Our team this year is really good at getting hot and staying hot. We had that one opportunity to get the momentum back and get some sparks flying, and we took advantage of it.”
McDonagh provided the game’s final spark with 2:15 left in the contest. With UMass playing a man-to-man defense, the junior decided to run circles around the perimeter. Once he found a lane to the left of the net, McDonagh burst past his defender and squeezed a shot short-side past Oliveri to give his team its first lead since the first quarter.
From there, it was up to the Crimson defense to hold its own. And playing in just the fifth contest of his collegiate career, junior goaltender Bryan Moore did just that. Coming on for senior co-captain Jake Gambitsky in the final minutes of the third quarter, Moore made three saves, including one with just 35 seconds remaining, to preserve his first career win.
“[Moore] played a great game,” Burns said. “He actually had a great week of practice, noticeably just making a lot of saves and conducting the clear really well. To see him go in there at the end of the game was pretty awesome. He stepped right in there, and that’s kind of the motto of our team: next guy up.”
For the Minutemen, Saturday marked their third-straight loss against a ranked opponent to open the year. UMass received multiple goals from four different players, including three from sophomore attackman Brendan Hegarty.
On the other end of the field, the Crimson countered the balanced UMass attack with more of a one-man show. Coming off a sophomore season where he scored 18 goals in 17 games, Burns accounted for half of Harvard’s offense on Saturday, becoming the first member of the Crimson to score at least seven goals in a game since 2012.
“Deke’s a really streaky player, so if he gets hot, he’s a nuisance for the other team,” McDonagh said. “I knew right off the bat when he had his first goal that it was going to be a big day for him.”
After the game, Burns said his performance “might have been a little bit of a fluke,” but he admitted that his final goal certainly turned the tide.
“After we scored the 13th, I think pretty much everyone on our sideline and our team knew that we weren’t just trying to tie this game up,” Burns said. “We were going for the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team (10-4, 7-0 Ivy) came away with two wins and one loss in this year’s Collegiate Squash National Championship to place third.
“I’m very proud of the guys this season as such a young team, with winning the Ivy title and getting third in the country,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “With this squad and with this age group, I think this is a good achievement, and we’ll take it.”
After an undefeated last season and a resounding 9-0 win against Trinity in the 2014 national championships, this weekend at Trinity fell short of matching the impressive previous showing. However, the 2015 championships proved that losing more than half of their starting lineup from last year would not keep the Crimson from claiming a spot among the nation’s best.
“We knew that we were going to have a tough time, being seeded third,” co-captain Tyler Olson said. “We knew that in order to win we were going to have to beat three teams that we had lost to during the regular season. From a strategy standpoint, we just wanted to play our game, be smart [on the court], and keep fighting no matter what happened.”
Sophomore Bryan Koh, freshman David Ryan, and co-captain Tyler Olson all left the Bantams’ home court with three wins each. Koh’s comeback in his St. Lawrence matchup to win three straight matches after losing the first two and Olson’s two five-game victories in the Saturday games were both notable performances that kept Harvard in the competition down to the final matches.
HARVARD 6, COLUMBIA 3
It was the middle of the ladder that helped propel the Crimson over No. 4 Columbia (13-4, 6-1 Ivy) for the second time this season. While Trinity and St. Lawrence played out the final championship contest, Harvard solidified its Ivy dominance by finishing highest out of the Ancient Eight teams that competed this weekend.
While freshman Madhav Dhingra and sophomore Dylan Murray dropped their matches against the number one and two opponents, the next five Crimson players notched wins against the Lions with relative ease, with no match going over four games.
In addition to these five victories, junior Sam Goldberg swept Tarun Nambiar in three games as the ninth seed.
ST. LAWRENCE 5, HARVARD 4
The No. 2 seeded St. Lawrence team (15-1, 4-0 Liberty) proved too strong again for the Harvard team in the semifinal of the championships in their second matchup this year. When the two teams met earlier this season, the matchup resulted in a 7-2 Crimson loss.
“I feel like a couple players may feel like a win slipped away,” Way said. “We feel like it was a winnable match but we just didn’t get the job done, but this is sports and that happens.”
In a hard fought battle, freshman Seif Eleinen was unable to recover from his injury early in the game and dropped his match at the number nine spot, 3-1.
Olson and Koh both pulled through five games to notch two more victories against the Saints and to finish the game with a 5-4 loss.
HARVARD 5, ROCHESTER 4
In its first encounter at the beginning of the 2014-2015 season, No. 6 Rochester University (12-5, 3-1 Liberty) could not pull of the win, as it was the Crimson who came away with the 5-4 advantage.
“We were seeded higher [for this weekend],” Way said. “But I think on paper they thought they were better. They’re a well-coached team, they’re strong top to bottom, they’re always tough to play, but the [Harvard] guys came through, and it was a job well-done.”
This weekend, it was up to Olson to sway the outcome of the game after his teammates succeeded in notching four victories. As his match reached 2-2, Olson ended the fifth game with an 11-9 win to advance his team to the semifinals.
“I would say I’m extremely happy with the season and how the whole year went,” Olson said. “Leading such an awesome group of guys for so many months and seeing the highs and the lows made it an amazing experience. All the guys really came together as a team and were playing for each other out there, I could see how much they were fighting, and I’m very proud of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With an ECAC Division I indoor title under its belt following last weekend’s convincing victories over Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth, the Harvard men’s tennis team rode a three match win streak into contests against a trio of nonconference opponents this past weekend.
The Crimson (9-3) opened up weekend play on Saturday with a 5-2 victory over Minnesota (7-3) before falling to No. 23 Vanderbilt (8-2) by a score of 4-3 on Sunday. Harvard closed the weekend playing late into Sunday evening and earned a 6-1 victory over visiting Bryant (0-7).
HARVARD 6, BRYANT 1
Crimson sophomore Brian Yeung battled Bryant’s Matt Kuhar in the final marathon match between the two schools. Yeung completed the comeback, defeating Kuhar, 4-6, 7-6, 1-0. But by then, Harvard had already secured the victory as the squad picked up the doubles point as well as five of the six singles matches to beat Bryant by a final score of 6-1.
“My question today was whether we had anything left,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “It’s a long weekend. Brian earned three wins in a big weekend for him. He was consistent in his game and kept a great attitude until the end.”
All other Crimson victories came in straight sets, including two victories from senior Shaun Chaudhuri, who took the first doubles match with fellow senior Denis Nguyen by a score of 6-2. Chaudhuri had no trouble in the second singles match, besting Bryant’s Zachary Morris in straight sets, 6-4, 6-1.
Sophomore Andrew Ball, junior Kelvin Lam, and freshman Xavier Gonzalez all also claimed singles victories for the Crimson.
VANDERBILT 4, HARVARD 3
The showdown between Vanderbilt and Harvard rested on the shoulders of sophomore Sebastian Beltrame, as the Crimson was tied with the Commodores at a score of 3-3 as all matches except for the second singles battle had come to an end.
After dropping the first set by a score of 6-4, Beltrame stormed back to take the second set, 7-6. After going down 5-2 early in the third set, Beltrame showed his resilience and brought the score as close as 5-4, but could not complete the comeback as Vanderbilt’s Rhys Johnson claimed the match by score of 6-4, 6-7, 6-4, and secured the Commodores’ victory over the Crimson by a score of 4-3.
“It was tough,” Beltrame said. “We got a couple huge wins right away…but it was real close, real well-fought out at the end. They’re a great team.”
Freshman Kenny Tao and Yeung kicked off the wins for Harvard, triumphing at fifth and sixth singles, respectively.
Captain Alex Steinroeder dropped his last two sets and the match at fourth singles against Vanderbilt’s Daniel Valent after claiming the first set, 6-3. Nguyen had his hands full against No. 8 ranked Austin Gonzales, who won the first singles match by a score of 7-6, 6-3.
HARVARD 5, MINNESOTA 2
Minnesota, which had lost on Friday to Vanderbilt, was looking to rebound against the Crimson in Cambridge. Harvard proved to be too much for the Gophers, however, as the Crimson topped Minnesota by a final score of 5-2.
“After losing the doubles point our guys came out on fire,” Fish said. “We got a good jump on them, and it was still very close in the end.”
That fire came in the form of junior Nicky Hu and Steinroeder, who both stormed back after dropping their second sets to win their matches. Hu defeated Minnesota senior Jack Hamburg by a score of 6-1, 3-6, 7-6. Steinroeder, who claimed the fourth singles victory for Harvard, clinched the win by a score of 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
After the second and third doubles pairs dropped their matches despite two match point opportunities, the Crimson responded by claiming five out of six singles matches. At first singles, Nguyen had no trouble upsetting No. 25 Leandro Toledo in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4.
Tao and Yeung also won their matches at fifth and sixth singles, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a weekend without matches, the Harvard women’s water polo team traveled to Princeton for the second time this month to take part in the inaugural Ivy Championship Tournament this past weekend.
Coming into the tournament seeded third, the Crimson (5-4, 2-1 CWPA) battled to a 6-5 loss in the tournament’s semifinal round against second-seeded Brown (3-3) and went on to defeat Dartmouth, 14-0, in the third-place match.
HARVARD 14, DARTMOUTH 0
Following a last-minute loss to the Bears in the tournament semifinal, Harvard faced off against the Big Green in a battle for third place in the tournament on Sunday morning.
The Crimson opened the game on an offensive tear, scoring five goals in the first three minutes of the match, leading up to a seven-goal first quarter. After an 11-save performance in the semifinal, freshman goalie Cleo Harrington earned her first shutout of the season, making seven saves against Dartmouth.
Junior attacker Charlotte Hendrix contributed to the scoring with two goals in the fourth quarter. The Santa Barbara, Calif., native also headed the defensive team effort that Harvard put forth throughout the match.
“We didn’t let them score,” Hendrix said. “That was one of our goals, to have a shutout. We played such phenomenal defense in the [semifinal] game, and we wanted that to carry over into the [consolation] game.”
The Crimson was in cruise control for the entirety of the contest, stretching its lead to eight by halftime. Junior attacker Rachel Lobato led the way for Harvard with four goals, while freshman attacker Sami Strutner chipped in a goal and a team-high five assists.
BROWN 6, HARVARD 5
The first round of the tournament pitted the Crimson against Ivy counterpart Brown in an early morning matchup on Saturday for a spot in the championship game against host Princeton.
Both teams had trouble finding the net throughout the game, but it was the Bears who broke through in the final minute of play to take the lead and the game 6-5. Senior attacker Liz Rosen gave Brown the lead with a shot from the right wing, which followed a string of passes from the Brown attack.
The first half saw the Bears jump out to a 5-2 lead before the halftime break. Harvard coach Ted Minnis lamented his team's inability to capitalize on offensive opportunities in the first half.
“[We] just couldn’t get anything going offensively,” Minnis said. “We went one for five on our power play, and you can’t win games that way.”
However, the Crimson defense stepped up in the third and fourth quarters, allowing only one goal in the second half of play, which included a stretch of 14 shutout minutes. Captain Victoria Frager produced five steals in the contest, keeping the score close throughout.
“We’ve been happy with how we’re practicing,” Hendrix said. “And at this point in the season, it’s good that we’re playing at this level, and it’s okay to be at a point where we have room to move forward.”

Harvard (1-0) defeated Hofstra (2-1) in its season opener at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium on Saturday. Although the Crimson headed into halftime neck-and-neck with the Pride with a tied score of 4-4, Harvard managed to edge out Hofstra, 6-2, in the second half, clinching an overall four-goal victory, 10-6.
In the opening period, the two teams put up interchanging goals, with neither team possessing greater than a two-point lead throughout the half. On offense, the Crimson executed three of its four first-half goals from free position opportunities.
To open up the second half, sophomore attack Maeve McMahon fed a pass to Carolyn Bruckmann, who tallied Harvard’s first goal less than a minute into the period.
While half of the Crimson’s goals came from free position executions, the Pride utilized settled offense, with five of its six goals coming from assists. Senior attack Brittain Altomare led Hofstra with two assists, both in the first period.
Harvard’s draw control possession, 10-8 over the Pride, benefited the team’s offensive surge. Sophomore attack Megan Hennessey clinched four draw controls while McMahon tallied two of her own.
Capitalizing on isolations and free positions, sophomore attack Marisa Romeo led the Crimson with four goals. Fellow sophomore McMahon buried a transition goal with a few minutes remaining in the second period, leveling the score, 4-4, heading into halftime. Romeo also posted Harvard’s first goal of the game on a free position shot that gave the Crimson its first lead.
The Harvard defense clobbered Hofstra in clear attempts, with the Crimson executing 14-of-15 attempts and the Pride only clearing 13-of-23. Junior goalie Kelly Weis recorded 11 saves in net for Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a disappointing Friday night for Harvard wrestling, as the squad dropped its final home meet of the season to Columbia at the Malkin Athletic Center, 27-12. With this loss, the Crimson moves on to a 3-8 overall record on the year.
“We had a lot of guys out of the lineup because of injuries, so I knew we would need a special effort to win,” Harvard Coach Jay Weiss said. “We had to bump up some guys to higher classes, and I hate doing that, but those guys did it and fought hard out there, which was exciting. I saw some good things, but I also saw some things that really need to be fixed quickly.”
For the 11th straight meet, the Crimson began the meet with a forfeit in the 125-pound weight class position, beginning the match with an immediate deficit.
“Obviously it’s been frustrating having so many guys out with injuries this season,” Weiss said. “It’s unfortunate for us that Eastern’s will probably be the first time we have our full lineup out there on the mat.”
Junior Josh Popple, who has spent the season battling injuries, repeated last week’s winning performance, fighting through a gritty match with Columbia’s Zack Hernandez at 184. Popple was outmaneuvered the entire first half of the match, but managed to turn the momentum at the midway point, eventually taking down Hernandez to notch the only Harvard pin of the day.
“If you look back at the last couple weeks with Josh, he’s been through a lot,” Weiss said. “We had to bump him up to 197 with James out with a concussion, and he came out huge and got a win for us and did the same thing this week. He’s a dangerous wrestler. He got that guy on his back, and that was huge for us.”
The comeback effort was Popple’s third consecutive win since his return to action.
“Being down, two-nothing, was something that I just couldn’t let get into my head,” Popple said. “I fought through it, getting him on his back, and you can’t ask for anything better than that really.”
Another notable performance on the day came from junior Pappy Hogan, who managed to snag a victory over the Lions’ Connor Sutton, 4-3, in his first match back from an injury.
“Pappy was just dealt a bad hand this whole year with injuries and illness last semester,” Weiss said. “He’s really just been fighting for his health to get back into the lineup, and he had a huge match last night. We needed him, and so its great for him to get to start to put things back together after such a frustrating season.”
Much like Popple, Hogan’s match was a comeback effort. After a tough start, the junior turned the tables later on in the contest.
“Getting a two-point turn in the third period there was a huge moment for him,” Popple said. “ He hadn’t gotten many of those this year, and it was definitely the deciding point for him in the match.”
For the Crimson, it was co-captain Todd Preston that first got Harvard on the board. Throughout the dual meet season, Preston has maintained an undefeated record, the first Harvard wrestler since 2013 to achieve this, and the match against Columbia was no different. Preston fought through a close match with the Lions’ Matt Leshinger, outmaneuvering his opponent to register the win, 5-2.
“He’s someone who has been a leader from day one,” Weiss said. “I don’t think he’s wrestled his best, and I know that he was at this time last year. He kept his composure and did some nice things last night.”
For the Crimson, Preston, Hogan and Popple were the only three to notch wins on the day.
“It comes down to execution,” Weiss said. “There were some mental lapses and mistakes that we’ve been making, and we can’t afford to make a mistake in a seven minute match. I thought we outwrestled Columbia, but those little mistakes cost us, and we’ve got to figure that out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team opened its 2015 season this weekend in Madeira Beach, Fla., with a slate of five games over the course of three days. The Crimson went 2-3 at the EMU Madeira Beach Spring Invitational.
ROBERT MORRIS 2, HARVARD 1 (8 innings)
The final game of the weekend came down to a walk-off two-run home run in the bottom of the eighth, wrapping up a pitchers’ duel that saw a both teams combine for a total of only seven hits over the course of the eight innings.
Sophomore pitcher Taylor Cabe suffered her first loss of the season after Eagles catcher Lauren Hackett sent a pitch over the left field fence with one of her teammates on second base. Heading into the eighth inning, Robert Morris (6-3) was held to three hits.
Through the first two games, Cabe’s ERA is 2.28.
TEXAS STATE 9, HARVARD 2
After giving up six runs in the top of the first, the Crimson struggled to remain in the game as the Bobcats (9-7) continued to score runs into the seventh inning.
The loss came by the arm of senior right hander Laura Ricciardone. Following the first inning, junior Morgan Groom came on in relief of Ricciardone, throwing 4.1 scoreless innings before being lifted in favor of senior Gabrielle Ruiz.
“Seeing all the pitchers throw was a really good starting point in the season,” junior second baseman Katie Lantz said. “They were facing batters that already had 20 games under their belt and they still all did a great job.”
UAB 12, HARVARD 6
Despite a very productive offensive effort by the Crimson, the Blazers (9-5) were able to answer on all accounts, doubling the runs scored by Harvard.
Junior catcher Katherine Appelbe led the Crimson offense with two hits and three RBIs, including a double and a triple. Appelbe ended the weekend with a .400 average, going 4-for-10 in the batter’s box while recording two singles, a double, and a triple.
“It was great to see the defense come out really strong and the offense come out even stronger,” Lantz said. “At the end of the second day we had scored 22 runs on offense. That to me is a strong performance.”
HARVARD 8, VILLANOVA 3
Heading into the fourth inning down 3-1, the Crimson offense exploded, taking back the lead given up to the Wildcats (1-4) in the bottom of the first and setting the pace for the rest of the game. With the bases loaded and the team down two runs, senior outfielder Andrea Del Conte was able to pound a single down the left field line to clear the bases and give Harvard the lead it needed.
Sophomore infielder Catherine Callaway led the team with three hits in the contest, along with scoring a run and driving in an RBI.
In the circle, Cabe notched the first win of her sophomore campaign, throwing all seven innings, allowing three runs on seven hits.
HARVARD 8, WICHITA STATE 0 (5 innings)
The opening game of the weekend proved to be Harvard’s strongest performance, as the team outperformed the Shockers (7-7) en route to an 8-0 win.
The Crimson tacked on a run in each of the two opening innings, but was able to break open the door in the fourth, scoring six runs to seal the game by mercy rule.
Leading the Harvard offense was senior shortstop Emily Gusse, who had three hits in the game, including the game’s only triple. Freshman outfielder Maddy Kaplan and Callaway both homered for the team, with Kaplan tallying two RBIs.
“This weekend showed us a lot about the team that we’re shaping up to be and what we need to work on,” Gusse said. “We’re starting to figure out what works out together in the time before we start conference play. In reality we want to use all 22 of our players and we’re trying to find the best way to make that happen.”

Transfer season came and went (I didn’t even know this was a thing tbh because #riverhouse) and for one reason or another, some of us have made the life-changing decision to live in another House. After some strenuous and rigorous research, we discovered the many ways people justified transferring.
1) You live in the Quad: You might as well be living in Narnia. Despite the routinely stated “but it’s suuuuuuch a great community, promise,” you know this does not compensate for waiting in line for the shuttle while the frostbite seeps through those Bean boots. Oh, and preferably you’d like to be in the same zip code as the school you attend.
2) You want to be closer to Felipe’s: Those cold weekend nights after you’ve crushed your CS50 pset or some beers (usually the former), nothing is more rewarding than topping it all off with a super burrito from your favorite Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately the shuttle doesn’t take one from Mather straight to this historic cornerstone.  So, a house closer to the Square would be the move to make.
3) A little Datamatch can go a long way: The desire to transfer Houses is intended to be closer with someone else. What better way to surprise them than with that special letter of transfer? Makes the planning for the waffle date much easier.  Besides, closer proximity means less time commuting and more time Netflixing together.
4) You long for a change of scenery and a legitimate reason to be late to everything: Quad.
5) The Blockmate Situation: Having a difficult time concentrating at night while your roommate makes inhuman noises? Getting sexiled a bit too often? Tired of the room smelling like three weeks of your lovely roommate’s unwashed laundry? Yolo it and transfer.
For those still waiting to transfer, we know difficult times lie ahead (or not), but all housing adventures have their trials and tribulations. May the Housing gods be forever in your favor (again).

How exactly do I get onto the elusive Harvard Campus Story? Why don’t they post my selfies? Does that mean I’m not pretty? Is my life not interesting enough for the viewing of the Harvard general Snapchat population? What could I possibly be doing wrong? Worry not; if you’ve ever asked yourself any of these questions, you are not alone. These are the queries that haunt us all. Well I’m here to present a scientifically proven approach that will (semi-reliably) lead to a spot on the Campus Story, aka the ultimate Snapchat glory.
Step 1: Throw yourself into the snow. Statistically speaking, this is the most reliable way to make it onto the Campus Story.
Step 2: Just dance. Anywhere and wearing anything is accepted, but popular locations include Lamont and dorm rooms, with a preference for bizarre costumes such as sumo wrestlers and dinosaurs.
Step 3: Attend a sporting event. At least a few snaps from the big events on campus will make it, but note that the pickings are slim. Act quickly, be competitive, be ruthless. Previous successful sports snaps have included anything from the tip off at a big basketball game to a photo finish of the women’s swim championships. It’s survival of the cleverest out there.
Step 4: Be on a team and Snapchat from the locker room. Those always get on.
Step 5: Capitalize when big celebrities come to visit. Recent popular ones included the HONY guy, Eva Longoria, and Keegan-Michael Key. Really this is just Snapchat’s way of rubbing in the fact that the rest of you unfortunate souls didn’t get to see them, but don’t let this stop you. After all, all’s fair in love and Snapchat.
Step 6: Don’t post selfies. Just don’t do it. (*Note: this advice really applies to any time you Snapchat, not just trying to get pictures on Campus Story)
Step 7: Leave 2 psets and a paper to complete the night before a midterm. Then go to Lamont and record yourself crying. Shout out to Snapchat for loving a good sob story.
Step 8: If none of the above to the trick, give up and resort to the far less selective Harvardyak.
Good luck and happy snapping!
