After nearly three years of anticipation, trap-pop megastar Symere Woods, better known as Lil Uzi Vert, finally dropped the album “Eternal Atake'' and its deluxe edition “LUV vs. The World 2,” the sequel to his acclaimed 2016 mixtape “Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World.” “Eternal Atake,” or, in his own words, to “forever overtake,” marks Lil Uzi’s first album since he crashed airwaves worldwide with his moody trap-pop anthem “XO Tour Llif3” and his Billboard-topping debut studio album “Luv is Rage 2.” His galactic odyssey of a sophomore album is Lil Uzi’s biggest flex yet. Balancing hard-hitting instrumentals with bouncy melodic flows, “Eternal Atake” marks a new level of confidence in, and ownership of, Lil Uzi’s trap-star lifestyle and craft.
From his lead single “Baby Pluto” on, Lil Uzi’s subject matter recycles cliches — the violence he partakes in, the women he sleeps with, and the drugs he takes to cope with both — but Lil Uzi innovates with imaginative concepts and versatility. The 18 track album and its 32 track extended release emulate the supernaturally inspired concepts of Uzi’s previous projects. Where “XO Tour Llif3”’s official music video depicted a drug-induced zombie apocalypse, “Eternal Atake” finds Lil Uzi invested in the concept of outer space. The album visualizer “Baby Pluto,” posted to Lil Uzi’s YouTube channel, features the rapper leading an extraterrestrial cult of sorts after being abducted by a UFO.
The album layout is similarly innovative, presented as a rap saga of three acts, each delivered by one of Lil Uzi’s three rap personas: Baby Pluto, Renji, and Uzi. Leveraging three different narrative voices throughout the album, Lil Uzi delivers perhaps his most sonically diverse project to date.
Though his music has often been labeled as “emo rap” and “punk rap” due to its genre-blending sound, Lil Uzi proves he is still a legitimate hype hip-hop hit maker on “Eternal Atake.” On songs like “Silly Watch,” he sheds moody electronic synths and picks up the tempo. Complete with speaker-knocking bass beats, rapid-fire hi-hats, and hyped “Wooh/Yeah” adlibs, Lil Uzi embodies the swagger and energy of his viral Migos collaboration “Bad and Boujee.” As he calls out “Got a Richard Mille, this not a silly watch (Woah) / All this money make me wan' hit my Diddy Bop,” his voice sounds full of genuine joy and humor, marking an encouraging return to form. These energetic tracks are a refreshing reminder of Lil Uzi’s musical passion after his tumultuous three years of label trouble and tweets about being “done with music.”
Despite the nostalgia for his old style present on some tracks, Lil Uzi does not shy from vocal experimentation. While sometimes detracting from the album’s cohesion, tracks like “Futsal Shuffle 2020” and “Lotus” see Lil Uzi using brassy digital synths to push his futuristic style to another level. His exploration of a new sound is perhaps best captured in “Urgency,” on which he collaborates with The Internet vocalist Syd. Syd’s mellowed vocals on the track in combination with an instrumental shift towards a syncopated bass backdrop give the track a unique R&B flavor à la Jhené Aiko. Following suit in mellow fashion is Lil Uzi, layering smooth, almost jazzy vocals over the track. This sort of vocal experimentation is an example of the way “Eternal Atake” elevates the rapper’s craft. “Eternal Atake” is Lil Uzi firing on all cylinders — drawing from his established sound without limiting his creative exploration.
Perhaps one of the benefits of dropping such a long project — the extended project “Luv vs. The World 2” is an hour and 45 minutes of playtime — is that what Lil Uzi sacrifices in cohesion he gains in versatility. Technical or lyrical, melodic or biting, his flow and delivery offer a shade for everyone. Being the crowd pleaser that he is, Lil Uzi provides fans a sequel to his breakthrough “XO Tour Llif3” with his reflective “P2.” As the track winds to a close, he captures the concept of being frozen in time singing “I don't wanna get older, I'm still livin' in my last year / I hope my life just keep goin', don't worry 'bout that.” Here he plays with the concept of stopping time only to forever live the best moments he is living today.
Lil Uzi’s “concepts” are not exclusive to the tracks themselves, but also woven into the soundbites interspersed through the album. At the beginning and end of songs like “Bust Me” and “P2,” careful listeners are rewarded with inventive audio snippets — muted conversations, the hum of a spaceship engine, a buzzing space portal — that grant narrative dimension to the galactic journey of “Eternal Atake.”
Lil Uzi's latest project finds him ready to take us on a trip through the cosmic depths of his imagination, and for the foreseeable future, seems well worth the ride.

“It’s quite strange to be playing to an empty room, but I’m hoping it’s going okay, that you’re here and I’m here,” Dave Matthews said during his live-streamed performance as a part of Verizon’s #PayItForwardLIVE — a series of online concerts in support of small businesses featuring everyone from Marshmello to One Republic — on Mar. 26.
Streaming from an empty room, Matthews started his hour-long set with “So Damn Lucky” from his solo album, “Some Devil.” As he played the song’s finger-picked melody, softly singing about “what will soon become of [him],” two acoustic guitars and a lone ukulele stood in as his audience. A music stand with the lyrics to his songs accompanied him too as Matthews divulged that he had trouble remembering them without the energy of a crowd. “This is strange, you know, I'm talking to a computer,” he said at one point.
In between songs, Matthews cracked jokes to the camera and, in line with the night’s mission of supporting small businesses, gave his own tips for helping out during social distancing and isolation. “I just think we should think about all those places that are one to us and are closed for now in this dangerous time,” he said. “So, maybe, we can invest a little bit in the possibility that they may come back.” Matthews spoke openly about the coffee shops and bars he would frequently haunt, citing the large role they have played in his life and acknowledging their absence.
His next song, “Mercy,” cut especially deep given the present circumstance. “I know you can see / All the world and the mess that we're making,” he sang, and the lyrics took on new meaning when propped up against the background of the need to live-stream performances in the first place. “Mercy, will we overcome this?” he sang at each chorus, letting his voice rise powerfully over his guitar playing as though he were earnestly begging for an answer, but Matthews seemed to know that all he could do was “maybe carry on just a little bit longer,” both for the loved ones featured in the song and for those from whom he is now isolated from. After the song, Matthews gave the best advice of the night: “Stay home. Stay away from me. Have a good time online and whatnot.”
He introduced his next song as one “about some dear friends” before starting the intro to “Virginia in the Rain,” one of the standout tracks on Dave Matthews Band’s latest album, 2018’s “Come Tomorrow.” While the studio version is heartfelt and yearning, his performance on Verzon’s livestream was more stripped down, somehow even more comforting than the nostalgia-inducing original recording. The normally slower song became upbeat and summery, almost as if the melody itself was anxious to go run outside amongst the wildflowers. Or at least, that was the image created by Matthews and his guitar from within the confines of the white-walled room. Eventually, the song’s summer feeling caught up to Matthews, who completely gave into the desire to sing every voice part of the song as his guitar weaved through rhythm, lead, and bassline, making the performance especially fun and engaging for those watching from home.
“I don’t know if I played this already. Maybe I didn’t? But I think I’m gonna shut up and play some more music,” he said with the same candor that characterized the livestream from start to finish. “If you have something to do, you should feel free to go do it,” he added, reminding his viewers once more of the strangeness that is watching an artist perform to an imagined audience.
“I haven’t played this song before, only for my family… but it’s quite sweet, I think,” he said, aptly introducing an unreleased song inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic titled “Windows.” With his voice singing lightly over the fingerstyle melody, Matthews carved a vivid image of a home and a community on lockdown, of being stuck inside but also of neighbors singing to each other from their windows. “None of us know what’s to come tomorrow, but I’m not going out today, so dance with me like the time we got is borrowed,” he sang, urging the livestream’s viewers to do the same. With “Windows,” Matthews focuses on the little things that keep him going during the crisis — of hallways and children playing and yearning for the day when the world will no longer have to live through windows — while parsing out the beauty in each of them.
Matthews ended his eight-song set with a haunting rendition of the Dave Matthews Band classic “Don’t Drink the Water,” his voice soaring effortlessly to a high falsetto while his guitar blazed under it.
“Thank you so much for tuning in. I hope that I’ve got it all right for you and everything,” he said just before turning off the camera. “Remember to look out for each other! That’s the number one thing in getting through things like this: Just be kind!” And with that, he put away his guitar, and the screen fell to black, his image replaced with Verizon’s glowing logo and the words “#PayItForwardLIVE.”

In her latest film “First Cow,” writer-director Kelly Reichardt follows the story of Cookie (John Magaro), a man just ousted from a group of fur trappers in early 19th century America. When Cookie meets Chinese immigrant King Lu (Orion Lee), the two share an instant connection and decide to team up to form a business whose success depends on the secret use of milk from a nearby landowner’s prized cow. Through her characters' trials and tribulations, Reichardt paints a powerful picture of the melancholic rhythm of life in rural Oregon — but some of her incongruent stylistic flourishes ultimately disrupt the illusion of gentleness she generally aspires to achieve.
Reichardt initially rallies image and sound to immerse her viewers in the harsh realities of foundational American life. She illustrates Cookie’s expulsion from his fur trapping troupe, King Lu's fleeing a band of hunters, and men hard at work at an impoverished temporary settlement. Reichardt complements these visuals with sounds of nature, like trees rustling, leaves crunching, moss scrunching, birds chirping, and fire crackling. It is clear that Reichardt’s intention is to transport audiences to an oft-overlooked realm of American life.
Once we’re there, Reichardt establishes a general mood of gentleness. This effect is achieved through images of hardship and the resigned interactions among the men at the settlement, as well as the minimal presence of the camera, since most of the shots are long and slow and their oblique framing confers a realistic appeal. Additionally, the sounds of nature serve as a constant source of calm. Even the way Cookie and King Lu’s relationship unfolds is conveyed with delicateness: They are often shown in silence, as if the other’s presence alone is enough. These visual, aural, and contextual elements come together to convey a gentleness, which when combined with the depressing subject matter of the film, imbues it with an overwhelming sense of melancholy.
But some of Reichardt’s stylistic choices contradict the prevailing atmosphere she tries so precariously to set up. For instance, while camera movement is subdued throughout "First Cow," in Cookie and King Lu’s first meeting, Reichardt inexplicably intercuts shots directly in front of each character, breaking her own stylistic norms. Some of these choices draw uncomfortable attention to themselves. During the night scenes, the lighting is so intense that Cookie and King Lu's faces reflect an unnatural glow. And when Cookie plucks flowers, the sound is dramatically heightened. Far from promoting the film's grain of realism, these choices accentuate the artificial construction of the movie, striking the viewer as peculiar and out of place.
Another of the film's inconsistencies lies in Cookie and King Lu’s friendship. The little dialogue they share feels out of place, shifting from poignant silence to sudden discussions of life dreams to occasionally awkward exchanges. Such disjunctive dialogue is a confusing refutation of the closeness that the film constantly implies.
“First Cow” gives us both a fascinating, critical perspective of rural America and a delicate depiction of male friendship. But the film falls short of creating its period-specific melancholic mood. The dissonance in Reichardt's choices with camera position and movement, sound, and dialogue results in an indecisive world that prevents the viewer from fully assimilating into the experience.

It was a sad day when Broadway shut down on Mar. 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Theater lovers were devastated — but more importantly, the cancellation of performances left casts, crews, and production teams without jobs. To provide aid during such a difficult time, Rosie O’Donnell, a comedian, actress, and author, brought back her 25-time Emmy Award-winning “The Rosie O’Donnell Show” for one night only. Streamed live on YouTube, O’Donnell’s show brought together Broadway stars from past and present to raise money for the Actors Fund, an organization that supports those in the entertainment industry. In addition to fundraising for a rewarding cause, the benefit showcased incredible performers and humanized stars throughout the industry. Poor wifi connections, struggles with audio, and views into celebrity homes felt more comforting than unprofessional, reminding viewers that the distance between seats and stage, audience member and performer, is not as insurmountable as it seems.
John McDaniel, the lead composer and producer of “The Rosie O’Donnell Show,” was the first guest of the night. McDaniel set the show off on a cheerful note with a rendition of “We Need a Little Christmas,” cleverly switching the line to “we need a little Rosie.” Most of the guests that followed kept the tone of the show just as upbeat, focusing less on the negative impacts of the virus and more on the bright future for Broadway after reopening. Even those who had spent months preparing for premieres only to have them cancelled days before remained optimistic. Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker, whose show “Plaza Suite” was set to begin on Mar. 13, only had good things to say about their healthy family and their gratitude for O’Donnell’s benefit. Words of encouragement and uplifting songs persisted throughout the three-and-a-half-hour show, lightening up unfortunate circumstances.
While all of the evening’s performances were meaningful and showcased impressive vocals, a few stood out as particularly mind blowing. Ben Platt serenaded viewers with a performance of “Make You Feel My Love,” effortlessly navigating the wide range and belting out higher notes with his trademark vibrato. Later, one of Platt’s “Dear Evan Hansen” successors, Jordan Fisher, performed “For Forever” from the musical. Fisher’s talent radiated as he sang the entire song with a smile on his face. Even the occasional glitch from a poor wifi connection could not detract from the pitch-perfect rendition. “Smile” was another popular choice, sung beautifully by both the legendary Patti LuPone and Audra McDonald with Will Swenson. This mission — to make viewers smile — continued with nostalgic Disney tunes as Andrew Lloyd Webber played a clever medley and Lea Salonga sang “Reflection” from “Mulan” just as exquisitely as she did in the 1998 film.
In addition to the performances, interviews, and short pre-recorded video messages, technical difficulties were a constant source of entertainment throughout the live stream. The show’s producer, Erich Bergen, became known as “Rosie Tech Support” after three guests in a row lacked audio and O’Donnell herself had trouble with her microphone. Many of the stars’ audio or video would skip, revealing that even celebrities struggle with acquiring flawless wifi. None of these issues made the experience less enjoyable; instead, the shared struggles brought viewers and performers closer together. Idina Menzel, whose talent has been displayed in theater, television, and film, tuned in from her kitchen with shaky camera angles and overall technological confusion, reinforcing the casual ease of the show. Her interview recalled conversations that many parents are having right now, with topics including the adventure of homeschooling and entertaining Menzel’s children. The informality of the live stream created an intimacy that does not exist during Broadway performances and interviews set in a studio, allowing viewers to bond with the stars along with O’Donnell.
O’Donnell’s one night only return was exactly what theater lovers and members of the Broadway community needed during this uncertain time. The show has since been posted on YouTube and the fundraiser, which has already raised almost $100,000, is still running. By bringing Broadway from the homes of the stars to the homes of the audience, O’Donnell successfully created a necessary feeling of unity and strength.

Captivated. I remember sitting in the front row of Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s 2018 iteration of the notorious “Introduction to Economics” course, feeling like I was being provided the language to articulate an entire approach to life. The definitions I scribbled in the margins of my notebook would come to define my first two years at Harvard — just as they’ve likely been defining yours, too.
That said, the impacts of COVID-19 force us to reconsider these definitions, providing new evidence towards the inviability of many of the hegemonic ideas courses like Ec 10a teach — evidence that cannot be ignored. As jobs and money become shorter in supply and life as we know it becomes harder to recognize, we will be forced to demand of one another what it really means to exist — and, more importantly, to exist together.
In his textbook, Mankiw delineates the four principles of “How People Make Decisions.” While straightforward, their implications are far-reaching.
1. “People face trade-offs.” In order to get something we like, we must give up something we like slightly less.
2. “The cost of something is what you give up to get it.” Opportunity cost is everything we must lose to gain something else. In trade, our comparative advantage (what we should spend our time doing) is in whatever we produce at the lowest opportunity cost.
3. “Rational people think at the margin.” Rationality is rooted in self-interest. It is doing our best to achieve personal objectives and involves making incremental adjustments instead of radical changes.
4. “People respond to incentives.” People alter their behavior in pursuit of rewards.
While these are handed to us as positive statements — statements about how the world is — they’re deeply normative, making assumptions and judgments about how we should be living. What grasp, then, might these principles have on us, and how has COVID-19 altered the extent to which we should accept their invisible hold?
After taking economics, I became obsessed with discovering my comparative advantage (which I’ve yet to find!) and began the dangerous game of calculating opportunity costs. In attending an hour-long yoga class, how much school work could I have done? Instead of spending five dollars to caffeinate myself, how much could I have donated to a better cause? This ongoing calculation led me to frame everything in terms of what I am losing, each choice accompanied by guilt  — and I don’t believe I’m alone in this habit.
Yet, the moment students learned we were being sent home, all of these smaller calculations ceased to matter. Time, while usually a liquidated asset, became viscous — as we waded through it slowly, what really matters most became more clear; the itch for expediency vanished. Many of us came to realize that the value of spending quality time with quality people cannot be quantified. Perhaps, we should measure opportunity cost in deep connections, not coins.
Because we’re taught to be “rational people,” however, our response to societal problems tends to be incremental. As students, we’re constantly nudged to think at the margins. For example, instead of society taking bold steps to fix the deeply-rooted systemic issues that lead to students fighting for a small number of quality jobs upon graduation and feeling like we’re never (doing) enough, we’re offered professional and peer counseling services to help us cope with the resulting stress. At least in part, this is because having individuals think at the margin enables dominant institutions and ideologies to maintain their power. If COVID-19 teaches us anything, it is that marginal adjustment is not working: We live in a time of crisis and it would seem that the only way to respond to such a crisis rationally, is radically.
There are many strong incentives to go outside right now. There is money to be made; people to see; food to taste; a world to explore. But this pandemic reminds us that our ultimate incentive is for the shared health of ourselves and the ones we love. The world stops if we do not first and foremost care for our wellbeing.
Mankiw’s four principles prescribe a singular way of existing within a society that seeks efficiency and assumes our interests are mainly materialistic and self-focused. However, the instances of altruism and self-sacrifice for the greater good that we are observing now and that flooded campus in those final days, evince that this archetype of human desire belongs in fiction. The only possible path forward is together.
Our comparative advantage must be found in compassion.
Personally, I’ve been paying the price of these principles for a while now, which early on seemed like the rational choice in a “free market.” Maybe this crisis will become our calling to stop measuring our lives in terms of opportunity cost, instead measuring them in terms of all that we constantly gain — so that we can continue to resist incentives other than the incentive for ourselves and others to be well and healthy and so that we contemplate how to best step out of the margins and contribute meaningfully to tackling our greatest challenges as global citizens.
For, we are not work-producing machines. Our supply can’t match every demand. Efficiency and self-interest are not our only objectives. Maybe following E10a’s principles of economics will help us become rich — but it’s improbable they will allow us to live richly.

The COVID-19 pandemic has left members of the Harvard community in need of institutional support. Recently, Harvard and the graduate student union reached a tentative agreement limiting graduate students to 20 hours of average weekly work. But so many graduate students need so much more. Indeed, there are outstanding calls from graduate students for student loan relief and a fully-funded “bridge year” for Ph.D. students.
Generosity starts at the top. When the University takes care of its graduate students — going above and beyond with emergency funding opportunities and timeline deferrals — graduate students will not only be able to better take care of themselves and their communities, but will also be able to dedicate themselves to their work, as students and as employees, from a distance.
It seems unfair to expect graduate students to commit themselves to teaching undergraduate courses when they are scrambling to figure out how to manage their Ph.D. projects or put meals on the table for their children. With funding guaranteed for a bridge year, graduate students would be able to make up for the lost time, worry less about lost funding, and ultimately complete the vital research to which they’ve devoted themselves.
Likewise, a universal temporary stay on student loan repayments would provide some relief for students in the midst of the financial and public health crisis in which we all find ourselves. The Harvard University Employee Credit Union is a private lender with the power to meet the standard of flexibility set by the federal government, which suspended federal student loan payments, interest-free, until October, and we encourage them to do so for all of its student loans.
Other institutions have led the way with generosity towards graduate students. The University of Michigan, for example, has pushed forward many of its winter deadlines for Ph.D. and Master’s programs. Many private lenders in New York, after reaching an agreement with the New York State Department of Financial Services, are providing universal student loan relief similar to that provided at the federal level.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has been engaged in “recession planning” for our University for quite some time. The global coronavirus pandemic was surely not what he or anyone else had in mind, but nevertheless, now is the opportunity to demonstrate that the University is well-prepared to protect both itself and its workers during a time of financial crisis.
There is no doubt that the COVID-19 outbreak will have damaging financial effects on the University, but Harvard’s financial losses will likely be recouped in the long term. Short-term financial difficulty, however, ought to not supersede the well-being of the people who bring the Harvard community to life.
So, as one small group of undergraduates, we call on the administration to go the extra mile for our graduate peers and mentors.

At least prior to coronavirus, I had a secret envy of the framers of the United States Constitution. While these individuals certainly made history — and the foundation for our system of government for that matter — their accomplishments were made possible by a unique historical environment. In ordinary times they would have simply been lawyers, merchants, or even forgotten military figures. But they were living through history, and they certainly knew that.
Today we have no shortage of reminders that what is going on around us is significant. We too are living through extraordinary times. The virus is everywhere, and pretty much all we do is talk about it. It dominates the headlines and opinion pages of newspapers, makes appearances on late night comedy shows, and even spawns meme pages. All sorts of people are asking questions and making predictions about when the pandemic will end, what will change after it’s over, and who, if anyone, we should blame.
We are constantly revising drafts for the history of today.
Yet where I see agency and possibility in interpreting the past, our excessive historicization of the present has become alienating and stifling. The more we look at the constant flow of news, statistics, and analysis, the more the virus comes to define all facets of our existence.
I don’t feel like the framers. I don’t even feel like Forrest Gump. As I go about my life, I am not trying to master history or even appreciate the significance of the moment. Right now, I just want to get through it.
The Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou’s celebrated film “活着” (“To Live”) captures this idea of living. His film depicts the trials of a family who lives through the tumult of modern Chinese history. The father, Fugui, is conscripted by both the nationalists and the communists during the Civil War, the son dies during the Great Leap Forward, and the daughter passes away in childbirth as the student “doctors” of the Cultural Revolution watch helplessly.
Yet at the end of the movie, as the father sits down with his infant grandson, he still expresses an abiding faith that from henceforth, “The days will get better and better.” The source of this hope is not a historical “lesson'' that Fugui drew from incredible external events. Fugui’s family does not live through history in neat or obvious ways: His forced conscription and loss of fortune saves the family when communists take over his village. His son dies not from the starvation caused by the destruction of technology in the Great Leap Forward, but from being struck by a modern car. The daughter’s death is especially cruel. The family rescues a competent real doctor, but accidentally overfeeds him and he is unable to assist her in childbirth. Instead, Fugui’s hope is rooted in a deep resilience which exists outside of, or even in opposition to extraordinary historical circumstances.
The decision to rely on an inner strength in the face of unfolding chaos is certainly not unique to Asian cinema. However, what distinguishes this resilient approach to living from say a Buddhist’s is that Fugui doesn’t turn his back on the chaos, he embraces the challenge of living head-on.
If the challenge for Fugui’s place and time was resisting radical disillusionment with history, I believe that our challenge is to resist excessive engagement. Even as we are told to stay in and practice social distancing, we have the disposition, and for many the occupational obligation, to look out at what’s going on and obsess over it. This is probably the worst time to take a break from the news, especially political news, but it is important to try. Like Fugui and his family, we cannot let history swallow our entire existence.
Let’s save our over-examination and historicization for later. To live through history, we must remind ourselves and our neighbors to have a life apart from it.

Harvard College’s 2020 summer programming will be held entirely online due to the coronavirus crisis, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in an email to undergraduates Monday afternoon.
The College mandated that undergraduates vacate campus last month to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Students are currently completing their spring semester of coursework online.
Khurana wrote that while he recognized students would find the news “disappointing,” the College is innovating methods to adapt projects and programming to the challenges of the pandemic.
The decision to move summer programming online will change many of the College-sponsored programs students use to find summer internships, per the email. Those programs include offerings sponsored by the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships and the Institute of Politics, as well as service programs offered through the Phillips Brooks House Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship. The decision will also disrupt the plans of athletes who arrive on campus early for pre-season training.
Throughout Monday afternoon, individual programs sent out specific messaging about how the College’s announcement would affect their operations.
All Harvard Summer School courses will move to a virtual format, Dean of Harvard Summer School Sandra A. Naddaff ’75 announced in an email Monday afternoon to those registered for classes.
For students planning to take Summer School courses for College credit, Khurana wrote that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has approved “select” online courses for credit. In past years, only on-campus summer school courses have been eligible.
The Harvard Global Health Institute announced that it would only support remote internships. The Institute of Politics informed applicants that it would communicate with Director’s Internship host organizations to determine if they are able to support remote internships this summer and notify students thereafter.
The Phillips Brooks House Association’s Summer Urban Program, which operates 10 summer camps in the Greater Boston area, told staffers it would switch to a digital model.
Office of International Education director Camila L. Nardozzi wrote to students who won study abroad funding that the office would allot them up to $1,500 to participate in remote programs “in lieu of an in-country experience.” The office noted that the sum could also be applied to take up to two online courses with “an international focus” at Harvard Summer School.
Harvard College Research Program administrator Elizabeth E. Perten wrote in an email to applicants that the program will still evaluate student research proposals originally submitted with applications. Students who are awarded funding will then submit a revised proposal for remote research given restrictions on laboratory and archival research, and other research that could require travel.
The Program for Research in Science and Engineering — a summer residential research program — will continue remotely, with adjusted requisites, program director Gregory A. Llacer wrote in an email to fellows.
Khurana wrote that the College will also post updated information about summer programs on its COVID-19 FAQ page. He encouraged undergraduates with questions about specific programs to directly contact the offices hosting them.
He concluded his email by thanking students for their “flexibility” as much of their college experience changes.
“While I never anticipated confronting a moment as challenging as this one, I am not at all surprised by the fortitude and patience you have shown during this unsettling time,” he wrote.

Facing dire economic straits brought on by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard is instituting an immediate University-wide salary and hiring freeze, cancelling or deferring discretionary spending, and considering deferring all capital projects, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in a Monday email to Harvard affiliates.
Bacow, Lapp, and Garber will each cut their salaries by 25 percent, per the email. Senior school administrators, including the deans of Harvard’s 12 schools, their vice presidents, and their vice provosts, will also either reduce their salaries or contribute to a support fund for employees experiencing hardship.
In the email, Bacow, Lapp, and Garber also addressed the possibility of layoffs or furloughs. The wrote that Harvard is still working to “gain a more complete picture” before deciding whether to take such action.
“We will be scrutinizing the FY21 budget to determine what other steps are necessary to respond to the financial impact of the pandemic on our operations. We will communicate with you when more information is available,” they wrote.
The coronavirus pandemic has thrown the University into financial turmoil in recent months, incurring unexpected expenses while also cutting revenue sources. Bacow said in an April interview with the Harvard Gazette — a University-run news publication — that the immediate financial effects are “significant.”
Bacow, Lapp, and Garber wrote that the University will tap into the endowment to address financial concerns, but its ability to do so is limited.
“Some of you may be wondering why we can’t just dip into the endowment to support us through these difficult times. We do intend to distribute as much from the endowment as we responsibly can, but there are limitations to the endowment’s capacity,” they wrote. “Because of the recent declines in the markets, the endowment, while still large, is not as large as it was previously. As it shrinks, it has less capacity to support our existing operations, especially as other shortfalls in revenue sources loom.”
Harvard’s endowment — its largest financial asset — consists of more than 13,000 funds, according to the University’s website. The largest categories of funding are restricted to being spent on specific programs, departments, and purposes, which includes professorships, fellowships, and financial aid for undergraduates. The funds have to be used according to the terms set by the donor.
In the previous fiscal year, the endowment provided $1.9 billion of funding to University operations, consisting of more than a third of Harvard’s total operating revenue for the fiscal year. By the end of that fiscal year, the endowment’s value stood at $40.9 billion.
After his 2018 inauguration, Bacow started preparing Harvard for a possible future recession and asked administrators at schools to “scenario plan” for challenging market conditions.
Harvard is planning to issue roughly $1.1 billion in bonds for outstanding debt refinancing and other purposes after steep interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Bloomberg News reported last week.

The Cambridge Public Health Department reported that 203 people who live and work in Cambridge nursing and assisted living facilities have tested positive for COIVD-19, including six who have died from the disease, the city announced Monday morning.
Coronavirus testing in nursing homes occured over the weekend as part of a partnership between the Broad Institute and the Cambridge Public Health Department. The pilot project facilitated “surveillance testing” for COVID-19, in which all nursing home residents and workers were tested regardless of whether they were symptomatic.
All facility residents and workers are being tested twice, with the initial and final tests being conducted three days apart, according to the city’s announcement.
While the Cambridge Public Health Department does not yet have data on the breakdown of cases among residents and workers — including how many of the positive cases are Cambridge residents — the health department “expects to have and report on this information in the near future,” the city’s announcement read.
Prior to receiving Monday’s results from the nursing home tests, the city had reported 256 confirmed cases and 1 confirmed death among Cambridge residents.
The city announced the public health department is currently working with Cambridge’s nursing facilities to provide guidance on “cohorting” patients — a process by which those who have tested positive are grouped together and those who have tested negative are grouped together. The practice is intended to prevent contact between infected and non-infected individuals.
The public health department is also providing strategies for “crisis staffing” — which aims to mitigate healthcare personnel staffing shortages due to COVID-19 — as guided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
If there are not enough staff to provide care, CDC strategies for managing staffing shortages include transferring patients to alternate care sites with adequate staffing, and allowing asymptomatic healthcare personnel — who have had unprotected exposure to COVID-19 — to continue to work.
The CDC also advises that healthcare facilities make plans to provide resources to assist healthcare workers with anxiety and stress management.

Harvard University Dining Services will replace meals cooked in-house with pre-made and packaged food items to prepare for a significantly reduced dining hall staff, the Dean of Students Office announced in a Monday email to students remaining on campus.
“HUDS will continue to support the nearly 450 undergraduate and graduate students on campus with meal support,” the email read. “These modifications allow them to do so with limited personnel.”
The DSO attributes the dining modifications to the University’s transition to “a new phase of COVID-19 service for campus residents” that will shrink the on-campus workforce.
According to the email, HUDS stopped preparing meals in the dining halls on Monday and has started offering students pre-made “sandwiches, salads, soups, side dishes like crudite and fruit salad, and more.”
The dining halls switched to serving “re-heatable entrees” on Monday and Tuesday that will be limited to previously purchased frozen foods. On Wednesday, the dining halls will begin offering meals from “several local vendors” on a rotating schedule.
Prior to the dining modifications, HUDS staff packed freshly-made meals for students to pick up in the dining halls.
Some HUDS staff remained on campus even after most students left to keep dining halls operational in Adams, Eliot, Kirkland, and Quincy Houses. This weekend, however, Quincy dining hall staff refused to report to work after two colleagues tested positive for coronavirus.
For students remaining on campus, the DSO has imposed strict social distancing rules. Students are prohibited from sharing living spaces and bathrooms, attending gatherings of more than two people, using House common spaces, and consuming alcohol regardless of age.
The email also announced that on-campus housing will be available this summer in an “extremely limited” capacity, and will only be available to students who are currently living on campus.
The housing announcement came shortly after the College’s Monday announcement that it will move all its residential summer programs online. The shift will apply to Harvard Summer School, as well as programs offered by the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, the Institute of Politics, and the Phillips Brooks House Association, among others.
Those on-campus who want to remain through the summer must petition for housing, according to the email.
“The accommodations we offer will be limited in nature compared to term-time and ordinary term-time resources such as dining will not be available,” it reads. “We hope that this information will be helpful to those of you who may need to stay.”
The DSO wrote that it will update students on the housing petition process in the near future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 15, 2020, 7:31 p.m.
As the ongoing coronavirus pandemic forces universities across the country to plan for possible continued disruptions to education, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Monday that Harvard is considering “lots of different scenarios" for what its upcoming fall semester might look like.
Bacow told Harvard Magazine last week that the University is “focused on the fall,” and that schools are identifying dates by which decisions on enrollment and teaching have to be made. However, he fears that by the time decisions have to be made, there will still be “a tremendous amount of uncertainty.”
Amid uncertainty around the timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic, other Massachusetts universities are also planning for possible changes to the semester. Boston University announced in a statement posted to its website Friday that, if public health officials deem it unsafe to reopen campus in the fall, the university would consider postponing its upcoming semester to January 2021.
In a subsequent statement, though, BU Today editor Doug Most wrote that "Boston University is planning to resume its on-campus, residential program in the fall of 2020, following the recommended best health practices around the coronavirus pandemic."
During Monday’s interview, Bacow also recalled spending the morning of March 9 in a meeting with members of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing board — over Zoom, presenting and discussing his plans to move instruction online and de-densify the campus.
The next morning, affiliates across campus woke up to emails about the decision to move to remote instruction. The College advised undergraduates to move out of University housing within the week. Administrators at Harvard’s 12 schools also outlined their own contingency plans for graduate students.
More than a month after those decisions, Bacow said he, along with other University administrators — including Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 — considered a spate of options. He said they made a decision roughly a week after they first began discussing options extensively, with an eye towards an impending spring break deadline.
“We looked at a variety of different possibilities,” he said. “For me, the actual decision was not a difficult one largely because the costs of being wrong were asymmetrical; what was more of a challenge was implementing it.”
Even before states began issuing guidelines for the virus, Bacow said administrators were watching as different regions of the world began socially distancing themselves, thinking of COVID-19's implications for Harvard. A crisis management team, led by Lapp and consisting of administrative deans, began to focus on “logistical planning” in the event Harvard needed to send students home.
“Pretty early on we realized that if this virus came to Boston and came to our campus that we would need to at least plan for doing it,” he said. “As soon as other countries started engaging in social distancing, we started to imagine what it would mean for Harvard.”
Bacow also acknowledged the role of a scientific advisory group led by Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen, which consisted of Harvard faculty who he said rank “among the world’s leading experts in epidemiology, infectious disease, virology and public health.”
“In the end, it was a collective decision that was done in which Alan, Katie and I all came together,” Bacow said.
“I guess the final call was mine," he added.
While administrators considered plans for the rest of the semester, Bacow said he tried to keep William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, informed of their recommendations.
“We brought it to the Corporation... to both inform them of our recommendation and to make sure that they were comfortable with our plans to go forward,” Bacow said. “We discussed it. We presented it to them — presented the rationale to them — and they supported our decision.”
Harvard was one of the first universities to move classes online and implement measures to de-densify its campus. After its announcement, universities including Smith College, MIT, and University of Massachusetts Amherst took similar precautions — many announcing plans that mirrored Harvard's that same day.
Bacow said that ultimately, in light of the spike in coronavirus cases after the University's decision, he believes keeping everyone on campus in Cambridge would have been the wrong choice.
“We would be putting lots and lots of people at risk,” he said.

The City of Cambridge will open the War Memorial Recreation Center beginning Tuesday as an emergency shelter to house homeless residents during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The recreation center, which sits on Cambridge Rindge and Latin School’s campus, will open a quarantine area for people without stable housing who display symptoms of COVID-19. The city announced it will open the recreation center’s fieldhouse to asymptomatic homeless people later in the week.
“The War Memorial is an ideal location to insulate our most vulnerable residents who are in need due to the ongoing public health crisis, while providing them with ample space and various resources, including medical support, food, showers, bathrooms, changing space and other activities,” Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said in a joint statement announcing the facility’s opening.
Homeless residents with confirmed positive tests will be housed in the 121-bed Freepoint Hotel. The city announced last Friday that the hotel space would open this week. The hotel will be staffed by medical personnel from local hospitals, as well as contractors hired by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.
The recreation center facility will include 22 beds in the quarantine section and more than 100 beds in the fieldhouse, which will house those without symptoms. An additional 20 to 50 beds in the center’s gymnasium will be reserved for overflow self-isolation space for those who have tested positive.
Homeless shelters in the city have struggled to stay open as the number of coronavirus cases has grown. The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which is staffed by Phillips Brooks House Association members, closed its doors late last month.
DePasquale, the city manager, said at a March 30 City Council meeting that he hoped to open the War Memorial facility by last Monday.
Harvard and MIT each donated $250,000 to help cover costs associated with opening the emergency shelter. The donations came after some Harvard students called on the University to house homeless residents in its now-empty dormitories.
City Councilor Jivan G. Sobrinho-Wheeler said Monday that he still hopes to see Harvard and MIT open their dorms for the homeless.
“Cambridge is a university community,” he said. “We have two universities with thousands of dorm rooms that aren’t being used and hotels that aren’t being used at this point. It makes sense as a place for unhoused residents to be able to shelter.”
In response to students’ calls last month, Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that the University was working with state and municipal governments to provide support during the pandemic and noted that hundreds of students currently remain in Harvard dorms.

A team of Harvard physicists published an article Wednesday outlining a novel method for determining the “spin” — or angular momentum — of a black hole.
The paper appeared in Physical Review D, a peer-reviewed academic journal, following the researchers’ recent study on a black hole imaging method published in Science Advances.
The articles come less than a year after the Event Horizon Telescope — a network of radio telescopes spanning four continents — visualized a black hole for the first time. The Harvard-affiliated project won the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics last September.
Astronomy lecturer and Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist Michael D. Johnson, a study co-author, said the team analyzed stacks of photon rings — rays of light that bend around a black hole’s strong gravitational pull. Johnson said black hole images previously produced by the team were not a single set of photon rings, but “really a stack of donuts.” Differences in the layers’ properties are crucial to the scientists’ method of calculating spin.
Alexandru V. Lupsasca ’11, a junior fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows and study co-author, said the proposed method relies on light polarization, a property of light determined by the direction of its magnetic field.
“If you look at the surface of the ocean, and you have polarized sunglasses, then you can see that some of the light that’s reflected off the surface is no longer visible,” he said. “If you tilt your head sideways, it does become visible again.”
The photon rings surrounding black holes are also polarized. The novel method for calculating spin relies on capturing polarimetric images — which take polarization into account — of the black hole’s subrings.
“All the odd and all the even subrings have the same polarization at a given angle,” Lupsasca said. “But the flip in polarization as you hop from an even to an odd subring is fixed by the spin of the black hole.”
Lupsasca said pre-existing methods for determining a black hole’s spin involve inferences based on the behavior of matter surrounding a black hole. Because the photon ring structure used in this new method is “purely a feature of the geometry of spacetime itself,” the approach may yield more accurate results.
Lupsasca said this discovery may lead to understanding of cosmic phenomena that have eluded generations of astronomers, like magnetic field structure and quasars — “the most powerful light signals in the universe.”
“They’re these laser beams. They look like lightsabers, but they can stretch for millions of light years,” he said. “And there’s a very deep question, which is, ‘how the heck does that work?’”
Johnson — who co-led imaging efforts at the Event Horizon Telescope — said he sees theory-heavy experiments like these as “guideposts” that inform new experimental inquiries into the properties of a black hole.
“If you had a perfect telescope, and you could produce these images, what can you learn from them in this idealized limit?” he said. “Once we know where the information is hidden in the images, then we can design the next telescope to be able to see that.”
But Johnson says scientists still have a long way to go to completely demystify the black hole. For now, that hunt for information within the black hole images demands “a lot of experimentation and numerical dexterity,” he said.
“A year and a half ago, no one had ever seen a black hole. And so now we’ve taken a picture of one,” Johnson added. “We’re still learning about where, in that picture, the interesting information is hiding.”

While Harvard students across the globe attend online lectures and turn in virtual assignments, many K-12 students in low-income areas are home with few educational resources and no access to remote learning.
To combat this problem, a team of Harvard and MIT undergraduates has launched “CovEd,” an online platform to pair volunteer tutors with grade school students that need educational support and mentorship during the coronavirus crisis.
Evelyn Wong ’21, the project’s founder, said that she started the group in late March when she heard about school shutdowns in her district and wanted to help low-income students with food or housing insecurities.
“Students who have financial means to get tutoring can just pay for a tutor,” Wong said. “But if your school is shut down, if you want college prep help or SAT prep help or academic support, you can’t do that.”
Inspired by initiatives created by students at the College to match people looking for housing with potential hosts, Wong created a Google Form to match students who could use help in school with student volunteers who have time to tutor them.
Interest grew quickly, and roughly 300 people signed up as mentors in less than a day, according to Wong. She soon formed a management team of students from Harvard and MIT to organize logistics and scale the project into a more formal organization.
The biggest logistical task early on in the project was forming mentor-mentee pairings. Students who sign up for the platform fill out a detailed form that includes the subjects they need help with, their tentative career aspirations, and any special needs or disabilities. Volunteer mentors fill out a similar form.
Students on the CovEd team spend hours manually making pairings while trying to match timezones and mutual interests. Once pairings are made, it is up to the mentor and the mentee to coordinate their meetings.
The team does not run background checks on mentors due to the volume of mentors who signed up. To ward off potential risks to student safety, they require that a third party, ideally the child’s parent or guardian, be present at every tutoring session.
Currently the platform has accumulated over 1550 volunteer tutors from 60 educational institutions across the country, with over 900 students signed up to receive tutoring. More than 700 of these students have been paired with mentors.
The CovEd team itself now spans hundreds of people, including a whole outreach team dedicated to spreading the project’s message.
“In areas like my hometown in North Carolina, school shutdowns have become a month-long break for students where there is no formal teaching going on,” Anne J. Lheem ’21, who co-heads the outreach team, said. “We felt like it was really important to make sure we were reaching out to those communities.”
CovEd rarely deals with money since tutors volunteer and services are provided for free. Wong said the organization has no plans to incorporate in the future. The team even turned down an offer of seed funding from an entrepreneur.
“You can’t pay someone to be willing to check in on a student periodically and even after the tutoring platform is over,” Wong said. “Part of asking for voluntary mentors is that we know if a mentor is asking to volunteer, then they want to. It’s not because they have a financial incentive.”

Harvard Transportation and Parking stopped running its shuttles Monday, shifting to an on-demand van service to serve the University’s mostly empty campus amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Ridership of the University’s shuttles has “dropped by 99%” since the majority of students were told to leave campus last month, according to Harvard Campus Services spokesperson Michael D. Conner.
Conner wrote in an emailed statement that the decision was made in light of the University’s choice to move instruction online for the rest of the semester, in addition to a Massachusetts stay-at-home advisory issued amid the pandemic.
Before the Monday announcement that campus transportation services would become on-demand, shuttles had already been running on a reduced schedule and limited routes since March 30.
“The last remaining shuttle route is running virtually empty,” Conner wrote. “Only essential employees are being asked to come to campus, and at this moment, the shuttles are not deemed essential.”
Conner added that Transportation and Parking has been serving fewer than 30 riders per day. As a result, the office has extended its on-demand van service — which previously ran in the evenings — to a schedule of 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends.
Transportation services have also ramped up sanitization efforts, according to Conner, cleaning vehicles after every shift and equipping drivers with sanitizing wipes. When a passenger boards, they are instructed to sit in the last row of seats to maintain an appropriate distance between the passenger and driver.
Additionally, Harvard employees hesitant to use public transportation because of the COVID-19 outbreak have become eligible for free parking in certain Harvard facilities, Conner wrote.
Conner also wrote that the Guaranteed Ride Home Program, which covers ride costs for postdoctoral students and employees in emergencies, has seen zero participation, despite the fact that the program could cover some medical- or health-related transport.
The Medical Academic and Scientific Community Organization — a nonprofit that operates the M2 shuttle which runs between Cambridge and Harvard’s Longwood Medical Area — has developed similar pandemic precautions.
MASCO has seen “greatly reduced” ridership due to the pandemic, according to its website. But because its busses service the Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School, and multiple hospitals, the shuttles have still seen some passenger use.
Beginning March 22, MASCO shuttles implemented rear-door boarding procedures to facilitate social distancing. A team of cleaners have also begun sanitizing “the entire interior” of each of MASCO’s vehicles every night, according to the MASCO website.
A MASCO spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
In addition to Harvard and MASCO’s transportation services, Bluebikes — a Greater Boston area public bike share system with several stations near campus — began offering free 30-day memberships to hospital workers in need of transportation through April 30.
The company is disinfecting “high-contact surfaces” on the bikes, such as seats and handlebars, each time they arrive in the Bluebikes depot, according to its website. It is monitoring developing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and local public health officials to determine whether it will continue the service.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously approved a measure Monday evening requesting stricter public health regulations to protect grocery store workers during the coronavirus pandemic.
The policy order directs the City Manager and Cambridge Public Health Department to develop stricter safety guidelines for “front line” businesses, such as food markets, pharmacies, and grocery stores.
The measures “will help ensure these employees are able to safely perform their crucial work, safeguard the health of these workers and their families, and save lives,” the policy order reads.
Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 declared a state of emergency in Massachusetts on March 10. Baker ordered the closure of non-essential businesses and issued a stay-at-home order on March 23. Massachusetts has reported more than 26,000 cases of COVID-19 since early March.
On Wednesday, a Whole Foods employee in Cambridge tested positive for the coronavirus. In Salem, Mass., a Market Basket employee died after contracting COVID-19, marking the first death of a grocery store worker due to the disease in the state.
These cases illustrate “just how dire this situation has become” for essential workers, according to the measure approved at Monday’s City Council meeting.
Potential public health guidelines include requiring front line businesses to provide masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer to their employees at each shift, mandating frequent store and equipment sterilization, and requiring customers to wear masks or face coverings.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale issued an advisory on Thursday urging Cambridge residents to wear face coverings whenever they leave their homes, including on trips to grocery stores and pharmacies.
“Using simple cloth face coverings is another way we can help slow the spread of the virus, especially from those who may have the virus and do not know it,” Siddiqui and DePasquale wrote in a joint statement Thursday.
During Monday’s meeting, Councilor Marc C. McGovern said he was “amazed and troubled” to see residents without masks when he went grocery shopping over the weekend.
“They’re doing a great job of not letting people in and trying to control the number of people in the supermarket, but the number of people that didn’t have masks on was just incredible,” McGovern said. “If there’s ever a time for us to be more strict and to step up, it has to be now.”
Additional guidelines proposed in the measure include requiring protective plexiglass barriers for cashiers, creating pick-up only locations, rerouting cash transactions to self-service kiosks, and providing workers hazard pay.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon — who co-sponsored the measure alongside Siddiqui — said the Council must make use of its public health emergency powers to protect essential workers in Cambridge.
“Often these are low-wage workers making twelve dollars an hour,” Mallon said. “They can’t afford not to go to work.”
“It’s incumbent upon us during a public health emergency to make sure that we are protecting them with those broad powers that a state of emergency provides for us,” she added.

It’s super important to take breaks from screen-time (and this includes your phone), so grab that ball of yarn that’s been sitting in your basement for years and ask your family if anyone has a knitting kit lying around the house. Desperate times call for some really warm, fuzzy measures.
Duolingo — Do It Right Now
Test out of your language requirement and miss having a language class? Wish you were enrolled in a different language department? Cooking dinner for your family but don’t actually know how to pronounce the name of the dish? Now is the perfect opportunity to refine your language skills. Even though traveling is a big no-no, why not mentally travel to the most vibrant places by learning how to speak another language? Duolingo has got your back.
Singing in the Rain (Your House)
If you ever convinced your parents to buy you an instrument only to give up on learning it after just an hour of practicing, this one’s for you. Grab that guitar that’s been growing increasingly dusty in the corner of your room and get to it. Find your own rhythm. If you’re feeling ambitious, you could even start a band with your family and perform for your friends (over Zoom).
Color
Yes, we mean it. Find some Crayola markers and paper, then color your heart out. It’s super therapeutic, and you can even bring your artwork back to school when we (hopefully) return in the fall. Don’t have coloring supplies? Try doing some origami, or maybe even have a paper airplane building contest with your siblings.
Childhood Computer Games
#TBT. We know you remember the good old days of boogieing on the dance floor of the Club Penguin igloos. Not a Club Penguin fan? Then Webkinz is also a great way to re-live some of your best childhood memories.
With these suggestions, we’ll be back on campus in the fall (fingers crossed!) before you can spell Duolingo.
