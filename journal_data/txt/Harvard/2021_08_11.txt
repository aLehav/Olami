After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Annette” is a film that, logically, shouldn’t exist. And yet, here it is, willed into its oddball existence by French filmmaker Leos Carax (“Holy Motors”). The rock-opera musical follows a celebrity couple — stand-up comedian Henry (Adam Driver) and opera singer Ann (Marion Cotillard) — as they birth a magical wooden doll for a daughter.
As one might expect, much has been made about the strangeness in “Annette,” and rightfully so. Carax builds a world where even the peripheral characters sing in a disturbing chorus, prancing around the screen like marionettes. That absurdity includes everything from doctors singing as they deliver a baby to Driver and Cotillard crooning during oral sex. Suffice to say, it’s a film full of off-kilter choices, but also one that's strangely alluring — an open invitation into a raucous, surreal world that promises something new.
Part of that novelty is how seamlessly Carax shifts between genres: He takes “Annette” from an abrasive melodrama about self-destructive ego into a surprising thriller with fantasy-horror undercurrents. But in many ways, “Annette” also feels like cinema about cinema with its fourth-wall-breaking opening number, backstage star-crossed drama, and running commentary on modern celebrity culture. All that is to say "Annette" revels in its self-awareness; Carax doesn’t just delight in his film's absurdity — he constantly draws our attention to it.
César-winning cinematographer Caroline Champetier, who collaborated with Carax on “Holy Motors,” helps craft the film’s absurd visual identity with a luscious color palette, splattered across the frames in deep saturated shades of green. It’s a bold look for the film, catapulting viewers into an experience that feels like a lucid dream. The vibrant colors combined with the indulgent production design also manage to adapt with the film — as the plot descends further and further into the fantastical, so do the film’s visuals.
Even the music feels new and out of the box. “Annette” was first imagined as a sung-through show by the Sparks Brothers (the subject of Edgar Wright’s new documentary feature). The Sparks’ genre-bending music takes “Annette” in interesting directions — from operetta to pop and back again. As with the rest of the film, many of the songs are meant to be jarring: an ode to things that are impossible to love. But the results can be hit-or-miss. The rhythmic, repetitive lyrics are often hypnotic, but can at times be frustrating. Driver and Cotillard sang live on-set, which is more ambitious than recording in a booth. But neither are professionals, a fact that’s unfortunately quite noticeable for Cotillard, whose opera vocals were dubbed over.
Watching as all of these deftly crafted components meld together, one can’t help but be reminded that they are mere spectators on the outside looking in, never truly living in the film’s world. It’s as if the film’s aggressive self-awareness, which so proudly takes center stage, adds a barrier of emotional separation. But this could be exactly what Carax wanted. For instance, his widely acclaimed film “Holy Motors” was arguably a success because it basked in the glory of its own strangeness. It didn’t care how unconventional it was or how difficult it might be for audiences to watch. It was a film that didn’t want to be loved.
But, unlike “Holy Motors,” “Annette” wants to have its cake and eat it too. Far from a series of strange episodic vignettes, “Annette” tells a story that asks us to care about its characters, or at least care about what happens to them. As the catalyst and emotional core of the film, Adam Driver gives Henry a powerful and domineering onscreen presence. But the intentionally strange, almost artificial barriers Carax sets up makes it difficult to care about Henry’s fate — even in the conclusion. There’s something amiss here, and unlike many of the odd creative choices throughout “Annette,” this identity crisis doesn’t feel like it was intended. As a result, Carax’s latest ends up being a quirky, abrasive slow-burn with sentimentality that often falls short.
There’s no denying that “Annette” is a beautifully-made film, and despite its lackluster ending, it still crackles with the escapist electricity that we've been missing from cinemas. While it seems destined for a divisive reaction, there’s one thing for sure: You probably have not — and will never again see — a film quite like this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council on Aug. 2 unanimously approved the renaming of the Agassiz neighborhood north of Harvard to honor Maria L. Baldwin, the first Black female principal in the Northeast.
In February 2020, the City Council approved changing the name of the neighborhood, which previously commemorated Louis Agassiz, a 19th-century Harvard professor and proponent of scientific racism.
The origin for the name change can be traced back to Maya E. Counter ’24, who was a high school student when she first proposed a change nearly two years ago after researching the Agassiz name for her AP United States History class.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and Councilor Denise E. Simmons — who co-sponsored the 2020 order to begin the process of renaming the neighborhood as well as the Aug. 2 order that secured the Baldwin name — both praised Counter for her role.
“This name change furthers the City’s shared goals of better understanding, learning from, and engaging with our history,” Siddiqui wrote in an emailed statement. “I am so proud of Ms. Counter and her advocacy efforts around this name change.”
Simmons also lauded Counter’s efforts, writing in an email that the process of renaming the neighborhood has been “organic,” and something she is very supportive of.
“I just want to praise the effort and initiative demonstrated by Maya Counter, a young woman in our community who has been actively engaging with the history of our community and asking the critical questions around whom we choose to elevate in our local historical narrative, how those individuals have been portrayed, and who might not have as prominent a place in our story as they deserve?” Simmons wrote.
Counter, who lives in the neighborhood, said the change was relieving for her and represented a shift away from Agassiz’s racist legacy and an adoption of what Baldwin represented.
“Her dedication and passion to creating safe and engaging spaces for students, despite all the odds stacked against her as for other Black women, due to her gender, and her race, not only speaks to the kind of legacy the Cambridge community should be honoring, but the kind of legacies that should be replacing old white supremacists’ across the country,” Counter said.
Counter said it is important to note that Maria Baldwin was born during Louis Agassiz’s lifetime.
“It's just important to know that her time is not late after Agassiz's. For the people who say that he was a product of his time, you know, so was she,” Counter said. “So I think it's really important to choose the right kind of history to represent our present.”
The newly-minted Baldwin Neighborhood is home to a large part of Harvard’s campus, including Harvard Law School, Harvard Divinity School and the Museum of Natural History.
The Agassiz name is still featured on several University buildings, professorships and campus museums. Some Harvard staff and faculty have argued in the past, however, that the name honors Agassiz’s wife and son, and not Agassiz himself.
The University’s ties to Agassiz also came under scrutiny after Tamara K. Lanier filed a lawsuit against Harvard in March 2019, claiming the rights to the Zealy Daguerreotypes. The items in question are several photographs that depict enslaved people and were commissioned by Louis Agassiz to support his arguments of scientific racism. According to Lanier, the people in the pictures, Renty and Delia, are her ancestors.
Lanier said Harvard can learn from Cambridge’s decision to scrub the Agassiz name from the city.
“Harvard needs to just jump on board, join the bandwagon and say, ‘You know what, we are not going to continue to celebrate and memorialize a racist,’” Lanier said. “That’s not hard.”
“When we have a historical figure, whose name connotates those kinds of dark chapters in our history it is our responsibility to, firstly, not only to rebuke this person, but also, wherever we see Louis Agassiz’s name, we need to make sure that the community understands who they are memorializing,” she added.
In October 2020, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced a University-wide committee chaired by former University President Drew G. Faust charged with creating guidelines for renaming campus buildings, professorships, spaces and programs associated with “historical figures whose advocacy or support of activities would today be found abhorrent by members of the Harvard community.”
Counter said she urges the University to reflect on how a name like Agassiz’s might make Black students feel.
“I would say to Harvard, think about how that makes your Black students feel,” Counter said. “Think about how it feels to walk around on campus, seeing names of buildings reflective of a white supremacist.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
Counter said she was relieved by the name change, but expressed that there is still more to be done across Cambridge, saying that finding out Agassiz’s legacy has made her question who streets are named after and their legacies.
“It definitely feels like I can finally exhale,” Counter said. “But at the same time, this is just one thing. There’s so much more to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a move that some of his peers consider risky but rewarding, Harvard professor and astrophysicist Abraham “Avi” Loeb last month launched a systematic search for artifacts or active technology created by extraterrestrial beings, called the “Galileo Project.”
The project’s necessity, per a July 26 press release, stems in part from a June 25 report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena delivered by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to Congress, which sparked fierce debate over the existence of extraterrestrial life.
Also inspiring this project was Loeb’s work in 2018 studying the “‘Oumuamua” interstellar object, which he famously suggested could have been a probe sent by extraterrestrial beings.
“These objects appear to behave in ways that are not compatible with technologies that we possess,” Loeb said in an interview. “It’s about time for the scientific community to get engaged in studying the nature of these objects, as well as objects like ‘Oumuamua.”
The Galileo Project, per the release, aims to identify UAP “using the standard scientific method based on a transparent analysis of open scientific data to be collected using optimized instruments.”
It will also limit its explanations of UAP to “known physics” to avoid speculation and maintain scientific rigor.
The Galileo Project will follow three avenues: taking images of UAPs to identify them, searching for “‘Oumuamua-like” interstellar objects, and hunting for possible extraterrestrial satellites.
Toward the first end, researchers wrote they hope to create a “network of mid-sized, high-resolution telescopes and detector arrays with suitable cameras and computer systems” in numerous areas. Machine learning software, they added, will allow researchers to sift conventional aircraft or birds out of their collection of images.
In avenue two, according to the press release, the project team will use “existing and future astronomical surveys” to discover and monitor interstellar objects and to design space missions capable of imaging these objects.
The project’s final avenue, the researchers wrote, will include discovering potential one meter-scale or smaller ETC satellites that may be exploring Earth.
Altogether, Loeb said, the project seeks to fill the “big, giant gap” both in humanity’s understanding of extraterrestrial life and research into the subject.
He said he believes the desire for “extraordinary evidence” of extraterrestrial life, combined with a dearth of funding, has made research into the subject practically impossible.
“If there is no funding, obviously, we will never find extraordinary evidence,” he said. “It’s a vicious cycle — a self-fulfilling prophecy.”
Unlike government reports with only anecdotal evidence, this project will abide by an unbiased, scientific approach, Loeb added. It will not assume the existence of extraterrestrial life to draw conclusions.
“We want to collect our own data from scratch, basically, that will be open, and the analysis will be transparent the way science is done,” Loeb added.
Harvard Astronomy lecturer Gerhard Sonnert said he “applaud[s]” Loeb and his team’s proposal — in particular, their commitment to “empirical” and transparent research.
The government’s secrecy around extraterrestrial research, Sonnert said, has compromised the credibility of its information and bred conspiracy theories. The Galileo Project, by contrast, will be conducted by scientists of the “highest caliber,” which will bestow “legitimacy to the findings,” according to Sonnert.
Sonnert said he is still unsure what exactly the project will find and recognized its high risks, but ultimately pointed to the potential high rewards to the field of extraterrestrial research.
“It’s an ambitious project of high risk, high return, and we don’t know if they find anything, but if they do, it would be a tremendous finding,” he said. “So they try to bring cutting-edge science to bear on a problem that has been around for a long time and has been ignored and put to the sides.”
Harvard astronomer Mercedes López-Morales, member of the Galileo Project’s Scientific Advisory Board, said the project is likely to offer natural explanations for UAPs, though she acknowledged the research’s limitations.
“The Galileo Project data will also be incomplete in a way that is not going to cover all wavelengths. There should be also radar observations and so on,” she said. “But at least in terms of a time baseline, it will be more complete than anything else that is currently available.”
Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan C. McDowell said he worried the project could be too ambitious and unfocused.
McDowell said sightings of UAP are “extremely rare,” acknowledging the “millions of times” that they might have been spotted, but were not.
“My fear is you spend a lot of money and you see nothing,” he added.
McDowell also said he is skeptical that the origins of these UAP is extraterrestrial life, adding that the “boring explanation is almost always right.”
He also said he has questions about the project’s plans to search for one-meter or smaller interstellar satellites, which he feels is “ambitious” and would require the team to “replicate everything that the Space Force already does.”
Amir Siraj ’22, the Galileo Project’s director of interstellar object studies, acknowledged that the project is ambitious, but said he is “very hopeful” it will make significant discoveries, assuming the team can construct a sufficiently large network of telescopes.
Even if the project does not observe any UAP, Siraj added, it could still be a success.
“Let’s say we don’t find any UAP,” he said. “That will be really interesting in its own right, because that could potentially put our result in tension with the rates implied by previous eyewitness testimonies, or even U.S. government reports.”
Loeb said he welcomes pushback about his proposal and will continue with his plans in the spirit of the accurate but then-unpopular theory that Earth revolves around the sun, posited by the project’s namesake Galileo Galilei. “We should look through telescopes to find out the facts,” he said.
“I’m not afraid of addressing a question just because others ridicule it,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 12, 2021 at 10:30 a.m. 
Human Evolutionary Biology lecturer Carole K. Hooven’s comments on a Fox News show last month maintaining the existence of two sexes and defending the usage of the terms “male” and “female” to refer to biological sex in medical classes sparked backlash on social media and within the department, with some arguing Hooven’s remarks set back Harvard and the department’s diversity and inclusion efforts.
Hooven joined Fox and Friends on July 28 to discuss an article by podcast host Katie Herzog, in which Hooven is quoted. Herzog’s article decries the “denial of sex” and the increased pressure for medical school professors to use gender neutral vocabulary instead of “male” and “female.”
Hooven said during the segment that she has been “feeling pretty frustrated about” the “ideology has been infiltrating science.”
“The facts are that there are in fact two sexes,” Hooven said during the segment. “There are male and female, and those sexes are designated by the kinds of gametes we produce.”
Hooven, who teaches on hormones and sex differences in behavior at Harvard, said using the terms “male” and “female” to refer to biological sex does not inhibit people from recognizing other people’s gender identities and pronouns.
“The ideology seems to be that biology really isn’t as important as how somebody feels about themselves or feels their sex to be,” Hooven said. “But we can treat people with respect and respect their gender identities and use their preferred pronouns, so understanding the facts about biology doesn’t prevent us from treating people with respect.”
Hooven added that it becomes “confusing” for students when professors, lecturers, and the media “start backing away” from terms that could be seen as offensive.
Laura S. Lewis, a Ph.D. candidate in HEB, took to Twitter on July 30 in response, saying that she was "appalled and frustrated” by Hooven’s remarks on Fox and Friends, calling them “transphobic and harmful.” She argued that people who respect gender identities and pronouns should also understand that transgender men, intersex people, and gender-noncomforming people can also be pregnant.
“Inclusive language like “pregnant people” demonstrates respect for EVERYONE who has the ability to get pregnant, not just cis women,” wrote Lewis, who volunteers as director of HEB’s Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. “It is vital to teach med students gender inclusive language, as they will certainly interact with people that identify outside the gender binary.”
Hooven and Lewis have both received support and criticism on Twitter, though tweets criticizing Lewis’s original response have now reached the thousands.
In a statement to The Crimson on Friday, Lewis said she condemned “all harassment, abuse, and racism that has been directed toward anyone involved in the recent conversations.”
“I also want to reiterate that I respect Carole as both a scientist and valuable member of our department,” Lewis wrote.
Lewis added that she believes the department can find mutual understanding over “inclusive language regarding biological sex and varying gender identities” to promote a supportive environment.
Several graduate students in the department have also circulated a statement in support of Lewis, condemning the “harassment, racist abuse, and threats of physical harm” she faced, and challenging Hooven’s views.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Hooven wrote that she strives to encourage students to engage with her arguments and facts, and she avoids dictating her students’ opinions on controversial topics.
“What I teach about has special appeal for students who are in the minority in terms of gender expression, identification, and sexual orientation, and the facts can feel quite personal,” she wrote. “I do my best to set a tone of trust and respect. I expect my students to sometimes disagree with me, and I expect that some people will feel offended or even hurt as they encounter and struggle with new ideas and information.”
Hooven wrote that faculty should not change language out of “fear” of social backlash.
“I see that more and more educators are changing language and even backing off of controversial topics not because they think it’s the right thing to do as educators, but out of fear,” Hooven wrote. “This is not the right way forward. We can be caring and sensitive to the needs and identities of everyone, while also sticking to biological reality.”
Not everyone shares Hooven’s understanding of “biological reality,” however. Several other academics who study the biology of sex — outside of gender expression — said the concept is complicated and contested.
Heather L. Dingwall, who graduated with a Ph.D. from Harvard’s HEB department in 2019, said she agrees with Hooven that there are two types of gametes — sperm and eggs — but she disagrees that gametes are the sole determinant of sex.
According to Dingwall, some people’s external genitalia may appear ambiguous or opposite to what is commonly expected based on their gametes.
“That person could make eggs, that person could have ovaries, but they could also have external genitalia that we commonly think of as male,” she said. “The way we are typically assigned to sex at birth is based on our external genitalia. Then what does that mean for that person?”
Though the majority of people would fall into the biological classifications of either “male” or “female,” Dingwall said it is “reductive” to focus only on gametes when understanding sex.
“I just think taking a reductive approach and trying to distill it down to one factor when there are clearly many, it’s just overly simplistic and really erases a lot of the beauty of human variation,” she said.
Sarah S. Richardson, a professor of the History of Science and of Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, said sex is a contested concept among scientists and is made up of many different variables. She founded the Gender Sci Lab at Harvard in 2018 to draw attention to interdisciplinary work between gender scholars and biomedical scientists and new ways to research sex and gender in humans.
“Set aside gender, sex itself is super complex,” Richardson said. “It is a developmentally dynamic construct made up of multiple components and variables and factors.”
Though she agrees that binary definition of sex as “male” and “female” applies when studying most people, she argues for a more dynamic understanding of gametes and sex overall.
“That’s just gametic sex, that’s just one level and one layer of sex, and it doesn’t get you very much explanatory power,” Richardson said. “If you wanted to study sex through a medical perspective, knowing gametic sex is not going to tell you very much, probably, relevant to the system that you're studying.”
In her statement, Lewis likewise argued for an understanding of sex beyond the binary of “male” and “female” to account for human biological variation.
“This variation can only be fully understood if we consider biological sex as interactions between chromosomes, gametes, gonads, and hormones, which each exist on a continuum in humans,” Lewis wrote. “I believe that scientists can have a positive impact on society by communicating this nuance to the public.”
Lewis wrote that she aims to have “private and respectful” discussions of the topic within the Human Evolutionary Biology department, building off the work of the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force.
