After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sujata Day’s directorial debut “Definition Please” was released to Netflix on Jan. 21 after being acquired by Ava Duvernay’s film distribution and production collective ARRAY. Starring Day alongside Ritesh Rajan, “Definition Please” is slow, subtle, and offbeat. It tells the story of Monica Chowdry, a washed-up former Scripps National Spelling Bee winner who spends most of her time painting, smoking weed, and struggling to find focus in life. She moves home to Greensburg, Pennsylvania to take care of her ailing mother and is rattled by the return of her older brother, Sonny. The three mourn the death of the family patriarch, Baba, all the while also wrestling with what it means to grow up, as they painfully recall the not so rose-colored past.
“Definition Please” is strange. Among the reasons behind its offbeat feel are that the story is small, the cast is small, and the film does not cover a lot of physical ground. The scenes are short, and the dialogue is shorter. Day wears cutoff jean shorts in almost every scene. The weather never seems to be remarkable, either. This contained, intimate focus is precisely the prowess of the film.
It is in the details that “Definition Please” excels. Day told the New York Times that her parents approved of the Bengali songs she created with composer Amanda Jones for the film. Characters eat rasgulla sweets and munch on masala-flavored Lays chips. Monica and Sonny fight with each other during the ritual of Raksha Bandhan, where the sister ties a rakhi on her brother’s wrist in honor of the sibling bond. There’s a Hindu calendar on the bare kitchen wall. These granular details are representative of the daily, less flashy elements of the in-between within an Indian household in America: that is, a household with immigrant roots and kids trying to find their place in American life.
Day’s exploration of culture’s place in her characters’ lives, however, does not just exist in the background. She manages to reckon with themes that, if done in a more stereotypical way, might have seemed recycled. These include the pressure on first-generation American kids to be successful in the shadow of their bootstrap-pulling parents, as well as defining what success even means in the first place. “Definition Please” portrays two adults trying desperately to answer these questions, but in an environment where the stakes are lower. Monica trains middle schoolers for local spelling bees, but has also been offered a rather nondescript job in a lab in Ohio. It isn’t the classic immigrant “med-school or bust” narrative. Rather, Monica simply has to choose between agency and familial obligations, the most pressing of which is taking care of her mother. The decisions depicted in the movie focus less on her career and more on her personal development.
Monica’s brother, Sonny, who struggles with bipolar disorder, presents a rich subtext to the plot: things left unsaid. His mental health crisis develops slowly and does not overtake the film, but unfolds with subtlety and nuance. By the time it becomes clear he is bipolar, the film is almost over. In the last scene, Sonny and Monica in therapy together — but they don’t say a word the entire session, and their emotional reckoning only comes when they reach the parking lot, where Sonny calls himself bipolar and Monica dispels his fear that she will love him less because he is “crazy.”
“I fucking love you so much,” Monica says through tears.
It’s an intense scene, but it’s also a moment of relief for the audience. Finally, Monica and Sonny are talking about their problems, which all come down to their simple insecurities: Sonny was scared, Monica was grieving, and they missed each other. But for the entire film, they never said it. They were just too scared of losing each other, or of saying the wrong thing, or of causing the other too much pain.
Unspoken history is similarly unearthed about halfway through the film when Monica has a flashback to a time during her childhood when she and Sonny accidentally broke a moorti, or statue. Baba, their father, comes in, and the camera is low to the floor, portraying him from the view of a child. He appears large and angry. There are allusions to his verbal and possible physical abuse when he grabs young Sonny by the arm and leads him into another room, enraged. But this is never addressed again in the film.
What can be made of these seemingly half-addressed kernels of plot? Even though Monica and Sonny do partially verbalize their conflict in the end, so much feels left unsaid. But these choices are intentional. Maybe, Day is suggesting that in these kinds of in-between households, so much is waiting to be excavated from the depths of memory. The film’s fragmented feel, then, is realistic. Trauma may go unspoken about for a long time. Eventually, though, the pain will bubble to the surface.
The central irony of “Definition Please” is that Monica is most famous for her ability to know the definitions and spelling of thousands of words in the English language. But the hardest part, Day’s film argues, is putting into words what has never been said before. As a South Asian young adult, this is a part of everyday life.
Many questions in “Definition Please” are left unanswered. The film is not trying to make a sweeping tribute to the often Western-tinged South Asian stories of extreme poverty and struggle to salvation. The characters end the film better off than when they started, but not by much. Day’s film is part of a budding movement to start telling stories about non-white people in a way that honors their culture but does not make it the entire focus of the film. Mental health, trauma, family tension — these are human experiences that spare no one. “Definition Please” doesn’t, either.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a crowded MBTA train station, Harvard student Sam Masur calls out the name of an estranged childhood friend. “SADIE MIRANDA GREEN,” he shouts, “YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY.”
So begins Gabrielle Zevin’s “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,” a novel that follows the lives of video game developers Sam and Sadie over the course of thirty years. Described by Penguin Books as “not a romance, but about love,” the novel is a fascinating and cleverly written exploration of the relationship between two close friends, but it unfortunately struggles with handling its multiple plotlines in the book’s later sections.
After a chance meeting in a hospital as teenagers, Sam and Sadie bonded over their shared love of video games until their friendship reached an abrupt ending. Years later, they meet again in Cambridge, where Sam attends Harvard and Sadie goes to MIT. They begin a partnership, and soon the explosive success of their first video game, “Ichigo,” launches them into the gaming industry.
Zevin weaves several other stories into the novel alongside Sam and Sadie. Flashbacks of Sam’s childhood growing up in L.A. with his grandparents and actress mother are intertwined with Sadie’s memories of volunteering at the hospital where her sister was being treated for cancer. Sam’s college roommate Marx also gets his own storyline, as he navigates being a side character (or NPC, as the book calls him) in the lives of his two closest friends.
It’s a lot of material to juggle in just one novel, and Zevin accomplishes this with skillful dexterity. A book about video games might seem daunting to those who have no knowledge about gaming, but this novel is more about human relationships than it is about video games. And in places where understanding the technical side of video game development becomes necessary, Zevin walks the reader through the process step by step.
The book’s strengths lie in its characters, though, and the plot ultimately takes a backseat to the relationships between its three main characters. Sam, Sadie, and Marx are all realistic and sympathetic characters who one can’t help but root for despite their flaws. Through them, the novel depicts a compassionate portrayal of the messy dynamics of a long, complicated friendship.
Zevin also does a wonderful job immersing the reader in the book’s multiple settings, from L.A.’s Koreatown to Cambridge. Throughout the first half of the book, Zevin’s excellent prose jumps deftly between perspectives and timelines, leading the reader through a sweeping and vividly authentic representation of the places that her characters call home.
Unfortunately, around the halfway point, the book starts to drag. “Tomorrow” is over four hundred pages long, and the plot doesn’t quite justify its length. After Sam and Sadie’s first success with “Ichigo,” the story becomes repetitive. Sam and Sadie release more games and start their own company. They fall in and out of love with various side characters. On a positive note, Sadie’s relationship with Marx has a refreshingly stable arc throughout the entire book, and their romance develops in intriguing and genuine ways.
The book tries to compensate for its flaws by introducing new characters and plots. A subplot about marriage equality in a Sims-like world, an ex-Mormon couple designing a post-apocalyptic video game, and an avant-garde production of “Macbeth” are just a few of these added storylines. While each is interesting on its own, they detract from Sam and Sadie’s story, making the second half feel disjointed.
“Tomorrow” pulls itself together at the end, though. The last fifty pages again show Zevin’s skill as a writer, as she brings together several plot threads to produce a poignant finale. Although the plot meanders on the way to its final destination, it does get there eventually, and the destination is exciting and emotionally satisfying.
One final point of praise is the novel’s approach to representation. Sam and Sadie are both Jewish, and Sam’s mother is Korean-American. Zevin (who is herself Korean and Jewish) integrates her characters’ identities into the novel with nuance and thoughtfulness. The novel touches upon issues such as racism in the performing arts and how dialogues about cultural appropriation rarely make room for artists of mixed-race identity. Sam is also physically disabled from a car accident, and he walks with a cane. Zevin incorporates his experience of living with this disability into the story.
Although its second half struggles with uneven pacing, “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” is worth the read. The book reaches unflinchingly into the messiness of our complex and often mysterious world, joyfully revealing to readers what it means to be human and to be a friend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Toni Morrison left Random House in 1983, their Black authorship decreased by 99.2%.
Even when Morrison was actively working in publishing, only 3.3% of the books that Random House published were written by Black authors.
This, of course, is not to devalue Morrison’s commitment to publishing Black voices. During her time as the first Black female editor at Random House, Morrison frequently published radical, activist works by the likes of Huey Newton, Muhammad Ali, and Angela Davis. Rather, this exemplifies how hiring diverse editors is not enough to break through the nuanced and intrinsically violent forces that keep Black voices out of bookstores and publishing houses. The homogeneity of literature is rooted in much more than the identities of publishers.
The publishing industry, as with most iterations of corporate life, has made lofty claims about the necessity and attainability of vague goals like “diversity and inclusion” for decades. Unlike other realms of professional life, tracking progress toward inclusivity in publishing is accessible and highly significant. The proof is (or rather, isn’t) in the pudding: People of color are simply not adequately represented in the literary world.
In recent years, however, the severity of Black exclusion from the literary world has been masked by a wave of a very specific category of work which often focuses on Black oppression and trauma. The category includes memoirs, social commentary, historical study, or any combination of these forms, with prime examples such as Ibram. X Kendi’s “How to Be an Antiracist” or Isabel Wilkerson’s “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents.” No disrespect intended to these authors and their vast catalog of work; the intellect, talent, and investment that they pour into their projects is immense, and the products serve critical educational purposes. But it’s precisely this emotional labor and the use of their works for education that are the problem.
As violence against Black people has come to the forefront of national media in the last several years, an unsettling fascination has developed within educated white communities on what Blackness is, means, and looks like. Nonfiction of this nature tends to satiate feelings of intrigue surrounding Blackness without readers having to engage in a meaningful, fully human capacity. Nonfiction that centers Black trauma is a blatant example of intellectual and emotional exploitation: Black intellectuals sift through mass amounts of data, personal experience, and generationally traumatic material in order to produce work that white readers greedily consume — under the cloak of education — as a means of mitigating their own feelings of guilt and discomfort with the legacy of slavery.
And while this network of nonfiction does cloud the narrative and data slightly, the unsettling reality of publishing fiction is still crystal clear: Fiction is nearly as white as it’s always been.
In 2020, the UK Research and Innovation, Arts and Humanities Research Council conducted a study on fiction and the publishing industry. After interviewing hundreds of professions across every major British publishing house, the study found some unsettling assumptions held by those in the publishing industry. When asked why writers of color are not being sought out and discovered, the replies were socially and economically loaded:
“If you’re not from a family that’s already going to support you somehow, you’re probably not going to be motivated to sit down and write books,” said a white female editor.
“For all under-represented voices the idea of writing a book and getting it published probably feels very remote from your day to day experience,” said another editor. “If you’re white middle class and/or upper class[ ]... you know it’s a possibility because you probably know someone who knows someone who did. Whereas if you’re not in any connection with that world, at all, how do you get a book published?”
Beyond being generally charged and offensive in their assumptions about non-white families, these statements reveal an outrageous assumption: Publishers believe that non-white people are not socially, economically, or culturally prepared to write fiction successfully. Not only are we not considered writers, we are not considered readers either.
All that considered, publishing diverse fiction becomes the ultimate step toward equity. Only by openly debunking myths about non-white readership, decolonizing our collective understanding of what good literature is, and moving Black writers out of the role of eduction and emotional labor, can the publishing world begin to actually reach its decades long goal of “diversity and inclusion.”
But, of course, publishers already know this. The power of fiction as a tool to shape cultural understandings of art and personhood is not lost on these companies. It has never been a question of how to bring diversity into the literary world in a non-exploitive, non-abusive way. The question is simply: Will they choose to?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Based in part on the 2017 Zimbabwe coup, Zimbabwean author NoViolet Bulawayo’s highly anticipated novel “Glory” is centered around the crumbling political system of Jidada, a fictional nation inhabited by animals like Destiny the goat or Tuvy the horse. When Jidada's leader, the Old Horse, loses his power, the nation’s citizens grapple with the question of who should take his place. In its threatened collapse, their society shockingly mirrors reality. All of their conflicts, from Twitter feuds to revolutionary violence, are applicable to ones that are witnessed in the world today.
Bulawayo employs stunning imagery, humorous dialogue, and thought-provoking Twitter-like threads in telling the story of “Glory.” These components lend greater depth to a story that already touches on a variety of political issues, including controversies involving conversative, old-fashioned views of women, and racial tensions. Through elements adopted from the real world, Bulawayo encourages readers to be more aware of the societal power structures that govern their own lives.
Readers witness many progressive changes in the society of animals as the kingdom reshapes itself. Bulawayo reveals how twisted the state of the world really is and mocks the ridiculous behavior of those who stand in the way of progress. She makes outrageous claims that are clearly intended to be humorous, making her novel toe the line of satire.
“Glory” is packed with various dynamic characters, which often makes it difficult to paint a full picture of Jidada in one’s mind; there are simply too many characters to keep track of. Nonetheless, the overwhelming number of characters does not detract from the message of a need for social and political reform conveyed throughout the novel.
One of the best parts of the novel’s layout is the inclusion of the aforementioned simulated Twitter thread chapters. Like the Twitter feuds of the human world, the threads are both informative of the atmosphere of the animals’ society and incredibly entertaining. Characters share sarcastic responses to online claims, such as in @goldenm’s tweet: “It’s spelled Dictatorship bruh. DICTATORSHIP. I mean you should know the spelling seeing it’s on your forehead.”
These tweets also summarize the kingdom’s attitude after what took place in previous chapters, pushing readers to keep up with the fast-paced story. One Tweet from @movernshaker states in response to another user: “Sit down, you didn’t start shit in 2017. Tuvy and the dogs carried out a coup, y’all were just used to sanitize it. And now they’ll finish their thing, WATCH and LEARN.”
Additionally, the novel highlights meaningful feminist issues through bold dialogue. Through characters like Aunt MaKhumalo and others, Bulawayo proves she is not afraid to write about sensitive topics. On the contrary, she takes pains to emphasize the ridiculousness of having such outdated opinions about women’s rights in modern society.
Above all, Bulawayo very clearly calls out the holes in our political systems throughout the novel. “Even the sticks and stones will tell you that an animal can’t just preach change without embodying it themselves, and that that change has to begin at the top and then trickle down to the rest of the masses,” she writes. In an important call to action, she prompts readers to reevaluate the performance of their political systems. In doing so, this novel effectively guides readers toward a greater consciousness of societal issues through a fictional, humorous, and animal-filled scope.

The fundamentals of public speaking and Expos 40 dictate that we should eliminate filler phrases from our speeches. Rather than filling silences with “like”s and “um”s, we should simply pause, collect our thoughts, and resume in an Obamaesque manner. It’s emphatic, our teachers tell us. After making an important point, the silence carries the gravity of our words — whatever that means. But somehow, we always find ourselves saying, “like.”
For many, the word “like” evokes images of “Valley Girl” — a movie most of our generation probably hasn’t even seen — and stereotypical teenage ditzes. For me, “like” invokes a memory of a conversation I had at Harvard with someone who said “like” six times in a row because they lost their train of thought. That’s not to say using filler phrases is a bad thing. The word “like” is a pleasant reminder of how we ditched the formality of unmuting and muting on Zoom and returned to in-person conversations. Listening to that person’s struggle to rack their brain for the thought that just wouldn’t resurface, I was reminded of countless memories of being in the same position.
Contrary to what a debate coach might say, using filler phrases can actually be a good thing. A study from the University of Texas at Austin found that people who use filler phrases such as “like” and “you know” actually appear more thoughtful and deliberate. Filler phrases tend to appear more commonly among “women, younger participants, and more conscientious people,” who “use discourse markers, such as ‘I mean’ and ‘you know,’ to imply their desire to share or rephrase opinions to recipients.” Having devoted their full attention to the conversation at hand, they are thinking carefully about how to convey information in a nuanced manner. A natural consequence of these findings to me seems that using “totes my goats” is linked to being unpopular. The details aren’t important, but like, you get the gist.
Such is the duality of filler phrases. They invoke images of “Valley Girl” and surfer bros, but also a sense of familiarity — a reminder that despite others’ world-class achievements, they’re just as human and prone to verbal tics as we are. Even at Harvard, with classmates who have sat in on Parliament meetings and performed in Carnegie Hall, we can’t stop ourselves from saying “like.”
But beyond that, filler words serve a functional purpose. Discourse markers help us evaluate whether the people we converse with are invested in our conversations, as well as their personality types — infinitely helpful for the fretful Harvard freshman trying to “find their people” a week before the semester even starts. In fact, some studies have suggested that speech-lacking filler phrases can sound too reserved, careful, or even unfriendly (that probably explains why your crush has never said “like” or “um” around you). When declining an invitation, saying “um, well, like, sorry” can appear more polite than simply saying, “no” (a tip for when someone confesses their crush on you — not that it’ll ever happen).
Filler words, in the right time and place, are comforting. Used in informal conversations, certain phrases, such as “like” and “you know what I mean,” can actually demonstrate attentiveness and help convey your ideas more clearly. Used in the middle of a presentation or interview, however, they can detract from your credibility and overall message; repeating “um” suggests that you’re unprepared even when you aren’t. To sum it up for the ruthlessly results-oriented Harvard students among us: use filler phrases when graded on participation; ditch them when graded on presentation.
Filler words represent a microcosm of the dichotomy between formal and informal conversation, a dichotomy that shouldn’t exist. Removing them from our parlance doesn’t change who we are or the quality of our ideas; just because someone (i.e. that one section kid) speaks with formal language doesn’t mean they’re smarter or merit more attention. Instead, we should acknowledge that great ideas are great ideas, regardless of how they are communicated. Doing so necessitates realizing that we often substitute mental shortcuts for more difficult problems, such as evaluating the quality of one’s ideas based on how one speaks. Increasing tolerance for filler words can rightfully shift our perception of professionalism.
For now, though, I don’t recommend using “totes my goats” in your next interview. You’re a Harvard student, after all; you’ve got to speak to impress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, as the Harvard student population was getting kicked off campus, I was celebrating my entrance into legal adulthood. On Saturday, March 14, 2020, I turned 18, the first of what I assumed would be the many steps toward the gradual transition from adolescence to adulthood. The transition I hoped would be picturesque and idyllic, however, was abruptly compressed by the entrance of Covid-19 onto the world stage.
My 18th birthday marked the beginning of quarantine, an event that precluded me from properly saying goodbye to many of my close friends, some of whom I have not had the opportunity to see since. This is not a unique experience, but rather one I share with countless of my classmates. Covid threw most of us into a foreign new world, with little guidance or precedent on how to navigate it.
Alone on campus, the Class of 2024 in particular felt the full effect of the break of tradition. There was no First Chance Dance, no Harvard-Yale, no Commencement, Visitas, or Activities Fair. Annenberg remained empty, and instead of getting Quadded by a mass of Cabotians outside of my dorm, we got Quadded by an anti-climactic Zoom meeting.
Covid-19 was like the little kid who, seeing a single file line of ants, steps on the middle, leaving the latter portion confused and with no path to follow. We arrived with no signposts or manuals, surrounded by stories of traditions we were missing and buildings we weren’t allowed to enter. We didn’t know what we were missing, what a normal year at Harvard was meant to be like. Quite frankly, though, we were the better for it.
As a freshman in what was supposed to be an intensely competitive and at times formalized social scene, I was thankful for this social vagary. The Class of 2024 is uniquely socially interconnected, owing to the pandemic and the lack of formalized sports, clubs, and societies by which our social lives would have been defined. Friendships were made that crossed what would normally have been solid social divisions. Relationships were had by people who typically would never have even crossed paths. The lack of in-person classes, clubs, and dining halls left people wandering around campus, introducing themselves to anyone who would listen.
The fact is, Covid-19 turned Harvard’s campus into virgin land, ready to be explored by a group of idealistic freshmen who didn’t yet know that Falafel Corner is a better late night food location than Jefe’s. Friends were made in the Mather courtyard, rather than Annenberg. Going into Boston became a weekly event, instead of a perpetually postponed plan.
This newfound freedom from tradition was’t limited to the Class of 2024, however. When we fnally returned to campus, only one class had experienced a full in-person academic year. The lack of experience allowed the entire student body to embrace an idealism that we’ve only felt when we first stepped foot on campus with our lanyard around our neck. For all intents and purposes, the pandemic made us all freshmen.
There’s value in being a freshman. With no elder guidance, there’s no one to tell you that you can’t organize a walkout while the University President is giving a speech. Thinking like a freshman has led students to run for the Undergraduate Council with a campaign to overhaul the entire system, or create an Instagram account devoted to imbuing within Harvard the school spirit of a state school. The pandemic eroded the forceful authority of history and replaced it with the promise of a future latent with possibility. Sure, the Institute of Politics may be historically full of cutthroat wannabe presidents, but this post-pandemic generation didn’t know that this was their role to play when they first comped. The past culture of competition, toxicity, and disillusionment is a positive feedback loop that can only be broken by something as jarring as a global pandemic.
Covid-19 shook us awake from that four year long trance that had many of us shuffling through Harvard, stepping where we were told to step. It changed the status quo, allowing us to ask questions of what we used to think was a fixed system. Traditions were lost, but new ones were made. Change is hard, and many times painful. But, many times, though, change is good.

The world is full of injustice, but never worse than when it affects Harvard students. We were confronted with this uncomfortable reality last week, when a team of YouTubers breached our hallowed halls with typewriters, cameras, and a can-do attitude. Disguised as Harvard students, the YouTubers crashed at least two large lecture halls, shouting, tapping noisily on vintage typewriters, and generally harassing the lecturers.
We cannot overstate our offense at this interruption (though we’ll certainly try). We came to Harvard hoping to be walled off from the world, the vagaries of day-to-day life dashed against the wrought-iron gates of Harvard Yard. Instead, we were inconvenienced.
More seriously, though, we are actually a bit peeved. There was an egotism in interrupting last Tuesday’s rally for an Ethnic Studies department, where our would-be comic flailed a bit and generally undermined the seriousness of the issue. He seemed to be broadly sympathetic to the cause, but the rally was subordinated to his broader routine.
Likewise, there’s an egotism in crashing a class as large as Life Sciences 1B, in thinking that you’re funny enough to justify interrupting a couple hundred people, commandeering their attention for a standup routine they can’t leave. We as students may be utterly undeserving of deference, but we do think our Professors deserve a little.
None of this should suggest that we can’t take a joke; we’re actually very funny. Here’s a list of jokes we find quite droll. Camus has us clutching our sides, Swift in stitches, Gogol gasping; invite us to a party sometime and we won’t shut up about them. No really, please, invite us to a party sometime.
We even like some humor directed at our shining University. Making fun of Harvard can be a great time, and we actually do it quite a bit. On Harvard Time knows just what buttons to push in making fun of the place we love to hate. So do the wonderful YouTubers who walk around Science Center Plaza, dangling free iPhones as they convince us to show off our embarrassing ignorance for their channels. There’s no shortage of appropriate mockery, and we’re happy to be the victims of ridicule; we just think we deserve a better class of criminal.
Anyway, we’re glad this will soon fade from collective memory. We’re a little jealous that many more people will watch the prank than will read this piece. But we take comfort in the grace and aplomb of our measured response: We condemn this invasion of our holy of holies unequivocally, calling for justice in the next world if we cannot get it in this one. But we don’t even, like, care anyway.

No more Zoom reveals, no more virtual welcomes. This Housing Day, for the first time in two years, Harvard freshmen learned about their future homes in riotous dorm-storm fashion.
On the second anniversary of the day Harvard sent students packing due to the Covid-19 outbreak, upperclassmen decked in house gear hollered chants, waved posters, and stormed freshman dorms. Housing Day is an annual tradition during which freshmen are sorted into one of Harvard’s 12 upperclassman houses or the Dudley Co-Op in groups of up to eight students, called blocking groups.
The Dean of Students Office had previously announced a pandemic-era modified version of the tradition, in which upperclassmen storm freshman hallways in groups of three for up to five minutes. Still, many students took to pre-pandemic ways, disregarding the restrictions and mobbing the freshman dorms en masse sans masks.
“I thought it’d be a little underwhelming, but it was actually really fun,” said Jennifer Xiong ’25, who was placed in Lowell House.
In the week leading up to Housing Day, House Committees released widely-viewed music videos showing off house amenities and dissing the other houses. On Wednesday night, some freshmen took part in River Run, a forbidden ritual in which students take shots of alcohol at each of the nine river houses in an ill-fated attempt to avoid being assigned to live in the remote Radcliffe Quadrangle.
Throughout the day, freshmen — even those who were “quadded” — expressed excitement about their new homes, donning house merch, sharing pictures on social media, and attending house events.
Jeffrey Fang ’25, who displayed his house pride with a new Currier House baseball cap and shirt, said he had hoped to get a house in the Quad, though some of his blockmates were less pleased.
“There’s a higher chance of getting a single, also better food. And just peace and quiet,” Fang said.
Some posters for the Quad Houses and Mather House bore the phrase “more sex,” in reference to their abundance of single dorm rooms.
Early Thursday morning, students from Kirkland House arrived first to University Hall, where they draped a house flag over the John Harvard statue and hoisted another onto the building.
Students participating in dorm storm festivities spotted Currier’s mascot, known as Woody the Tree, brawling with Eliot House’s elephant mascot in an interhouse tussle.
When asked how he felt about his new house, Mahdi A. Hamad ’25 yelled “Quincy! Q house! Let’s go!” and said it was his second choice behind only Adams House.
Savannah S. Cooksey ’25 said Housing Day and the dorm storm were “pretty fun,” even though she was “iffy at first” about getting assigned to Currier.
“We had seen Currier outside of our window where we were, and we looked and were like, ‘Crap, it’s not gonna be us, it’s not gonna be us,’” Cooksey said. “And then we hear ‘Boom boom boom boom,’ and we were like, ‘Dang it.’”
Taylor Fang ’25 said she was concerned she might have a higher chance of getting “quadded” due to the unusually large size of the Class of 2025 but felt “really lucky” to be placed in Adams.
“I heard that the 300 extra freshmen all got quadded,” she said. “That might just be a rumor, but that just made me feel even more like, ‘Wow, I’m really lucky to get a house that I like.’”
After receiving their housing assignments, freshmen had the chance to speak to upperclassmen, grab swag, and learn more about their house on the walkway to Annenberg Hall, where students had set up tables.
Audrey Gunawan ’25 said Housing Day festivities “lived up to everything that [she] expected.”
“I can tell that it’s really exciting for a lot of people, and especially the upperclassmen, who haven’t gotten to have a real in-person Housing Day yet,” Gunawan said. “I’ve been meeting a bunch of people that, turns out, are in my house.”
“I’m ready to be out of the Yard,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School appointed Monica E. Monroe as its new Assistant Dean of Community Engagement, Equity, and Belonging last month.
The Law School’s Office of Community Engagement, Equity, and Belonging aims to support historically underrepresented students and student organizations through mentorship and campus programming. Monroe took over the role on Feb. 22, following the departure of Mark C. Jefferson in April 2021.
An alumna of George Washington Law School, Monroe previously served as an assistant dean of students at her alma mater, where she also taught courses in legal writing. Prior to her appointment last month, she worked as the associate dean of equity and inclusion at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.
Monroe said that her career in law as a clerk and commercial lawyer prior to academia has shaped her pedagogical approach.
She recalled the first time as a young attorney she faced “some hostility” from an opposing counsel. Though she was initially flustered, Monroe said she learned to handle high-stress situations by taking a breath and approaching the challenge pragmatically — a skill she said she will take with her into her role as assistant dean.
“I think sometimes we underestimate the power of a pause because we're in such a fast-moving, fast-paced world,” Monroe said. “It permits you to collect yourself and move forward and perhaps not meet hostility with hostility but defuse it.”
Monroe said her primary goal as assistant dean is to elevate all student voices at the Law School.
“My goal really is to have everyone be seen, heard, and respected here and figure out how we can talk across difference,” Monroe said.
The hiring process for the assistant dean position included feedback from students, faculty, and staff.
“I was very glad, as someone who comes from a student services background, to see students incorporated right within the process,” Monroe said.
Arabi Hassan — co-executive director of First Class, an affinity group at the Law School for first-generation students — described the areas in need of improvement members of First Class hope Monroe can address.
“Overall, I think we're looking for a leader who is willing to work closely with first-generation, low-income students to get a sense of what we need and how we can move forward and actually achieve some of those goals,” Hassan said.
“I would love to communicate as much as we can the needs of our students and be able to communicate that to the school. I hope there's more direct communication between our members and administration,” she added.
Paulina Olaveres, co-executive director of First Class, said she feels that, especially at the law school, “there's almost like a rulebook that exists that wasn't given to all first-gen or low-income students.”
Monroe concluded that she intends to approach her work with students with empathy and compassion.
“I feel like if I lead with love and if we all try to lead with love, it is my hope that my tenure will serve this institution well and some good will come from that,” Monroe said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crowds of students lined up to receive a red sweatshirt bearing the phrase “One Crimson” in Harvard Yard last September.
These sweatshirts were part of the Harvard Athletics Department’s ongoing initiative to bridge the gap between student-athletes and the larger student body, Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott said in an interview Friday.
Following a 2020 Athletics Department review that found many student-athletes feel a disconnect with the broader student body, the Athletic Department wants to boost the interaction between student-athletes and the rest of campus, according to McDermott.
McDermott said the elite gear student-athletes receive from their teams might perpetuate this divide. The Athletics Department had this in mind when they gave students a free “One Crimson” sweatshirt, she said.
“I know it’s a sweatshirt — it’s not gonna save the world, but it’s a message that we want you to be part of us,” McDermott said. “It’s our way of giving a warm hug to campus.”
The Athletic Department’s efforts to achieve greater campus unity include offering recreational programming and upgrading facilities’ fitness offerings and equipment, per McDermott.
“We want our community to really be fluid between student-athletes being part of the student body and students being part of our athletic community,” McDermott said.
“If we can not have the river be such a divider and have reasons that people have to cross over all the more, then I think it helps with that flow,” she added. “We can try to capitalize on that by making our spaces more fluid and welcoming to everyone.”
Student-athletes have reported feeling isolated from their houses as team practices often conflict with regular meal times, forcing them to eat at a different time than other students, McDermott noted.
“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard about meals since I've been here,” she said.
This year, Dunster’s dinner hours have been extended one hour later than in other houses, allowing student-athletes to eat until 8:30 p.m. every night. McDermott said though this change has accommodated student-athletes, it has its drawbacks.
“It puts them in one place, and they’re not able to eat with their residential communities, which is a big part of experiencing Harvard,” McDermott said.
The Athletics Department also aims to foster collaboration between faculty and coaches to help student-athletes juggle their academic and athletic responsibilities.
McDermott cited the Faculty Standing Committee on Athletic Sports — a committee composed of athletics staff, faculty, students, and other representatives across the University — as a means to encourage this cooperation. The group is tasked with discussing sports-related policies and overseeing the athletic experience on campus, among other purposes.
“That alignment for the faculty to see the coaches really engage in a process that they can relate to — because they may do it in an academic sense, and now they’re seeing the coaches speak at that type of level as a coach — is only reinforcing that our coaches are truly educators,” she said.
McDermott also discussed efforts to integrate non-athlete students into Harvard Athletics through initiatives like the Grow. Play. Achieve. Program, created in 2020 by the department to promote health and wellness among undergraduates.
Through the initiative, coaches have the opportunity to “present some of their wisdom and expertise” to the whole student body, McDermott said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pulitzer Prize winning poet Tracy K. Smith ’94 will serve as the Harvard Class of 2022's Alumni Day speaker, the University announced Wednesday.
Smith, a professor of English and African and African American Studies, served two terms as the 22nd United States Poet Laureate in 2017 and 2018. Smith joined the Harvard Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — in 2020, but stepped down upon receiving her teaching post last year.
Formerly known as the Harvard Alumni Association’s annual meeting, Alumni Day will take place June 3, following the Commencement ceremony for the Class of 2022 and the joint ceremony for the Classes of 2020 and 2021. The event — back in-person for the first time since 2019 — will also include the traditional alumni parade, musical performances, and a speech by University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
Smith said she was “deeply honored” to be selected, according to the Harvard Gazette, a publication overseen by the University's public affairs department.
“It’s important to come together after this time of relative isolation and speak about this place that we share,” she said.
Bacow told the Gazette that Harvard affiliates are “fortunate” Smith will share her wisdom with alumni.
“Tracy is an inspired choice to serve as the first official speaker for Harvard Alumni Day,” Bacow said. “Her poetry has the power to create common ground and to mend what is broken — a gift to all of us, especially in dark times.”
Philip W. Lovejoy, the outgoing HAA executive director, told the Gazette that Smith provides “a shining example” of a drive among Harvard alumni to make the world a better place.
“This day will be the highlight of the alumni calendar, with the traditions and the pomp and circumstance we all love — and I am thrilled that we will be hearing from Tracy K. Smith, one of our most compelling alumni voices,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three months after an external review found that a “permissive culture regarding sexual harassment” at Harvard allowed a former Government professor to rise through the school’s ranks despite repeatedly sexually harassing students and colleagues, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he was confident in procedural changes made in the wake of the report.
The report, released in February 2021, detailed how former Government Professor Jorge I. Domínguez sexually harassed women over three decades — all while being promoted to several high-profile University positions. Domínguez was barred from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences campus and stripped of his emeritus status in 2019, following his retirement.
“The same issue, were it to arise now, might be a little bit cumbersome, but we would still avoid the unfortunate outcome that occurred previously,” Bacow said in May 2021.
The report said Harvard’s processes had improved in the years since allegations were first made against Domínguez in the 1980s, finding that “if the University confronted the same situation today, it has the processes and structures in place to handle it differently.” But the three-person external panel also offered nine specific recommendations for Harvard to improve sexual harassment reporting processes, as well as a broader call for the University to “accelerate progress toward a culture intolerant of sexual and gender-based harassment.”
Just over a year after the report was released, as Harvard grapples with another high-profile sexual harassment scandal, the school has not fulfilled three of the external review’s recommendations.
Despite reforming its sexual misconduct training curriculum and revamping online resources, Harvard has not established a standardized procedure to vet faculty and staff for misconduct during hiring and appointment processes — a key recommendation of the external review. And more than a year after Bacow pledged the school would create a centralized personnel database to better track misconduct reports, school officials could not point to completed reforms in the management of personnel data.
The external review also called on the University to hold units — such as academic departments — accountable for instances of misconduct by having deans and the University provost conduct internal reviews at least once every three years. But the school has not announced any such review cycle.
School officials say further updates are coming this semester — including regarding efforts to establish processes for vetting candidates and a centralized personnel repository. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in a statement this week that Harvard is working on all 10 recommendations.
“When he accepted the recommendations from the external review committee, President Bacow made clear that the University must continue to build on our progress and accelerate our work in assuring Harvard is free from harassment, discrimination, and bullying,” Garber wrote. “In the year since these recommendations were made, University leaders have prioritized efforts to move them forward including addressing our policies and structures.”
Domínguez was first accused of harassment in 1983 by Terry L. Karl, then an assistant professor in the Government Department. In a statement when the external report was released last year, Bacow apologized to Karl, writing that “Harvard failed her.”
Today, Karl says she would not recommend any Harvard affiliate seek recourse through Harvard’s Title IX processes.
Though she acknowledged recent strides, Karl said more reforms are needed in the school’s processes for handling gender-based harassment, citing a federal lawsuit filed last month by three Harvard graduate students that accused the school of ignoring a decade of complaints against professor John L. Comaroff.
“I wish [Harvard] would design their procedures not to meet the minimal Title IX, but to bring in some of us who have experienced these issues and can design better policies so they won’t make victims feel that it takes too long, that they’re not being listened to, that their rights are being violated — all of which led to a lawsuit, and a very understandable one,” Karl said.
The report recommended that Harvard increase transparency around investigations and sanctions. In recent years, the FAS has publicized sanctions it levied against professors — including Comaroff.
Harvard has also revamped its gender-based and sexual misconduct trainings and its online resources, per three of the external review’s recommendations to improve climate and increase the accessibility and transparency of reporting processes. Many reforms have come from the University’s newly-formed Office of Gender Equity, which was established last March after Harvard combined its Title IX Office with the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
The OGE, which runs mandatory trainings for all Harvard employees, updated its required e-learning courses to focus on improving the school’s culture, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain. The OGE’s website, which launched last summer, also includes a new electronic complaint filing process and a data hub with current statistics about complaints and disclosures.
Harvard also says OGE is expanding. The office has hired three new staff members for its Sexual Harassment/Assault Resources & Education team and hopes to bring on two more staffers later this year, according to Swain.
Starting in 2017, before the external review recommended that Harvard monitor employees with past infractions, the school instituted policies intended to track patterns of misconduct disclosures. OGE is notified when someone is accused of misconduct multiple times, according to Swain.
The report also recommended that the Government Department improve the gender balance of its faculty. A 2019 department review found that only two women went up for tenure in the last quarter-century — and only one was promoted. In contrast, 14 men went up for tenure and 12 were promoted over the same period. The review noted the department has disproportionately failed to retain female junior faculty members compared to their male colleagues.
In the faculty overall, the total number of tenured female professors at Harvard has increased from 226 to 305 since 2012 — but women still make up fewer than 30 percent of tenured faculty.
Nicole M. Merhill, Harvard’s Title IX coordinator, who heads the OGE, wrote that the school’s work is an “evolving process.”
“It would really be a mistake if we looked at these recommendations as a checklist or bulleted list of actions,” Merhill wrote in a statement. “Culture change, as you know, is an ongoing and evolving process and it requires three pieces to work in tandem – individual actions, structural actions, and cultural change.”
Still, Karl said the lawsuit against Harvard over its handling of the Comaroff complaints is evidence that the University must continue to improve its processes.
“I’ve never known anybody who chose the legal route unless they felt that that was all that was left for them,” she said. “It’s a failure of a procedural system when people choose the law — that’s how it must be understood.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson (13-13, 7-7) traveled to Hanover, N.H. to square off against the Big Green (3-23, 2-12) in a must win game to keep their Ivy Madness hopes alive. Harvard responded to the pressure in dominant fashion, crushing their conference rivals by a 33-point margin. Senior guard Tess Sussman led the team with a career-high 25 points, shooting an efficient 10-for-13 on her field goal attempts. Junior guard McKenzie Forbes and sophomore guard Lola Mullaney also scored double figures, tallying 17 and 13 points respectively. The win, paired with a loss by UPenn the same day, allowed Harvard to clinch the final spot in the Ivy League playoff tournament.
“We knew we had to win [this] game,” said junior guard Maggie McCarthy. “We played with no pressure even though we knew there was pressure. We played like we deserved to win [this] game; we’ve worked all season to get to the Ivy Tournament.”
The contest started off slow until Sussman and Forbes drained back-to-back triples to tie the game at 8-8. Sussman then converted back-to-back layups for the final lead change of the game, as Harvard led 12-9. The Crimson nailed back-to-back triples again, this time courtesy of Mullaney and first-year guard Harmoni Turner, to extend its lead to 18-13. Sussman tallied her ninth point of the first quarter off of a nifty dish from junior guard Annie Stritzel. The teams continued to trade baskets as Harvard closed the quarter with a 24-17 lead.
Harvard made its push in the second quarter, embarking on an enormous 23-4 run in which Forbes drained three consecutive triples. The Crimson outscored Big Green 28-9 in the second quarter to widen its lead to an astounding 52-26 margin at halftime.
Harvard continued its offensive explosion in the third quarter as a barrage of threes ensued from Forbes, Sussman, McCarthy, and Mullaney. Sussman continued her career night, going on a personal 10-1 run to balloon the Crimson’s lead to 74-37. The third quarter concluded with a couple of baskets by each team, with Harvard leading 76-41.
The Crimson started the final stanza with five straight points to reach the apex of its lead, 81-41. The team proceeded to take its foot off the gas pedal in this period as Dartmouth outscored Harvard 11-9 in the period. All in all, the Crimson cruised to a comfortable 85-52 victory to earn a spot in Ivy Madness, which it will host the following week.
After senior day festivities for guard Tess Sussman and forward Maddie Stuhlreyer, Harvard and Princeton (22-4, 14-0) tipped off Saturday afternoon in Cambridge and traded a series of offensive spurts throughout the first quarter. After the Tigers ran out to a nine-to-two lead, the Crimson responded with a trio of layups to narrow the margin midway through the period, which concluded with a five-point Princeton lead, 20-15.
The Tigers, however, outscored Harvard 17-7 in the second quarter, primarily due to the Crimson’s struggles from the field (three for eighteen) and three-point line (one for nine). Junior guard Maggie McCarthy recorded the lone three-point make in the period, and her standout play on defense complemented her efficient 12-point offensive performance.
Despite the 37-22 halftime deficit, Harvard emerged from the locker room to cut the Princeton lead to single digits. First-year guard Harmoni Turner led the third quarter offensive surge, recording seven consecutive points on her way to a team-leading 15.
“We know Princeton's a good team,” McCarthy said. “They have a reputation of being a good team, but we know they're beatable, too, and that's what we took from this game. We lost on the scoreboard by 20, but we were in it the whole game. In the second quarter, I think we let up. [...] On the defensive end, rotating and being there for each other and then offensively, we did not shoot well, and that's not typical of us.”
Junior guard McKenzie Forbes’ three-point conversion cut the Tigers’ lead to 41-32, but the Ivy League regular season champions continued their hot shooting from the first half to extend the lead to 57-40 by the end of the third period. The Princeton lead expanded to 20 throughout the fourth quarter, finishing at 73-53 when the final buzzer of the regular season sounded.
“I'm not discouraged, I'm disappointed,” Coach Delaney-Smith said. “There were some mistakes — we allowed the middle drive, we allowed the baseline drive, and our rotation was off on too many possessions. [...] Those are correctable errors, those are things that are unacceptable and shouldn't have happened. But the bottom line was, we have got to hit shots.”
Correcting her team’s defensive errors will be the focus of Delaney-Smith’s practices this week ahead of Harvard’s rematch against Princeton in the Ivy League conference tournament. The Crimson and Tigers will return to Lavietes Pavilion on Friday, March 11 at 4:30 p.m. as both teams aim for an Ivy League tournament championship and a bid to the NCAA tournament.
“This whole year flew by for me,” McCarthy said. “Especially being a junior after three seasons, things start to go by faster. It's not believable for [Delaney-Smith], either. I'm gonna remind everyone early [this week in practice], this is potentially our last week, and I’ll remind everyone that we're playing for Kathy, [...] and bringing the emotion, bringing everything for her for her 40 years.”

Part of the hard work of preparing for Housing Day for first-years was, of course, manifesting their favorite House, River Running, and most importantly, coming up with a blocking group name. This year’s batch were nothing short of punny, topical, risque, intellectual, and remarkably self-aware. So, here’s Flyby’s breakdown of the twelve most hilarious and creative names from the Class of 2025!
Larry Blockow 
An ode to our fearless leader. Anyone with this blocking name should just opt to live in Mass. Hall.
Milf and Cookies
A brilliant name that has me wondering: Who’s the milf? Who’s the cookies? Again, who’s the milf?
Party Block Anthem 
Quite the banger… Party Block Anthem is a great blocking name and a reference to an even greater song. Let’s hope this foreshadows an LMFAO resurgence at Sig Chi.
The Block of Gibraltar 
The pun: 10/10. The originality: 10/10. The knowledge of British geography: 10/10
Wordle #930 6/6 BLOCK
A little WORDy, but I appreciate the reference to America’s new favorite word game and ego booster.
The Quadfather
If you get quadded perhaps Michael Corleone can help you out.
Six in the Stacks
This is a great shout-out to one of the most famed Harvard traditions. It’s only ranked lower as it clearly calls out anyone who hasn’t yet completed the Harvard trifecta (aka me).
Party of One 
You’re blocking alone, and you’re telling it how it is. Respect.
Stop, Block, and Roll
It’s catchy and rolls right off the tongue. It also reminds me of my elementary school fire drill days.
The Suite Life 
This gives me so much nostalgia and serotonin. Zack and Cody would be proud.
River Gang
It’s straight forward. You want the River - I get it. I only wonder: what’s going to happen when if this group gets the Quad?
Blockussy 
Um.
If your blocking group name did not make the list, don’t worry, you’re just not that funny. JOKES! My blocking name is “The Toads,” so I have no legs to stand on. But whether your name is an inside joke or an expert pun, Flyby is wishing you the best of luck for Housing Day!
