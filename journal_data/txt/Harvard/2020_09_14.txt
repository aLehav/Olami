After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Midway through last semester, I was walking along the Charles River, watching a group of friends picnic with blankets and beer cans while a couple of senior boys played spikeball on the river’s grassy shore.
The sun was just setting. The dining halls would soon be closing after dinner. The final clubs were getting ready to blast the newest hits. It seemed like the wind down of every typical college day — except that day, it wasn’t.
By the end of the weekend, almost all students would be required to vacate their dorms in order to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. No one in our school’s administration — and perhaps, in the world — could predict a return date.
And that semester, no one would return. I held off from sharing my sorrow about the abrupt end in deference to the students in situations worse than mine or the seniors who experienced all their lasts too soon. Despite everything, wasn’t I lucky to have a safe home to quarantine in? And as a junior, wasn’t I lucky to have more time?
While the former still holds true, I’m not so sure about the latter. Someone in the Class of 2020 joked that Harvard would have to “woo them extra” to get their alumni donations. Now, they have a second punchline: “But not as much as the Class of 2021.”
As part of the Class of 2021, I’m about to start my senior year, in which I will not live on campus for at least the fall and will have classes online for the whole year. The next few months will hold a lot of uncertainties, but what I do know for certain is that my typical college days are over.
Never again will I walk down Plympton Street after a packed lecture in Sanders, pausing to watch the passersby crowd around a bookstore’s window or to hug a friend after serendipitously crossing paths. Nor will I stand next to my classmates on the steps of Memorial Church during a student-organized vigil, heeding the calls for justice, opening my heart to collective grieving. No more packed movie theater dates with my crush from the Quad, unexpected discoveries during an open group study hall, or Harvard-Yale games with my roommates, spent decked out in all the crimson gear we could find.
My college experience — and those of the millions of other seniors enrolled this year — as I knew it is all but over. And, yes, I’m devastated that I won’t have a typical last year at the school I grew to love. But it is precisely because of my love that I know, undoubtedly, Harvard is making the right decision to go online, to only bring back those that they must.
The truth is, what I’ll miss most about college when I graduate are those face-to-face encounters: those exchanges that made me distinctly aware of my humanness in that moment, in that place. Engaging with so many other students, staff, professors, and strangers made me strive to understand — and correct — the impact of our human actions. My time on campus made me believe a better world was possible. I started to hope, more deeply and more boldly.
It was the people I met at college that strengthened my capacity to love, and ultimately, it’s the people that matter most when making decisions amidst a pandemic. Ensuring the safety — the most fundamental part of any endeavor involving others — is impossible for a full campus during the time of coronavirus. And my remote senior year is a necessary sacrifice that protects the people and campus I’ve come to adore.
I still remember a time when I could stroll through a full and bustling campus unwinding from the work week; I want all that and more for the Class of 2022 and the next class and the next. Sending us home is simply Harvard’s way of making that happen, of — one day — giving someone the best four years of their life back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In just one week, fall will be upon us. Harvard Yard will once again be incrementally transformed by a canopy of spectacular red, yellow, and orange leaves — small reminders that beginnings and ends can rarely be separated. For some, the semester’s start signals the end of the Harvard experience they felt they had once been promised; for others, it is the end of life at home, but the beginning of a long-awaited dream, though one manifesting as a very different reality.
One way or another, students are returning to a school that will not resemble anything experienced, or even imagined, by their peers who have walked Harvard’s grounds for the past 384 years.
“It kind of feels exciting in a way and at least we’re getting some of the Harvard experience,” explains Manu Penenory ’24, as she settles into her new residence in The Quad, a place that students, just six months ago, would have complained is too far from the Yard. “So far, it’s pretty good and I think people are quite happy about being on campus,” she said. “I want to be optimistic and say it will bring us closer together because it’s such a unique situation that we’re living through and nobody has ever experienced university in this way.” Laughing, she shares the anecdote of another student helping her as she struggled to open her mailbox — the start of the kind of spontaneous friendship that only being on campus can unlock.
Ten thousand miles away, Micheal Zhang’s ’24 neighbors have no idea they live next to a Harvard dormitory. Previously strangers to one another, Micheal and a group of other Australian freshmen are leasing an apartment together in Sydney — an impressionist remodeling of the Harvard experience. He says, the roommates have become close “bonding over the tragedies” associated with not being able to obtain student visas. “We decided to make the best out of a bad situation,” he said. “It’s been really fun so far and I’m super excited for the upcoming semester.”
Even students who haven’t left home, such as Matti Tan ’24 from the Philippines, remain positive despite having to adjust to “a really broken sleep schedule,” which entails “intermittent naps” to accommodate 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. classes. Matti summarizes the practical optimism of his international peers, saying, “We’re not trying to sulk all of the time, because that will get us nowhere,” while emphasizing the need to “exert more effort” to nurture friendships.
The fall has been a new start for many, but for seniors like Samyra C. Miller ’21, the semester signals an end.
“It's sad, just like being completely honest — always say ‘no regrets in life’ — but I think this is the one time I regret not doing everything I wanted to do on campus,” Miller said. She says students no longer take for granted human connection, and she is doing her best to create for them a “sense of community.”
Since the start of Harvard’s diaspora, Samyra’s Instagram account has become a fountain of information and dialogue. Through screenshots and re-posts, Samyra’s fingertips rest on the arrhythmic pulse of our student body: Almost everyone at the College seems to follow her, or at least recognizes her name.
Samyra explains that “Harvard students want to do things very quickly,” so she converts long-winded emails into digestible news bites that are “best for our consumption.” She directs school traffic to a single place, but also plays school counselor, hosting live chats on Instagram for students to vent their grievances. While initially outraged at the decision to only bring back first-years, she now acknowledges that administrators are “putting forth the best plan that they can” and “they’re all just really trying to figure this out with us.”
It has become clear to me, after speaking with Harvard students worldwide in recent days, that to overcome the challenges of a virtual education, no matter how close or far from Harvard Yard, we must imbue our experiences, social and academic, with a new kind of intentionality — not to erase our disappointment, but to pragmatically navigate it.
“Making the most of it” and “doing our best” seem to be the only thing left to do. Our physical community may be dispersed, but new, makeshift webs of care and support have formed, as we collectively grab hold of an opportunity, taking the best of what’s on offer. Matti reflects that while Harvard is “a dream school for almost all of us,” ultimately, “we make the school.”
“What makes Harvard a good university is its students, not just its professors or its resources,” Tan said.
A virus can remind us that Harvard is so much more than just a place. Harvard is its people and their ideas, coming together across all boundaries — including time and space.
The Fall, in Genesis and the canon it has inspired, is about being cast out — from a green yard across the wide-spread world, from grace and ignorance, to knowledge, freedom, guilt, and responsibility. This semester — this fall from normalcy — leaves us with the daunting responsibility of making the most out of a previously unimaginable situation.
The weeks ahead are an experiment — a petri dish for what is possible for our educational, vocational, and social lives. These weeks also constitute what is possibly the most fascinating moment in the history of being a student. We are reconceptualizing community, probing technology’s limits, and experiencing monumental events in real time. What we are learning right now are things we couldn’t have learned in any other context, undoubtedly re-shaping our collective future.
This column is appearing as a first. In it, I will set out to give presence to Harvard stories that might otherwise slip between the cracks, peeking inside a kaleidoscope of patchwork communities, while my friends and I try to stitch together our own from our new off-campus residence in Central Square. I will be exploring and reflecting on the paradox of our separate co-existence, while trying to capture what matters most to us in these exceptional times.
Welcome to the beginning and the end. Welcome to the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of a nationwide two-day strike for racial justice, several Harvard academics suspended their classes and withheld their labor to draw attention to the necessity of fighting racism. Other scholars, in particular those without tenure, participated in the Scholar Strike for Racial Justice by holding teach-ins and disseminating educational information on racial justice. Organizers of the national Scholar Strike were motivated by the decision of NBA players to strike following the shooting of another Black man, Jacob Blake, in Kenosha, Wis.
We applaud scholars who have leveraged their position to disrupt academia and draw attention to racial inequality in our country however they can. In particular, untenured faculty who conducted teach-ins and provided anti-racist resources to students remind us that all of us can (and must) contribute something to the fight for racial justice.
It’s worth noting, however, that the faculty who have chosen to participate in the strike are those who’ve already demonstrated a commitment to incorporating racial justice into their curricula. Educating students about racial justice has generally only taken place in specific classes and departments, such as African and African American Studies and Ethnicity, Migration and Rights, which tend to draw students who are already interested in anti-racist activism. As a result, those getting an anti-racist education because of the strike likely would’ve received this education anyways. Students without striking teachers, in disciplines with curricula that’re generally race-free, might not have even known the strike occurred.
We are disappointed that the strike didn’t draw more participants across all disciplines, which we take as indicative of a continued reluctance to broach issues of race in large parts of academia, particularly STEM. We hope that the Scholar Strike can inspire faculty across all departments to ensure that their curriculum and environments are anti-racist.
The pervasiveness of anti-Black racism demands continued disruption, education, and discussion. Academia cannot separate itself from suffering and human rights struggles. Universities have long been powerful sites of political and economic change. The 2016 dining hall workers’ strike and the graduate students union strike this past year have shown us that change often requires disrupting the routines and function of the University. And college protests going back to the 1960s remind us that university-based protests have power far beyond these ivy-covered gates.
The future of remote organizing remains uncertain. Zoom teach-ins and breakout rooms may not sufficiently replicate the protests in front of Memorial Church and University Hall. Still, striking faculty make clear that a virtual university will not prevent critical dissent and disruption. After all, these scholars didn’t merely strike; they struck during the first week of the term, shaking up an already unorthodox return to school. We hope that organizers continue to push the virtual envelope to protect workers, fight anti-Black racism, and continue to push Harvard to do better.
If this summer was marked by enormous and vital protest, then striking faculty are doing the critical work of signaling to their peers, students, and university, that the necessity of demanding change does not end with the return of classes. On campus, virtual or otherwise, none of us are exempt from the obligation to push justice forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As summer turns to fall with no immediate end in sight to the coronavirus pandemic, researchers at Harvard Medical School’s affiliated teaching hospitals are working around the clock to help design and test two major COVID-19 vaccines.
The pressure to produce a vaccine is mounting as the United States and other nations continue struggling to contain the pandemic, which has closed businesses, disrupted education, and caused nearly one million deaths worldwide.
Much of the scientific community — as well as the general public — has reached the conclusion that only a vaccine will produce sufficient herd immunity and end the pandemic. Governments, pharmaceutical companies, and academic researchers are working to design, test, and manufacture vaccines in hopes that at least one will be effective.
At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital, Dan H. Barouch is heading a COVID-19 vaccine effort in a partnership with pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson.
Barouch, who serves as Director of Beth Israel’s Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, led the design effort for a vaccine which uses a common cold virus as a viral vector to deliver the coronavirus spike protein to host cells, stimulating the body to elicit an immune response. After successfully showing a robust immune response in adult rhesus monkeys, the team started phase one and phase two clinical trials at the end of July.
Barouch said the team is currently testing both a single-shot and two-shot vaccine regimen to determine the right balance between feasibility and potency.
“While a single shot would be immensely more practical and logistically feasible and deployable for a global vaccination campaign, a two shot regiment will likely be more potent,” Barouch said.
The team is currently looking at early clinical trial data, according to Barouch. They hope to begin a large phase three trial this month, involving 30,000 to 60,000 people across the globe.
A key concern in the large-scale phase three trials will be ensuring a diverse enrollment that includes ample representation from minority groups, Barouch said. Previously, organizers of similar trials have created education outreach programs to tackle the issue.
“A lot of these trials are trying to increase representation from the Black and Latinx communities, because they are disproportionately affected by this disease and there's a lot of history and mistrust of medical research,” Barouch said.
The effort between researchers at Beth Israel and Johnson & Johnson is one of seven supported by Operation Warp Speed, a Department of Health and Human Services funding program aimed at delivering vaccines to Americans by January 2021.
Another effort backed by Operation Warp Speed and tied to Harvard is the vaccine being developed at Moderna, a Cambridge-based biotechnology company.
Lindsey R. Baden, the Director of Clinical Research in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, serves as the co-principal investigator for Moderna’s phase three clinical trials, which are currently at two-thirds enrollment.
The vaccine is based on messenger RNA technology, which Baden said is an attractive method because it can be developed at a faster speed than other platforms.
While a number of vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials have shown promising preliminary results, Baden cautioned against drawing conclusions prematurely.
“I want us all to be very cautious about saying what does or does not work until we have high quality, phase three, efficacy data that we can all look at and be confident that there’s a strong signal of protection or amelioration of disease without any safety concerns,” Baden said.
Barouch said researchers must follow proper safety protocol to maintain public trust in the vaccine testing process.
“The goal of vaccine is twofold,” Barouch said. “One is to protect the individual who received it — and that's important — but it's also to have enough herd immunity in a population that it ends the pandemic. There's an individual benefit, but the most important thing is the public health benefit. We will not achieve the public health benefit of a vaccine if a substantial number of people don't have faith in it.”
Though some harbor concerns about the safety and feasibility of developing a vaccine on such a short timeline, Baden said developers are taking “no shortcuts on safety.”
“Normally you do a phase one, and then you wait and do a phase two, and then you wait and do a phase three. You review data, you think about it, you debate,” Baden said. “When it's finally ready, you go to the agency for approval, then you decide to manufacture and then another year goes by before you've manufactured to scale. So some of those elements that are normally done in sequence have been done in rapid sequence, and that costs a little more. But that's a financial risk, not safety risk.”
Baden also said it is important to remember that ending the pandemic requires access to vaccination for all parts of the world.
“I would argue this is a global problem. An outbreak anywhere threatens everywhere, so we need seven billion [doses],” Baden said. “We need to think broadly, and not just parochially, because this is a transmissible respiratory virus.”
“We're not just solving the science," he added. "We need to go to scale for society."
Correction: September 16, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Lindsey R. Baden as saying manufacturers need to produce seven million vaccine doses. In fact, she said seven billion.

Harvard University Health Services will combine several peer education groups aimed at undergraduates into a centralized program this year in anticipation of a fall 2021 launch.
Four peer education groups — Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators, Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, Health Peer Advisors and Liaisons, and Sexual Health Awareness and Relationship Communication — will merge as part of the initiative. They respectively educate students about gender, sexuality, and interpersonal violence prevention; drugs and alcohol; general health; and sexual health.
Student Mental Health Liaisons, the fifth peer education group, will also undergo changes, though HUHS has not announced exactly what form they will take.
The unified program will train undergraduate members to “promote a multitude of important public health topics, including substance abuse, emotional and physical wellbeing, spirituality and more,” HUHS Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria Francesconi wrote in an emailed statement.
Iman G. Lavery ’22, director of operations for CARE, said while HUHS’s decision to integrate the groups was made without consulting undergraduate educators, the formulation of the new program would rely on student input.
“We don’t want to put burdens on the membership,” Lavery said. “But we also want to make sure that it’s open for people who are excited about it, for people who do want to make sure that their passion for the work that CARE does gets translated to this new group.”
“I think we do have a really unique opportunity to delve into the places where all of the peer ed groups overlap and make sure that we’re actually going to be able to create a more comprehensive resource for students,” she added.
CARE educator Patricia J. Liu ’21 said she felt a “loss” upon hearing of the planned consolidation, but saw the educational potential of the new peer education group.
“While I think CARE was a really great way for Harvard to demonstrate their commitment to consent, it’s not to say that a centralized wellness program couldn’t also do that to a significant degree,” Liu, an inactive Crimson news editor, said.
“There are a lot of different ways that CARE and SHARC could interact or CARE and DAPA could interact to create more of an intersectional curriculum,” she added.
DAPA educator Robin M. Robinson ’22 said she is likely to join the new program despite feeling a similar sense of loss to Liu.
“It’s kinda sad because each of the groups had their own personalities,” Robinson said. “You won’t see DAPA water bottles anymore, you won’t see SHARC shirts.”
“It took a long time for DAPA to be taken seriously by the undergrads, and I know a lot of people still don’t really know what SHARC is,” she said. “So it’s going to be interesting to see how this new group brands themselves and see how they do their community outreach.”
Some student educators like Liu and Robinson expressed uncertainty over whether normal peer education programming would continue during the 2020-2021 academic year — including wellness workshops led by CARE and DAPA each fall for first-year students. Still, Francesconi wrote that there will be no interruptions during the transition period.
“HUHS will work closely with students from our peer education groups throughout the fall and spring to shape this new group,” she wrote. “Until its launch, our peer education groups will continue to operate and provide support to the community.”

Harvard Law School will participate in the 2021-2022 Weil Legal Innovators Program, which will allow incoming students to defer their first year to complete a paid fellowship with a participating nonprofit, the school announced earlier this month.
Launched in 2019 by the law firm Weil, Gotshal, and Manges, the program aims to help students build professional skills and networks before law school and learn about the intersection of the public and private sectors. Accepted students will work on social and legal initiatives focusing on issues such as racial justice, humanitarian aid, or environmental conservation.
The Law School will now join Columbia Law School, Duke Law, Georgetown Law, Penn Law, and NYU Law as a WLI partner institution. Fellows will receive a $10,000 scholarship to their law school upon matriculation.
“We are thrilled to have Harvard Law School join our second year of the Weil Legal Innovators Program,” Weil Executive Partner Barry Wolf said in a press release. “HLS’s involvement will help expand the program’s reach to even more students who are interested in potential careers that span both the public and private sectors.”
Previous Weil Legal Innovators worked with organizations including Human Rights Watch, Innocence Project, Earthwatch Institute, Ashoka, Aspen Institute, Oxfam, and Tahirih Justice Center. Fellows also receive $50,000 in compensation, full health benefits, an interview for the Weil Summer Associate Program, and mentorship from a Weil, Gotshal, and Manges partner.
Assistant Dean of Admissions Kristi L. Jobson ’06 said in an interview that the WLI program aligns with the Law School’s mission to educate lawyers in a wide range of areas. She also noted the Law School values work experience in the admissions process.
“This was a bit of a no brainer for us,” Jobson said. “This is one of many steps we've taken in the past few years to broaden access to legal education, promote practical experience before matriculating at law school, and support students pursuing public interest work.”
The Law School began to actively prefer work experience in the 2010-2011 admission cycle before launching its Junior Deferral Program in 2014, which allows undergraduate juniors to apply with the condition they defer their admission for two years after graduation, per Jobson. JDP students will be eligible to apply for the WLI program.
“Having students who've had experience — in the private sector, public sector, service work, working internationally — come to Harvard Law School and bring the perspective they've gained from those professional experiences to the classroom and to the case law they're reviewing helps elevate the conversation in the classroom,” Jobson said.
The press release also noted that public service plays a significant role in the Law School curriculum. Law students are also required to perform 50 hours of pro bono work, though on average, members of the Class of 2020 performed more than twelve times that requirement.
The Law School previously established initiatives — such as its Low Income Protection Plan, Summer Public Interest Fund, and Public Interest Interview Fund — to support students interested in pursuing public service careers.
“The school, on the whole, has long supported public interest work,” Jobson said. “We've seen that some of the leading lawyers in the public interest have attended HLS and that's something we're very proud of.”

The Cambridge Police Department is investigating “deeply disturbing” social media activity allegedly linked to a lieutenant in the police force that appears to make light of police brutality.
The department launched its investigation Friday following a Cambridge Day news report that allegedly uncovered the private Twitter account of Cambridge Police lieutenant Shawn Lynch. The account — which carried the lieutenant’s name and the handle “@CPD496” — included a post that reacted to a news article about police brutality with a GIF of the actor Will Smith clapping and a post reacting to a tweet about the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wisc. with a GIF of the comedian Jerry Seinfield saying “That’s a shame.”
The account was deleted after Cambridge Day notified police of its presence.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in a Sunday email that the department swiftly launched an investigation into the social media posts after becoming aware of them.
“The Cambridge Police Department’s Professional Standards Unit has been directed to immediately commence a comprehensive staff investigation to determine if such statements were in fact made by the Officer and if the Officer violated any of the Department’s Codes of Conduct, Policies or Procedures,” Warnick wrote.
If true and found to violate the department’s policies, Warnick wrote that CPD will “seek to impose strict discipline against the officer.” Warnick would not share the details of the discipline, adding that the investigation remains in its initial phase.
This incident does not mark the first time CPD has come under fire for department members’ social media activity.
In May, Cambridge Police Superintendent Jack Albert inadvertently published a message on the department’s official Twitter account that called Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) a “jerk” and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) a “clown.” He subsequently apologized.
In his statement Sunday, Warnick acknowledged officers’ rights to freedom of expression unless such comments imperil the mission of the department.
“While the Department recognizes that employees have a right to free speech under the First Amendment, the Department will not tolerate statements that are inflammatory, discriminatory and/or disrespectful to any individuals, races or ethnicities that are linked in any way to an Officer’s employment as a Cambridge Police Officer,” Warnick wrote.
“Statements such as those alleged to have been made violate the public trust that the Department has rigorously taken pride in building, which can cause immeasurable damage to that trust, and they will not be tolerated,” he added. “It is imperative that the community can rely upon and have the utmost confidence in the commitment of all Cambridge Police Department Officers to provide the highest level of public safety services to all residents of Cambridge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at Harvard Medical School have discovered a new genetic link between a subtype of autism spectrum disorder and abnormal regulation of blood cholesterol levels.
Published in Nature Medicine last month, the research found that genetic mutations underlying dyslipidemia — a condition characterized by abnormal levels of lipids such as cholesterol — were present in 6.5 percent of children on the autism spectrum.
While certain hallmark subtypes of autism, such as those associated with epilepsy and Fragile X syndrome, have a genetic basis that is well understood, scientists “still don’t understand the cause of most cases in most children with autism,” according to Pediatrics Lecturer Alal Eran, a first author on the study.
“We know their autism has a very strong inherited component, but we don't understand what genes and what changes in these genes cause autism in most of these patients,” Eran said.
To help address that unknown, researchers sought to pinpoint genes which may be linked to ASD in patients, first poring over genetic data from children with autism and their relatives.
Nathan P. Palmer, a data scientist in the Medical School’s Department of Biomedical Informatics, said the researchers kept certain criteria in mind when looking for potentially relevant genes. Namely, they focused on genes which play a role in early brain development and may show different patterns of expression in males and females, since almost 80 percent of children on the autism spectrum are male, per Eran.
Ultimately, the researchers found that ASD patients and close relatives are more likely to carry mutations within certain genes which are known to regulate blood lipid metabolism. In order to confirm this pattern, they followed up by analyzing medical data from Boston’s Children Hospital and healthcare claims from a large U.S. insurer.
“Children with autism tend to have abnormal lipid levels in their blood that we can detect using routine blood tests, and looking at their medical records, they have a lot more mention of an explicit dyslipidemia diagnosis, meaning that there is some alteration in their blood lipid levels,” Eran said. “We also found that parents of children with autism tend to have more dyslipidemia diagnoses than parents of kids with other neurodevelopmental disorders.”
Eran said the discovery of a link between altered lipid regulation and a subtype of ASD may allow doctors to repurpose drugs approved for other purposes of modulating lipid levels to modify behavior and development in ASD patients. Still, she underscored that the research is still preliminary and will require further testing in animal models to confirm the link between autism and dyslipidemia before proceeding with human studies or developing targeted therapies.
“I don't want my statement to suggest that we think that patients should now take cholesterol modulating drugs, or anything like that,” Eran said.
Medical School Biomedical Informatics Chair Isaac S. Kohane, another first author on the study, wrote in an email that he felt especially gratified during the research process by messages of support he received from patients and their families who “recognized—before many clinicians did—that their children differed in systematic ways from other children.”

“They’ve had to find their own paths to therapies customized to the various comorbidities that characterize the different diseases that are lumped together under that single label of autism,” Kohane wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Undergraduate Council who met with the leaders of an independent review of the Harvard University Police Department said they worry the University will incrementally change, rather than transform, policing on campus.
The University launched the external review — led by law enforcement experts Brenda Bond and Ronald L. Davis — in June to supplement an existing internal review and search for a new chief to replace Francis D. “Bud” Riley, who is retiring at the end of a tumultuous year.
Noah Harris ’22 said that though most students in the listening session had had few direct experiences with campus police, the department has a poor reputation on campus.
“HUPD has a reputation for being bad news, and has a bad name in the Harvard community, at least among the students,” Harris said. “We all feel that we need a lot more transparency from HUPD as well, because when something bad does happen, they don't take accountability for it.”
Bond and Davis met with the Council’s executive committee on Sept. 4 – one of a series of meetings aimed at gathering opinions about Harvard’s police.
Jenny Y. Gan ’22 questioned whether the reviewers are speaking to the right stakeholders in those listening sessions, though she said she appreciated that they included Council members.
“It's not my discussion to have,” she said. “Not that I don't have a social responsibility, but it's the Black students on campus who are going to be affected, the students who have been victimized before by the police. Those are the ones that this group should be talking to.”
Gan said she hopes that the reviewers also speak with student activists and the homeless population in Harvard Square.
HUPD has come under periodic fire for its treatment of individuals experiencing homelessness, including earlier this year. Officer Anthony T. Carvello, for example, used what onlookers called excessive force against young, Black, homeless men on at least three separate occasions over the past year.
Carter H. Nakamoto ’21 said they share Gan’s concerns about the lack of representation of non-Harvard affiliates.
“For someone who is experiencing homelessness in Harvard Square, that's a person who will probably be much more affected by HUPD than I will, and has — to my knowledge — literally no recourse, literally no method of trying to secure accountability, to make changes, to this force that will really affect their lives, and potentially inflict violence upon them,” Nakamoto said. “That strikes me as something that is a priori untenable, and completely unethical.”
They added that non-affiliates have few pathways to express dissatisfaction with Harvard police.
“As a student, there's no democratic accountability for me over the people who will walk around campus with guns. That's already really bad,” Nakamoto added. “But I at least have access to this listening session where someone will hear my concerns and maybe or maybe not act on them.”
Jason A. Newton, a spokesperson for the University, wrote in an emailed statement that the reviewers are meeting with “various stakeholders across campus, representative of student, faculty, and staff populations, in addition to members of the HUPD department itself.”
So far, that includes the UC, the Harvard Graduate Council, the GSAS Student Council, faculty deans, proctors, tutors, RAs, and senior administrators, he wrote. He also said “quite a few activist groups” have submitted written comments, and that the reviewers will meet with members of the Harvard Coalition for Black Lives.
“While the list of their meetings is robust, and constantly evolving as they have more conversations, it obviously cannot be exhaustive,” he added. Newton also noted that all community members are welcome to email the reviewers written feedback.
Still, students who participated in the listening session also questioned the format and efficacy of the review.
Nakamoto said they think, by their very nature, listening sessions are “something that the University uses often in situations where we have not seen meaningful changes result from them.”
Harris also said he worries the “appearance of action can sometimes take the place of actual change.”
Newton wrote that the University is “committed to transparency with the recommendations within the report and implementation strategies.”
For Nakamoto, the fact that the external review is occurring simultaneously to the search for a new chief makes it “difficult to believe” that a true “reimagining” of HUPD is “actually on the mind of administrators.”
“That action is implicitly indicating that HUPD will continue to be — at least for a good stretch of the near future — a part of campus life,” they said.
Newton wrote that the recommendations that come from the external review will be released prior to the completion of the chief search, and that the external reviewers will meet with the search committee in the coming weeks.
“Given this timing, the report and recommendations that are the outcome of the review will help inform the search itself, and then will serve as a roadmap for both the incoming chief (once appointed) and senior leadership moving forward,” he wrote.
Despite what students view as its limitations, Gan said she is “optimistic” about the review.
“But I also find myself being realistic about Harvard,” she added. That means an expectation that the result of the review is “likely going to be more on the conservative side.”
Steven G. Catalano, a spokesperson for HUPD, declined to comment on the ongoing review but wrote in an email that HUPD is “committed to providing a safe and secure campus through quality policing and treats all persons with dignity and respect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Anthropology professor emeritus Gary Urton filed a retaliation complaint against a former graduate student on Aug. 31 for publicly sharing the preliminary findings of an investigation which found Urton abused his power by making a sexual advance towards her.
The Office for Dispute Resolution in late August determined that Urton violated multiple Harvard policies by propositioning then-graduate student Jade d'Alpoim Guedes to join him in a hotel room in 2012. Urton is facing allegations of sexual harassment — which were first reported by The Crimson in May — from multiple former students. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay placed him on administrative leave in June.
Guedes tweeted the concluding section of ODR’s draft final report on her allegations, which included the investigators’ findings, on Aug. 26.
In Urton’s complaint, which ODR sent to Guedes Sept. 9, he alleged Guedes violated confidentiality rules and retaliated against him by sharing the preliminary results of the investigation.
The confidentiality clause in ODR’s investigative procedures does not explicitly prohibit a participant in an ODR investigation from sharing information they learn during the proceedings, but it notes that doing so opens up that party to a retaliation complaint.
“Retaliation can take many forms, including the dissemination of information in a manner intended to pressure or shame participants and witnesses in connection with the ODR process (such as, through social media) or to discourage participants or witnesses from assisting with that process,” a Frequently Asked Questions pamphlet about the ODR procedures reads.
Urton declined to comment on the specifics of his ODR complaint.
“I will simply state that ODR has a policy of confidentiality for a reason and I believe it should be adhered to,” Urton wrote in an email.
The FAS accepted Urton’s retaliation complaint and forwarded it to ODR to begin an investigation, according to a letter ODR sent to Guedes Sept. 9. ODR will conduct an investigation separate from the one into Guedes’s original complaint and issue findings of fact that it will forward to the FAS.
If ODR substantiates Urton’s allegations, Gay or her designee could decide to sanction Guedes. It is unclear, however, what sanctions the FAS could levy against Guedes, who graduated from the University in 2013 and now holds a tenured professorship at the University of California, San Diego.
In a response to ODR Thursday, Guedes wrote that her tweet did not constitute retaliation and that Urton’s complaint amounts to an attempt to silence her.
“Mr. Urton seeks to intimidate, further harass, and retaliate against me for stating facts about his inappropriate conduct toward me,” Guedes wrote in the response, which she shared with The Crimson. “Asking for my silence after a decision is made on an already public case infringes on my first amendment rights.”
“In now accusing me of retaliation for sharing my experiences after the formal investigation had concluded, Mr. Urton has grossly distorted, and it seems, weaponized an anti-retaliation policy clearly intended to protect victims and witnesses from this very type of retribution from the accused,” she added.
Guedes wrote that Harvard’s decision to accept the complaint could have a chilling effect on complainants, especially those who still attend the University and could be subject to sanctions.
“I am surprised you accepted his complaint,” Guedes wrote. “In doing so, Harvard is sending a very clear (and quite chilling) message to would-be reporters, that Harvard will not protect them from intimidation and harassment by those they accuse.”
Guedes wrote that the policy should be interpreted “in the spirit of the law with which it was intended” — to protect complainants from harassment by the accused party.
“Such provisions are not designed to help protect the confidentiality of the accused and do not apply after the accused is found to be at fault as Dr. Urton was,” she wrote. “My tweet which shared the conclusion of the decision constitutes the sharing of a fact and it is difficult for me to understand on what grounds this could possibly be construed as retaliation.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment.
The ODR procedures’ confidentiality policy, which includes the anti-retaliation provision, has drawn criticism before from those considering filing a Title IX complaint.
In 2018, 15 women who accused former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual harassment sent a letter to then-FAS Dean Michael Smith stating they would not participate in an ODR investigation into Dominguez unless the office changed its procedures. Their seven demands included a guarantee that the University would not investigate retaliation complaints against those who shared information unveiled in the investigation.
As in Guedes’s case against Urton, media outlets had already publicly reported details about some of the complaints against Dominguez, and the women argued in their letter that sharing findings that were “part of a public discourse” would not constitute retaliation.
Administrators ultimately declined to alter the ODR procedures to meet the women’s demands. In an April 2018 response to the 15 signatories, which was obtained by The Crimson this month, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote that the anti-retaliation provision of the ODR procedures is “essential to the fairness of the process to everyone involved.”
“A person who has experienced sexual harassment may elect not to participate in a process — and to leave a problematic situation unaddressed — if any statement they make might then be shared publicly by the respondent,” Garber wrote.
Garber added that if the confidentiality provision was not in place, both witnesses and respondents — ODR’s term for those accused of sexual misconduct — might be discouraged from participating in the process.
Suzanna E. Challen, a former Government Ph.D. student and one of the 2018 letter’s signatories, wrote in an email that Urton’s retaliation complaint against Guedes illustrates why she chose not to participate in the ODR investigation into Dominguez.
“By keeping these processes private, there is no accountability,” Challen wrote. “No one knows if allegations are properly handled and if sanctions are appropriate, or even if sanctions are issued at all.”
“I did not file a complaint with ODR because privacy does not protect students, it protects the predator,” she added.
Challen wrote that Guedes’s case echoes her own.
“I am appalled that, after our years of advocacy, Harvard is still resorting to the same old tactics—this time turning ‘retaliation’ on its head again, to protect the alleged abuser, instead of the victims,” she wrote. “How many victims is it going to take before Harvard values its future over its past?”
Clarification: September 14, 2020
This article has been updated to clarify that Jade d'Alpoim Guedes shared a draft, not final, report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and six other local colleges and universities opposed a bill that would legalize college sports betting in a Friday letter to Massachusetts state legislators.
The presidents and athletic directors of Boston College, Boston University, the College of the Holy Cross, Merrimack College, Northeastern University, the University of Massachusetts, and Harvard University signed onto the letter, which was addressed to Massachusetts Senate President Karen E. Spilka, Speaker of the House Robert A. DeLeo, Senator Michael J. Rodrigues, Senator Eric P. Lesser ’07, Senator Patrick M. O’Connor, Representative Ann-Margaret Ferrante, Representative Aaron Michlewitz, and Representative Donald H. Wong.
The signatories of the letter, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott, expressed their opposition to a provision in House Bill 4887 — a bill introduced to spur economic development in the Commonwealth — that seeks to legalize sports betting, including on college athletics competitions. The House of Representatives voted in favor of the provision in late July, though the Senate voted against amendments that would have included the provision in the legislation.
“Based on our years of experience, each of us believes that such legislation will create unnecessary and unacceptable risks to student athletes, their campus peers, and the integrity and culture of colleges and universities in the Commonwealth,” the letter reads.
University administrators laid out their opposition to legalized college betting on the grounds that it could compromise the integrity of student-athlete competition, promote unhealthy and financially risky habits among students, and deplete limited university resources.
“Easy access to placing bets can lead to bad decisions and even addictive behavior in regard to making wagers on ‘big games,’ creating mental health and financial problems for students and their families,” the letter reads.
Legalized gambling could impose pressure on student-athletes to sway game outcomes, the letter cautions.
“Student athletes could be persuaded that agreeing to limit scoring or committing an ‘unforced’ error would not really matter,” they wrote. “But doing so clearly harms personal and institutional values, has no place in college sports, and, as history shows, often leads to more corrupt and unethical actions.”
Gambling on college sports could also incentivize students to share information regarding their classmates who are varsity athletes — including their health and playing status — with gamblers who would benefit from such knowledge, according to the letter.
They wrote that, on an institutional level, the legalization of gambling in college sports would financially strain university resources as schools enforce athletics policies. They added university leaders would have to “devote more scarce time and resources to protecting the brand, values, image, and reputation of their schools.”
“We recognize that during the current difficult economic climate, the Legislature desires to develop new sources of revenue, including sports wagering,” the letter concludes. “But like other states, Massachusetts can gain those benefits without legalizing college sports betting. Such a limitation is necessary to safeguard the longstanding distinctive role and contribution of student-athletes as well as to preserve the integrity of intercollegiate athletics in the Commonwealth.”

Eighty-eight students declared their candidacy for 44 seats available on Harvard’s Undergraduate Council, according to a list announced by the UC Election Commission in a Sunday email.
This year’s field of candidates grew somewhat over last year’s, which drew 73 candidates.
The numbers of both upperclassmen and freshmen announcing their candidacies increased over last year but, in line with previous trends, far more freshmen are running for spots than upperclassmen. This year, 53 freshmen announced campaigns, compared to 35 upperclassmen.
The freshman candidates are competing for 12 reserved spots on the Council, making this a particularly competitive semester. Last year only 34 first-years ran for a seat, and in the case of Elm Yard, it was a non-competitive race. Now, every Yard is competitive, with at least ten candidates in each Yard competing for the three available spots.
Elections will not be competitive in the following Houses: Dunster, Adams, Eliot, Mather, Cabot, Pforzheimer, Winthrop, and Dudley. Mather, Cabot, and Winthrop have fewer candidates than available seats, which means there will be some vacancies on the Council this semester.
Lowell will be the most competitive House this election, with seven students competing for three seats.
There are also some former UC representatives who left the Council and are now running for a seat, such as former Lowell House representative Samyra C. Miller ’21.
“I thought that it was a good time for me to once again try to come back to the Council,” Miller said. She mentioned the “plethora of student voices” that she has access to, as Miller runs an Instagram account with a large following of Harvard students and will be doing a podcast with The Crimson called The Harvard Communitea.
Campaigning began at 12 p.m. EST on Sunday. Voting will open on Tuesday and both voting and campaigning periods will end on Thursday at midnight.
This year’s Election Commission’s rules handbook states that candidates must follow social distancing guidelines in the midst of the pandemic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences has adopted new interim policies on sexual and gender-based harassment to comply with the U.S. Department of Education’s new Title IX regulations, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced in a Monday morning email to FAS affiliates.
Gay plans to form a committee “in the coming weeks” to review FAS’s policy and work towards developing a long-term version, she wrote in the email. The group will collect input from the FAS affiliates on the topic.
The Department of Education released its new, long-awaited Title IX changes in May. Among other updates, the new Title IX rule narrowed the definition of sexual misconduct to “unwelcome conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive”; previous Obama-era guidance defined sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that includes “requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”
In August, the University adopted two interim policies to address sexual harassment and misconduct in response to the federal changes — one to hew to the new federal guidelines, and the other to address behavior that falls outside those guidelines’ jurisdiction. Conduct prohibited under the University’s previous policy will continue to be prohibited under the two new interim policies.
Under both policies, formal complaints are first investigated by the Office of Dispute Resolution. However, under the Interim Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy complaints will additionally proceed to a hearing panel composed of trained experts in and outside Harvard.
Both policies share the same definition of consent as voluntary agreement that may be communicated verbally or by actions, use the preponderance of evidence standard, prohibit retaliation, and require responsible employees to share information with a Title IX official upon learning of concerns of sexual harassment or misconduct.
As was the case before the federal rollout, the FAS will both adhere to the new University policies and supplement them with its own interim policy, designed “to suit the Faculty’s needs and goals,” according to Gay.
The FAS’s former policies spanned 37 pages in length, detailing specific procedures for filing, investigating, and resolving sexual misconduct complaints, depending on whether they are against students, faculty, or staff. The FAS’s new interim policies, meanwhile, are condensed to 11 pages, deferring to University policies in the cases of allegations against faculty and staff while continuing to involve the Administrative Board in the case of allegations against students.
“Having these interim policies in place affords us the time to undertake a more deliberate and collaborative approach to developing a new, longer-term FAS policy,” Gay wrote.

It’s your first class of the semester, and the professor begins to run through the course expectations: camera on, stay muted unless speaking, participate in breakout rooms. You may be thinking that maybe this whole online class thing won’t be so bad: there are plenty of positives, such as watching pre-recorded labs without having to dump your mostly-full iced coffee at the door. That is, until your professor casually adds, “and no eating in class.” Well, Flyby is here to save you from your 9 a.m. – 2:45 p.m. Mondays with some snack ideas that we think you can pull off eating in class.
Bite-sized >> Fork and Knife
If you’re looking for a full meal, we recommend staying away from foods that require a utensil or take multiple bites to finish. Think more along the lines of poppable treats like wontons, bagel bites, or chicken nuggies. Skip the sauce to minimize any risk of spillage, and make sure to use a napkin between bites to avoid getting oil stains on your laptop. If the Trader Joe’s freezer aisle isn’t really your thing, you can also opt for small classic snacks like trail mix, grapes, crackers spread with peanut butter, berries, or dried cereal. Load these bad boys into your hand off-screen, then disguise the action of popping them straight into your mouth as a face scratch or cough cover.
Anything in a Cup
Bringing a cup to class is universally accepted and thus the perfect loophole to the “no eating” rule. Whip up a hearty banana-peanut butter or kale-apple smoothie and sip the day away. If you’re really scared of your professor, you can even put those bite-sized foods in a cup and tip your head back for a long swig each time you get hungry. We’ve never truly appreciated the shielding power of this dishware until now, so be creative about what you put in that cup — although our official stance is to abide by the Code of Conduct even during a Thursday evening class.
Full Send 
If you’re in a hundred person lecture and are willing to play the odds that your face isn’t in the first grid, we recommend a full send. We’re talking a full meal of all the things you’ve never been able to eat around other people. Crunch away on pita chips and baby carrots. Chew on ice if that’s your thing! Unwrap noisy tinfoil leftovers without your classmate’s judgey side-eye. We’ve all been momentarily stunned when someone nearby opened up their tuna fish and boiled egg combo from FlyBy — now you can try it for yourself without the fear of public shame. And hey, if garlic really is the cure for all diseases like your grandma has been telling you since you were little, it’s not like worrying you’ll run into your d-hall crush is going to get in your way anymore. With a little bit of finesse and a few well-timed ducks to pick up your pencil, you can squeeze in a whole meal without disturbing any of your classmates.
Staying focused during Zoom school is going to be tough, but snacking is a mostly harmless way to keep your mind sharp. Just be on the lookout for any general reminders from your TF that eating in class is strongly discouraged — that’s graduate school speak for “*cough cough* you there eating, stop eating.”

Let’s be real, at this point Harvard feels more like a vague concept than an ~actual real place~, and we have no idea what’s going on 80 percent of the time. With students scattered all across the world, clubs left on their own to figure out what virtual programming even means, and a seemingly endless list of deadlines and Zoom calls from the College, the information is endless and our inbox (or mine at least) is already at 15,000 unread messages and counting.
The confusion may be constant, but Flyby sat down with Samyra C. Miller ’21, our favorite go-to news source (sorry News Board), to spill the tea and tell us how she keeps us all informed and, of course, entertained.
RR: Of course, we have to start with: how does it feel to basically be holding this entire institution on your shoulders with one Instagram story? 
SM: Have you seen Riverdale? It feels like I’m one of Archie, Jughead, Bettie, or Veronica who solve all the town’s problems, even though they have all the resources they need to solve the problem, but it seems like only these little children can do the solving. I don’t know which one though — definitely don’t want to be Archie. Kinda hate Archie.
RR: So how did this all actually start? Did you plan to make it a regular thing or did it just happen naturally? 
SM: So, I think that I’m petty. When I first started going on rants or posting things that people would respond to that I would then post, it was around my sophomore fall. At first, I was just dragging these orgs that everyone else was afraid to drag, then other people had stuff to say, so I started posting what they had to say about these orgs too. Any of the bad “-ists” or “-isms”... shut it down. I think the summer between my sophomore and junior year, I was doing a lot of posting conversations about stuff and doing polls, and that was really when people started taking a liking to it a lot more.
RR: Did you anticipate it becoming as well-known as it is today?
SM: In life, in general, I don’t like to have high expectations for anything. But I definitely didn’t intend or expect anything to come out of me just either airing people out or spilling some tea or getting other people’s opinions. It was never me like, sitting down at my desk and being like “How will I plan to do this?”
RR: Have you ever talked to admin about your Instagram? Like are they aware of how much students rely on you spreading info?
SM: They’re very happy that students are getting this information — though sometimes they’re like “I wish students would just read their emails.” Like people think I’m the ~knower of all things Harvard~, that I just know stuff, but half the time I just read the emails they send! And then I post the info from the emails. From admin, they have been trying to find a way to centralize things, and I think that they see my Instagram being that place of centralized information, which I think they appreciate, but wish that it could have been a more University-affiliated centralized way. But I know that they see it — some of them follow me, some of them respond to my stories, some of them contribute — some are even the anonymous people that y’all are engaging with and have no clue.
RR: Do you have a favorite discussion you’ve had on your account?
SM: This wasn’t really an actual “discussion,” but the Corona Confessions were so funny. I’m sitting here and I see everything. But the stuff people were telling me… I know so much stuff about so many people from Corona Confessions! For more impactful discussions, I think when we had that talk about colorism, I think a lot of people learned a lot. Any time we talk about final clubs, people always go off but there’s good discourse on either side. Or when Harvard’s decision came out for the spring, that was crazy. The only reason why I went live was because my DMs were blowing up so much… that I just had to go on live and let people talk.
RR: What do you do to de-stress, both in general and especially with social media?
SM: I’ve been doing some singing, watching Netflix (recently I’ve been watching Selling Sunset), talking to friends… I love candles, so sometimes I’ll just light a candle and go on websites to shop for clothes that I’ll literally never buy… kinda therapeutic.
RR: Do you have ideas on how to actually make info more accessible to students?
SM: I think if Harvard got their socials popping, if Harvard got their Twitter popping… any very public, very modern place that students are checking into that isn’t like, “Download the Omni app.” Instead of telling students to meet you somewhere, you need to go meet the students somewhere. Get a little more on Twitter, little more on Instagram, just make it a little more fun and engaging for students instead of just “Here are the deadlines for the week.” If Dean Khurana got on TikTok... Dean Khurana, I need you to get a TikTok, or Instagram Reels. I challenge Dean Khurana, I challenge Dean O’Dair, I challenge John from Annenberg. We would pay attention! Come into our world, we’re not coming to yours. We’re not going to Omni.
RR: Any plans for how you’ll keep this going after you graduate?
SM: So people have DMed me asking, “How are you going to make sure this info is still available when you graduate?” I don’t know! Someone was like “You need to pass the torch” — if anybody wants to do it, be my guest! Alternatively, Harvard could just get popping on Twitter. They just have to make some engaging content, and it’d be crazy! But I’m also down to pass the torch (or the little tea cup).
RR: Best advice you would give first years or other seniors in your year?
SM: Never make permanent decisions for temporary feelings. That’s the first one, which goes for anybody. For first years, I would say to just do what you want. When I came to Harvard, I did whatever I wanted. I used to go scream at the top of the balcony in Annenberg, I used to blast music in the dining hall, just do what you want and be yourself unapologetically. Don’t try to come here and *sssssssss* slither. You don’t have to be one like that. Just be who you want to be and not who someone thinks you should be. That might be cliche, but everything’s cliche for a reason — because it’s correct!
RR: Is there anything else you want other students to know about your account? 
SM: What I do isn’t able to be done without people sending me stuff. It’s one thing for me to post stuff, but most of the information I post is from other people. Sure, I am the one posting it and holding the space, but y’all are the ones who contribute to that space! It’s not all on me, everybody does their part. This is a group effort!
