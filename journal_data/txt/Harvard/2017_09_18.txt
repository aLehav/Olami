After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The start of a new semester is inevitably accompanied by tweaks and adjustments to the previous years’ class offerings and logistics, with instructors constantly in search of an improved student experience and increased Q scores. We have already commented on the positive changes implemented this year by the always-restive Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I”.
They are not, however, the only class to have updated their policies. This semester, the infamous pre-medical class Chemistry 17: “Principles of Organic Chemistry” will no longer grade its students’ problem sets on a point basis, but instead award checks, check pluses, and check minuses as grades.
At first glance, this move will help to decrease students’ stress in completing weekly assignments. There will be no immediate incentive for them to aspire to perfectionism in their problem sets to gain an edge over other students. Any drop in stress is a welcome and beneficial change for Harvard undergraduates, especially for pre-med students who already have more than their fair share of stress.
This tweak, aside from easing the weekly demands of Chemistry 17, may also serve a pedagogical purpose. The instructor of the class, Chemistry professor Eric N. Jacobsen, has mentioned that students were “more concerned about getting the answers 'right' than with taking the time to understand the underlying concepts.” The flexibility of the new grading scheme will therefore empower students to concentrate on their comprehension of the material—the crux of education at a liberal arts college such as Harvard.
This new plan, however, is not without potential pitfalls. For one, the fact that homework will no longer be graded will place greater weight on students’ midterm exams, which can be hit-or-miss. Nevertheless, pre-med students are no strangers to high-stakes exams, having to take the grueling MCAT.
There is also the potential danger of laziness associated with problem sets that are not graded. Students may not feel motivated to try their best on these assignments if they will not receive a grade on them. Though we very much hope that students will put their best foot forward, despite the diminished incentive, we also believe that the class staff ought to remain vigilant and ensure that students are actively engaging with and comprehending the material.
On the whole, we are optimistic that this new policy will improve student experiences in Chemistry 17 and help to set an example for other classes. In the future, perhaps students across all concentrations and interests will be able to reap the benefits of an improved approach to grading.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, I never would have imagined being homesick for Harvard. But I sorely missed being at Harvard during this break, amazing as my summer escapades were. I could not wait to see my friends, teammates, and the delightful Brutalist walls of Mather House. I missed the intimacy of an impromptu heart-to-heart with a roommate and the excitement of a meaningful philosophical exchange in the most unexpected of places.
I did not miss collegiate protest culture. Protests and activism, both fortunately and unfortunately, are necessarily adversarial. We must advocate for or against something, and one’s gains are made from another’s losses. We must set ourselves against both our peers and others we don’t know. We know that everyone will never truly be satisfied even if effective compromise can be reached.
For instance, the agenda of the Women’s March and the agenda of the March for Life cannot both prevail. As Women’s March organizers made abundantly clear, pro-life women were not to be included in this unified, inclusive national effort. In a darker parallel, the goals of neo-Nazi scum in Charlottesville and their counter-protestors cannot both prevail. (Hopefully there’s no debate over which agenda should be left on the ash heap of history.)
But it is something quite miraculous that every ideological shade under the sun draws from the same set of civil rights to protest. Conservatives frequently roll their eyes and grumble about the latest outrage fad, but we would do well to remember that we borrow from the same constitutional tradition in our advocacy in the likes of the March for Life and Tea Party movement. The constitutional rights to gather peacefully and speak are granted to all Americans, and every political persuasion has exercised these rights.
The adversarial nature of protest, though, often obscures genuine empathy and understanding from many sides. The protests over the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are particularly demonstrative of this foggy tragedy. These protestors are rightfully concerned about the future of close friends and family, and belying their external outrage seems to be real compassion.
There are also reasonable voices calling for responsible stewardship of national legislative processes. Indeed, these voices may seem to dismiss outright the hopes and dreams of DACA beneficiaries. But what many of these people see in DREAMers is that America remains the world’s best hope for opportunity, and there is a real desire from both sides of the aisle to continue to make this so.
Many believe that Congressional legislation is a better legal route to this goal and that President Trump was right to deliver lawmakers an ultimatum. That doesn’t mean that such people are deaf, dumb, and blind to the struggles of the over 700,000 individuals whose futures in the United States seem to be in jeopardy. But the nature of protest shrouds this reality in a cloud of conflict, anger, and division. We must be willing to peer through the fog a little more to understand what really motivates protest and not just examine the protest itself. We might just find some common ground in American values.
Protest’s frequent role as an integral facet of our American society points to a population that cares deeply about progress and the correction of perceived injustices. Do I believe that progress often has a price? Yes. Do I believe that certain causes are worthier than others, and certain methods more effective? Yes. But I see every day that Americans of all kinds are not complacent about the upkeep of their civil society, and on balance, I believe that is a good thing.
I’ll end on a word of caution, though. Protest’s natural bedfellow is politics, and as I’ve written before, I believe that politics is hardly a path to personal fulfillment. I’d much prefer the company of a good friend in the bleak walls of Mather House than the solicitations of a snake on Capitol Hill. After all, what good would it be to devote myself to protest and advocacy if I did not first devote myself to my friends and comrades?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent months, there has been a great deal of talk across this country and on this campus about free speech. Conservatives in particular have been quick to defend voices like Charles A. Murray ’65 in order to protect the values of free speech from the onslaught of campus liberalism. While there are indeed many issues with the groupthink that can often arise on a campus as liberal as ours, I find it ironic that many conservatives have not been more defensive lately on another issue that merits much more (and substantive) discussion as of late.
I speak, of course, of Chelsea Manning’s dismissal from the Institute of Politics as a Visiting Fellow for this term. Upon her appointment on Thursday, hell has been wrought on the Institute of Politics. Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo refused to show up to a scheduled event, citing his vehement disagreement. In addition, a senior IOP Fellow resigned, and prominent Republicans condemned Manning’s appointment. The Institute of Politics gave in to a political wing that ironically condemns the illiberalism of cancelling free speech and disinviting speakers.
This is not an article about whether or not Manning was a traitor or not—she of course pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges, including espionage. What this is about is the right to free speech. Instead of standing up for their decision and following through with the principles they acted upon by appointing Manning, the IOP has caved to ideological pressure. If they truly cared about presenting Manning’s message to the world, they would have stood by the appointment. Ultimately, the IOP has shown us that voices can be silenced if they don’t fit with a dominating ideological agenda.
In a statement, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote that while Manning could potentially be invited to speak at the Forum in future, the Visiting Fellow title is viewed by many as an “honorific,” and therefore was perhaps not an appropriate decision to give to someone as controversial as her. But Sean Spicer, a man who damaged national discourse extensively during his role in the West Wing, was announced as a Fellow the same day as Manning. While I do not wish to conflate the actions of the two, how much more deserving of this “honor” is Spicer than Manning?
It is a shame that Manning will not be able to share her experiences with the Harvard student body in a capacity as a fellow. She is perhaps the most substantive high-profile speaker the IOP could have had this term.
One way in which ideology has obfuscated this debate is through identity politics. I strongly disagree with Manning’s decision to turn this into an issue of her gender identity. In a tweet released last Friday, Manning implied she was being disinvited for being a trans woman, and that her “marginalized voice” was being suppressed. This is ludicrous. It is undeniable that the Trump administration has taken a disgusting and reprehensible approach to transgender individuals. But both Pompeo’s and the Kennedy School’s statements specifically disavowed any suggestion of discrimination on the basis of her trans status. If one were to replace the name Chelsea Manning with Edward Snowden, the same actions would likely have happened.
Manning was disinvited because of a backlash against her actions of espionage, which were significant (however one looks at it). But by not acknowledging that this was the reason why she was disinvited, she has precluded a conversation on campus about the worthiness of her free speech. Manning has simplified a complex topic and fit it into the completely inadequate boxes of identity. This is upsetting, because it erroneously simplifies the issues that should be discussed: freedom, liberty and government accountability, which all of us—whether we are on the right or left—should care about.
The only statement that correctly discusses the gravitas of the issue is that of the Harvard Libertarians, who stated, and rightly:
“We are profoundly disappointed in the IOP’s decision...Harvard’s Latin motto—Veritas—means truth. Chelsea Manning’s only alleged crime was telling the American public the truth about the undeclared, unconstitutional wars that their government never allowed them to vote upon.”
Although I am not a libertarian, I believe Manning’s controversial actions deserve to be discussed, justified, and cross-examined in a space as important as the IOP. It would have gone a long way towards examining crucial questions of justice, privacy, security, and, of course, free speech. But these issues are not being discussed in the wake of Manning’s dismissal.
All that seems to matter for many liberals is her trans status, and all that seems to matter for many conservatives is her divulging of state secrets. And this is a problem. Because as the left and the right drift ever apart, we lose sight of what issues that matter really mean. This debacle is only one example of how political identifiers change to reflect personal ones, and vice versa.
This school’s motto is Veritas, and increasingly we find ourselves shrinking away from it into the comfort of our own worldviews and ideologies. We must gain the power to accept that others have viewpoints apart from our own. We must recognize that if the Republican establishment is slow to condemn neo-Nazis but quick to criticize Chelsea Manning, they do not believe in free speech. We must agree that if Charles Murray is allowed to speak at Harvard, Chelsea Manning should be allowed to be an IOP Fellow.
Otherwise, we have given up on Veritas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: My U.S. citizenship grants me privileges. It allows me to travel from the United States to El Salvador with relative ease. I have to pay $10 for a tourist card, because although I travel there every two years and and have dozens of relatives in the country, it’s not considered my “legal” home. When I visit my Abuela Carmen, whose home sits between tropical trees and gleaming green leaves, I tell her that I’ll see her soon. And because international mobility is not treated as the human right it should be, telling Abuela that I’ll see her again is a privilege.
Last week, I bought a book of poetry by Javier Zamora, a Salvadoran-American poet who crossed the Mexico-U.S. border at nine years old. In the opening poem, Letter to Abuelita Nelli, he writes, “I can’t go back and return. There’s no path to papers. I’ve got nothing left but dreams.” The ability to cross borders is a privilege afforded by the trivial circumstances of my birth.
Zoe: I was once told that people usually become involved in the immigrant rights movement because of some personal connection. If they aren’t undocumented themselves, they have a parent, a sibling, a close friend, a bond formed in blood that inspired the call to action, the resolve to fight. Most citizens never experience that call. Instead they exist in a bubble of ignorant privilege—or, worse, they stand on a platform of bigotry where their privilege is the snake woven through every word that seeks to strip others of their humanity.
Some people straddle these extremes, neither completely bigoted nor ignorant. These citizens’ use a definition of allyship that includes the constant reassurance that the world sees them as being a “good” person for going “out of their way” to help those who are “more vulnerable” than them. They sleep well with the knowledge their conscious is squeaky-clean, and, at organizing meetings, they can be heard with a voice that never stops to listen to the very people it supposedly serves. I strive to never be that type of “ally,” which so many people fail to see themselves becoming.
R: Undocumented students—who’ve made their lives here, who’ve fled violence, whose parents have been exploited, whose human rights have been violated—want allies. But to be an ally means more than simply saying you support them, or DACA, or rhetoric that humanizes them while criminalizing their parents. It means using your privileges, those granted by a piece of paper or a gold and blue booklet, to defend them.
Imagine a future when things get even more dire and ICE comes knocking in Cambridge. La migra targets Harvard—maybe for its name, perhaps to make a point—and looks to arrest members of our community. Undocumented students and their families take refuge in Memorial Church, which has promised to be a sanctuary, but ICE insists on discarding people’s humanity to make a political point.
If they try knocking those doors down and forcibly ripping people from the country that is their home, those of us with privilege, with papers and passports, must take action. We have to be willing to get arrested protecting our peers. Wield the privilege we’ve done nothing substantial to deserve to protect the undocumented Americans around us.
Allyship is not simply about hollow promises, Facebook statuses, or newspaper articles. It’s about putting your bodies on the frontlines, getting convicted, serving time, all while knowing that you will be treated with a level of dignity. You will not be forced to leave the only land that has ever felt like home. Allies are cowards if they aren’t willing to risk just a sliver of what undocumented activists risk everyday to defend their humanity.
Z: It is wrong that some of my closest friends live with a constant underlying stress and anxiety rooted in an uncertainty of the future. Numbers have nothing on the power of their voices projecting across the Yard, across the nation. Their narratives are what so many people can’t even begin to fathom. Being an ally means putting yourself out there, not because you want to have a clean conscience or be able to say that you dabbled in advocacy as an undergrad, but because it’s the right thing to do.
There are 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, guilty of nothing more than wanting to achieve the American Dream that Congress continues to prevent from being their reality. They exist and persevere against a government that never allows them to forget their status. It’s time for citizens to wake up and realize the privilege that citizenship and being in a family of citizens provides. It’s time to act, because undocumented immigrants don’t deserve to be in the shadows ever again.

Despite rainy weather, crowds of Harvard Law School students, staff, faculty, alumni, and their families gathered in Jarvis Field Friday night for an event recognizing the school’s contributions to the arts as part of its bicentennial celebrations.
The event, called “HLS in the Arts,” spanned two days and is one of the first in year-long series to celebrate the Law School’s 200th birthday. The programming kicked off earlier this month with a talk on the Law School’s history and the unveiling of a memorial honoring slaves of the family that endowed the Law School’s first chair back in the nineteenth century.
The weekend's string of performances began with a set from the HLS Drama Society, which puts on the school’s Parody show each year, and was followed by alumni and professor performances ranging from classical piano to Scottish violin. The school also celebrated its storied place in pop culture history with a video compilation of movie and TV references—including popular films “Legally Blonde” and “Paper Chase”—to the Law School.
On Saturday, following a day full of performances and exhibitions, the school screened a pre-release screening of the documentary “The Soundtrack of Our Lives,” about Law School alumnus and record producer Clive Davis, who also served as the honorary chair of the weekend’s festivities.
Richard J. Lazarus, a Law School professor and the faculty chair of the bicentennial planning committee, said that this year’s celebrations have been in the works since as early as 2014, when he began meeting with faculty, staff, and students to brainstorm ideas for how best to commemorate this milestone in the school’s history.
His said his intention was for the school to spend the year recalling its own achievements, but instead actively showing what makes it so “iconic.”
“We knew we didn’t want one event. We also knew that we didn’t want it to be sort of an event which said ‘Harvard Law School is great, and all we’re going to talk about for a year is how great Harvard Law School is,’” Lazarus said. “The basic idea was that we would in a sense show Harvard’s greatness, if it’s great, by what we did, rather than by talking about it.”
Lazarus said the event was for students to enjoy, but added it was equally important for the school’s staff, who were both attending and performing over the source of the weekend.
“Students come and go, but the staff don’t,” Lazarus said. “We have some very, very gifted professional, musicians on the staff, too.”
The events of the bicentennial will continue throughout the year, with its centerpiece event—The October Summit, a conference on contemporary legal issues—happening next month.

Reflecting on the white supremacist rally that racked Charlottesville, Va. last month, Amanda Gorman ’20—the country’s inaugural National Youth Poet Laureate—recited her poem “In This Place (An American Lyric)” in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 13.
A sophomore in Leverett House and Los Angeles, Calif. native, Gorman was named the nation’s premier young poet in April. In Washington this month, she spoke alongside National Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith, addressing issues of racial inequality in America.
“Social and economic inequality are always at the forefront of my work. With some new pieces I'm writing, I'm hoping to address the tumultuous climate in the US at the moment, as well as the need for a continued conversation on power and privilege,” Gorman wrote in an email.
Gorman, who previously served as Inaugural Youth Poet Laureate of the West and has published a poetry book, cited Toni Morrison and Yusef Komunyakaa as two of her artistic influences.
“There's a chant I say to myself whenever I am about to perform: ‘I'm the daughter of black writers, we are descended from freedom fighters, who broke chains and changed the world.’ It's a reminder of the shoulders I stand on,” she said.
Still, Gorman said, balancing her duties as Youth Poet Laureate with her Harvard course load isn’t always easy.
“Balancing school work at a rigorous school like Harvard while traveling as Youth Poet Laureate can be difficult—let alone keeping up a healthy social life and self-care,” she wrote. “I find it's about prioritizing who I want to affect with my title, and prioritizing the people I want to use my limited time with: family and friends who uplift me.”
Gorman said Harvard is an inspiring place to continue her work as National Youth Poet Laureate.
“It's so fantastic to be in an area with deep roots in poetry,” she wrote. “From Elizabeth Bishop, to Jorie Graham, to Tracy K. Smith, our country's best poets, especially women, have touched this city, and every day I'm inspired to try to walk in their footsteps.”

A year after Harvard’s endowment dropped nearly $2 billion in value, three of the University’s peer institutions have already posted double-digit returns for fiscal year 2017—which, experts say, may portend growth for Harvard.
Dartmouth College yielded 14.6 percent on its investments, a marked improvement over the negative 1.9 percent it posted in fiscal year 2016. Down Mass Ave., MIT reported 14.3 percent returns. And across the country, the University of California system returned 15.1 percent, bringing its endowment to $10.8 billion.
These strong returns at other large endowments could bode well for the world’s largest educational endowment, which has for years seen its performance outpaced across the Ivy League. 
“If they still were carrying a reasonable stock of public equities, then they might have pretty good results, somewhere between 12-15 percent,” Charles A. Skorina, a financial headhunter, projected.
Harvard needs the boost. After Harvard Management Company posted negative 2.0 percent on its portfolio in fiscal year 2016—and, combined with other financial flows, lost nearly $2 billion in endowment value—University President Drew G. Faust said budgets would be constrained across the University.
Those worries haven’t abated over the past year. In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-ran publication, Faust said weak endowment returns—coupled with the possibility of deep cuts to federal research funding—remain a threat to the University’s financial health.
“There’s general agreement across higher education that endowment returns are likely to be more constrained in the decade to come than they were, for example, in the early 2000s before the financial crisis,” she said. “We have to be imaginative about what we do, how we do it, how we make choices, and also about other ways of generating resources,” she continued.
Dartmouth attributed its high returns to the “broad rise in public markets” domestically and abroad. MIT and the University of California noted, though, that market trends can be difficult to predict: “The world has become more uncertain and financial markets more volatile,” MIT’s treasurer wrote in the university’s annual report.
Skorina predicted public markets will continue to flourish so long as companies and investors believe Republican lawmakers can advance a “business-friendly” agenda.
He added public markets might balloon if the White House unveils a significant tax cut, possibly resulting in “another few years of good earnings” for institutions with robust investments in public equity.
In the last fiscal year, a plurality of Harvard’s investments—around 20 percent—were in private equity. But a lot has changed at HMC over the past year. The firm hired N.P. Narvekar as its CEO shortly after posting its fiscal year 2016 returns, and he has since moved to lay off half of the firm’s staff, outsourced the management of most of its funds, and unloaded some of its private equity and idiosyncratic natural resource assets.
Though Narvekar cautioned it might be five years before these changes manifest in Harvard’s returns, the results for this fiscal year will provide the first glimpse of how the firm performed under Narvekar’s leadership.

Controversy enveloped the Kennedy School of Government this weekend as critics on campus and around the country castigated the school for rescinding Chelsea Manning’s appointment as a visiting fellow this fall.
Last week, after the Institute of Politics announced that Manning—a former Army soldier who went to prison for leaking classified military documents to WikiLeaks—was a visiting fellow this fall, conservatives and national security officials quickly denounced her selection as misguided and unpatriotic. CIA Director Mike Pompeo did not show up to a scheduled speaking appearance at the IOP Thursday in protest of Manning’s selection, and Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA, resigned from his fellowship at the school because of the appointment.
Facing criticism on-campus and nationwide, Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf rescinded Manning’s invitation in a statement issued in the early hours of Friday, calling her selection a “mistake.”
Now the school faces a fresh wave of controversy as commentators lambast Harvard’s decision to disinvite Manning, a transgender activist whose prison sentence former President Barack Obama commuted in 2017.
Several campus organizations co-signed a letter Sunday criticizing the school’s about-face, arguing that Manning’s experience as a transgender prisoner and efforts as a whistleblower merited a place on campus.
“In light of her selfless sacrifices as a whistleblower, her dedication to the truth, and her commitment to human rights, we call upon the Harvard Kennedy School to reinstate Chelsea Manning’s designation as a fellow at the Institute of Politics,” read the letter, signed by the Trans Task Force, the Progressive Jewish Alliance, and the Anti-Islamophobia Network, among several other groups.
Some commentators accused Harvard of having a double standard for selecting its fellows, saying it was wrong to give the fellowship to embattled former White House press secretary Sean Spicer and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, but not Manning. Several hundred alumni have signed a petition for Spicer and Lewandowski’s fellowships to be revoked.
Lewandowski was charged with misdemeanor battery of a reporter before he was fired from the Trump campaign, and Spicer was routinely accused of lying during his engagements with the press.
The backlash was not limited to campus: Opinion pieces quickly sprang up in several national publications, slamming Harvard for kowtowing to the federal government.
“Hiring Manning may have been questionable, but firing her under pressure was disturbing,” the Boston Globe Editorial Board wrote.
The Young Turks, an online liberal news show, urged its viewers to boycott Harvard, circulating a petition asking people to “not have any affiliation with Harvard or provide any support for it whatsoever if they do not reverse their disgraceful decision on Chelsea Manning.”
“To bow your head to the CIA says that basically you think that whatever the CIA says is what Harvard should do,” the show’s host Cenk Uygur said in a video.
In the New Yorker, Nathan J. Heller ’06, a former Crimson editor, accused Elmendorf of prioritizing optics over free ideas.
“Elmendorf nods to pieties about Harvard being in the ideas business but concedes that, even more, Harvard is in the image business,” Heller wrote.
And speaking at a conference in Nantucket, Mass. Sunday, Manning herself addressed the controversy and called Harvard a "police state," according to the Associated Press.
“I’m not ashamed of being disinvited,” Manning said. “I view that just as much of an honored distinction as the fellowship itself.”
A spokesperson for the IOP did not respond to a  request for comment.
Logan E. Leslie ’15, a special forces veteran currently pursuing a joint degree at the Law and Business Schools, said that although it was the right decision to rescind Manning’s fellowship, it made the Kennedy School look “even weaker”.
“It’s a sign of weakness for Harvard to bend to public opinion, I’d say. It shows that they didn’t feel the moral high ground to begin with,” Leslie said.
Still, several conservative politicians commended Harvard for its change of heart.
“Harvard's about-face deserves credit; not easy to admit being wrong,” former presidential candidate Mitt Romney tweeted. Romney was one of several conservative figures who took to Twitter to criticize Harvard for hiring Manning.
Jason E. Chaffetz, a former Republican Congressman who is an IOP fellow this fall, said Harvard should have never considered hiring Manning, and ultimately made the right choice to rescind her fellowship. Chaffetz also said he saw no parallel between selecting Manning and Lewandowski for fellowships.
“I think you have to take each situation differently and assess it. I don’t think there is a litmus test,” Chaffetz said.
Leslie said there is a difference between being committed to free speech and honoring someone with a fellowship.
“I don’t think there should be limits on who comes here to speak, to have their ideas see the light of day, in the forum, I one hundred percent support that. Once you start naming them a fellow, you’re putting Harvard’s name on that person,” he said.

Popular legend has it that cockroaches could survive a nuclear armageddon, but administrators report they may not quite survive House Renewal.
According to Zachary M. Gingo ’98, Senior Director of Operations for the Building Operations group, cockroach sightings around the River Houses have been declining as Harvard has renovated older buildings.
“At a general level, the impact of House Renewal has been to significantly reduce the numbers of cockroaches in the Houses compared to what they were prior to the renovations,” he wrote in an email. “This primarily has to do with the replacements of the domestic sanitary lines, as well as much better sealing of penetrations in foundation and partition walls.”
For decades, the pests have been spotted everywhere at Harvard, from the band room to dining halls. They have been particularly intractable in the older unrenovated buildings. 
Gary D. Alpert, former Harvard Entomology Officer of Environmental Health and Safety, was responsible for keeping the pests out of dorm rooms for years. He said the age of the buildings helped the insects find their way into dorms.
“American Cockroaches were coming up the shower drains, from behind bath tubs and where ever the 80 year old cast iron pipes were eaten away,” Alpert wrote in an email.
Despite student concerns that construction could push cockroaches into the remaining unrenovated houses, Alpert wrote that while construction may disturb cockroaches, it won’t necessarily drive them into the neighboring buildings.
“Vibrations can stir up pests that already exist,” he wrote. “There is no scientific or analytical reason why cockroaches in a Harvard House would increase or decrease due to construction in a separate nearby building.”
Gingo also noted that during that the renovation of Winthrop, reported cockroaches sightings in neighboring Eliot fell 34 percent compared to the year before.
To reduce the number of cockroaches in the Houses, the Building Operations group regularly inspects and cleans plumbing, working with an in-house Ph.D. entomologist and an outside firm.
Nevertheless, the pests continue to plague the river Houses, especially those that have not yet been renovated. Karen C. Andres ’20, a Kirkland House resident, said that her roommate found the bathroom infested with cockroaches upon arriving at their suite. Having tried two types of bug spray unsuccessfully, Andres and her roommates turned to the Internet.
“We read online that if you keep all the sinks and showers on it will help flood them out so we kept them on for several hours,” Andres said, adding that the technique was successful.
They later received a warning from building management about the excess water use. “I don’t think they were very concerned about the roaches,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 20, 2017 at 2:47 p.m.
44 students were elected to the Undergraduate Council on Friday following a four-day campaign period.
1454 students voted for both new and returning members, down from 1,820 students last year. Those elected include 12 freshmen, 13 sophomores, 11 juniors, and 8 seniors. Notably, the number of seniors doubled from the four seniors elected to the Council during last fall’s election.
In some upperclassmen Houses, only small numbers of students turned out to vote. In Dudley, Winthrop, Dunster, and Lowell Houses, 21 or fewer students voted. In Dunster, where nearly 400 students were eligible to vote, only 12 cast ballots. In Dudley, only two students cast ballots.  Keeping with usual voting trends, the four freshmen yards saw the highest turnout, with 746 members of the Class of 2021 voting in the UC election, marking roughly 44 percent of the freshman class.
This year, Council members will have the ability to form caucuses, a capacity granted to members last spring. During the 35th Undergraduate Council’s last meeting earlier this month, four members presented a motion to formally recognize a Black Caucus. In April, members voted to form a Latinx Caucus.
The new Council will also gain the ability to recommend approval for new student groups after the body amended their governing documents last spring. The task comes as over 50 student groups were placed on probation—now making them ineligible for UC funding—after failing to attend an Office of Student Life training for student group leaders.
The new Council is expected to vote on a budget on Sunday, Sept. 24.
The full list of newly elected representatives is as follows:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following initial complaints about Winthrop House’s swipe access, House residents received an email from their Faculty Deans last Monday stating that the issue had been resolved.
After Winthrop reopened for the school year, some non-residents found themselves unable to swipe into certain areas of the building where students live.
The house’s Faculty Deans, Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson, wrote of the accidental restrictions in an email to residents, adding that all undergraduates now have access to residential areas in the House.
“Harvard College students should have swipe access to the House, except for the Winthrop-specific common spaces (i.e., JCR, Library, Beren Common Room, etc.),” the email said. “For the Winthrop-specific common spaces, Winthrop students will need to escort their guests into such spaces.”
 According to the email, Sullivan and Robinson were “not aware of the issue” until members of the Undergraduate Council and Winthrop’s House Committee brought the problem to their attention.
Many Winthrop residents said they first noticed the issue when non-resident students tried to visit the House.
“One or two times right off the bat I had to let my friends in,” Will A. MacPhee ’19 said.
Some residents said that they also had trouble initially getting their own cards to swipe into the House.
“I got locked out of the courtyard once,” Winthrop resident John J. Shen ’19 said, calling the issue “really annoying.” He added that other residents had issues accessing the basement because “unless you swiped, the alarm would go off.”
Although the Faculty Deans’ email said swipe problems should be fixed, several students said they still had some difficulty swiping into certain locations in Winthrop.
Andy J. Kim ’18, a Winthrop resident, said that while swiping in was “getting easier” each day, he still had some difficulty using some card readers.
“You have to press it a certain way,” Kim said. He added that he developed a special “technique” he used to successfully swipe in, adding, “I feel like I know the sensors better.”
Mather House resident Julie A. Baldassano ’17 said she was still having difficulty accessing some stairwells in Winthrop on Sunday, claiming she “couldn’t get in a second ago.”
House Committee co-chair Danielle O. Strasburger ’17 said that while she believed the swipe issue had been fixed, she couldn’t say so with complete certainty.
“I haven’t actually talked to anyone who’s tried. I have not confirmed,” Strasburger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School has raised nearly $706 million since the launch of its capital campaign in Nov. 2014, reaching 94 percent of its $750 million target with just under a year to go in the campaign.
The Medical School was one of the last of Harvard’s graduate schools to join the University’s record-breaking capital campaign, which has so far raised over $8 billion against a $6.5 billion goal. Its individual campaign—dubbed “The World Is Waiting: The Campaign for Harvard Medicine”—has so far received nearly 10,000 gifts and pledges to support research funding and curricular reform, among other goals, according to spokesperson Kevin T. Jiang.
The Medical School’s fundraising is especially needed as the University faces deep cuts to federal science funding, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview with the Harvard-owned Gazette last week. The Trump administration’s proposed 2018 budget cuts funding for the National Institutes of Health by roughly 24 percent, Faust said—a “real body blow to higher education and research universities.”
To counter the constrained federal funds, Faust said, the University is “focusing more on partnerships with industry as sources of support for research.” Approximately 43 percent of the gifts to the Medical School campaign have come from foundations and corporations, compared to 39 percent from individuals and family foundations, Jiang said.
The Medical School designated four major priority groups at the start of the campaign: “Discovery,” “Education,” “Service,” and “Leadership.” Discovery—referring to research funding—comprises the majority of the school’s campaign goal, or about $500 million.
The campaign is set to end on June 30, 2018 and the Medical School is confident that the goal of $750 million dollars will be met prior to that date, according to Jiang.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard women’s volleyball team can claim the title as the queen of New England after completing a three-game sweep of Boston College, Northeastern, and UMass Lowell this weekend.
This performance comes just a week before the Crimson(5-4) match up against their first Ancient Eight opponent in Dartmouth on Sept. 22 and earned Harvard their first winning record of the season.
“We have made some huge improvements over the last few weekends of play before we face Ivy League teams,” junior blocker Jocelyn Meyer said. “We are excited to finalize our adjustments heading into conference play.”
HARVARD 3, NORTHEASTERN 1
A first set defeat did not afflict the resiliency of the Crimson, as they fought back and earned 25 points in the ensuing three sets for the game victory against the crosstown Huskies(5-6).
Harvard maintained a balanced attack throughout the match, finishing with over 11 kills in each of the four sets. In addition, five Crimson players posted double-digit kill numbers with junior co-captain Christina Cornelius notching a team-high 13 kills.
The two teams were mostly deadlocked throughout the first set, with Harvard maintaining a slight lead up to the conclusion of the set. But the Crimson failed to capitalize on a double set point opportunity at 24-22, trading points until 26-26.
Kills by Northeastern sophomore hitters Amy Underdown and Natalie Shollin were ultimately the final signatures on the 54 point set card.
Undeterred by the events of the first set, Harvard held its ground throughout much of set two before sprinting to the 25 point set line with a 5-1 run at the conclusion of the set.
“I feel like the change was that we really wanted to earn every point,” Cornelius said. “ So instead of waiting for our opponent to make mistakes, we were trying to stay on top of things and stay super focused and aggressive to be able to control the game.”
The Crimson maintained its high-octane offense in the third set, breaking away at the halfway point of the set with a 19-13 lead. The Huskies battled back with a 6-0 run, but Harvard held its ground late in the set with powerful kills by sophomore blocker Maclaine Fields and Meyer.
Those kills were two of 14 total set kills over 38 attempts for the Crimson. Harvard would finish with 57 kills in the game overall, with a kill percentage of .222.
To conclude the game, the Crimson cruised through in a 25-18 fourth set score. This marked Northeastern’s first home loss since 2015, ending its remarkable 12 game streak.
HARVARD 3, UMASS LOWELL 0
The Saturday contest at the Malkin Athletic Center lasted all of 90 minutes as Harvard captured its weekend sweep in resounding fashion.
The Riverhawks (3-7) could not contain an effective Crimson attack that finished with attacking percentages of .226, .400, and .346 in the three respective sets.
The most competitive set was the second set, when UMass Lowell fought to only a one point deficit at 17-18. However, Harvard went on a 5-0 run and broke away from there. Senior hitter Paige Kebe sealed the set with a textbook kill from sophomore setter Erin McCarthy.
The final set saw 11 kills from the Crimson, as they traded leads with the Riverhawks for much of the set before breaking away from a 18-18 deadlock to a 24-18 match point score.
With the game all but sealed, Cornelius delivered the final point two plays later with a powerful kill. This was Cornelius’s ninth kill of the game, only second to freshman hitter Mindie Mabry who finished with ten kills.
This weekend also saw increased minutes for some younger players, such as freshman hitter Sandra Zeng. The Honolulu, Hi. native saw minutes in all three weekend matches, where she finished with 15 digs.
Mabry continued an impressive first season with breakout performances in all three matches and totaled 36 kills, becoming an important lynchpin of the Harvard offense.
“Mindie has been doing a great job at spreading out our offense and making things unpredictable,” Cornelius said. “She is such a force on the court and is so aggressive. It is great to see her take a leadership role in our team so early on as a freshman.”
The Crimson hope to see continued contributions from the freshman as they face Dartmouth Sept. 22 at home to open up conference play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After winning at home last week against Quinnipiac, the Harvard women’s soccer team looked to gain vital momentum for Ivy League play by closing out its nonconference slate with more W’s. A two-game road trip to Villanova and Seton Hall, however, stood in its way.
Come the end of the weekend, the Crimson (6-3-0) didn’t quite have a winning streak, but it nevertheless picked up a confidence-building win to bring into conference play.
The team followed up a narrow 2-1 loss to the Wildcats (4-5-0) on Friday afternoon with a convincing 3-0 victory over the Pirates (0-6-2) on Sunday. The win was perhaps the most complete one of the year thus far for Harvard.
“Playing three games in five days, and nine in 24, isn’t easy by any means,” Crimson coach Chris Hamblin said. “The whole coaching staff is proud of how the group battled through it with two strong performances, especially on the road.”
HARVARD 3, SETON HALL 0
The Pirates entered the contest on Sunday afternoon still searching for their first win of the season. 
After a back-and-forth start to the match, the Crimson eventually started to wear Seton Hall down, as Harvard busted the game open with two quick scores late in the first half. The Crimson tacked on a late goal to seal the 3-0 shutout win.
Two freshmen combined for Harvard’s first goal, as forward Murphy Agnew threaded a pass to midfielder Linda Liedel, who beat her defender and then beat the goalie with a bullet to the back left corner. It was the first collegiate goal for Liedel, who was making her third start.
Agnew’s assist, meanwhile, capped off a strong week in which she tallied one goal and two assists.
“Every player on our team has had to step up into a leadership role this season, and I think everyone has done a really great job embracing these new roles,” said Crimson captain Caroline Chagares. “[Liedel] and [Agnew] have been playing really well and we’re really excited for them to continue to change the game.”
Minutes later, junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi added Harvard’s second goal directly from a corner kick. These direct scores, called “olimpicos,” are rare in soccer, but Mohammadi already has two on the year after doing the same thing against Providence in the season opener.
In addition to flashing her spot-kick abilities, Mohammadi continued to be the Crimson’s talisman on offense as she accumulated six shots over the course of the game, five of which were on target. She also added an assist on the team’s third goal, which junior midfielder Zayne Matulis provided the finish on to clinch the game.
The stellar performance by Mohammadi ended a streak of three games in which she failed to get on the score sheet. The junior has, however, tallied at least one shot in all nine games thus far.
“Offensively, it was a game of firsts for us,” Hamblin said. “We had never scored twice in a half before. We had never won a game by more than one goal. These were both objectives we wanted to accomplish before conference play, and we were able to do that today.”
VILLANOVA 2, HARVARD 1
Less than 48 hours earlier, the Crimson took the bus down the I-95 and across the Delaware River to Villanova, Pa., at the Higgins Complex. In that contest, a closely contested first half turned into a more open second half in which the Wildcats slipped past Harvard.
Senior defender Emily Kuefler opened the scoring for Villanova in the 53rd minute when she capitalized on a one-on-one opportunity against Crimson sophomore goalie Kat Hess. A well-placed pass by sophomore midfielder Kristin Barbour had released Kuefler on the left side of the six-yard box, and Kuefler didn’t hesitate to drive the ball into the back of the net.
Agnew answered for Harvard ten minutes later, converting a solo effort to even the score at 1-1. But with tired legs after Wednesday’s win, the team could not hold on for a draw.
Wildcats senior forward Amanda Vocelka snuck behind the Crimson defense in the 84th minute, and connected on a strong header that deflected off Hess and into the goal. With only five minutes remaining, this score turned out to be the game-winner.
It was the first win ever by Villanova over Harvard, in their fourth-ever meeting. The Wildcats ended up earning the win on the back of their movement off the ball, which pushed them over the top.
“We wanted to stay organized on defense, which I thought we did well,” Chagares said. “Villanova is a good team, and we’re going to learn a lot from that game as we near Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team was unable to notch another win on Saturday night, falling to Boston University. The Terriers (1-5-0) avenged last season’s loss against the Crimson (1-3-1) and got its first win of the season in a close 1-0 game.
“It was obviously not the result that we wanted,” senior midfielder Christian Sady said. “But I thought overall we defended really well, aside from that one set piece that was just kind of a lapse in concentration and that’s easy to fix for us.”
Both teams seemed evenly matched from the starting whistle, with just four combined shots taken in the entire first half. Harvard’s offense flowed and the team was able to maintain possession in the attacking third, but nevertheless the team struggled the first half to earn clear shots on goal.
The team’s best and only attempt at goal in the first half came in the 13th minute when co-captain defender Eric Gylling took a screamer from 35 yards out, which unluckily hit the crossbar.
“I thought we kept good possession,” Sady said. “I would’ve liked to see us be a little more dangerous in the final third, but…I’m confident that moving forward we’ll be great.”
Though the offense was struggling to find opportunities to take shots, the defense remained steady and prevented the Terriers from getting many looks. The game also saw the debut in between the posts of Harvard freshman Matt Freese. The Crimson netminder saved two shots from BU’s sophomore forward Matt McDonnell and junior midfielder T.J. Butzke, as well as one from sophomore midfielder Satchel Cortet.
In the 44th minute, however, a Terriers free kick was curled into the Crimson’s penalty box. The ball was picked up by Terrier senior defender Adam Sheikali, who placed the ball just inside the left post to give his team the 1-0 lead going into the half.
“Matt Freese did great,” Gylling said. “I don’t think it’s the easiest thing to come in as a keeper and start a full game, especially against a crosstown rival, but he did really well.”
It was in the second half that the Crimson offense came alive and found a way to get past the BU defense. The Terriers made the first attempt at goal, but Harvard quickly responded with looks of its own.
Ivy League Rookie of the Week midfielder/forward Paolo Belloni-Urso took three of the five shots that Harvard had in the second half. One of the team’s best chances at an equalizer came in the middle of the second half when Belloni-Urso fed a ball to freshman midfielder Cornelius Bencsik at the top of BU’s box, but Bencsik’s shot went wide.
Though the clock was winding down, the Crimson offense upped the pressure on the Terriers defense. Ten minutes after Bencsik’s shot, and with just under two minutes left in regulation, the team had two more chances to score and send the game into overtime. After a foul on BU, Belloni-Urso sent a long free kick over the wall and right on target for goal, but BU’s William Bonnelyche managed to punch it away.
Bonnelyche was not off the hook just yet, though, as Sady was right there for a quick rebound. The Terriers goalie was quick on his toes and saved Sady’s shot as well, shutting Harvard out and sealing the win for his team.
While the offense was picking up its rhythm, Harvard’s defense remained just as strong as it was in the first half. Freese saved BU’s early shot in the half, and the back line stopped the Terriers offense from making any more attempts on goal in the last 45 minutes of the game.
Despite the loss, the Crimson gave a strong performance that can serve as a base upon which to build for the rest of the season.
“We had a few guys who weren’t healthy for the game so I think once they get back in the lineup that could help us with our attack going forward,” Gylling said. “We’re also talking about keeping our outside mids wider and looking for more productivity from the forwards.”

On Saturday, the No. 7 Harvard Radcliffe Women’s rugby team (1-1-0) faced off against No. 3 Army (1-1-1) in New York for its second match of the season. In a neck-to-neck match, the Crimson and Army Mules battled to tie the score 33-33 at the final whistle. The tie is also the first time Harvard has tied in a match since 2015 against Brown.
From the opening minute, the teams appeared evenly matched and unable to break the scoring stalemate. The Crimson was the first to open up scoring in the game when it broke through the Army Mules’ defense.
Freshman Milan Roberts scored off of an offload by junior Caitlin Weigel, before junior Jenny Kronish had her first of three successful conversion of the match to bring Harvard to a 7-0 lead.
“When we stick together, keep constant communication on the field,  and stay connected we are able to showcase our talent and become a dangerous threat.” junior Genevieve Quirion said.
The Crimson continued to find holes in the Army defense and pushed through when senior captain Maya Learned scored a try to increase the lead to 14-0.
The Army Mules recovered and soon found its offensive footing, when senior wing Sydney Hawkins cut Harvard’s lead to 14-7 at the halftime whistle.
The pressure against the Crimson defense continued at the start of the second half as Army sophomore tighthead Sally Varner scored to tie the game at 14-14.
Then, the Army Mules took the lead for the first time in the game when senior wing Rebecca Stipp scored a try, and with a successful conversion, Army led 21-14.
However, Harvard regained its earlier momentum and began to take control of the game again.
“One big turning point was a few minutes into the second half,” sophomore flyhalf Delia Hellander said, “We came out on the back foot and got scored on 2 times pretty quickly, but after that we really pulled together and fought through the last 35 minutes and played some of our best rugby so far.”
With the team communicating well and finding weak spots in the Army Mules’ defense, junior flanker Ginny Miller scored a try followed by a third successful conversion for Kronish to bring the Crimson to a 21-21 tie with Army.
Harvard fed off its renewed momentum as sophomore wing Tori Tong scored a try to bring the Crimson to a 28-21 lead.
Harvard then extended its lead to 33-21 when Hellander scored for a try, her second of the season. However the Crimson was unable to convert the extra point.
The Army Mules, however, was not ready to give into Harvard’s defense as it fought for a successful try and a conversion to cut the Crimson lead to 33-28.
The last score of the match belonged to Army in the last minutes of the game as it scored a conversion to tie the game at 33-33 at the final whistle.
Harvard knew it had a few things to take away from the match.
“[We need to continue] to work on our defensive connection and...on retaining the ball offensively through multiple phases, cutting down on small errors,” sophomore Emily Prentice said.
After the tense tie against the Army Mules, Harvard is only looking forward to the next match and improving upon itself.
“For the next match, we want to improve our composure under pressure,” junior Caitlin Weigel said. “As always, we want to continue to improve our passing, timing, and domination of the contact point.”

The Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams formally opened the 2017 season at The Course at Yale, competing against two league rivals in the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet.
Competing in a dual meet against the Bulldogs, the Crimson men placed second overall, with junior Collin Price and senior Tyler Spear finishing in second and third place, respectively. The women finished third overall against Yale and Princeton, led by senior Elianna Shwayder in fifth place and freshman Abbe Goldstein in sixth place.
“We went out with a very specific idea of what we wanted to do and just focused on running our own race and executing coach’s plan,” Spear said. “The team is the middle of a very heavy training cycle and so we’re mostly concentrating on making sure to take care of our day-to-day routine so that once the championship season rolls around, we’re ready to go.”
Spear and teammate Price both recorded their best Harvard career finishes in a cross-country race on Friday. Also recording strong finishes on the men's side were freshman Matthew Pereira, who finished eighth overall, followed by senior Louis Colson in 12th and fellow freshman John Fish in 15th place.
“Particularly excited about the performance of two of our freshmen, Matt Pereira and John Fish, who finished as our third and fifth runners in their first ever collegiate races,” Spear said. “They’re total gamers and are going to develop into big time stars over the course of their careers at Harvard.”
In the women’s race, Shwayder’s fifth place finish marked her best collegiate finish at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet. In addition to Shwayder’s strong run and freshman Abbe Goldstein’s break-out debut, senior Fiona Davis also scored points for the Crimson  in 18th overall, along with junior Miranda Sadler and freshman Tessa Medrano, who were 27th and 28th.
“HYP was a low-key opportunity to work on our mental approaches to racing. We made a plan to run relaxed and together during the first half and then increase the pressure over the course of the second half of the race,” Shwayder said. “We're gradually working into racing and we're not placing a lot of stake in these early season measurements. Rather, we're focused on training through these races to be ready come the end of October and November.”
Next Friday, both the Harvard men’s and women’s teams will compete in the Coast-to-Coast Battle in Beantown held at the Crimson’s home course, Franklin Park.
“Overall, the team is pleased with the showing. We raced a light group, and have yet to fold in about half of our healthy runners,” Spear said. “We’re excited to see how the team does on Friday at the Battle of Beantown and especially once we start to get into the groove of racing during October and November.”
