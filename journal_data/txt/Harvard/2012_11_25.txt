After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the evening of June 26, 2012, London was bombed at it prepared for the impending Olympic Games. The act was not out of malice, as had been the case 70 years prior: this time, the bombs were poems, not weapons.
The Chilean artistic collective Casagrande has for the past decade staged “bombings” of various cities during which 100,000 poems, printed on bookmarks, are dropped from an aircraft onto the populace below. Harvard has no chance of experiencing one of these events, however: Casagrande exclusively bombs cities that have in the past experienced an actual bombing. This is not simply a sort of public art installation; it is an act of healing and recovery, said Casagrande co-founder José Joaquín Prieto in a discussion November 5 at Lamont Library’s Woodberry Poetry Room.
The first instance of this dropping of poems occurred in Santiago, Chile, over the La Moneda palace, which, Prieto explained, was bombed in 1973 during a military coup d’état. “The image of an airplane soaring through Santiago and releasing its bombs over the governmental palace became the symbol of the beginning of 17 years of military dictatorship,” Prieto said.
To Prieto and his colleagues, bombing the palace with poems in 2001 had particular personal significance. “The founding members of Casagrande…were born around 1973, the time of the military coup, so the bombing of the palace was both a creative response to our personal stories and a way to become involved in the transition to democracy,” he said.
A few months after the poem bombing in Chile, Casagrande decided to turn this personal project into something international that was meant to be deeply unifying. “We wanted to share this experience in another place,” Prieto said. Casagrande bombed Dubrovnik in 2002 and Guernica in 2004; Berlin and Warsaw were later targets. The sense of international connection in the bombings is reflected in the poems themselves: for each bombing, the poems chosen are in equal number by Chilean poets and poets from the country being bombed. The London bombing also involved poems from the 204 nations in the Olympic games.
The bombing of poems naturally creates worries about excessive litter and waste, but Prieto says that these concerns are completely unfounded. “Each time the poems have been released over a city, the crowd picks them up,” Prieto said. “People who receive a flying bookmark exchange them, turning them into items of exchange rather than waste.”
This sort of bombing would seemingly be a powerful experience for any community and a valuable opportunity to experience art in the company of others, but Casagrande has determined that this event will only take place in cities that have experienced an actual bombing in their past. “The experiences of the people who are there are truly important,” Prieto said.
Those people have also been crucial to the evolution of the project. Casagrande has for some time called the events a “Rain of Poems,” but a few Guernica survivors who witnessed the event there convinced the group to refer to the event as what it is. On the group’s website, the project is now called a “Bombing of Poems.”
For Prieto, there is no better vehicle than poetry to help a city move beyond its historical tragedy; it is an art Prieto finds both nationally and internationally unifying. “Poetry matters precisely because it speaks to the world and not to an individual person,“ he said. “It’s possible never to take up a poem in your life, but this kind of performance creates the possibility of reading and exchanging poetry.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Art lovers, rejoice! From Nov. 26 to 28, the Harvard Monday Gallery presents "surfacing." The galley, which opened in March of 2012, is an exhibition space operated by students in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies and exists to provide undergraduates majoring in VES with a venue for exhibiting their artwork.
Kayla A. Escobedo '13, a curator for "surfacing," explained that the works displayed were chosen according to quality rather than adherence to a chosen theme. "This semester we had an open call for submissions, and we discovered the show by choosing interesting work," Escobedo said. "We don't try to directly connect the works to one another, but we hope the title will spark some interest in its potential meaning and relation to the show."
The opening reception for "surfacing" will run from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Monday night, with continued viewing hours from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Harvard Monday Gallery is located at 6-8 Linden Street.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after about 2,600 undergraduates voted in support of a referendum calling for Harvard to divest its $30.7 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry, a Harvard spokesperson said on Wednesday that the University has no plans to adjust its investment portfolio in response to the student plebiscite.
“Harvard is not considering divesting from companies related to fossil fuels,” Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The divestment referendum, which was approved along with two other student-initiated ballot questions in this month’s Undergraduate Council presidential election, earned 72 percent of the student vote.
Although the three successful referenda will now be adopted as the official position of the UC, they have no power to directly influence University policy. And with the divestment question in particular, administrators have given little indication that they are looking to change course.
In May, Jane L. Mendillo—president and CEO of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees University investments—said in a statement that Harvard already has a system in place to ensure that its investments are financially and socially sound.
“Our due diligence process includes critical evaluation of issues related to environment, labor practices and corporate governance,” Mendillo said. “Investments that fall short in any of these areas are unlikely to generate the strong long-term returns we require.”
And at an open forum hosted by the UC and Harvard Graduate Council in October, University President Drew G. Faust reiterated that the Harvard Management Company, which oversees University investments, is principally committed to generating funds to support education and research.
“That is its sustaining goal, and it devotes itself to that, not to using the investments to advance particular agendas of one sort or another,” Faust said.
Still, referendum organizers say they hope to use the election results as a platform to convince administrators to comply with their demands.
Alli J. Welton ’15—a board member of Divest Harvard, Harvard’s chapter of Students for a Just and Stable Future, which sponsored the divestment question—said that thus far, she and other members of the group have been repeatedly denied in their efforts to schedule a formal meeting with Faust to discuss the issue.
However, Galvin wrote that Faust “always appreciates hearing from students about their viewpoints, and she has addressed this issue with students on several occasions,” citing Faust’s student office hours and her appearance last month at the UC- and Harvard Graduate Council-sponsored open forum.
But Welton said that although she and other members of her group have made use of both of these options, they are not satisfied with this limited access. Welton said she will try again on Monday to schedule an official meeting with Faust, in the hope that the ballot question’s wide margin of victory will make Faust more amenable to meeting with her group.
Deidre Nelms, a student at Amherst College who is also advocating for divestment from fossil fuel companies as president of the Green Amherst Project, said she was disappointed to hear that Faust had not yet granted a formal meeting to organizers at Harvard.
“At Amherst College, our Board of Trustees and our president [have] met with us. They have been very willing to speak with students,” Nelms said. “It seems like Harvard should be equally willing to at least negotiate with students.”
Welton that said she believes that if she and other Divest Harvard leaders get that opportunity, they will be able to make a convincing case that Harvard should withdraw its investments in fossil fuel companies.
Climate change resulting in part from the burning of fossil fuels, Welton said, is “clearly as extreme, if not more extreme” than the issues that have prompted divestment at Harvard in the past—apartheid South Africa in 1986, tobacco in 1990, and genocide in Darfur in 2005.
And, Welton said, the stakes are too high for Divest Harvard members to be satisfied with the alternative.
“[President Faust is] going to have to change her mind, because we’re not changing ours,” Welton said. “Climate change is a matter of life or death for millions and millions of people. We’re going to do whatever we can to change her mind over the weekend or the next couple of years.”
