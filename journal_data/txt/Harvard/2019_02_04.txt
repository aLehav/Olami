After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are lonelier than ever in an increasingly well-connected world. Loneliness is perhaps one of those rare burdens truly borne by everyone regardless of creed, where we come from, whether we are rich or poor, young or old, etc. We all crave deep, meaningful, and intimate friendships.

We are unsatisfied with mundanities and surface-level pleasantries. We cringe at the awkwardness of first encounters, where we come to know a person but do not yet know them. Often, we choose to forego this awkward experience altogether and retreat. Nevertheless, we yearn to be pursued. We yearn to be pursued by a true friend, not merely a companion or acquaintance.

The cultivation of deep friendships is completely within our power to pursue. C.S. Lewis writes that friendship is “the least instinctive, organic, biological, gregarious and necessary” of human loves. The human race does not need friendships to reproduce, and we aren’t hunter-gatherer nomads who must rely on companions in a collective for our most basic survival needs.

True friendship surpasses the threshold of mere companionship when it asks, “Do you see the same truth?” — a question whose biological or social necessity is far from obvious. So, to Lewis and the ancient thinkers he draws from, this kind of friendship is a love that is truly and freely chosen. It is absolutely our choice to cultivate. But what stops us from choosing and cultivating this kind of friendship? Simply put — we have no idea what it would even look like.

Social media is not the primary problem. It does not necessarily help us find those same truths at the core of friendship, but its cardinal sin of fostering superficial connection is not so much a function of the medium as it is a reflection of the poor quality of friendships we generally have. We can barely envision a close, affectionate, and intimate bond with another person, the hallmark of the friendship we truly want, that doesn’t have a sexual or romantic end.

Our hyper-sexualized culture is apt to take bonds of friendship and recast them as principally erotic urges, romanticize a star-crossed love story, or lament a missed connection. Writing with relevant timelessness, Lewis mourns how we often view intimate friendship as a mere cover for eros and eroticism. We are absolutely obsessed with dating, “shipping” people who we think would be good together, weddings, hook-up culture, most anything related to sex and sexuality.
Everyone across the social issues spectrum is guilty, from conservative evangelicals to BuzzFeed liberals who make “List the Random Things You Hate and We’ll Tell You When You’ll Get Married” quizzes. This obsession is hardly contained within this millenium, but 21st century social media has exponentially exacerbated the problem.

We don’t often watch movies or listen to music about friendship completely removed from romance or sex. We have a better chance with books — but for every book about an adventure shared among friends, there are at least 50 trash romance novels, by my very scientific count. We are starved for models of meaningful friendship, and we starve ourselves further by stubborn insistence on coupling everyone up.
A society that is hyper-conscious about sex is hyper-selfish at its core. Rarely do we think about sexuality in terms of what we might give. It is mostly about what we want from others, when and how we want that attention, and condemnation of anyone who might deny us. It is this same attitude we often extend towards friendship.

What is to be done? We must acknowledge challenging truths about the friendships we really want. Building friendship takes intentional time, requires initial awkwardness, and grows in vulnerability and authenticity. These kinds of friendships won’t occur frequently. They will be exclusive and held with very few of our companions, a challenge to a world also obsessed with inclusivity.

Our deep-seated cultural corruption of friendship can only be undone by a radical and countercultural change of our hearts and minds. We want to be pursued and sought after, but we must try much harder to pursue and seek others. This is not passively waiting for others to offer themselves to us. Rather, we must offer others our time, our ears, and our hearts. Friendship is solely a function of our own choice because it is solely under our own power that we offer up our very selves.

Rejection is a real possibility in this model. What if we aren’t enough for our friends? What if we fail them? Goodness knows I’ve failed my friends many times, and I will again. But the societal status quo is a wearisome, isolating alternative. It is high time we embraced a countercultural attitude to remove the rot in our friendships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few months ago, I rushed through the yard at an excited pace toward my first class at Harvard. After getting lost multiple times, I burst into my Government lecture five minutes late. I plunked myself down into a nearby seat and listened: “Notable alumni of this lecture include … and Jared Kushner. Just kidding, Jared Kushner did not take this class. Trust me, if Jared Kushner had taken this class, we would be much, much better off than we are right now.
I attended the same high school that Jared C. Kushner ’03 attended, where students, faculty, and administrators loved to boast about Kushner, their favorite alumnus. Though I am fairly moderate, I was considered to be the token liberal in my high school. Whenever politics came up at the lunch table, I was labeled as a “radical, stupid leftist.” Friends and teachers were aghast when I mentioned that I was voting for Clinton. My political views were the butt of many jokes.
So, on my first day of college, I was relieved to finally be on the laughing side.
But soon, my mind wandered to a quick calculation. Looking around, I realized there were probably 200 people shopping that class. Even at a liberal campus like Harvard, there must have been some students feeling ostracized due to their political views, just like I had been in high school.
The truth is that while these jokes seem innocent, they mask a truth far more sinister. Here at Harvard, conservative voices on campus are delegitimized and suppressed. I have seen this first hand. Once in Annenberg, a student told me that racist Trump supporters in her state prevented a Democrat from winning a Senate seat. With this comment, she casually labeled all those who voted for Trump in her state to be racist. Her words shocked me. Even one who believes that the president is a racist cannot assume that the fifty percent of the country that voted for him are all racist as well.
This reveals a dangerous symptom of contemporary polarization: the misconstruction of opposing narratives. Many conservatives understand the virtues of conservative ideology but have warped conceptions of liberal beliefs. Likewise, many liberals can’t fathom the virtues of conservative values. Instead, they wrongly assume that racist motives guide most conservatives. Hillary Clinton grossly generalized half of all Trump supporters as “deplorables,” and from conversations I’ve had the past few months I think that many Harvard students and faculty would agree. This defamation delegitimizes conservative voices and silences them.
As liberals on campus, we emphasize inclusion and diversity when it comes to race, gender, and sexual orientation. However, we simultaneously stifle ideological diversity and label conservative voices as backward thinking bigots. As Nicholas D. Kristof ’82 describes liberal intolerance: “We’re fine with people who don’t look like us, as long as they think like us.”
Alternative political and ideological views should not be the cause for shame on campus. On the contrary, we should celebrate a diversity of thought amongst the student body as the foundation of the university as a marketplace of ideas. Instead, we have fostered an environment hostile to different political views in order to create an artificial sense of consensus.
This echo-chamber hurts us all. Most of the learning we do in college takes place in the cafeteria, not the classroom. The admissions office worked hard to accept a diverse student body so that we could learn from each other. By silencing conservative voices, we lose out on this experience.
Silencing alternative voices also weakens the liberal mainstream. Strong ideas and values arise from debate and struggle with different philosophies, not from reinforcement and patting each other on the back.
This intolerance is not only the fault of the student body. The faculty and administration are equally to blame. A survey run by the Crimson last year on members of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences found that about 38 percent of faculty identified as very liberal and an additional 45 percent identified as liberal, whereas less than 2 percent of the faculty identify as either conservative or very conservative. The same survey found that 88 percent of faculty think the president is doing a very poor job and another 8 percent said he is doing just a poor job. Only 1 percent of faculty said they believe Trump is doing a good job and no respondents said Trump is doing a very good job — not one. Ideological diversity clearly does not seem to be a priority for Harvard during its hiring process. As a result, conservative students are left without mentors and liberal students don’t have the benefit of hearing any challenging ideas.
Universities are supposed to be a place where young people of diverse backgrounds come together to partake in a great exchange of ideas. However, my college experience so far has been a liberal rubber stamp. If there is any platform in which the entrenched polarization of America can be uprooted, it is at the university. Yet at Harvard, polarization is enhanced by the continual delegitimization of alternative ideologies. Students and professors must strive to correct this, both by being conscious of their own language and biases and by striving to create an environment that is open to all ideologies.

The stark reality of climate change is as alarming and impending as ever. To combat this growing threat, the Harvard Management Company has become a leading investor in a methane emissions reduction working group. We applaud this move, and believe that the commitment of resources to sustainable investments shows the University’s drive to mobilize its financial power in the fight against environmental degradation.
As this Board has opined in the past, the University must play an active role in combating climate change. Our response to this threat, both as a University and as a society more broadly, will be the defining issue of our time and our generation. Harvard can and should work persistently to reduce its own carbon footprint and support sustainable technology. We are hopeful that HMC’s investment will contribute to reducing fossil fuel emissions, as this specific working group encourages companies to report and reduce their methane emissions.
Moreover, HMC’s activity signals the seriousness of the University’s intent to honor its commitment to the Principles for Responsible Investment, a United Nations-supported investment network that promotes environmentally responsible and sustainable initiatives. In 2014, HMC signed onto the initiative, and the working group directly operates within the network. This Board wrote then that such an action would allow Harvard to use its clout and “leverage” for positive ends, and this working group offers vindication for that hope. We further hope that this investment and others made through PRI will constitute significant efforts to combat climate change. Nonetheless, deliberate selection of sustainable investment opportunities must seek to maintain maximal endowment returns. This method of responsible investing will allow HMC to continue funding the University’s mission and commitments, including student financial aid and research initiatives across its schools.
As responsible investment and active divestment are inherently intertwined, it is important to distinguish between the two. As we have repeatedly opined many times in the past, divesting the endowment from fossil fuels would be merely a symbolic gesture with no impact on the reality of climate change. Actively supporting environmentally-conscious companies through good investment practices such as this working group, as well as promoting approaches to solving climate change issues through influencing public policy, creates a more pragmatic and positive effect instead of an empty gesture.
While we are pleased with HMC’s investment in the working group, there is clearly much more the University can do to combat climate change. This measure is simply one step towards achieving the goals set out in the University’s “Climate Action Plan,” which includes plans for it to be fossil fuel-free by 2050. While in 2019 such change may seem drastic and an abstract future responsibility, actions such as this investment show that such a future is possible — not merely for Harvard, but for our world. We encourage HMC to continue to search for investment prospects that promote sustainability and garner high investment returns so that Harvard can continue to support the work seeking to address climate change — and the other challenges we face — that takes place every day across campus.

Square residents ventured out in the cold to Brattle Street Saturday to shop and support their neighbors at a charity yard sale for the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
The yard sale, organized by the Harvard Square Business Association, was held in the Corcoran building, which formerly housed Urban Outfitters, Tealuxe, and Sweet Bakery. The stores closed late last year ahead of plans to demolish and rebuild the site as a “pedestrian mall.”
Among some of the sellers were former Brattle Street stores, which donated eclectic pieces ranging from furniture to art to 1930s baseball cleats. The event raised nearly $2,000 for the homeless shelter, according to Denise Jillson, the Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
The event organizers made clear that the purpose of the sale was to give back to the community. As they perused, patrons were reminded by pamphlets taped to walls and cabinets to “consider those who have fallen on hard times” in making their purchases.
Susan E. Miller-Havens, a local artist who helped organize the event and whose gallery was forced to close with the planned construction, said the yard sale was designed to address one of the Square’s most pressing social needs.
“It is an ongoing problem in Harvard Square that we don’t have enough shelters, and the shelters don’t have enough money,” Miller-Havens said.
Jillson said the charity partnership was a natural fit.
“The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter is a member of the association, and it has been since its inception,” Jillson said.
Ultimately, she said, holding the yard sale to support the shelter “was really a no-brainer.”
Ethan M. Kahn ’20, the co-administrative director of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter said the relationship between the shelter and the Harvard Square Business Association is ongoing.
“The Harvard Square Business Association oftentimes facilitates our connections with donors, including other organizations and shops throughout the square,” Kahn said. “We’re really appreciative of their support.”
The yard sale will also run on Feb. 9, from 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. at 0 Brattle St.

Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality — though currently a small program offering only undergraduate degrees and graduate secondary fields — is working towards one day becoming a “full-fledged” department, Acting Chair of WGS Françoise Lionnet said in an interview Friday.
The WGS Committee is an interdisciplinary study program spanning the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. Many students within the committee pursue joint degrees in other departments ranging from biomedical engineering and computer science to history and literature.
Lionnet said though the process to become a department requires much administrative oversight, the transformation would be “an overdue recognition” of the importance of WGS’s “intellectual and interdisciplinary profile.”
“A lot of administrative work has to go into making it into a department,” Lionnet said. “The university administrators have to agree that's the necessary step and that would be a long process.”
To achieve this goal, the committee has already taken several steps to expand the program.
Currently, the WGS faculty comprises mostly joint appointments between WGS and other departments, but the Committee has made strides in the past few years to expand its faculty. In 2017, WGS hired its first full-time faculty member Durba Mitra and then subsequently hired its first full-time tenured professor Robert F. Reid-Pharr last year.
WGS Director of Undergraduate Studies Caroline Light described the appointments as “fantastic” and “exciting news in terms of institutional resources.” She credits the divisional dean for allowing the committee to hire full-time faculty.
“We were able to make two full appointments on our faculty, which is really new because we’re a committee, we’re not a department in WGS, which means up until just a couple of years ago all of our faculty were jointly appointed faculty,” Light said. “This speaks a lot to team-led support for our program.”
“That’s a revolutionary change in our capacity as a relatively small interdisciplinary program to appoint faculty fully in our program,” Light added.
Not only is the faculty growing within WGS, but the graduate and undergraduate student populations have also expanded.
“For the first time ever, there are looking to be, in the first day of sophomore tutorial, over 20 students, which is really amazing,” Light said.
Despite the growing interest, Light said she is concerned by the multiple upcoming WGS faculty retirements, which may present some difficulty in keeping up with the growing student demand.
Montita Sowapark ’19 — a joint concentrator in biomedical engineering and WGS — said that because most of the classes are seminars, there is likely a limited number of students who can take WGS courses.
“By the nature of the material and the type of work that you’re doing and the types of questions you’re asking, most of the classes work better as seminars,” Sowapark said. “And also because of limitations in how many people can be hired, how many lecturers can be hired per semester, it’s such that fewer people are able to take the WGS classes that they want than ideally.”
In response to the limiting nature of seminar courses, the program is progressively adding more General Education courses — including Ethical Reasoning 42: “Sex and Ethical Reasoning” — that allow for a greater number of students, Lionnet explained.
“We have of course a lot of seminar-based courses, but we have also a lot of Gen Ed courses that are beginning to be offered more and more,” Lionnet said. “And I think that’s the pathway to attracting larger groups of students.”
Still, Sowapark said she considers the biggest obstacle to growth and meeting student demand to be funding.
“I absolutely love the faculty that we have in WGS but I really do think that if Harvard were to dedicate more funding, because that’s really literally the bottom line,” Sowapark said. “How much money do they have to hire people who are doing the most innovative work, to fund research, to fund students, to fund professors writing books, etc.,” Sowapark said.
Nevertheless, the intimate size of the Committee has made it easier for students and faculty members to bond, according to program affiliates.
“I do rely on professors not just for academic support and advice but also for a lot of emotional and personal support and advice. I feel very safe and comfortable approaching them about things like sorting out what I want to do with my future or going through like a particularly difficult time,” Sowapark said.
Lionnet said the small size of WGS courses can facilitate conversations about more sensitive issues.
“In our kinds of courses we talk about personal issues and it’s easier to do that and feel comfortable talking about that in small groups,” she said.

Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. sharply criticized Harvard’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. in a Jan. 29 RealClearInvestigations article that identifies him multiple times as Fryer’s lawyer.
Asked twice whether — as the article asserts — he represents Fryer, Sullivan avoided directly answering the question.
Instead Sullivan wrote that Boston attorney George J. Leontire is representing Fryer. Pressed further, Leontire then responded in place of Sullivan that he and Fryer declined to comment.
Sullivan is currently facing scrutiny over his choice to represent former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in his Manhattan sexual abuse case. In a letter to Winthrop affiliates about his defense of Weinstein, Sullivan emphasized the importance of representing the “unpopular defendant.”
The Crimson first reported the existence of at least one Title IX investigation into Fryer in May 2018, and another in December. He also faces a state-level investigation led by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, an additional Title IX complaint, and a Harvard investigation into his finances and personal spending.
The Title IX complainants allege Fryer engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct stretching back years and that he created a hostile environment for women at the Education Innovation Labs, the research group he founded. Fryer has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Harvard's Office for Dispute Resolution — which conducts formal Title IX investigations — issued a report this fall on two of the three Title IX inquiries into Fryer. ODR is still investigating the third sexual harassment complaint against Fryer. The Harvard inquiry into his finances is also ongoing.
In the RealClearInvestigations article, Sullivan called the ODR investigations into Fryer “deeply flawed and deeply unfair.” He alleged investigators “weighted the credibility of white witnesses far above minority witnesses” and ignored the testimony of several EdLabs employees who spoke in support of Fryer.
“It shows what the current [#MeToo] movement, some blood in the water, and good coaching [of witnesses] can produce,” he said.
Sullivan’s comments directly reference witness interviews and details of ODR’s reports, which are typically shared only with complainants, respondents, and the parties’ advisors.
Sullivan criticized ODR’s handling of the complaints in the article. He alleged Harvard investigators acted without a “semblance of due process or the presumption of innocence” and their report used racial stereotypes.
“Roland was constantly portrayed as an over-sexualized black man who no one could tell no,” Sullivan said. “Yet, there was not one piece of evidence of someone telling him no and him doing something mean to them. Even [a hostile witness whom he had fired] said in her interview that Roland’s so-called ‘yelling’ is not about raising his voice but it’s the intensity of his look and how his voice sounds.”
Asked about his quotes in the RealClearInvestigations article, Sullivan wrote in an email that he did not have any additional comments.
“I do not have any additional comments relating to the ODR investigation of Prof. Fryer,” he wrote.
Per Harvard policy, all parties involved with an ODR investigation must avoid sharing information they learn during the course of the inquiry.
“Once a complaint is filed, the Complainant or Reporter, the Respondent, and any witnesses will be notified that disclosing information about the case has the potential for compromising the integrity of the investigation and might, in certain circumstances, be construed as retaliatory,” the policy reads.
Retaliation is considered a separate violation of Harvard’s policies against sexual and gender-based harassment.
“The parties remain free to share their own experiences, other than information that they have learned solely through the investigatory process,” the policy reads.
Stuart Taylor, Jr., who wrote the RealClearInvestigations article, did not respond to a request for comment. In the past, Taylor has written books and articles criticizing Obama-era Title IX guidelines and has frequently referenced the “problem of systematic discrimination by universities against the accused.”
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Sullivan’s criticisms or the status of the investigations. Fryer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The Undergraduate Council voted to create a director of belonging and inclusion position at its first general meeting of the year Sunday.
The Director of Belonging and Inclusion — to be chosen from among current UC members — will oversee the caucus system and research inclusion within the Council and peer schools’ student governments. The director will also advise the UC as a non-voting member of the Executive Board, a group comprising the Council’s top leadership.
Eliot House Representative Maxwell A. Gillmer ’21, President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 proposed the new position. The Council voted 22-3-5 to amend its bylaws to create the new role.
All UC representatives will be eligible to apply for the position. The president and vice president will select a candidate, who will need to be confirmed by a majority vote of the 13-person Executive Board.
Gillmer said he supported creating the role because groups like the Harvard Graduate Council and the Institute of Politics have similar positions that promote diversity and inclusion within their bodies.
“We, as a governing body, need to keep up with not only the other governing bodies of other schools, but also what the campus is prioritizing,” Gillmer said.
Palaniappan said she supported the new position because internal research from recent years showed women did not feel the same level of inclusion on all UC committees.
Not all representatives, however, said they think the new position will effectively improve inclusion and belonging on the Council.
Oak Yard Representative A. Blake Barclay ’22, who opposed the creation of the new position, said he believes it will place the Executive Board’s shared responsibility of promoting diversity on one individual. He said he thinks the new role will divide communities instead of uniting them.
“A lot of times, we create these positions to focus on committees we feel are not inclusive enough,” Barclay said. “All that does is further distinguish between the communities that we have together and make it less cohesive by kind of saying that you need additional help to be integrated into our community.”
Elm Yard Representative Michael Y. Cheng ’22 said he thinks other methods — such as advertising or changing the UC election process — may be more effective in increasing representation on the Council. He said he is concerned the new position will not “meaningfully increase the representation of” communities historically marginalized on the UC.
“I’m afraid that it might be a feel-good position,” he said.
Huesa, in contrast, said she believes the position will not be purely symbolic, but she also argued symbolism is important in efforts to include diverse communities in the UC.
“I think the fact that we have a director of belonging and inclusion will also incentivize marginalized communities to think, ‘This is a space where I can be a part of,’” she said. “The fact the UC didn't previously have a director of belonging and inclusion might have also contributed to the fact that it might seem like an institution that only powerful white men are a part of.”
Other representatives said they think the new director’s role will demonstrate to the student body that the Council cares about promoting diversity.
“I think this is one of the best pieces of legislation that I’ve seen been passed on the UC during my time here,” Leverett House Representative Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 said. “Having been the only black female to have served on the Council in the past two years, there have been times when I felt like my voice has been silenced, or I haven’t been able to speak up for fear that it would be a direct reflection on my community.”
“When there’s not a diverse enough set of females in this type of arena, it becomes a bunch of men making decisions for us, which isn’t necessarily fair,” she added.
Palaniappan and Huesa also co-sponsored a constitutional amendment at Sunday’s meeting to restructure committees in the Council. Their proposal, if confirmed, would reduce the number of standing committees from six to five and would redistribute responsibilities among them.
The amendment would dissolve the Student Life, Student Initiatives, and Student Relations committees and divide their responsibilities among the current standing committees — Finance, Education, and First-Year Class — as well as among two proposed committees, Health, Safety & Wellness and Social & Residential Life.
Because the UC did not have a quorum present at Sunday’s meeting, representatives chose to postpone the vote on the amendment to the Feb. 10 general meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A swarm of students, locals, and tourists braved frosty temperatures for $1 soft serve ice cream and $5 pizza at the grand opening of Milk Bar Bakery and &pizza in Harvard Square Saturday. The new combo store sits at 1-3 Brattle St., filling the long-time vacancy left by the departures of Tory Row and Crimson Corner.
By the time the two stores opened their doors Saturday morning, eager patrons had already flocked to Massachusetts Avenue, forming a line so long it snaked down Church Street towards Border Café.
The opening of Milk Bar and &pizza comes after a slew of closings that has changed the landscape of businesses in the Square in recent months. The new store offers patrons both sweet and savory goods from the two popular chains.
Offerings range from Crack Pie — a pastry the menu describes as having “toasted oat crust with a gooey butter filling”— to pizzas drizzled with hot honey. The bakery also serves Boston-themed treats including a Boston cream pie “milkquake” — a milkshake blended with cookies or cakes.
Saturday’s festivities began at 11 a.m., when Milk Bar representatives clad in pink puffy coats distributed hand warmers and encouraged the crowd to dance and join in group cheers. At one point, a pickup truck bearing dozens of cases of Monster Energy drinks parked across the street and began distributing the caffeinated beverages to eager patrons — some of whom had been in line as early as 9 a.m.
&pizza ambassadors, including a number of College students recruited for the positions via email, helped to corral stragglers and make sure the customers who crowded the sidewalk stayed in line.
Some customers said they were drawn to the opening because they are fans of Milk Bar’s founder and CEO, Christina Tosi, a television personality and celebrity chef.
Maegan Cullinan, a student at Emerson College, said she has followed Tosi since the chef’s time on MasterChef.
“I got one of her cookbooks and started baking a bunch of stuff they sell here, so this is really exciting,” she said.
Patrons said they were determined not to miss the opening despite the line.
“Once you’re standing out there for 20 minutes, you’re like, ‘I can’t leave now or it wouldn’t be worth it,’” Emma G. Lanford ’22 said.
Milk Bar Chief Operating Officer Sujean S. Lee ’03 said she decided to open the store across the street from her alma mater because she wanted Harvard students to enjoy the bakery’s pastries and ice cream.
“Milk Bar to me is about creating a movement that encourages people to celebrate,” she said.
For those deterred from attending the opening festivities by the prospect of spending time in line on a frigid weekend, Milk Bar and &pizza are open until midnight from Sunday to Wednesday and until 2 a.m. from Thursday to Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the loss of two tenure-track professors who specialize in Asian-American studies, three student and alumni groups sent letters to University President Lawrence S. Bacow calling for a formalized ethnic studies program.
The groups — the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, and the Coalition For A Diverse Harvard — each sent letters to Bacow last week decrying the impending departures of Associate Professor of Education Natasha K. Warikoo and Assistant Professor of History Genevieve A. Clutario. The University decided in November not to put Warikoo up for tenure, and Clutario recently accepted a position at Wellesley College.
Members of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance Board of Directors wrote in their letter that they were “shocked” and “furious” to learn of the professors’ departures.
“In addition to teaching oversubscribed classes, they stretch themselves as advisors for too many students and as members of multiple committees addressing the need for Asian American Studies and for the greater inclusion of Asian Americans at Harvard,” the board members wrote.
“With Harvard's failure to retain important and beloved faculty in Asian American Studies, we wonder why Harvard's vaunted promise of diversity for the benefit of all students seems to exclude the faculty and academic programs in Ethnic Studies,” they added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Bacow has received the letters and intends to respond. Swain wrote that the University will not comment on individual tenure cases.
Warikoo confirmed in an email that she was not put for tenure and will be leaving Harvard. Clutario did not respond to a request for comment.
The groups’ recent letters are part of a decades-long effort by activists to push the University to devote more resources to ethnic studies. Since the 1970s, Harvard affiliates have issued 12 formal proposals to administrators, in addition to circulating petitions — including one in 2016 with roughly 1,000 signatories — and directly lobbying administrators. Activists also sent a letter to Bacow in June 2018 urging him to “create a home” for ethnic studies within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Sally Chen ’19, an organizer for the Ethnic Studies Coalition, said she believes Harvard should establish a dedicated program in ethnic studies to prevent the University from continuing to lose professors like Warikoo, who studies racial and ethnic inequality in education, and Clutario, who researches Asian-American history from a transnational perspective.
“These people, without central support, are going to leave,” Chen said. “It’s, in the long term, just a really significant waste of energy and money and resources to not put in the investment to bring people, retain them, and support them.”
“I think we’re tired of seeing band-aid solutions,” she added.
The College established the Ethnicity, Migration, Rights secondary field, then called “Ethnic Studies,” in 2009. In 2017, the Committee on Degrees in History and Literature established a field of specialization in ethnic studies.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay said in an October interview that she planned to recruit faculty who specialize in ethnic studies before making plans for a formalized ethnic studies program. She said she planned to meet with ethnic studies advocates this semester.
Activists are seeking more financial — and structural — backing from the University to create an ethnic studies program.
“We need a robust and interdisciplinary Department of Ethnic Studies that will equip students of all backgrounds with the language and skills needed to grapple with the critical issues of race and ethnicity of our time, including affirmative action,” Ethnic Studies Coalition organizers Juhwan Seo ’17 and Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17 wrote in their letter to Bacow.
Jeannie Park ’83, the president of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, said Asian-American activists have specifically criticized what they view as an imbalance between Harvard’s stated commitment to diversity — particularly during the ongoing lawsuit alleging the University discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process — and Harvard’s perceived lack of support for faculty and courses focused on ethnic studies and Asian-American studies.
”For the students and alumni who testified, putting themselves out there in a very difficult position sometimes, defending race-conscious admissions, talking about the incredible importance of diversity to their educations, it’s dismaying to then feel the rug pulled out from under them in terms of the academic program, which of course is at the heart of what Harvard does,” Park said.
Clarification: Feb. 5, 2019
A previous version of this article stated Warikoo was denied tenure. To clarify, the University chose not to put her up for tenure. 
Correction: Feb. 5, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Warikoo was not put up for tenure in December. In fact, the University decided not to put her up for tenure in November.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will consider a proposal to allow students to concurrently pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree at its first meeting of the semester on Tuesday.
Under the proposed program, students would be allowed to double-count up to twelve credits — or three classes — toward both degrees. The program would serve as a replacement for the Advanced Standing program, which allows undergraduates entering the College with enough course credit in high school to obtain a bachelor’s degree in three years or a bachelor’s and master’s degree in four.
The Faculty Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body — voted in favor of the proposal at its biweekly meeting last Wednesday. The Council’s vote, however, is purely advisory.
It is unclear how popular the proposed concurrent degree program would be if it were to take effect. Before the Advanced Standing program underwent a significant overhaul — expanding its reach to all undergraduates — in a decision that paved the way for the new concurrent degree proposal, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noël Bisson said that only a “tiny” portion of the student body chose to pursue Advanced Standing each year.
The faculty will not vote on the plan at Tuesday’s meeting, but could do so as early as March.
Under the proposed plan, students graduating in 2023 and before who were eligible for a master’s degree under the previous Advanced Standing program would be allowed to obtain one under the rules “that were in place when the students matriculated.” Students who are “uniquely qualified” and will be juniors at the College before the fall of 2020 would be allowed to petition the Office of Undergraduate Education to let them apply directly to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for a concurrent master’s degree.
Comparative Literature Professor Karen L. Thornber will present the proposal on behalf of the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The faculty will also discuss a proposal to rename the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies — which houses classes for the visual arts — to the Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies. The Faculty Council voted in favor of the proposal at its meeting last week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions prepare for the final stages of their ongoing lawsuit challenging the College’s consideration of race in its admissions policies, the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill is gearing up for its own legal battle to defend its admissions processes.
The two cases — both filed Nov. 17, 2014 — pit SFFA, an anti-affirmative action group, against the schools’ race-conscious affirmative action policies. Harvard’s case, in which SFFA argues the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants, went to trial in October 2018, and both sides are now awaiting post-trial arguments and final judgement. UNC’s case, however, is just getting started. Both sides filed for summary judgement in their favor Jan. 18, asking the case’s judge to make a decision without going to trial.
The cases have much in common — a shared plaintiff, a shared effort to dismantle affirmative action, and a shared possibility of heading to the U.S. Supreme Court. But they also each harbor key distinctions that lend insight into SFFA’s legal strategy and the cases’ potential outcomes before the court.
Central to the cases’ similarity is their plaintiff: Students for Fair Admissions, and more importantly, its founder and president, Edward Blum. In addition to these two lawsuits, Blum was also behind the high-profile affirmative action case Fisher v. University of Texas, Austin, in which Abigail Fisher — a white woman — argued that the school had discriminated against her by rejecting her and admitting African-American and Latino students with similar qualifications. That case, filed in 2008, went to the Supreme Court twice — first in 2012, and then again in 2015.
In both instances the court ruled in favor of UT. In the first instance, the court argued that the use of race in college admissions met its standard of strict judicial scrutiny and that the school’s system was “precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.” The second time, the court decided that UT’s interest in educational diversity was concrete and precise enough and that it could continue to consider race in admissions if executed in the narrowest possible manner, .
Between the UT case and the ones currently at hand, Victor Goode, an associate professor at the City University of New York Law School, said he sees a larger legal strategy at play in Blum’s fight against affirmative action.
“The attack against affirmative action at this point has a very simple ideological goal in mind, and that is simply to get the case before the current Supreme Court,” he said. “Since Justice Kennedy is no longer there, I believe that they hope that they can now end affirmative action entirely.”
Mishell B. Kneeland, a former Assistant Attorney General of Texas and one of the lawyers representing University of Texas in the 2016 Fisher suit, agreed that Blum’s strategy of pushing cases to the Supreme Court has not changed. But she said his strategy has evolved as cases are decided.
“He’s doing a good job responding to the precedent that came out of the Supreme Court in Fisher and adapting to that,” Kneeland said. “I think in the UNC case they used very specific language that came out of Fisher.”
Blum wrote in an emailed statement that the Harvard and UNC cases were filed before the second Fisher ruling was handed down, but confirmed his organization aims to convince the court to overrule precedents allowing race-based affirmative action.
“While the Fisher case never asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the use of race nationally, the Harvard and UNC complaints seek that outcome,” he wrote. “It is our hope that the earlier Supreme Court jurisprudence that allows racial classifications and preferences will be overturned one day.”
Despite the similarities between the cases, the nuances of their legal arguments bely the multifaceted approach Blum is taking in his attempt to eliminate race-based affirmative action. In the UNC case, SFFA is listed as a plaintiff alongside an unidentified white male. He alleges, similar to the Fisher case, that UNC discriminates against white students in its efforts to admit racial minorities.
“UNC has been basically accused of putting their finger on the scale in favor of African American and Latinx students,” Kneeland said. “It’s a different formulation than what’s been accused in the Harvard case, and so you can’t compare them the same way.”
In Harvard’s case, SFFA filed on behalf of Asian-American students, a unique “twist” in the case, according to Peter F. Lake '81, a higher education law expert at Stetson University.
The issue at at stake there, Lake said, is the question of “too much versus not enough” representation of certain racial backgrounds in college admissions.
“Asian-American students are claiming that a certain ceiling has been reached and after that it was hard to get in because of that,” he said. “In some ways that kind of claim harkens back decades to a period before the Supreme Court knocked down quotas in higher ed.”
One of the original challenges to affirmative action in the United States was whether quotas were permissible for achieving racial diversity.
Harvard and UNC also differ in that the former is private, while the latter is public. This impacts both the arguments available to them, and the likelihood that they can convince the court their practices are constitutional, Kneeland said.
“In the state cases, the state can say that it has a compelling state interest in achieving its goal, so under the Constitution you can’t discriminate against somebody but you can show a compelling state interest in something, such as diversity of the student body,” Kneeland said. “That strategy is not available to Harvard.”
Lake said the differences between the cases — which also include variations in UNC’s admissions policies compared with UT’s — are deliberate on SFFA’s part to try and convince the Supreme Court that these instances vary enough from the ones they’ve ruled on previously.
“The Harvard case certainly has that signature if they wanted it, to some extent so does UNC, because in the Fisher case, the Texas admissions process is very different,” Lake said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard spent $600,000 lobbying the federal government in 2018, a figure $10,000 less than the amount the University spent in 2017.
Though last year’s figure marked a slight decrease in expenses, lobbying costs have generally seen an uptick in the last five years as Harvard and higher education more broadly face a hostile political climate.
The University’s Office of Federal Relations worked to combat an “unprecedented” 1.4 percent excise tax on colleges and universities with endowments larger than $500,000, passed December 2017, according to its quarterly lobbying filings with the U.S. House of Representatives Office of the Clerk.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain listed in an email Sunday several of Harvard’s lobbying priorities including combating the endowment tax and maintaining strong federal research funding and student aid. Swain also cited securing legal protections for undocumented students under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to live and work in the United States — as one of Harvard’s areas of focus.
"The University is actively engaged in Washington on important institutional priorities that have an impact on students, faculty, staff, and our larger community,” Swain wrote.
Harvard’s lobbying efforts coincide with an era when the University and its peers navigate several legislative and political challenges — most recently, the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history, which temporarily ended last week. During the 35-day partial shutdown, more than 800,000 federal employees were either furloughed or forced to work without pay. At Harvard, funding lapses and restricted access to resources stalled some faculty members’ research projects.
Despite the shutdown, Harvard’s lobbying efforts did not increase in the last three months of the 2018 financial year. The University spent $5,000 less in lobbying in the last quarter of 2018 than it did in the same time period in 2017.
During the shutdown, Trump proposed exchanging temporary protection of DACA recipients for the funding needed to construct a wall at the United States southern border — a proposal Democrats have repeatedly renounced. In the later years of her more than decade-long tenure, former University President Drew G. Faust made advocating for undocumented students one of her top lobbying priorities, a precedent University President Lawrence S. Bacow has continued.
Since taking office, Bacow has met lawmakers in Washington, D.C., to advocate for legal protections for undocumented students. Roughly 65 Harvard affiliates were undocumented in the 2017-2018 academic year.
Swain also said advocating for those protected under Temporary Protected Status — a legal designation given to individuals from certain countries who have fled armed conflict or natural disasters — is another of Harvard’s lobbying priorities. Dozens of Harvard staff members who are protected under TPS still face uncertainty regarding their legal status, though a court order has temporarily stalled the Trump administration’s attempts to terminate the policy.
Harvard spent more on lobbying in 2018 than all other Ivy League schools. Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania, which spent $570,000 and $522,000, respectively, came closest to Harvard’s total, according to the schools’ filings.
Harvard’s lobbying expenditures fell between 2006 and 2012, according to its filings. In 2006, the University spent $760,000 in D.C. Beginning in 2011, Harvard’s lobbying expenditures remained below $600,000 — a trend that continued even as spending slowly increased until President Donald Trump took office in 2017 when spending topped $600,000 again.
Harvard maintains a federal relations office in Washington, D.C., to lobby the federal government year-round. The office employs four full-time staff members and the law firm O'Neill, Athy, and Casey — a group that specializes in congressional relations — for lobbying activities on Capitol Hill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Munching on mozzarella sticks, drinking beers, and cheering loudly for their teams, students crowded into common rooms and dining halls across campus to watch the New England Patriots take on the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl Sunday.
Though the game itself marked the lowest scoring championship in National Football League history, some students said they enjoyed watching Patriots quarterback Tom Brady win his record sixth title — or hoping to see him lose. Many took a break from papers and problem sets to watch the game.
Several students said they hoped the underdog Rams would topple the Patriots, who have played in three of the past four Super Bowls and won two of those.
“I just like underdogs,” said James L. Walkingstick ’21, who rooted for the Rams despite being from Oklahoma.
Motolani “Mo” J. Oyewole ’22 was even more vehement in his criticism of the Patriots. When asked who he wanted to win, he said, “Not the Patriots. They’ve got to let someone else have it. Patriots have been there so often, it’s just become predictable and repetitive.”
But for others, the question of which team to root for had to do with hometown loyalty rather than unlikely underdogs.
“I want the Patriots to win. I’m born and raised in New England, and I’ve watched the game since I was literally born,” said Nicolas J. Sleeper ’22. “As a young fan, I don’t even remember the first two or three...I still want more championships.”
Through the first three quarters, the game remained close. The Patriots scored a field goal early in the second quarter, and the Rams eventually tied the game with one of their own late in the third. Brady, however, connected with star tight end Rob Gronkowski for 29 yards to set up a short touchdown run in the middle of the fourth quarter opening the game up. The Patriots were able to hold on for the remaining seven minutes, tacking on one more field goal and stifling all of the Rams’ offensive attempts to mount a comeback.
As the two teams squared off, some students made sure they could be in front of a TV. A few minutes before the opening kickoff, more than 30 students swarmed into the dining hall in Adams House, where the game was projected onto a screen, and jockeyed for seats as the national anthem played.
At the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub, students crowded around the bar, surrounded by Patriots flags and banners that hung from the walls. Some entered a raffle in the hopes of winning a Patriots or Rams hat.
Students said the watch parties were fun, though some had more fun than others.
“It never gets tiring to keep winning,” Kenny G. Coplan ’22 said, as the Patriots held a 3-0 lead in the second quarter.
Prateek Pinisetti ’22 had a different opinion on the hometown team.
“I hate the Patriots,” he said. “First of all, they beat the Chiefs, and I’m a big Chiefs fans. And I just don’t like the Patriots.”
Ultimately, though, some undergraduates said they enjoyed the watch parties, even if their team lost.
At Quincy House, Faculty Dean Deborah J. Gerkhe brought bottles of champagne into the house courtyard after the Super Bowl ended, to celebrate the Patriots’ victory.
Watching Gerkhe spray champagne on raucous College students, M. Tyler Jenkins ’19 said, “I love football. It brings us together.”

With 5:03 remaining in the fourth quarter, the New England Patriots trailed the New York Jets 10-3 with the ball on their own 19-yard line.
It was the second week of the 2001 NFL season, delayed to Sunday, September 23 due to the tragic events less than two weeks prior, and the Patriots were hoping to avoid falling to 0-2 on the year.
Quarterback Drew Bledsoe dropped back to pass, surveying the field. Finding no open receivers and facing a collapsing pocket, Bledsoe darted right, scrambling down the sideline. Bledsoe approached the first down line to gain, but Jets linebacker Mo Lewis met the quarterback with force just in front of the marker. As Lewis barreled towards his target and Bledsoe pushed towards the first down, not a single person witnessing the play could have possibly foreseen the massive chain reaction it would cause. The collision between the two men would change the NFL forever.
The linebacker’s bruising hit knocked Bledsoe out of the game, and the Patriots sent in its relatively unknown backup, the previous season’s sixth-round, 199th overall draft pick out of Michigan, Tom Brady.
The Patriots would not win the game, but the team went on to win many, many more under Brady’s leadership. Every die hard New England sports fan knows the rest of the story from 2001: Brady unexpectedly led the team on a deep playoff run, taking home the franchise’s first Super Bowl victory with a 20-17 win over the then-St. Louis Rams.
On the eve of the next Super Bowl matchup between the Patriots and the now-Los Angeles Rams, sports media outlets across the country are rehashing the heroic storylines of the 2001 season.
But what of the man who launched the career that brought eleven AFC titles and five—possibly soon-to-be six—Super Bowl rings to New England? For former Jets linebacker Mo Lewis, his future would revolve around the basketball court with his sons and a current Harvard connection.
Junior forward Chris Lewis, drawn to the court rather than the football field like his older brother Mo IV, who played at the United States Naval Academy, has been an impressive force for Harvard Basketball since his arrival in Cambridge. The six-foot-nine Computer Science concentrator in Eliot House chose Harvard over multiple impressive suitors during the recruiting process, as the highly coveted prospect was ranked 68th in the ESPN Top 100 for the Class of 2020.
Lewis valued both identifiers in his role as a student-athlete, even touring the Massachusetts Institute of Technology down the Charles River from his current home on campus. Roughly 30 miles from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Lewis has settled a stone’s throw from the home of Brady’s illustrious career and deep into the heart of Patriots’ country. His father’s Jets squad is not the most popular team in the area, to say the least.
Long before Chris, Mo Lewis enjoyed 13 years in the NFL, all with the Jets. The fan-favorite for Gang Green played an even 200 games for the Jets, recording an impressive 1,231 tackles, 52.5 sacks, and 14 interceptions en route to two All-Pro and three Pro Bowl selections.
Although his tenure was wildly popular among Jets supporters, perhaps the most affected fanbase lives in New England, where Patriots faithful have enjoyed a sports dynasty the likes of which the NFL has never seen. Even the most ardent Patriot-haters cannot deny the impressiveness of Brady and company’s current run.
Perhaps the only silver lining for the growing contingent of restless football fans hoping for different champions—even if I would settle for a new Colts dynasty—is that Brady’s career is in its twilight. New England is quick to dispute this fact, claiming its quarterback is ageless and his tank bottomless.
While Brady seems to defy his age, my fellow supporters that have seen countless AFC playoff dreams crushed by the 41-year-old hope that the possible full-circle nature of a Super Bowl pitting the Patriots against the Rams is a sign that life without Brady may soon arrive.
This chain of events was started when the first domino fell as it was met with a crushing hit from proud Harvard father Mo Lewis. While I wish Marlon Jackson’s interception in the 2007 AFC Championship Game had the same significance, the shock of Lewis’ hit reverberated throughout the NFL and changed the game for good.
As the Patriots and Rams face off again, the legacy of that fateful tackle will surely be remembered and referenced many times. While this was a lasting impact for New England sports, Lewis would surely hold that part of his most significant living legacy in the area resides on the Harvard basketball team, through his son Chris.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A frigid January chilled students, solidified the Charles, and froze Harvard hockey, which posted a 1-5-1 record to kick off 2019. Only two days into February, the Crimson has undergone a much-needed turnaround, opening the month with a pair of victories over Ivy League and ECAC rivals Yale and Brown, shutting down the Bulldogs and shutting out the Bears.
Perhaps Punxsutawney Phil’s proclamation that “spring is just around the corner” applies more to hockey than to the weather — the Charles remains frozen, but Harvard is crimson-hot.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 0
The Crimson has struggled on power plays this season, notching a mere seven advantage-aided scores heading into the weekend. The power play proved key, though, in dismantling a hapless Brown team (5-16-2, 2-12-2 ECAC) that, after posting two early-season upsets over Cornell and Colgate, has gone winless over the past 16 games.
Despite outshooting the Bears 27-3 through the first, Harvard (7-11-3, 6-8-2) had only a tenuous 1-0 lead at the end of the period to show for its labors. Minutes of the second ticked by with plenty of Crimson domination but no Harvard scoring.
Then, with 11:23 to go in the period, Brown was called for interference. Power play, Crimson.
Seconds later, freshman defender Maryna Macdonald found the puck and handed it off to freshman forward Dominique Petrie near the top of the right faceoff circle. A laser sizzled through the air, skirting players from both sides to find a path between the goalie’s pads and into the back of the net. The crowd erupted, the band jumped to its feet, and Harvard had a score to match its efforts.
Aside from the security afforded by the second goal, all this — the crowd’s excitement, the set pass by Macdonald, the touch by Petrie — was familiar. With 11 minutes to go in the first, the Crimson had earned a power play goal with a similar set up and the same crew on the ice, with captain Lexie Laing passing Petrie’s rebounding shot off to senior defender Kaitlin Tse for the goal.
“One of our goals this week was to take the goalie’s eyes away and make sure we’re screening in front, so when those D-shots do get through, we have someone there to tip it and have a net-front presence,” senior forward Bradley Fusco said. “We really did that tonight, so the hard work in practice definitely paid off this week.”
This time, Harvard would strike again a mere two shots later — without a power play and with new lines on ice.
An assist from sophomore defender Kate Glover and sophomore forward Keely Moy gave Laing her second point of the day. The law of large numbers taking hold, the Crimson’s shots were finally finding their mark.
Two minutes later, a dish by Tse to a wide-open Fusco, who skated strongly down the ice to beat an advancing defender and have a clean shot at the net, completed the demolition of Brown.
Leading the Bears 4-0, with a 41-11 advantage on shots to close the period, Harvard entered the third with less fire but no less dominance, shifting the focus to shutout preservation. All 12 Brown shots were saved, earning junior goalie Beth Larcom her second shutout in as many games and earning the Crimson its second win of the weekend against an Ivy League foe.
“We don’t have an Ivy championship, so every game [against Ivy League opponents] is like playing for that championship,” Fusco said. “It really gets us hyped up.”
HARVARD 5, YALE 2
Looking to capitalize off of its first points in a couple of weeks, Harvard faced its age-old rival — Yale (7-15-1, 6-9-1). In a similar position in the ECAC standings as the Crimson, the Bulldogs matched Harvard’s intensity for the first couple of minutes of play. After a few minutes of evenly played action, however, the Crimson managed to tilt the ice with a decisive first goal. For the rest of the day, Harvard would never trail.
With 15:02 remaining in the first, sophomore forward Becca Gilmore, who has been in and out of the lineup with injury, ripped a shot from the slot that was stymied by the Yale defense. Bulldog junior goalie Tera Hofmann adjusted towards the far post to the deflected puck, but sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich beat her to it. Opportunistically pouncing on the rebound, Jovanovich wrapped a backhand finish around Hofmann’s pads and inside the post to give Harvard the 1-0 lead.
“I think we all came out flying, and we knew that this game was huge just as we want to move up in the standings,” said freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere. “I think with everyone pushing the pace and just crashing the net and getting lots of shots through helped us get the first goal and build off of it.”
Keeping up the pressure, just another minute later, Harvard generated a point black shot that required a deft glove save from Hofmann to keep the score 1-0. Despite the near miss, the Crimson offense would not be done for the period. Just a few minutes later, 10:47 into the first frame, Harvard cycled the puck to the point for a long-range blast from Macdonald. Weaving through traffic in front of the net, the puck found the top corner with both pace and placement, doubling the Crimson lead to 2-0.
Heading into the second, Harvard would stay on the offensive with a power play. While the opportunity did prove uneventful, a key momentum shift would break the game wide open for the Crimson, and one player would primarily orchestrate it. In the early second period, with the score remaining 2-0, Yale had just killed off the Harvard penalty, and its offense responded with some promising zone time.
Funneling the puck to the net, the Bulldogs found themselves with a shooter wide open in front. Harvard freshman goalie Lindsay Reed forced the shooter to a sharper angle and made the initial save, but on the rebound, the net was exposed. As Yale’s follow-up crept towards the goal line, Della Rovere came in from behind Reed to swipe the puck off the line and prevent the Bulldogs from cutting their deficit to 2-1.
After the goal line clear, Della Rovere was not done. Leading the breakout, she found herself in a one-on-one on the left side of the ice. At first, the Yale defense effectively angled her outside the dots, but Della Rovere was able to turn the corner just enough to muster a shot off the side of the net. Although the initial attempt did not get on goal, Hofmann prematurely slid towards center but the puck bounced right back to Della Rovere, who knocked it home for the 3-0 Crimson lead.
“I think it definitely started in the defensive zone,” said Della Rovere. “We kind of fell apart, but we stayed strong and just wore them down a little bit, so I think that, as I was able to skate, I just kind of had a little edge on her–a little bit more speed–and I was able to beat her wide.”
Just about two minutes later, Della Rovere would add to her and Harvard’s totals in a play that looked very similar to the Crimson’s first goal. As Harvard controlled possession and put a shot on net, Della Rovere was able to scoop up a rebound chance and bury the opportunity with a backhand, depositing the puck in the top corner.
“Faceoffs take five people,” Della Rovere said. “We kind of run our own system, and everyone followed their routes. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.”
Indeed, faceoffs proved to be a key to the Crimson success not only on the fourth goal but throughout the game. At the dot, Harvard beat out Yale 31-19, and the extra controlled possession gave the Crimson its edge, as other stats like shots on goal and power play opportunities stood fairly even.
“Faceoffs were a strength that we worked on this week because, last weekend, we were kind of weak on the faceoff dot,” Fusco said. “So, again, we focused in practice on making sure that we could win our faceoffs and control plays off of that. That brought us momentum, and practice paid off this week.”
Other than establishing control at the faceoff dot, another theme for Harvard throughout the game was crashing the net. Both the first and fourth goals came on rebound follow-ups, and the Crimson would look to add one more in a similar fashion.
After Macdonald unleashed a point shot, junior forward Kat Hughes collected the wide bounce off of traffic. Falling to her right, Hughes still managed to get the puck on net before the defense adjusted to the rebound ricochet, giving the Crimson its largest lead of the day at 5-0.
Macdonald proved to be the leading scorer of the day with three points (1 goal, 2 assists) followed by three players with two points: Della Rovere with two goals, Jovanovich with one goal and one assist, and co-captain and forward Lexie Laing with two assists.
The Harvard lead would stop growing at 5-0, and Yale would actually outscore the Crimson in the third, 2-1. Under a minute after the Harvard fifth goal, the Bulldogs’ sophomore forward Rebecca Foggia found the back of the net to break Reed’s shutout. Starting from near the blue line, she was able to cut through the Harvard defense and find an open pocket at the top of the right faceoff circle before firing through a screen and into the top corner.
With under two minutes left in regulation, Yale would capitalize on Harvard penalties and add a second goal on a five-on-three power play advantage. That being said, the Crimson’s efforts proved comprehensive, and Harvard had held the game in tight control from the second period onward.
With a rivalry win under its belt, as well as the team’s best scoring display in ECAC play, the Crimson would be heading into Saturday’s matchup against Brown as a different team than the one that played for most of January.
“We’re coming down to the final stretch of our season, so every point counts,” Fusco said. “It was nice to get that win…. We’ve just to bring that same energy and feed off of what we ended today and keep it rolling tomorrow. Saturday games are important to keep the energy. Like coaches said in the locker room, what happened today doesn’t matter if we don’t show up tomorrow.”
Harvard returns to play on Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the Beanpot Semifinals, where the Crimson will host No. 7 Boston College. The winner advances to the final on February 12, and the loser will play for third in the consolation game on the same day.

BOSTON, Mass. — Under the bright lights of TD Garden, anything can happen. As the Harvard men’s hockey team left the ice for a timeout, a last-minute miracle was exactly what it hoped for. With just 1:57 on the clock, Boston College junior defenseman Julius Mattila was whistled for tripping, putting the Crimson in the perfect position to tie the contest and send this Beanpot semifinal into overtime. The goalie was pulled. Harvard’s power play unit, the best in the NCAA heading into the matchup, took its position. The following two minutes contained net-mouth scrambles and desperate keep-ins, but no Crimson goal.
For the second year in a row, No. 17 Harvard (11-7-3, 8-5-2 ECAC) was served with disappointment at the Beanpot, this time at the hands of the Eagles (10-12-3, 9-4-3 Hockey East) in a tight 2-1 game. BC nabbed its first ticket to the championship game since winning it three years ago. In the process, the Eagles also beat a regular season non-conference losing streak dating all the way back to 2016.
“I thought the game was pretty much back and forth for the most part,” said Crimson head coach Ted Donato ’91. “For me, I was I think frustrated with the amount of time we spent in the box. It made it difficult for us to get any kind of flow in the game…. [BC goaltender] Woll made the saves that they needed late in the game.”
A disjointed first period saw Harvard outshoot BC, 8-5, but the Crimson could not capitalize on either of its power plays. Meanwhile, the Eagles had broken the ice less than five minutes into the contest. A promising rush for Harvard resulted in a turnover, springing three BC players away against a lone Crimson defenseman. Nifty passing courtesy of junior Graham McPhee put the puck on the stick of rookie Patrick Giles in the slot, who lifted it over Harvard senior net-minder Michael Lackey. The tally was Giles’s first career goal, giving his team a 1-0 lead.
“Hindsight is 20-20 there,” said Crimson co-captain Michael Floodstrand, recalling the turnover that led to the goal. “[Jack Donato] tried to feed it to me. It was a tough pass to handle, but I’ve got to have those kind of things… A good team like [BC] capitalizes on those.”
At the other end of the ice, junior goaltender Joseph Woll was a steady presence for BC, but had not faced a significant threat yet from Harvard’s offense. The team's vaunted man-advantage squad, operating at an efficiency of 34.3 percent coming into the game, hadn’t been able to set up as effectively as usual. Even worse, having already conceded a goal, the Crimson found itself in the box three times in the middle frame.
Twice in a row the culprit was sophomore forward Henry Bowlby. But luckily for Bowlby and Harvard, that was not his only mark on the box score. Midway through the second period, junior defenseman John Marino wove his way into the offensive zone, curling behind the net to center for Bowlby in the slot. His attempt beat Woll, knotting the game up at one. The teams traded chances through the rest of that period, but the scoreboard stayed the same for over 15 minutes of playing time.
The Eagles broke the stalemate halfway through the third period, again on an odd man rush. This time, rookie Oliver Wahlstrom dropped a pass for fellow freshman Jack McBain, who fired over Lackey’s glove for his sixth goal of the season. Wahlstrom, a former Crimson commit, collected his sixth assist of the year on the play.
“This year’s different,” said McPhee, looking ahead to the championship game. “Everyone in the locker room really trusts each other…. We know if we stick to our system we can get the job done.”
Harvard still had eight more minutes in regulation to bring the contest back to a tie. But penalties had hampered the team all game, and the crucial next few moments were no exception. Another trip to the box put the Crimson under pressure, and ultimately the squad was unable to regain momentum. The closing 6-on-4 was too little, too late.
The semifinal proved very different from the type of contest Harvard usually plays — and thrives — in. It was low-scoring, low in shot volume, and without a single power play tally. That goes both ways for the Crimson, which has struggled on the penalty kill but went a perfect five for five on Monday evening. BC’s aggressive PK certainly benefited from the standout performance of Woll (.964 SV%), who looked in control throughout the game.
“I told Joe Woll, ‘Make a lot of saves,’” joked Eagles coach Jerry York when asked about the team’s penalty-killing strategy. “Your goalie has to be your best PKer. We tried to key in on Fox... [since] he distributes the puck so well…. And we got lucky, we got some bounces too.”
The Eagles did succeed in limiting Harvard’s considerable offensive talent. Of the Crimson’s top five scorers, only one, sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh, picked up a point on the night. The usual suspects, like junior blue-liner Adam Fox and rookie forwards Casey Dornbach and Jack Drury, were held to three shots each, though Fox did hit the pipe with one of those tries. Meanwhile, co-captains Floodstrand and Lewis Zerter-Gossage, who stole the show against Dartmouth on Friday, were held to two shots and one shot respectively. Harvard’s own defense corps blocked 17 BC attempts on the night, but could not entirely keep the Eagles to the perimeter — both BC goals came from the slot.
A consolation game awaits the Crimson next Monday, against the loser of the semifinal matchup between Northeastern and BU. But while the team’s Beanpot hopes have been quashed, conference play continues this weekend against No. 20 Union. If Harvard wants to fulfill its playoff aspirations, it will need to regroup quickly and return to its winning ways.

Love It: “Waking up in the morning makes my day” by Maya S. Bhagat
Everyone said they’d be so bad, but I don’t see what all the fuss is about. 9 a.m.’s allow you to get a significant chunk of work out of the way bright and early. I mean, how productive are you really going to be after a poorly scheduled club meeting in the evening? Also, 9 a.m.’s are the first step to clubbing all your classes in back-to-back order to avoid those unproductive one hour and 15 minute spells. Seriously, that is not enough time to do quality studying or (more importantly) take a good nap.
Another reason I appreciated 9 a.m.’s was that I had an excuse to duck out of those late evening PSET sessions with friends — you have to sleep in order to adequately focus in class the next day. Plus, more sleep equals more brain power in the morning, so I can actually make a good impression on my TFs.
Even though I’m not a morning person myself, I always had a quiet dining hall to look forward to during breakfast, to sleepily contemplate the day ahead, or get a table to myself to work. No one saw me that one time I broke a bowl, and I got to see the lovely face of my 9 a.m. friends to brighten up the rest of the day. Being an international student means juggling time differences, and the morning is always the best time for me to be online or catch up with family and friends via telephone.
I already feel my lack of 9 a.m.’s this semester acutely somewhere deep down in my soul. This semester will be passed in mourning as I try to finish my work in the glow of the 9 a.m. sunlight.
Hate It: “9 a.m.’s make me feel like death why do they exist, again?” by Kiana Ziadkhanpour 
I thought I could handle them. I had woken up every morning at 6:20 a.m. for the past four years, so I naively believed that I could deal with waking at 8 a.m. on a daily basis. Week by week, I found myself waking up later and later, dragging myself to class — the quality of outfits and critical thinking skills dropping with the temperature. Sure, it was nice to have an important obligation (class) to wake me up on a daily basis, but the amounting pain (hunger) of inevitably missing breakfast each morning set a bad tone for the day, especially on Thursdays when I had class back-to-back from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. After last semester, I promised myself I would do everything possible to avoid another 9 a.m., but with the new schedules increasing the frequency of early morning classes and my sections and lab times increasing, I knew my chances were slim. Amazingly, though, my earliest class now starts at 10:30 a.m. (so grateful), leaving me ample time to have the most important meal of the day (pumpkin seed butter!).
Now though, even on cold and dreary mornings, I find myself waking up early (sometimes even before 8 a.m.!), and only rarely is it because of nightmares of missing class. Who would have thought that without the weight and pain associated with a 9 a.m., the idea of waking up doesn’t seem as difficult? Turns out that my hate of 9 a.m.s isn’t so much associated with the prospect of waking up early, but more so with being rushed and not having time to ~myself~ first thing in the morning.
So as we begin to settle into our classes for the semester, I am happy to say that I will be warm and cozy in my dorm, taking my time getting ready, or maybe getting an extra hour of sleep, while the world around me has to deal with the concept of 9 a.m.’s.
