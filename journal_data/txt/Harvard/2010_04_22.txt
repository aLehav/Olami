After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, Rockingham County Commonwealth’s Attorney Marsha L. Garst and more than a dozen police officers raided the James Madison University campus newspaper, The Breeze. They ordered the staff to turn over pictures taken at Springfest, an annual campus party that police broke up this year because it turned into a riot. On Friday, police entered The Breeze’s newsroom with a search warrant and threatened to seize all cameras, computers, and other documents unless the photos were turned over. Left with no choice but to hand over the photos, Breeze Editor-in-Chief Katie Thisdell complied. The police confiscated 926 photos, only 682 of which were pictures of the riot. Forcing The Breeze to hand over its unpublished photos violated the integrity and indepence of journalism.
This incidence of search and seizure oversteps legal authority and is a violation of the Privacy Protection Act, which states that it is illegal to forcefully take unpublished material from a journalism source—an act Thisdell cited when the police entered the newsroom. Because student journalists should be protected in the same way that full-time journalists are, the police had no right to demand material that the newspaper is entitled to keep private.
Moreover, the secrecy surrounding the situation is wholly unjustified. Rather than issuing a sealed affidavit that can remain sealed for up to a year, the judge who permitted the seizure should have issued a subpoena and introduced more transparency into the proceedings.
Even if the police technically possessed the proper documentation to enter the newsroom, they inappropriately exercised their force by intimidating the staff and threatening to confiscate other items besides the photos. Demanding the photos was wrong on its own, but threatening to shut down the entire operations of a paper showed even bigger disregard for the newspaper’s rights.
In spite of the trying circumstances, we believe Thisdell should be commended for how she handled this situation. By citing the Privacy Protection Act when the police initially requested photos, Thisdell not only attempted to protect the transparency and honesty of her school’s newspaper, but also made a statement about how college newspapers have the same rights as other journalism outlets. She acted in the best manner she could have, given the circumstances.
The photos are now being held by a third party until a judge can rule on the issue, and The Breeze is currently receiving legal advice on the case. Garst could face a fine for violating the Privacy Protection Act if the case goes in favor of The Breeze. Hopefully, the situation will be resolved in a way that will teach the authorities a lesson about the value of free speech.
Student newspapers are respectable journalism outlets and should be treated as such. The Breeze and all other student newspapers should receive the coverage of the Privacy Protection Act, which protects a principle that journalists and Americans pride themselves on—the principle of free speech.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I woke up one morning after four hours of sleep to find 44 new e-mail messages in my inbox. Forty-two had been sent over the “Pf-Open” list, and the remaining two were the only ones relevant to my interests. It was disheartening to have to mark all the Pf-Open messages “opened,” promising myself that I’d read them when I got the time. I might as well have relegated them all to the spam folder.
Those who treat the majority of open-list messages as spam should be allowed to opt out of receiving them while retaining what they view as the benefits of being on the list.  These benefits include notifications about upcoming on-campus opportunities, speakers, and performances that many individuals would care to know about—few would want to miss out on Bill Gates at Sanders, Kid Cudi at Yardfest, or even the free CamelBak water bottles at the Malkin Athletic Center. Additionally, queries from underclassmen or from various list members asking for assistance provide chances for other members to serve as guides and mentors. They also provide answers to questions that others may have as well. Who knew, for example, that Harvard students could use the parking lot at the elementary school behind Comstock Hall?
But the subsequent message threads that branch from such useful pieces of information fill up our inboxes and drive us to exasperation, leaving the useful bits few and far between. List members are left to glean the most valuable pieces from a sea of nonsense. We should not have to wade through eight different phrasings of the same question to finally find out what to do with the census form. It’s as though we are stuck in a new era of gold mining, filtering out the majority of what we see just to gratify ourselves with a pertinent prospect here and there. The lists often seem to be abused for casual conversation, and this abuse is something that many list members could do without. Personal views on a game of Assassins versus a game of Humans vs. Zombies, however strong, do not need to be broadcasted to the masses.
The use of open lists for casual conversation crosses the fine line between utility and spam. Open e-mail lists should ultimately serve as forums for constructive discussion and only occasional entertainment. Not everyone on a list needs to be privy to the banter between a few members. Instead, the best way to allow community spirit to flourish online non-invasively would be to create an online forum where members can post topics rather than send them to an entire list; those who are interested can reply while those who are not interested do not remain subjected to the random thoughts of others. It creates a win-win situation for all without clogging any inboxes, and it continues to build a sense of community by providing an opportunity for members to voice their opinions.
Ultimately, the question of whether open-list messages serve a purpose seems to be a matter of personal preference. For some, the epitome of captivating open-list discussion is Pf-Open’s “First Ever Pfopen Novelty Account Flame War Thread,” a 76-and-counting-message thread begun over spring break in which members posted under the pseudonyms of Sigmund Freud, Mary Tudor, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Master Yoda, among others. Though the ensuing conversation was initially bewildering and utterly bizarre, it eventually made for a highly entertaining read despite its seemingly random postings. “Digressed, this thread has,” Yoda astutely proclaimed at one point.
But a little listlessness is sometimes a good thing—perhaps Yoda in his wisdom could have gone on to say, “Unnecessary, this thread is.”

“This is an extraordinary situation,” reads the Norwegian Air website, with the Scandinavian penchant for stony understatement. Vulcan, Roman god of fire and the being after whom volcanoes owe their name, is emptying his lungs this week, blowing out a slow stream of smoke and ash that drifts eastward still. While commentators grapple with the name of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull—its ancient, unpronounceable appellation—European airlines as far east as Moscow are choking under the strain, losing hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds and transfers as whole departures columns read “Cancelled.” England, perhaps hardest hit, even announced it would send Royal Navy warships to rescue stranded Britons.
“It is impossible to attain the depths of reality by describing its surface manifestations,” a German writer once wrote. Something about this goes beyond the mere fact of the ash or any inconvenience. The volcano opened a window onto a reality that resists explanation, becoming a hot primeval eruption to counter the cold steel of airports, the efficiency of modern infrastructure. Ancients thought the clouds of dust emerging from the Sicilian crater Vulcan’s lip were the industry of the god’s forge as he beat out thunderbolts for Jupiter. Some of the incredulity behind that legend-making became comprehensible as in the midst of trying to arrange alternate routes home, punching variation upon variation of possible routes into the computer, one could see passengers and officials look up in amazement, turn to one another, say: “An Icelandic volcano…”
From the ground in western Europe, the sky looked dazzlingly blue; it was hard to believe anything had happened at all. Like the Airborne Toxic Event in Don DeLillo’s “White Noise,” its invisibility added to its incomprehensibility. But unlike in the novel, the volcanic ash is not something man-made; that it comes from nature, and yet seems so foreign, makes it all the stranger. Sartre wrote that “Dissemblers arrange to keep secret dimensions to themselves, like the Russian whose friends told me: he has twelve storeys of sincerity, you have only reached the fourth. This type is always silent.” Nature is the greatest dissembler of all: Remaining silent, her mystification is broad.
For me, the ash meant 23 hours of trains from Copenhagen to Prague, including four transfers in small German towns. Others, including students trying to get back from spring break, faced far more arduous journeys by bus or ferry. At railway stations, taxi drivers waving cardboard signs advertising rides for thousands of euros weren’t doing bad business. DeutscheBahn overbooked in trying to get people home, and for a few hours of the journey we passengers without seat reservations sat on the ground between wagons with legs drawn up beneath us, near the lavatory and the kitchen trash, making light of the cramped space. Outside, the Hamburg region rolled by in a magic lantern of luminous green grass, black pines, and farm houses. A French couple placated their crying baby in stroller with multiple petits gateaux; a Czech woman, tabloid in lap, stared for a while at the no-smoking sign and then lit up. Everyone found their way of coping.
This volcano, so mystical, has a history of confusion. When it erupted in 1821, it did so for months, resulting in flooding from glacier runs and heavy ashfall; a full year later, puzzled farmers looked on in wonder as hundreds of cattle died from what would later be known as delayed fluoride poisoning from the ash. The range of emotions to which the volcano has given rise, from frustration, to doubt, to fear, affect everyone. Much culture is nationalistic and specific—even as globalization expands brands like Coca-Cola and the Black Eyed Peas, artists turn inward to create specific products like wicker baskets or plum wine or marionettes. But the natural event transcends. As the art critic John Berger put it: “The notion that art is the mirror of nature is one that only appeals in periods of skepticism. Art does not imitate nature, it imitates a creation, sometimes to propose an alternative world, sometimes simply to amplify, to confirm, to make social the brief hope offered by nature. Art is an organized response to what nature allows us to glimpse occasionally. Art sets out to transform the potential recognition into an unceasing one. It proclaims man in the hope of receiving a surer reply… the transcendental face of art is always a form of prayer.”
And so, this volcanic eruption is far more than just an inconvenience to passengers at Heathrow, or a less impressive Krakatoa, as Simon Winchester suggested in the International Herald Tribune this weekend. As of this writing my flight to London has just been cancelled; it will be a long trip home. Peering into the dark heart of the crater the only appropriate emotion seems to be awe and a profound humility as the volcano continues to release its ash, fascinating scientists, eluding comprehension, defying human control.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Diversity involves more than skin color and sex. True diversity also considers a person’s political and social ideology. Sadly, that does not seem to be the case at Harvard University.
In a recent class, my professor took a blind poll of all the students’ political affiliations. Of the 40 students polled, I was the only conservative Republican. The vast majority of the class was liberal, including the professor—he had served in the Clinton administration. In my short time at Harvard I have taken courses at the law, business, government, and education schools, and every class has had a similar make-up.
I felt alienated as usual, but I had to laugh as I looked around the room. Thirty of the 40 students were female, and almost 50 percent, including myself, were “students of color.” President Faust would have been overcome with euphoria to walk into our lecture and observe the “diversity.” As I sat alone in a classroom of peers, I realized that diversity at Harvard is an intellectual joke.
I was deeply concerned with President Faust’s recent letter in which she boasted of her own leadership and the great strides that she has made to promote diversity.  I applaud her efforts—they have resulted in several impressive gains.  However, President Faust mentions only “women and minorities” as her focus for diversity.  She naively assumes that more females and minorities will automatically guarantee different ideologies in the classroom.  This is trickle-down diversity, and it does not work.
It seems that in her mind, irrespective of your way of thinking, if you have colored skin or two X chromosomes, then you are diverse.  This is an incomplete and prejudicial definition of diversity.  If there are 10 Black, 10 Latino, and 10 Native American students (with an equal number of males and females) all of whom are conservative Republicans, then do you really have diversity?  At our nation’s most esteemed academic institution, the answer should be an impassioned “NO!”
Furthermore, attaching a personal characteristic to an externality is the beginning of bigotry. To say that Native American equals alcoholic, or White equals can’t jump, or female equals diverse; all of those statements have prejudice at their roots.
Is there some value to giving special treatment to race, culture, and gender? The Supreme Court thinks so (Grutter v. Bollinger), and I completely agree. But I am also proposing a paradigm shift to the view that political and social ideologies are equally important factors in true diversity.
President Faust’s letter references Harvard’s 2005 task force that conducted two comprehensive surveys of diversity.  The conclusions of that research focused exclusively on race and gender.  Harvard spent $50 million on this task force.  However, not a dime has ever been authorized to study Harvard’s disparate inequity in political ideology.
Shouldn’t our country’s greatest minds place a higher value on diversity of thought? We see the viewpoints of our administration in their political affiliations—on July 26, 2004, President Faust contributed $2,000 to John Kerry’s campaign.
I know I am not the first conservative to bemoan the liberal bias of the Ivy League. It is also true that more liberals than conservatives choose careers in academia. Nevertheless, Harvard is cheating their liberal students by having an overwhelmingly liberal faculty, because neither must vehemently research and defend their views during class debates. Recently I had a face-to-face meeting with Dr. Lisa Coleman, our new Chief Diversity Officer, and I was very encouraged by her willingness to listen and consider these points. I implore her and President Faust to include “political and social ideology” in Harvard’s official definition of diversity. This would be the first step toward Harvard intentionally hiring more conservative professors. Such a balance would behoove Harvard’s faculty, students, and reputation.
Finally, instead of surrounding himself with a team of rivals, it is well documented that George W. Bush’s cabinet was filled with like-minded individuals. There was not enough diversity of thought or opinion, and many consider this a fatal flaw of his administration. Does Harvard’s leadership realize that they are making the same mistake?
I yearn for the day when our school becomes a beacon to the world by proclaiming to students that their minds are more important than their skin or sex. As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another. Unfortunately, when it comes to diversity of thought, Harvard University is dull indeed.

Tonight’s dinner hasn’t traveled very far to get to your tray—most of it is locally and sustainably grown as part of Harvard University Dining Services’ Earth Day Dinner.
The meal will take place during normal dining hours and feature items from local farms that were produced using sustainable techniques, including borscht soup made from local beets, Maine lobster bisque, locally baked sourdough rolls, and locally made ice cream and four-berry pies, among other items.
“The Earth Day dinner is a HUDS festive meal, happening in every dining hall,” said HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin. “It is made up almost entirely of local, organic or sustainably raised ingredients.”
Unlike last week’s Haiti dinner, which focused on fundraising, Martin said, the Earth Day dinner is aimed primarily at raising awareness of Earth Day.
The meal is part of a campus-wide “Earth Week,” a celebration of the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, which started on April 22, 1970. Harvard’s Earth Week, which will actually span 10 days, started on April 14 and will include the first annual Harvard Green Carpet Awards on April 23, which will honor staff, students, and faculty who have made significant contributions to reducing the University’s greenhouse gas emissions. The celebration will culminate with tours of the new Harvard Garden near Lowell House on April 24. The garden opened on April 17, and is a joint effort of the Food Literacy Project and the Office for Sustainability, along with other organizations.
Members of the Harvard Environmental Action Committee, a student  group focused on promoting sustainability and environmental protection, said they applauded the HUDS effort.
“HUDS has shown a strong commitment over the years to sustainability,” said Jackson S. Salovaara ’11, an EAC officer. “We the students are impressed and appreciative of their ongoing effort through one-day events like this dinner and ongoing programs like the Food Literacy Project.”

Now that biology professors have begun the exodus from their long-standing Cambridge facility to make way for the incoming stem cell researchers, the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department’s plans to eventually inhabit the Allston Science Complex are growing increasingly uncertain.
To accommodate SCRB, some members of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology are currently in the midst of a two-month move-out from the Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building.
SCRB had originally been slated to move into the Science Complex, long heralded as the centerpiece of interdisciplinary research in Allston. But with the Dec. 2008 news of the slowdown in Allston construction, the University decided to relocate the SCRB to Fairchild.
To date, the University has not publicly indicated whether the moves planned for the MCB and SCRB departments are permanent measures, creating an uncertain timeline for the construction of the Science Complex.
It remains unclear when the structure will reach completion—and, if it does, which units will eventually occupy the building.
“It is premature to speculate on what departments or programs may or may not be settled into Allston and when,” wrote Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal in an e-mailed statement.
The lack of clarity surrounding SCRB’s long-awaited move into the Science Complex has raised the possibility that the stem cell researchers, once situated, will not leave Fairchild in the near future.
These circumstances have left the soon-to-be former residents of Fairchild in a standstill. Whether the MCB professorswill ever return to Fairchild seems to depend upon the duration of SCRB’s occupation of the building.
“The general understanding is that Allston will someday come alive, but now it’s quite vague,” said MCB Executive Director Susan H. Foster. “We just are living for today.”
MCB Department Chair Catherine Dulac said that the scope of the renovations resulting from the transitions indicate that MCB’s move out of Fairchild is likely a “permanent” change.
Even in the unlikely case that SCRB eventually moves into the Science Complex, MCB professors will be hard-pressed to return to Fairchild, given the difficulties of moving and renovating laboratories, Dulac said.
SCRB expects to move into the gutted and renovated Fairchild building by the fall of 2011 and will remain “for the foreseeable future,” said SCRB Executive Director Kathryn L. Link. “It really all depends on what the University decides about the extended campus.”
Last December, the University formally announced that construction on the Science Complex would be held indefinitely due to financial constraints, but administrators have provided no timetable for its future, nor have they been clear about what form the building will ultimately take.
In a March interview with The Crimson, Bill Purcell, one of the co-chairs of the Harvard Allston Work Team, said that the team’s recommendations for the future of Allston would not be determined by a specific schedule.
“While there are things that will require study over a period of time, this shouldn’t be something where the schedule becomes the driving force: the driving force is knowing the right thing to do,” Purcell said.
RETHINKING EXPANSION
Faced with the possibility of permanent transitions that will fill much of the currently available space, science departments and centers on the Cambridge campus may be forced to reevaulate plans for future expansion.
The decision to centralize SCRB—a department that has traditionally been dispersed across the Cambridge and Medical School campuses—into a unified space in Fairchild will force the departing MCB professors to join other members of the department in the Biological Laboratories and the Northwest Science Building.
MCB professors moving into the Bio Labs will occupy laboratories alongside other faculty members in the department, as well as much of the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
“It puts pressure on space,” said OEB Chair Andrew A. Biewener.
But he noted that space will only become an issue if OEB is faced with the opportunity to expand—a scenario made increasingly unlikely with the financial crisis.
“I’m not sure there’s going to be a lot of growth in FAS anyways,” Biewener said.
Administrators of the FAS Center for Systems Biology and the Center for Brain Sciences—early tenants of the recently finished Northwest building—said that their new neighbors from MCB will occupy space that could become relevant to the centers in the long term. But for now, they added, the space is going unused.
“A full house is always more fun than too much empty space,” said Bodo Stern, CSB director of research affairs, who added that the center will still have space for two to three more faculty members.
But Stern said that additional faculty searches down the line will depend upon available space—and the future of Allston plays a major role in predicting the amount of space that will be open.
“That is definitely going to be something that affects System Biology in the long term,” Stern said about the uncertain future of the Science Complex.

Change can start with a kiss.
This was the message of the LGBT couples who gathered outside the Science Center yesterday to lock lips as a message of LGBT pride and visibility. The seemingly simple event, participants said, had deeper social and political implications.
Joel Z. Yao, an LGBT tutor in Winthrop, organized the “kiss-in” as part of this month’s Gaypril celebration of LGBT awareness. He said that he wanted to support same-sex couples’ ability to feel safe in public spaces by situating same-sex love in the public eye.
“I want to encourage LGBT boys and girls to uphold their orientation and express affection toward their partners,” he said. “I see it as a tender gesture to show gay and straight are the same, because love is the same.”
Yao added that despite gains in visibility, LGBT people still face considerable prejudice.
According to Yao, although over the past two decades an increasing number of young gay men have come out in high school and are comfortable with their identity, many remain reluctant to express their sexuality—or even afraid to do so.
“Even on a campus that is pretty ‘gay friendly,’ there are still a lot of people struggling,” Yao said.
A graduate student—who said he preferred to remain anonymous because identifying the event’s objectives with a particular name would detract from its message of universal acceptance—agreed that LGBT people are often made to feel out of place, even when it comes to “simple” acts like expressing affection.
“Straight couples can kiss at their convenience, but I feel like I’m immediately drawing attention when I’m in public with someone I love,” he said. “I don’t want to have to fight to be a normal person.”
The kiss-in’s participants, many standing arm in arm with their partners, said that the prevalent perception in society that heterosexuality is normal and anything else is wrong has contributed to discrimination against LGBT individuals.
James F. L. Croft, a doctoral candidate at the Graduate School of Education, said that issues of discrimination and normalcy are deeply rooted in American culture, adding that “attitudes around sex and sexuality are  really screwed up.”
“Many people feel ashamed aboutsex, but it needs to be expressed as normal, healthy, and central to our identities as human beings,” Croft said.
He added that sex education propagates political and social opposition to open and honest sexuality, for gay and straight couples alike.
“If we don’t get the schooling right, I don’t think we’ll be able to live in a society where people have safe and healthy sexual relationships that they’re proud of,” Croft said.
When the bell struck one, he and his partner draped a rainbow flag around their shoulders and locked together in an embrace.
“Events like today’s kiss-in help people see same-sex love as a regular part of everyday experience, and that’s the change society needs. There’s too little love in the world to allow any of it to be censored.,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Microsoft founder Bill Gates called on the nation’s brightest young people to use their talents to engage with the world’s biggest problems in an address to a packed Sanders Theatre yesterday.
While he took care to not disparage those who enter high-paying careers directly after graduation, Gates said that the greatest impact will be made by those who devote their lives to fighting poverty, improving global health, and raising the standard of education.
“A lot of talent—a lot of the best minds—are going to sports or entertainment or investing or even to scientific innovation that is focused on the specific needs of the rich,” Gates said. “When you work on a baldness drug, it’s a little bit different than working on a malaria drug.”
Gates, a former Currier House resident and arguably Harvard’s most successful dropout, left the College in 1975 during his sophomore year. His return yesterday marked the first time Gates had visited the University since leaving his post at Microsoft in 2008 to become co-chair of his charitable outfit, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He was the keynote speaker at Commencement in 2007.
In yesterday’s address, Gates spotlighted two problems, health—in a global context—and education—in an American context—as the marquee issues that the upcoming generation should solve.
Gates said that both health and education can be improved by simple fixes with increased research, noting that while teacher quality has a significant role in improving student performance, it remains unclear what exactly constitutes an exemplary teacher.
After finishing his prepared remarks, Gates took about 25 minutes of audience questions, which covered topics from philanthropy to the role of the financial sector.
Benjamin M. Zagorsky ’12 asked Gates whether it was necessary to enter a public service career or if one could make a difference by earning money and then donating to charity.
“It helps to have people going into philanthropy jobs clearly, but I’m a student at Harvard, theoretically one of brighter minds in society. What should I be doing: putting my life to this service or amassing amounts of money to help people who are maybe better suited to that work?” he said after the event.
Zagorsky added that it was thrilling to speak with one of the world’s most influential individuals.
“I was just standing there talking to him. It felt like what it should feel like—he’s a human being and I’m glad he treated me like one,” he said.
Not all attendees’ questions were straightforward, however.
Claiming to be a Kennedy School applicant from Kazakhstan, one event goer asked Gates if he would pay his tuition to the school. Another attendee inquired about Gates’ “vacation” plans for the doomsday date in the Mayan calendar.
Yesterday’s address was part of Gates’ cross-country university tour, during which he planned to speak to students on five college campuses in California, Chicago, and Boston.
In an interview with The Crimson, Gates said the inspiration to speak at Harvard came from a desire to channel the passions of students towards worthy causes.
“Having awareness amongst these students about the challenges in education, the challenges in poor countries, I think that’s critical and it will help us make a lot of progress to have their open-minded, energetic thinking applied to these issues,” he said. “So I’m excited to hear what they’re thinking and what their questions are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Allston residents say they have been displeased with the level of communication they are receiving from the University about its intentions to expand into their neighborhood, the revelation that Director of the Institute of Politics Bill Purcell–who announced his resignation this week–will take on a role in the Allston planning process was cause for more frustration among community members.
Purcell announced on Tuesday that he would be stepping down from his job at the IOP to dedicate himself more fully to advising University Executive Vice President Katharine N. Lapp on development in Allston and to further his involvement on the Allston Work Team.
“I really know nothing about Purcell’s new position other than what I read on a blog post by some guy in Tennessee,” Allston resident Harry Mattison said. “We know very little about Purcell. The whole thing continues to be an enigma, and the sooner Harvard starts collaborating with its neighbors about our shared future the better.”
But the debate in the community over Harvard’s role has encompassed more than Purcell’s recent appointment.
Mattison added that he would like to have a better understanding of the goals and plans of the Work Team, a faculty-led group charged with recommending strategies for Harvard’s expansion into Allston. The committee was created in December after construction on the Science Complex ceased.
“There is no communication about what the Work Team is doing with the Allston community,” Mattison said, adding that Allston residents have not had a chance to meet as a group withthe team since an initial meeting in February.
Allston resident Bruce Houghton echoed these sentiments.
“We had one meeting a couple of months ago—and I never heard anything again,” Houghton said. “It seems sort of inadequate, doesn’t it?”
Mattison added that he took issue with the vagueness with which the University has communicated its vision for Western Ave. and North Harvard St., which he said Allston residents hoped would be a “main street” for the neighborhood.
Mattison said that while the University’s recent leases to non-profits such as the Earthwatch Institute–a citizen science organization–and the Silk Road Project–an organization that promotes artistic innovation–would have certain benefits for the community, they do not necessarily “fit into a plan to revitalize the community.”
Mattison added that he would like to see greater opportunity for the community to weigh in on the University’s choice of tenants for its Allston properties.
“What they are doing is showing up after they’ve signed a lease and sending us an e-mail about it,” Mattison said. “It’s certainly not a collaborative, joint-planning process.”
But some Allston residents disagree, countering that the vision of Western Ave. as the “main street” of Allston is overly simplistic.
“I think Western Avenue and North Harvard Street are really going to be unique,” Allston resident Paul Berkley said, referring to the mix of academic and commercial buildings he said he hopes will one day come to Allston. “I hate to put a label on it like ‘Main Street.’”
He added, “Any time Harvard finds a good tenant for any their vacant buildings I’m happy to see that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night marked the inaugural event of the second annual Gay Rights as Human Rights Conference with a film screening and discussion titled “Queering Development Practice.” Hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School as part of this week’s University-wide recognition of the month of Gaypril, the event addressed LGBT advocacy in developing countries.
“There’s often a domestic focus around LGBT policy issues because on the international level people think it’s too difficult to tackle,” said Sarah B. Bouchat, who organized the conference and is involved in the Kennedy School’s LGBT Caucus. “We want to address not only what the lives of LGBT people in developing countries are like, but how everyone in the broader community is implicated in advocating for rights.”
Bouchat said that this conference marks the beginning of what she thinks should be a longer discussion of LGBT issues in developing countries, and hopes that Kennedy School students can learn how to be helpful in cultures that are not their own.
Richmond P. Blake, a member of the LGBT Caucus who helped organize the conference, said that this event is especially important for the Kennedy School because of its focus on foreign affairs and international politics.
“As far behind as the U.S. is on gay rights, it’s still leaps and bounds beyond a lot of other countries,” he said, noting that in order to play a role in the international fight for rights, it is important to explore how to help developing countries become more accepting of gay people without imposing Western values or creating backlash in those communities.
Tommy Tseng, a master’s candidate in public policy at the Kennedy School, agreed that as students in policy, it is important to have an awareness of developing countries before starting to work with them.
“When working in cultures with restrictive or discriminatory laws we have to know how to adjust our programs to take into account different societies’ laws,” he said, adding that the conference as a whole would address issues of policy on a range of levels.
“The goal of the conference is to educate the student body and members of the community on LGBT issues, and we hope to use this conference as an opportunity to start a dialogue with allies of LGBT students,” he said.

In preparation for last night’s sex toys workshop, an array of multi-colored and multi-textured dildos, vibrators, lubricants, strap-ons, and other devices mimicking all forms of oral, anal, penile, and vaginal stimulation spread across the long table of Adams Lower Common Room.
Sex educator and sexologist Megan Andelloux led the workshop, which was sponsored by the Adams House BGLT Tutors, HLS Lambda, and Harvard Law Students for Reproductive Justice.
The event was part of this month’s Gaypril festivities, but was not targeted only at LGBT people, said former co-president of HLS Lambda and Adams House tutor Erika J. Rickard.
“This reaches beyond the LGBT community because straight people like sex too, not just the queers,” Rickard joked, clarifying that the idea behind the event was to explain that these things can be applicable to any gender or sexual orientation.
In response to Andelloux’s repeated emphasis on being happy with one’s body and oneself, Ez U. Cukor, a law student involved with both HLS Lambda and Harvard Law Students for Reproductive Justice, said that this sex-positive emphasis was an attitude that could benefit much of society.
“In high school you learn all the ways sex can hurt you,” said Cukor, adding that she hopes to see society become more accepting of various forms of sexual behavior. “I think the more chance people have to access this information, the more change there will be.”
Andelloux said that she teaches about sexual play and displays a variety of toys because traditional sex education often leaves people thinking only of the negative sides of sex.
“It’s important to focus on why people play, why they want to be touched, have orgasms, and explore fantasies,” she said.
In addition to explaining the collection of items on the table, Andelloux talked about basic anatomy, even bringing out a vulva puppet dubbed Veronica, complete with fabric clitoris and a rosette urethra.
“If you’re playing with the vulva, lubrication comes from here but the clitoris is up here,” she said, pointing to the appropriate areas of pink cloth. She said that clitoral stimulation and vibration are effective ways of reaching orgasm, but added that it was important to remember that an orgasm does not necessarily have to be the ultimate goal of sexual play.
“If you feel like you had a good time and lost control of your body a little bit, that’s what matters,” she said. “All these toys can be used to have an orgasm or to have fun and to play, and if it makes you feel good and it’s good for your body, why not?”
When asked what was the best sex toy, Andelloux had a simple answer.
“Fingers!” she exclaimed, holding up both hands. “You have ten sex toys with you all the time, and you can do tons of amazingly naughty things with your hands that we don’t give enough credit to.”
After passing a table full of sex toys around the room and testing the texture of multiple bottles of lube, most of the attendants left the event with pretty sticky fingers.

Filling out the 2010 Census may seem like just another boring piece of paperwork, but it is extremely important for states and municipalities, a panel of former mayors told an audience last night in the Lowell Junior Common Room during an event organized by the Institute of Politics to raise awareness of the census.
“There are a number of issues that are critically important to cities, and, yet, they’re not particularly sexy,” said former Mayor of Miami Manny A. Diaz, an IOP Fellow.
The results of the census determine the allocation of $435 billion in federal funding, the distribution of Congressional seats, and the provision of government services in cities.
“It has a dramatic impact on your ability to revitalize your city, and especially the neighborhoods that need it the most,” Diaz added.
Thus far, an estimated 71 percent of Americans have filled out the census, the panelists said, and census counters will begin going door-to-door next week, which, according to Greg J. Nickels, the former mayor of Seattle, might cause concern among some Americans.
“It’s safe, this isn’t going to be used as a tool to try and deport you or determine your immigration status, or anything else—you might owe the government money. It’s safe, it’s confidential, and it’s important,” Nickels said.
According to IOP President P. Kenzie Bok ’11, Harvard students have been working to help spread this message. The IOP Community Action Committee has worked with CIVICS—a joint IOP and Phillips Brooks House Association program that teaches civics classes in elementary and middle schools in Boston and Cambridge—to prepare a lesson about the importance of the census for their students, many of whom come from serially under-counted populations, Bok said.
The system of counting is imperfect, the former mayors said, especially when it comes to counting college students.
During the discussion, audience members said they were motivated to be counted in their home cities, because those areas might have a greater need for federal funds than Cambridge does.
IOP Director Bill Purcell said he sympathized with the students, but that the current counting system is necessary to produce an accurate depiction of the nation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From choosing blocking groups to navigating the rooming lottery, Harvard housing can be stressful. But the process can cause even more worries for students who feel out of place living with people of the same gender.
To alleviate at least that aspect of housing anxiety, the Office of Student Life has been working in concert with various student groups to develop a gender-neutral housing policy in which mixed-gender living arrangements could help students feel safer and more comfortable in their House.
THE NEEDS
Though students want to live with members of the opposite sex for a variety of reasons, the OSL prioritizes students with a gender-based need when accommodating requests for gender-neutral housing.
The official policy states that the OSL may, in consultation with the Houses, permit mixed-gender rooming groups “to accommodate students with a gender-based need—i.e., transgender students.”
The OSL met with the UndergraduateCouncil, the Transgender Task Force, and the Harvard Queer Students and Allies to determine this definition.
“The phrasing has been carefully articulated to serve students who may not feel comfortable identifying as transgender or transsexual, but for reasons related to gender identity or gender expression need what is legally considered a mixed-gender housing situation,” says Eva B. Rosenberg ’10, chair of TTF.
Officials say that fostering awareness of the different housing needs that transgender and gender-nonconforming students can have is key to creating rooming arrangements where students can feel comfortable and, above all, safe.
“It is extremely important that students with a gender-based need have access to housing in which they feel safe in their preferred gender identity and expression regardless of medical transition, pronoun preference, or other gender-nonconforming status,” says Rosenberg. She adds that safety includes a student’s physical and mental wellbeing in addition to protection from harassment or abuse.
‘INGRAINED ASSUMPTIONS’
Ryan R. Thoreson ’07—who collaborated with both the UC and the OSL in discussions on gender-neutral housing when he chaired BGLTSA, now QSA—says that though he appreciates the College’s efforts, the required separation of men and women, even by a locked door, raises questions about assumed gender roles and student heterosexuality.
“There are few barriers to choosing the roommate you’re most comfortable with, and gender is one of those barriers,” he says. “If it is an issue of student safety, the architectural limits should be something the administration thinks about for all students and not just students who are heterosexual or presumably in danger of sexual violence.”
Rosenberg agrees that the barriers to mixed-gender housing are based on ingrained assumptions.
“The premise of gender-neutral housing is that women are safer with other women, that men are potential sexual predators, and that sexual attraction is between members of opposite sex only,” she says. “Those assumptions are outdated and often don’t apply.”
Nonetheless, Rosenberg says the College’s attempts to cater to students with gender-based needs have been forward-thinking.
“My interest as chair of TTF is to make sure that any future policies prioritize the needs of gender-nonconforming students,” she says, adding that the current case-by-case basis system is successful in fulfilling most needs.
THE PROCESS
According to administrators, students who put in a request for gender-neutral housing must consult with the OSL and their House about their needs.
Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh says there was some debate about placing students with gender-based needs in Houses that could better accommodate their needs architecturally, but that the OSL ruled to maintain the current housing lottery system.
“We wanted to continue the randomization process that allows the diverse communities we see in the Houses,” says McIntosh.
He adds that the OSL is working with the Houses to keep these students in the lottery without isolating them in singles far from their friends.
“We’re committed to trying to bring people from different backgrounds together while being as inclusive as we can of transgender students and others,” he says.
Rosenberg agrees that this is the best way to approach providing gender-neutral housing without making students feel segregated.
“Because the Houses differ so greatly, it’s almost impossible to imagine a blanket policy,” she says. “But it’s important to have a general policy to let students know their needs will be met and also an individual policy to put into practice.”
THE LIMITS
Though differences between House structure make a universal solution unrealistic, the Report on Harvard House Renewal—which includes guidelines for the physical renovation of the Houses aimed to enhance residential life—includes recommendations that “examine housing policies related to the availability of gender-neutral housing.”
In order to make such living arrangements an architectural possibility, the Report suggests eliminating walkthroughs and fitting locks on all bathroom doors and private bedrooms within suites, as the College policy requires that bedroom occupants be of the same gender even in mixed-gender suites.
According to McIntosh, housing students of different genders in separate bedrooms with personal bathrooms within the same suite is difficult in certain Houses.
“We can’t put locks on many of our bedroom doors because many times locking a door prevents access to either a bathroom or a mode of egress,” he says.
He adds that the OSL determined which suites in which Houses could fit these architectural requirements for gender-neutral housing.
“We can provide gender-neutral housing in every House but there are significant constraints given the number of students living there,” he says, clarifying that bedrooms for more than one resident cannot be included because of the ban on mixed-gender bedrooms.
WHAT’S NEXT
Emphasizing the importance of providing for students with the greatest need first, QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11 says it is important to make the undergraduate population at large aware of the current policies. Though the current OSL website contains information regarding gender-neutral housing, this information is rather difficult to find, and it should not be presumed that the QSA or TTF will get information to people on a need-to-know basis.
“Whether with websites, House literature, or otherwise, this needs to be made as visible and explicit as possible,” says Chan, noting that greater visibility will benefit not only those who want gender-neutral housing, but will also serve as “an affirmation of the College’s dedication to gender-nonconforming students as a part of student community with a set of needs we all need to actively think about.”
The OSL is working to address these issues without appearing to require that students “come out” to the College. For example, the OSL is developing a database to manage information about preferred nickname and gender. Housing questionnaires now include boxes marked “transgender” and “other,” accompanied by a text box for self-identification.
Chan says most members of the QSA are pleased with the progress, but they add that more must be done.
“The onus is on the College administration to be proactive in disseminating information,” Chan says. “Inclusion and safety for all students is the college’s responsibility.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What better way to spend a beautiful spring day than by tossing a Frisbee around the Yard? For  the Harvard men’s ultimate team, it’s more than just a way to spend  the afternoon; it’s a pastime involving fierce competition.
The Crimson recently competed in the  first of two qualification tournaments for the National club competition  in the sport. Two weeks ago, the Metro-Boston Area Sectional welcomed  teams such as Bentley, MIT, Northeastern, Harvard, and Tufts to Rhode  Island for a weekend of tough rivalry.
“We made it to the finals [of Sectionals]  to play against Tufts, who is our biggest rival and who I think will  be one of our biggest rivals in Regionals as well,” co-captain Alex  Yang said. “Unfortunately we had a lot of injuries and we had a very  short roster that day. We did our best but we weren’t able to beat  them.”
The Crimson lost to the Jumbos by a  score of 12-9, but was able to come home with a second place finish,  dominating Bentley in the consolation match. With the strong weekend  of disk throwing, Harvard secured a place for itself in the regional  tournament on May 8-9, putting the Crimson one top-two finish away from  Nationals.
Despite training three times a week  in preparation for the upcoming games, uncontrollable factors such as  numbers and injury plague the Crimson on its quest for retribution against  Tufts.
“With a really short roster, it’s  tough to do well [in tournaments], just because by the end of the second  day, we’re just all so tired when so few people are playing,” Yang  said. “So right now, the first goal of our team is just to get everyone  healthy. We’re also just trying to make sure that all of our healthy  guys keep getting better.”
The team will be participating in a  round-robin tournament hosted by the Jumbos this weekend, where it  will get one last chance to see the some of the competition it will  face in May. For the seniors, there’s even more riding on this last  chance at a title.
“It’s my last year on the team,  and as a captain I’m really hoping that we’ll be able to make to  Nationals,” Yang said. “[The tournament] takes place the day after  Commencement, so if we were to make it I would actually be flying out  just a couple hours after Commencement ends. I think it would be great.”
“In the past few years, we’ve only  made it to nationals once, which was my sophomore year,” he continued.   “That year, we tied for fifth place in the nation which was our best  finish ever, so this year I’m really hoping we can do as well or even  better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot has changed for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team since it was soundly defeated earlier this month by No. 5 Virginia, 14-9. But in just two short weeks, the young Crimson started to come together, and, with a win over Princeton last week, put itself back in the playoff picture.
Harvard’s growth was on full display yesterday afternoon at Harvard Stadium when the young team took its latest top-10 opponent, No. 7 Dartmouth, to the wire.  But while the Crimson has come a long way, its efforts were not enough to pull off the upset.
Needing a win to keep alive a legitimate shot at making the four-team Ivy League tournament, Harvard (6-7, 2-4 Ivy) squandered an early two-goal lead, eventually falling, 11-9, to the Big Green (10-2, 5-1).
“I think it’s a disappointing loss because we were there with them,” said sophomore Melanie Baskind, who finished with two scores.” We’re doing things right, just not all the time. Overall, we hung with a top-10 team. We’re a completely different team than we were at the beginning of the season.”
After accumulating a 5-3 lead over the first 20 minutes of play, the home team allowed its opponent to go on a crippling 7-1 run that put the Crimson behind by four with just over 20 minutes left to play.
Harvard managed to claw its way back into the contest, rattling off three-straight scores to get within one with 7:30 left on the clock.
Freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen kept the momentum alive, winning control of the ball off the ensuing draw to give her team the possession and a chance to tie the game.
But two costly Crimson turnovers down the stretch allowed Dartmouth to get back in control of the contest.
“We’re all looking at that last possession as something we want back,” Baskind said. “We tried setting up a play and got pressured and ended up turning it over. It wasn’t too pretty.”
The Big Green capitalized on the turnover, as Hope McIntyre picked up a ground ball and sent the ball the other way. Hana Bowers gave Dartmouth an insurance-score with 2:40 left to put her team up 11-9.
The Big Green iced the match on the ensuing draw after the Big Green’s Hilary Smith pulled down possession of the ball, as Dartmouth managed to run off the contest’s final ticks and pick up its fifth conference victory.
“Overall, we did give it all that we had and gave Dartmouth a run for their money,” junior Sam McMahon said. “I don’t think we should hang our heads after [yesterday’s] game.”
The attempt at a comeback began when freshman Danielle Tetreault kickstarted the Harvard run, ending a 12-minute scoring drought with an unassisted score to cut her team’s deficit to two. VanderMeulen, the conference’s reigning Offensive Player of the Week, got in on the action minutes later, finishing a feed from Tetreault despite being face-guarded to put the score at 10-8.
After the Crimson offense worked the ball around quickly, Baskind finished an unassisted score to cut it to one.
“We came up with some big defensive stands,” McMahon said. “We let our attackers handle the ball and they put it away.”
But Harvard could not complete the comeback.
While the Crimson managed to make it a close contest at the end, things really got away from the home team midway through the contest.
After going up 5-3 courtesy of a goal from freshman Micaela Cyr with 10:34 left in the first half, things began to unravel.
Dartmouth’s Kristin Goldberg answered just moments later, sparking a 4-0 run for the Big Green over the next five minutes of play.
Cyr kept things from getting out of hand, scoring her second goal of the contest off a free position shot just 15 seconds before the break.
But the Dartmouth offense picked up right from where it left off, notching three straight scores in the opening 5:10 of the second frame to put the visitors ahead, 10-6.
Despite the late rally, the four-goal deficit was too much to overcome.
The loss drops Harvard into a tie with Brown for sixth place in the conference standings with one league contest remaining.

After winning its last five matches against five Ivy League teams, No. 65 Harvard (14-10, 5-2 Ivy) continued its dominance on the courts, as the team went on to take the final match of the season, 6-1, against Dartmouth (11-10, 2-4) yesterday afternoon at the Beren Tennis Center.
“I feel like the team overall played well in its second outdoor match of the season,” freshman Christo Schultz said. “Considering the conditions, we played a good match. There are many variables when you’re playing outside, and you can very easily get caught up in the distractions, but we were able to handle them well.”
The Crimson started off the match by capturing the doubles point by winning two of the three close matches.
Junior Aba Omodele-Lucien and Schultz teamed up on the top court, but lost the match, 8-5.
Junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans and freshman Joshua Tchan evened up the doubles score with a 8-5 win, followed by a 9-7 victory by freshmen Will McNamee and Andy Nguyen to clinch the doubles point. McNamee served two double faults in the last game, but redeemed himself by hitting an unreturnable backhand volley to close out the match.
“It definitely gave us confidence to win the doubles point going into the singles,” Chijoff-Evans said. “I feel that it was critical to win this match.”
The Crimson dominated in the singles, taking all but one match in straight sets. Playing at the No. 1 slot, Chijoff-Evans proved to be dominant against his opponent, going up 4-0 in the first set, and clinching the match, 6-2, 6-4, on a powerful serve that saw his competitor’s return go into the net.
“I took the match really seriously because my opponent was a good player,” Chijoff-Evans. ”I wanted to end my season on a pretty good record, so I was looking to get that last win.”
Schultz quickly wrapped up his singles match by the score of 6-3, 6-3. The lefty was dominant throughout the match. At one point, he leaped up into the air for an overhead smash. Tchan, playing at the No. 2 slot, wrapped up his match in similar fashion, with a big serve to take another singles point, 6-4, 6-3.
“I knew his game style and I just needed to focus on what I should do and the tactics I should play,” Schultz said. “He was playing a certain game style I’m good against as long as I’m particular about what shots I make and when.”
In the only loss of the match, Nguyen went down to his Dartmouth competitor, 6-3, 6-4. Down 5-2 in the second set, the rookie broke his opponent’s serve and held his own to bring the set within one game, but saw his chances at a comeback slip away on an ace from his opponent.
Though the contest was already clinched for the Crimson, Omodele-Lucien kept fighting hard to win his last match of the season. He broke his opponent to go up 6-5 in the first set, sending a strong forehand up the line and letting out a yell to send a message to his competitor across the net. Following this, he quickly took the next game and clinched another point for the Crimson, 7-5, 7-5.
Playing at the No. 6 slot, sophomore Mac McAnulty was the last man left standing on the courts, and he pulled out the longest match of the contest against the Big Green. The second set went all the way to a tiebreaker. With his team cheering him on, McAnulty defeated his opponent, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
With the win in the last match of the season, the Crimson squad looks to build on this confidence heading into next year. The team loses only one player in captain Michael Hayes to graduation next season.
“Fortunately, everyone who starts is coming back next year, which normally doesn’t happen,” Chijoff-Evans said. “We’re such a young team, and I feel like the sky’s the limit. I feel like we can be NCAA contenders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a wave of offensive momentum after back-to-back victories two days before, the Harvard baseball team (13-21, 6-6 Ivy) looked to stretch out its recent success into a three-game win streak.
But while the Crimson didn’t miss a beat on offense, it couldn’t put together the same consistent defense it showed on Monday against Brown, surrendering a 15-11 loss to UMass (8-20, 5-7 Atlantic 10) in the second round of the Beanpot yesterday afternoon in Brockton, Mass.
“We made some crucial errors we shouldn’t have made,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “That’s disappointing. We need to minimize those.”
On the offensive end, Harvard got going early by scoring three runs in the first inning. Albright earned the first two of his five RBI in his first at-bat. The star catcher sent home classmate outfielders Dillon O’Neill and Sam Franklin with a single up the middle. Two at-bats later, the designated hitter crossed the plate himself off a single from junior catcher Cole Arledge.
“We can score early and often,” Albright said.
But before the Crimson could strike again, UMass tied up the game with one run in the first and two in the second frame. Second baseman Eric Fredette was first on the board for the Minutemen, taking advantage of a catcher’s error. One inning later, first baseman Mike Gedman put up a two-run homer to tie the game, 3-3.
UMass was unable to build on its momentum immediately, and Harvard responded in the top of the third with another three-run inning, one which the Minutemen could not match in the bottom of the frame.
Once again, Albright sparked the Crimson offense, sending home Franklin with a double for his third RBI of the day and Franklin’s second of three runs.
“Tyler was really hot today,” Franklin said.
This time, with Albright in scoring position, it was sophomore Marcus Way who sent the captain home. The first baseman sent the ball through left field for a two-run homer that increased Harvard’s lead to three.
“We have one of those lineups,” Franklin said. “Anyone at anytime can hit…everyone’s clicking at a good time right now.”
Harvard matched its production in the next frame when it put up three more runs. Junior Sean O’Hara picked up an RBI when freshman Dan Moskovits scored on the shortstop’s ground-out. Soon after O’Hara sent home Moskovitz, Albright picked up his fourth and fifth RBI with a single that sent home Franklin and freshman Kyle Larrow.
But Albright’s final two RBI of the game marked the last time the Crimson would put up three runs in a single frame.
The bottom of the fourth marked a turning point in the game, as UMass powered through Harvard’s defense and never looked back.
“When we score runs, we need to come back in the dugout and suit up for them,” Albright said. “We didn’t do that.”
Instead, the Minutemen responded with an offensive outburst of their own. Gedman sparked the UMass offense by hitting his second two-run homer of the game.
The Crimson didn’t do itself too many favors on defense, allowing two unearned runs before the end of the inning.
“It was just one of those crazy midweek games,” Franklin said. “We made a bunch of errors.”
But even after the five-run outburst, Harvard still had a one-run lead. Unfortunately for the Crimson, it couldn’t put together strings of hits like it had earlier in the game.
Before Harvard crossed home plate again, UMass took the lead with a three-run inning of its own in the bottom of the sixth, with RBI from Mike Donato and Peter Copa to put the Minutemen up by two.
The two teams continued to trade runs, as the Crimson was able to tie things back up with up with two runs in the top of the seventh, the first coming from junior right fielder Taylor Helgren, who sent home Albright. Harvard’s final RBI of the day came on a ground out from senior pinch hitter Dan Zailskas, who sent Way home to tie the game back up.
But just as in the fourth inning, UMass had the last work, scoring two more runs than the Crimson had in the top of the frame. This time, the Minutemen’s outburst was enough to give themselves a four-run lead that would hold until the end of the game.
Despite the four-run loss, Harvard remains optimistic that it can bounce back as it heads back into conference play this weekend.
“We’re not too worried,” Franklin said of the loss. “We feel like we have a lot of momentum going into Yale this weekend…I think we’ll be okay.”

The Harvard women’s tennis team entered its season finale ranked 45th nationally and looking to add a final win against No. 56 Dartmouth (16-6, 3-4 Ivy) to its résumé as it makes its case for one of the 33 at-large bids to the NCAA tournament. The Crimson (14-7, 6-1) hopes to join Princeton (20-5, 7-0), which secured one of the 31 conference champion bids by going undefeated in Ivy play, in representing the Ivy League at the annual tournament next month.
Playing in the Big Green’s Boss Tennis Center yesterday, Harvard took care of business in dramatic fashion, defeating Dartmouth, 4-3.
“I’m so proud of our team, the way they fought today and hung in there the whole match,” Crimson coach Traci Green said.
Harvard opened the match with momentum by clinching the doubles point with 8-5 and 8-2 victories at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively.
“Our No. 1 doubles team of [junior captain] Samantha Rosekrans and [sophomore] Holly Cao really has been getting better and better the last four matches,” Green said. “They have been stepping up…[Freshmen] Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton at No. 2 have had so much energy out there and really led the way.”
In singles play, 73rd-ranked Cao defeated the Big Green’s 118th-ranked Molly Scott to give the Crimson its second point of the afternoon. The sophomore picked up her 15th win of the season while handing Scott only her third loss at No. 1.
“I played pretty well,” Cao said. “My back was bothering me a little bit. I’m glad that I finished the matched quickly and came away with the win. I just played my game and kept being aggressive. I kept the points short and hit a lot of winners, and that worked.”
Rosekrans had her eight-match win streak snapped by Jesse Adler. With the 6-2, 6-2 loss, Rosekrans moved to 13-7 on the season at No. 4 and gave Dartmouth its first point.
Tachibana concluded her rookie season with a convincing 6-3, 6-0 victory to put Harvard a point away from its second consecutive win over the Big Green. Tachibana improved to 14-6 on the No. 2 court this season.
“I was really ready to go,” Tachibana said. “This was one of the best matches I’ve had all season. It felt really good to end on that.”
Freshman Alexandra Lehman lost a hard-fought match at No. 6 to Georgiana Smyser. After dropping the first set 6-3, Lehman stormed back to win the second set by the same score. After taking a 3-2 lead in the third set, she lost the next four games to lose the set 6-3, bringing Dartmouth within a point of the Crimson, 3-2.
With only two matches to play, Norton had all eyes on her in the most contentious match of the afternoon. Playing No. 3, Norton pulled out a slight first set victory, 7-5.
In the second set, Norton quickly fell 5-1 to her opponent, Mary Beth Winingham. Unwilling to give up the set, Norton rebounded to win the next five games and take the lead, 6-5. After Winingham won a game, the set moved into a back-and-forth tiebreak that Norton eventually won 9-7.
The win gave Norton a 14-6 record at No. 3 this season and clinched the match for Harvard.
“It felt amazing,” Norton said. “It just felt really good to clinch it. I knew that I had to pull [the match] out and I’m really happy that I did.”
Finally, at No. 5, junior Agnes Sibilski lost in three sets to Carley Markovitz, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.
Having completed its regular season, the Crimson now must await the NCAA selection committee’s decision to see whether or not it will play in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2006. The team bracket will be announced on May 4, while singles and doubles tournament selections will be released the following day.
“Everyone is excited we are ranked 45th,” Green said. “It’s the highest we’ve been in a few years. We knew the ball was in our court. We’d love to make NCAAs, but if we don’t, we’ll go back to the drawing board and come back stronger than ever.”

What’s better: racing or  meeting Usain Bolt?
Members of the Harvard men’s  and women’s track team will decide for themselves this Thursday through  Saturday as the team competes at the University of Pennsylvania’s  116th Penn Relays. A squad of thirteen women and ten men  left earlier today to take part in the oldest and largest track and  field carnival in the United States.
The Penn Relays, which normally  draw an audience of 100,000 or more, ranks third behind the World Championships  and the Olympics in size and prestige.
While the Crimson’s first  race begins tomorrow afternoon with freshman Melissa Bellin competing  in the 400-meter hurdles event, the main highlight of the event will  take place on Saturday as Bolt and team Jamaica takes on team USA in  the 4x100 meter relay.
While Harvard will not be racing  in that event, the Crimson looks to challenge over 11,000 athletes from  other colleges in the country. Top events for Harvard include senior Jack  Brady’s performances in the shot put and discus throws on Friday,  and the hammer throw on Saturday.
The men and women’s 4x800  teams will also prove to be exciting events. The women’s squad, consisting  of junior co-captain Thea Lee, sophomore Meghan Looney, junior Hilary  May and freshman Carlyle Davis, will see top competition from both the  Ivy League and track powerhouses like the University of Tennessee, which  broke all four records in last year’s event and returns two of its  four runners.
The men’s side will be no less challenging for the Crimson’s  freshman Jeffrey Homer, junior Brian Hill, and sophomores Darcy Wilson  and Brian Paison, as 15 teams enter the competition with times under  7:20.

Beyond the Harvard women’s quest for a third-straight Ivy title, this weekend’s women’s golf Ivy League Championships will also bring the chance for a rematch between Crimson junior Mia Kabasakalis and Columbia senior Nancy Shon.
The two finished last week’s Roar-EE Invitational tied atop the leaderboard with scores of 148, but Shon’s one-stroke edge on the last nine holes gave her the win in a tiebreaker. It was Shon’s first individual title of her career and the Lions’ first individual title at their home tournament, which they hosted at Spook Rock Golf Course in Suffern, N.Y.
The Honolulu, Hawaii native earned All-Ivy status two years ago by placing seventh at the Ivy League Championships. The senior did not compete last season.
Given her recent success, Shon appears to be Columbia’s biggest threat, but teammate Stevy Loy, the Ivy League individual runner-up in 2008, cannot be counted out. The senior has the chance to become a three-time first-team All-Ivy selection this weekend after placing among the Ancient Eight’s top 10 as a freshman and sophomore.

Is the saga of Burgerman over—or is it just beginning? This past Monday, Samuel B. Novey ’11, the Burgerman of legends yore, ran the Boston marathon in a giant burger suit.
Why did this sociology concentrator in Adams House, a man of class and taste, choose to run the Boston Marathon, among the hordes of men and women who come from all over the world, dressed as a popular food item?
Why for charity, of course.
Novey, who ran the marathon as a “bandit,” meaning he wasn’t a registered runner, described the experience of running as “epic."
“Boston’s marathon is the greatest in the world,” Novey said. “It was great. I ran alongside two fries who also wanted to help out the cause.”
Novey is a volunteer for Citizen Schools, a national network of after-school education programs for students in the middle grades. Novey teaches a group of middle schoolers from Edwards Middle School in an after school apprenticeship at B. Good. In order to raise money from the program, Novey decided to run the Boston Marathon in a burger suit, collecting sponsors along the way.
But Novey says that the race is far from over for Burgerman.
Novey, who garnered the support of the Game Show network—which spent the day of the marathon filming him and donated $5,000 to his cause—said he has had more success than he ever expected, though he initially aimed to raise $100,000. He has currently raised $13,643, but he is still “counting.”
More importantly, B. Good has given Novey and his Citizen Schools students the opportunity to design their own burger in the course of their apprenticeship. The burger will be unveiled on May 6.
