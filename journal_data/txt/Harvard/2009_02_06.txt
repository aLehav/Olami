After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Privacy in our society is clearly diminishing: We carry devices everywhere we go so that people can reach us, the credit cards we use let any corporation view our purchases, and the Internet has allowed an unprecedented level of information to be publicly available. While this trend can be troubling, simple-minded reactions are not warranted. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened in the Cambridge City Council on Wednesday when, following protests from many fearful and disgruntled citizens, the body voted to keep surveillance cameras already installed in the city turned off, citing their possible contribution to the erosion of civil liberties. This move by the council was an overreaction in light of the surveillance program’s scope, purpose, and prior history. Funded by a grant from the Department of Homeland Security, a mere eight cameras were installed around Cambridge in 2008 to aid firefighters and other evacuation personnel in the event of an emergency. For a sizeable community like Cambridge, the cameras’ potential to be life-saving in dire circumstances greatly outweighs their minimal impact on privacy. Most of those in opposition to the use of these cameras at the city council meeting did not have a problem with the standard function of the cameras in emergency situations but were more concerned about the possibility of exploitation. But as much as these cameras may conjure up images of an Orwellian nightmare with the government watching our every move, they add no more cause for alarm than cameras installed on highways to monitor speed limits or in stores to monitor shoplifting. Boston has installed over 100 similar cameras already and has seen no problem in surveillance-related abuse. While the installation process was not particularly transparent, with most of it taking place without the involvement of the Cambridge City Council, disallowing these cameras is unnecessary, rash, and wasteful. Like any newly instituted system, the cameras should be allowed a trial period with evaluation and feedback. Just as nearby Brookline agreed to activate the cameras and use them on a trial basis, Cambridge should observe the impact of cameras before making its decision. It is a city’s obligation to protect and assist its residents in a time of emergency, and blocking a possible rescue due to unfounded fears of the government being able to view a public street shows little perspective. Eight cameras will not mark the end of our First Amendment rights. Hopefully Cambridge residents will not have to wait for an accident to ensue for us to learn this.

On this day two decades ago, Polish patriots took on the world’s largest army and succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, eventually toppling the Communist regime in Warsaw. They achieved this feat not through violent revolution, but through a series of negotiations that became famous as the Round Table talks. The defeat of Communism in Poland—which was soon followed by its total collapse in Eastern Europe and, in 1991, the Soviet Union itself—should properly be regarded as one of the greatest triumphs in European history. 
The collapse of Communism in Poland was precipitated by both economic crisis and political ferment. By 1988, Poland’s command economy, overwhelmed by $6 billion of foreign debt and paralyzed by governmental incompetence, was in serious decline. Workers’ complaints over rising prices precipitated strikes and protests in 1970, 1976, 1980, and 1988. In July, a standoff between miners and the government saw the re-emergence of Solidarity, an illegal trade union.
Solidarity, led by the charismatic electrician Lech Walesa, had gained international sympathy after the 1980 shipyard strikes in Gdansk. It would eventually gain huge popular support; 1.5 million Poles would claim membership in April 1989. However, the Communist regime felt threatened by the union and responded with force. In 1981, Wojciech Jaruzelski, the secretary of the Polish Communist Party, declared martial law, criminalized Solidarity, and imprisoned much of its leadership. For two years, Poland suffered under military rule.
By the end of the decade, however, the situation had become all but untenable for the autocratic government in Warsaw. As complete economic chaos threatened to overwhelm Poland, the Jaruzelski clique was forced to moderate its views toward Solidarity. In September 1988, Minister of Interior Czeslaw Kiszczak had approached Walesa and made the unprecedented move of inviting Solidarity to political talks intended to fix the country’s worsening political and economic situation. 
From February to April of 1989, the Communist leadership met with the leaders of Solidarity in what became known as the Round Table talks, which resulted in an agreement to hold semi-free elections that summer. The results of these elections favored Solidarity’s candidates even more than its own leaders had expected; of the available seats, Solidarity won nearly every single contest. To many observers, it seemed as though Poland would move rapidly toward capitalism and democracy. 
Turning Poland into a market economy, however, was a more complex and painful process than anyone could have imagined. In the early 1990s, the Polish government attempted to use “shock therapy” programs—championed by Jeffrey Sachs and other Western experts—to jumpstart the economy. This resulted in high inflation and unemployment for years. The Polish economy eventually revived, but the intervening years were painful for most of the country. Solidarity, which had championed shock therapy, soon paid the political price for backing the unpopular economic platform. 
Led by Walesa, Solidarity emerged from the overthrow of Communism popularly viewed as the savior of the Polish nation but proved to be much less effective as a governing party. Just four years after the Round Table talks, the once-dominant coalition led by Solidarity had fragmented and lost power to its Social Democratic opposition, some of whom had served in the Communist government. This was not due simply to the economic climate; in the first truly free elections, the movement split violently when Walesa ran for president against Tadeusz Mazowiecki, another Solidarity politician who was then prime minister.
As a result, the political figures that had defeated Communism were not able to bring Poland into the greater fold of the European community. Instead, it took a new generation of political leadership to accomplish the unthinkable: turning a mismanaged and unproductive command economy into a functioning and streamlined market system. Yet all this hard work paid off in the end; on May 1, 2004, Poland and seven other formerly Communist countries in Central Europe joined the European Union.
The 20-year anniversary of the Round Table talks serves as cause for reflection on the events of the past two decades in Poland and the Central European region as a whole. Even with the advantage of historical hindsight, the revolution of 1989 is just as impressive—if not more so—than it was 20 years ago. Despite the numerous challenges that Poland has faced in the past two decades, it has undergone an amazing transition. Since 1989, it has joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, earned full membership in the European Union, and built a successful democracy. To that end, we salute Poland and join with its people in the twentieth anniversary celebration of the 1989 talks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About midway through Clarel’s first year at Harvard, Facebook began to sweep across the Yard. Seemingly ideally suited for freshmen, who tend to accumulate friendships like trading cards, Facebook quickly became a student-body sensation,en route to reshaping the social-networking world at large. It seemed like everyone in our class had created a Facebook profile by the end of freshman year. Except Clarel.  
For someone so uniquely socially gifted, it was somewhat unexpected. Only a few months into our Harvard experience, Clarel had already emerged as one of the most likeable, most recognizable figures in Annenberg. With his infectious laugh and wide smile, Clarel brought joy to even the most mundane of activities. In many ways, he appeared the Harvard ideal: a natural leader, blessed with intelligence, creativity, and the capacity to bring large groups of people together with interests as varied as his own. 
And though Clarel epitomized so much that was right about Harvard, he also marched to his own beat. While some undergraduates seemed to treat relationships as a means to an end, establishing contacts as a way to bolster social capital, Clarel simply valued the authenticity of true human connection. Whether it was an impassioned conversation in his Thayer entryway or a hard-fought pickup soccer game across the river, Clarel lived to experience people and share his love of life with others.  
While some undergraduates turned to alcohol as a way to dull the intensity of Harvard’s climate, Clarel preferred to organize group outings into Boston, experimenting with new cultures and new cuisines. In fact, he loved nothing more than lively conversation around a dinner table: the cheerful banter of friends, punctuated with moments of deep insight. This, too, was the music he enjoyed. 
And of course you can’t talk about Clarel without mentioning explicitly his love of food. Watching Clarel eat was a pleasure unlike any other–few men have ever sought to extract such energy and flavor from each emphatic bite. And perhaps no Harvard student in the storied history of overflow housing has ever utilized a DeWolfe kitchen with such vivacity and spirit, preparing curried chicken and rice for his privileged guests.  
The loss of Clarel is tragic for everyone who knew him. In his honor, a Facebook group has been created to pay tribute to his memory, serving as a platform for all friends and classmates to share a story or remembrance.  I would urge all such individuals to join and actively take part. However, to pay tribute to Clarel, this alone is not sufficient.
I can’t say with any certainty why Clarel never joined Facebook. But I do believe that he had an innate understanding of its limitations. For Clarel, keeping in touch was important, but touch itself–the warmth and intimacy of in-person engagement between friends–was something without substitute. I certainly am grateful that Clarel touched my life, as are so many countless others. 
To celebrate Clarel, I would encourage that each of us find time in the coming weeks to gather a group of friends and enjoy a wonderful meal together. It was one of Clarel’s greatest joys.

To the editors:

Duncan Kennedy’s description of the situation in Gaza is, as far as I know, entirely accurate, really even prosaic. That it may seem controversial is largely because of the extraordinarily one-sided coverage that the mainstream media in the United States provide for our consumption on most aspects of Middle Eastern politics. All of us have an obligation to inform ourselves about this painful and dangerous situation as fully as possible.

To the editors:
While agreeing with the general sentiment, I take issue with the staff editorial about the Supreme Court’s finding in Herring v. U.S. Again, though I agree with the main idea, which is that the court is taking drastic and controversial steps against the exclusionary eule, the manner in which this editorial is presented characterizes the decision as more extreme and far-reaching than it actually is.
First, I disagree with Herring’s depiction as “unprecedented.”  In fact, there is notable precedent for clarifying exceptions to the exclusionary eule.  Both U.S. v. Leon (1984) and Arizona v. Evans (1995) dealt with exceptions to the exclusionary rule, and in both cases, the holding allowed for these exceptions if law enforcement showed that the mistakes were made in good faith.
Secondly, the hypothetical proposed by the column, that police could “plead ‘negligent’ as a cover-up for violations of individuals’ rights in a variety of circumstances…” is not accurate, according to the finding in Herring.  Here, the court allowed the exception to the exclusionary rule because the officers that arrested eefendant Herring did so based on mistakes made by other law-enforcement officers, not the arresting officers themselves. They acted in good faith based on information they received from colleagues, which happened to be incorrect. Here, it would not be fair to argue that an officer could purposely violate a defendant’s rights and plead negligent, as that would violate the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.
Finally, the final paragraph of an otherwise balanced, well-written opinion is unnecessarily inflammatory.  “The Supreme Court has taken a dangerous decision by allowing evidence obtained illegally to be used in a trial. For a democracy to flourish, no one can be above the law.” By providing exceptions to the exclusionary rule, the court is holding that evidence that fits into this exception is not illegal. The court says nothing of allowing illegal evidence to be presented at trial and instead rules on the existence of exceptions to the exclusionary rule.  By writing that police officers are made “above the law” with this decision, you are implying that they committed some sort of crime in the Herring case, or in the cases referenced by Herring. All of the courts ruled on the legality of the procedure followed by law enforcement and never ruled any of their personal behavior illegal.

Three United Nations employees cast a critical but hopeful eye at the peacekeeping organization during a panel discussion titled “Peacekeeping: Can the U.N. Meet the Challenge?” last night at the Institute of Politics.Michael R. Gaouette ’90, a team leader for the U.N. in Darfur; David J. Harland, a member of the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations; and Susana Malcorra, an under-secretary-general in field support, focused on the difficulties the U.N. faces when it tries to preserve order after peace settlements are reached.“Peackeeping uncovers some of the most important international problems of our time,” said moderator Jacqueline Bhabha, the director of the University’s Committee on Human Rights Studies. Malcorra called for a reevaluation of the current U.N. intervention model because of new challenges.“More and more so, the U.N. has become a target in itself,” she said.Harland and Gaouette presented mixed viewpoints on the efficacy of the international organization, especially the Security Council.“Clarity is not the greatest of its virtues,” Harland said. Gaouette, meanwhile, reflected on his own experience with the U.N.’s limited success in Darfur. “We just don’t have anywhere near the tools required to do this job,” he said. The event concluded with audience questions to the panel. Michael J. Brower, who holds a Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, praised the work of the panelists.“You are doing God’s work in the world of the devil,” he said before turning his attention to the audience members, asking what they could do to make the United States a less militaristic force in the world.  Jessica K. Reitz, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School who previously worked in Sudan, said she found the event informative and relevant to her experience.“I really appreciated the realistic view on the challenges of peacekeeping,” she said.Malcorra said she was pleased with the success of the event. “At the end of the day, we are an organization that is alive and is rethinking itself in a constant manner,” she said. “Engaging in a dialogue with the broader society is critical.”—Staff writer Evan T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In preparation for an upcoming protest to be staged by the Westboro Baptist Church, a Kansas-based anti-gay group, the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School held a forum yesterday to discuss possible responses.
Although participants suggested several courses of action—ranging from ignoring the protest completely to having a concurrent pro-gay celebration—those present agreed that their response would be non-violent and respectful. 
Principal Christopher Saheed emphasized student safety as his main concern, warning students against engaging directly with the protestors.
“They are not reasonable,” he said. “They are irrational. They could care less about reason.”
The church—which has earned a “hate group” designation—has demonstrated against homosexuality in Cambridge in  years past, including at Harvard’s commencement in 2003. 
The church has announced that its members will also picket in Lexington and Reading next month. Famous for picketing Matthew W. Shephard’s funeral, the group also holds anti-gay protests at funerals of AIDS victims. Recently they have begun demonstrating at soldiers’ funerals across the country, saying that their deaths are evidence of “God’s judgment” of America.
The CRLS forum was organized by Project 10 East—the school’s gay-straight alliance—and Students Teaching and Advocating Respect. Kathy Keegan, Project 10 East’s supervisor and the discussion’s moderator, told the audience that the school would need to be cautious in their interactions with the hate group, which has filed lawsuits against the institutions that they picket. 
School committee member Marc McGovern, who was present at the meeting, said he supported the idea of a large, positive counterdemonstration to draw the media’s attention away from the group’s negative message.
“I’d rather that publicity be about our community,” he said.
But Cody Doucette, a CRLS high school senior who serves on the school committee, said he thought it would be more “powerful” if students refused to acknowledge the group’s presence.
“They say the most hateful, cruel, and ignorant things because they want you to get mad,” he said. “That’s their game.”
Others at the meeting recommended a middle ground, suggesting that awareness and counterprotest events should be held, but indoors, away from the church group picketers. 
Final plans for the school’s response will be decided later by a student leadership committee that was formed at the end of the meeting.

While Harvard hockey teams competed at the Beanpot Hockey Tournament earlier this week, teams of hungry College students stuffed their faces to qualify for a chance to defend Harvard against teams from four other Boston-area universities in Qdoba’s Fifth Annual Rice and Bean Pot burrito eating contest last night.A total of 14 teams, made up of four students each, wolfed down four of Qdoba’s 18-ounce vegetarian burritos in hopes of landing a place in the final round of the contest next Tuesday. The fastest team in Tuesday’s final round will win an all-expenses paid trip to Mexico.Harvard will be represented by ‘Team Marvel’—Kenneth I. Brewer ’11, Morgan T. Pope ’11, Philip M. Ngo ’12, and Brandon J. Hopkins ’11—who consumed their burritos in 4 minutes and 30 seconds. Matthew D. Thomas ’09—who said his team participated last year with lackluster success—was back this year to win.“Last year we were good, but amateurs,” Thomas said. “This year we have a team of professional eaters.”This year, Thomas also shared with his team his secret of eating burritos quickly. “Don’t chew or bite; just swallow,” he said.Alexander P. Douglas ’09-’11 said that while the grand prize was enticing, he participated in the contest primarily for the thrill and the free burrito.“I ate at Qdoba in preparation,” he said. “I averaged around two minutes a burrito in practice.”Douglas, who recruited his team two hours before the contest after being “cut” from another team, finished his burrito in one minute flat.Most participants saw the contest as a free dinner.“It just looked fun, I really like Qdoba burritos, it was a free Qdoba burrito, and I was really hungry,” Elizabeth A. Miranda ’11 said. “I honestly wasn’t really watching the other team at all.”Boston University student Yevgeniy M. Maksimenko, a certified EMT, was present at the contest for safety reasons.“You know, they’re eating under pressure, and there’s always a possibility it’ll go down the wrong pipe.”Francisco Diaz, who has been regional manager of Qdoba for five years, has attended every Rice and Bean Pot contest.“It’s gotten very intense, with people coming in to practice for two or three weeks beforehand,” he said. “Harvard’s seen the biggest growth in teams, starting with just four teams five years ago.”Macnamara G. De Oliveira, general manager of Harvard Square’s Qdoba, pointed out that participants in the competition were largely male.The winning Harvard team will compete in Tuesday’s finals with teams from Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern.—Staff writer Shan Wang can be reached at wang38@fas.harvard.edu.

Eating cured meats may lead to an increased risk of leukemia in children and young adults, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study recently published in the BioMed Central Cancer journal.The study found an association between consuming smoked or cured meat and fish more than once a week and an increased risk of acute leukemia. Conversely, researchers concluded that subjects who ate vegetables and tofu regularly along with cured meats showed reduced risk for leukemia.The population-based case-control study, conducted in Taiwan, looked into the dietary habits of 515 subjects who ranged in age from two to 20 years-old. Researchers gathered data between 1997 and 2005.According to Professor of Medicine David C. Christiani, the chemical culprit is most likely the nitrites added during the curing and smoking process. These chemicals transform into N-nitroso compounds—which are known carcinogens—in the acidic stomach.“These are some very active compounds in your body,” said Christiani. “Have you ever heard of the hot-dog headache? That’s what you get after eating too many hotdogs.”Other nitrite and nitrosame-containing foods implicated in this study include sausages, Chinese-style salted fish, and bacon.Although the correlation is very strong, this study does not point to a causal relationship between eating cured meats and leukemia, said Christiani. In order to show causation, researchers must look into the mechanism of how extracts from cured meats affect bone marrow at the cellular level.“These results need to be confirmed in other studies before doctors can make strong recommendations,” he said. “We don’t want the cured meat and sausage industry on our tails.”Researchers need to conduct long-term cohort studies or animal studies in order to gather further information, said Chen-yu Liu, a research fellow at HSPH and the primary author of the manuscript.“Leukemia is the most important childhood cancer,” said Liu. “I’m concerned about the children, and what factors are associated with the disease.”According to Christiani, the study’s original focus was not related to diet, but rather attempted to determine whether living in areas with strong pollution from petrochemical industries increases the risk of leukemia. The subjects’ diets were gathered as preliminary information that would later be used to adjust for environmental factors.“We didn’t expect to see such a large difference, and [we] noted that it was worthy to look deeper into,” he said.Although the study surveyed children and adolescents, Christiani said the results also apply to adults.“In fact, adults can accumulate the carcinogenic agents over time, so theoretically the cured meats may be more harmful,” he said.—Staff writer Helen X.

Harvard researchers have successfully tested a new cancer vaccine in mice that could make previously expensive treatments accessible outside state-of-the-art medical centers.The therapy—which destroyed tumors in 90 percent of mice tested—uses small implants to avoid costly cell reprogramming outside the body. The latter technique requires practitioners to have extensive training and specialized facilities that are only available at elite hospitals.The findings, published in the journal Nature Materials last month, seek to combat those tumors that fool the immune system’s normal process of identifying dangerous substances.Normally, a particular type of immune cell—called a dendritic cell—will search the body for foreign matter, targeting it for destruction by T cells, another component of the immune system.But some tumors manage to escape detection, enabling them to grow uncontrollably, said Nathaniel D. Huebsch, one of the study’s authors. “The idea with a cancer vaccine is to wake up the immune system and let it know there’s a tumor in the body and it should try to destroy it,” Huebsch said. Current therapies involve reprogramming immune cells in a petri dish to recognize the patient’s particular tumor, said Omar A. Ali, one of the authors. But these cells have a low survival rate, requiring physicians to use large numbers of them to effectively treat tumors, said the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences associate.“These therapies have worked pretty well in many patients and are very promising, but you need a highly trained technician and a very expensive facility,” Huebsch said. “Patients at the Brigham [and Women’s Hospital in Boston] can probably access these therapies but not patients in more rural areas.”Ali decided to develop an implantable system that would recruit the dendritic cells by mimicking infection and inducing an immune response.  With the new implants, 90 percent of mice with tumors survived, when otherwise they would have been expected to die within 23 days.The mice’s immune systems also recruited similar numbers of naturally present dendritic cells as are typically injected in reprogramming therapies, Huebsch said, suggesting that the implants are as effective as pricier therapies, potentially opening the possibility of treatment for many who now cannot afford it.“Firstly, it promises to be more effective than vaccines currently under investigation today,” said SEAS Bioengineering Professor David J. Mooney, an author on the study. “Secondly, it would be a tremendous benefit to patients because it would be more widely available, and less expensive.”But before the therapy can reach that stage, it must undergo human clinical trials that require approval from the Food and Drug Administration, which Ali said he hopes to obtain soon.“We’re developing more of the preclinical data that we need to support a clinical trial,” Ali said. “All the components we use in the system are FDA improved for clinical trials and our goal is to get this system into clinical trials as soon as possible.”—Staff writer Alissa M.

Regina George, Serena Van Der Woodsen, and Marissa Cooper may have more to thank for their popularity than just great hair. A group of researchers from Harvard and the University of California, San Diego have suggested that social network structures have a genetic basis—meaning that popularity may be coded in one’s DNA. According to co-author and Harvard Professor of Medical Sociology Nicholas A. Christakis, the findings expand on the common intuition that genes influence social behavior, accounting for the variability in an individual’s popularity. “The interesting point is not that the number of friends varies from person to person,” Chrisakis said, “[rather] that other higher-order aspects of network structure also appears to be genetically determined.”These high-order aspects of social networks include transitivity, or how well one’s friends know each other, and centrality, the tendency for an individual to be near the center verses the periphery of a network.Using data on the social networks of 1,110 adolescent twins, researchers were able to show that social networks of identical twins share more similarities in structure than those of fraternal twins in measurements of transitivity, centrality, and the number of friends.According to Christakis, there are distinct evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of being at a particular location in a social network. He said that if a deadly germ is moving through the population, being in the periphery has a clear advantage. Alternately, being in the center of a social network can provide access to valuable information about prey. The research questions the validity of current network models that treat individuals as interchangeable nodes and neglect the genetic influence on network structures. “Our findings suggested that it’s not okay to treat people as interchangeable nodes. There’s heterogeneity at the level of nodes of network that needs to be accounted for,” Christakis said. The researchers developed a new model, called the “attract and introduce” model, which outperformed the previous models by including heritable traits of social networks. This new model is based on two parameters: people’s attractiveness level and their tendency to introduce their friends to one other. “The basic idea is that if people are interconnected, their healths are interconnected, if we really want to understand health, we have to understand society,” Christakis said.The new findings might also have policy implications, according to Christakis. “If things spread in networks, if I get you to behave well, others will start to behave well too,” he said. “The dollars spent on getting you to behave well have a much bigger rate of return than I previously thought, for instance.” The paper was co-authored with James H. Fowler ’92 and Christopher T. Dawes, both researchers at the University of California-San Diego.—Staff writer Gordon Y. Liao can be reached at liao@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School will move up its recruiting process in order to bring recruiters to campus earlier in the year after firm cutbacks due to last fall’s economic turbulence left many students with far fewer summer offers than in years past.The Law School’s Office of Career Services announced that the school will invite firms to campus the last full week of August before classes begin, advancing the recruiting timeline by about a month. Traditionally, the Law School’s recruiting cycle began later than at comparable institutions, which hurt students last October when law firms reduced the number of spots reserved for Harvard recruits in light the impending recession.Fly-out week—the time when students visit firms who have expressed interest in them—is now scheduled for the week of September 14, two weeks after the first day of classes. During that period, the school puts classes on hold for a week-long fall break.In addition to the new recruiting schedule, the Law School will also offer prospective employers the option of using the same timeline as in years past.Although most students interviewed said that they were in favor of the new calendar because it would improve job opportunities and allow students to better focus on their interviews, some logistical issues remain to be solved.“This means you get all your interviews done without any of the other distractions like classes, extracurriculars, or journal-work,” said Law School student government president and third-year student David K. Kessler ’04. “But there are still some problems.”Several student organizations, including the Legal Aid Bureau, conduct workshops in the week before classes begin to orient their new members. Under the new schedule, training will now conflict with firm interviews.But student group leaders doubted that the changes will impose a significant burden on their plans next year.“I imagine the training will either have to begin earlier or be incorporated throughout the first weeks of the semester,” Logan A. Steiner, a third-year student member of the Bureau, wrote in an e-mailed statement.An earlier interview schedule also means that students will arrive for their second year of law school without much time to take advantage of the school’s advising services in the fall. “Some students don’t know what they want to do at the beginning of their second year,” Kessler said. “With this schedule, decisions will have to be made over the summer.”Much of last fall’s economic turmoil occurred in the gap between when most other top law school’s welcome recruiters and Harvard Law School conducts their interviews. As a result, rattled law firms changed their hiring goals and cut the number of Harvard summer associates they planned to hire.Some students were therefore forced to find jobs using means other than on-campus recruiting.One student—who requested to remain anonymous—was unable to secure a position through on-campus recruiting and said it seemed surreal that an economic crisis would affect an institution like Harvard Law School.“As a Harvard student, you feel entitled to get a job, and you ignore these dire reports on CNN,” she said. “You think that things will work out like every other year.”—Staff writer Elias J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The same gas that makes balloons fly and voices rise is also an important tool for Harvard researchers conducting specialized scientific research—a tool that will be in shorter supply thanks to cutbacks faced by University scientists in the current financial climate.   
The cancellation of a helium liquefier—promised as part of the designs for the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering—has served as an uncomfortable reminder for some professors that research agendas may have to take a backseat to fiscal prudence as University administrators make tough decisions about how to cut budgets.
In areas of research such as condensed matter and quantum physics, certain phenomena can only be realized and controlled at low temperatures, making liquid helium—one of the simplest means of cooling a specimen—a precious commodity.
“It’s really a lifeline,” said physics professor Amir Yacoby. “If you run out of liquid helium your experiment warms up and when this happens it could set you back months.” 
Currently, researchers who use liquid helium must buy it from external suppliers, which has become problematic due to erratic suppliers as well as the element’s steadily rising costs, Yacoby said. 
The liquefier would have solved those problems by allowing Harvard scientists to prepare liquid helium themselves and would have benefitted the research of a variety of groups in the Physics and Chemistry Departments as well as the School of Engineering and Applied Science.  
“It was supposed to be a University-wide service that anyone who requires liquid helium would be able to buy,” Yacoby said
But in December, the group of researchers involved in planning for the liquefier was notified by Dean of the Physical Sciences Jeremy Bloxham that the project had been postponed indefinitely—a decision made jointly with SEAS, whose interim dean, Frans A. Spaepen, pointed to the machine’s multi-million dollar price tag as the reason for the decision. 
Spaepen said in an interview this week that the loss of the liquifier could be weathered without grinding research to a halt, but the decision struck an ominous chord for Yacoby. 
“The sad thing about the note is that it says that it is postponed indefinitely,” Yacoby said. “It wasn’t. ‘Let’s pass these times and see what will happen in a year or so.’” 
While he said that the research groups he has talked to are all cutting down on their low-temperature experiments, he remains hopeful that this is not the “final blow.” 
“If you look across the country, you see that institutions that currently do not have liquefiers are eventually stopping doing cryogenic [low-temperature] research,” Yacoby said.  
SEAS STRUGGLES
While the liquifier was meant to serve researchers in both the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and SEAS, the latter body faces an independent set of challenges, having transitioned from a division to a school less than two years ago.
In a letter sent to the SEAS community in December, Spaepen outlined the School’s plans for dealing with the economic downturn, including an immediate cut of $1 million of unrestricted expenses for the current academic year.
Much of the gap was closed by freezing hiring for open staff positions—a move also taken by the divisions of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and cutting nonessential discretionary spending, said Harry E. Dumay, dean of finance at SEAS.
But while the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has slashed its planned hires in half in response to the financial decline, prioritizing the upkeep of existing academic programs, SEAS—as a recently-minted school—has maintained an emphasis on growth and has cut none of the seven faculty searches that it had authorized prior to the financial crisis.
A project to expand the school’s faculty from 60 to 100—which would bring it on par with most medium-sized engineering schools—will go forward, although more slowly than expected, according to Spaepen.
“You have to think, ‘If I stop my recruitment and stop building labs I can save a lot of money,’” said former SEAS Dean Venkatesh ‘Venky’ Narayanamurti. 
“But we would rather not stop our growth plans unless we are really broke,”  he said.
SEAS’ plans to expand into Allston along with other parts of the University may also prove to be of concern, both for bioengineering research and undergraduate teaching. 
SEAS is slated to have a major part in the new Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, funded by a $125 million dollar donation and touted as a part of the Allston science complex that would strengthen the University’s nascent engineering efforts. 
The project is complemented by a new bioengineering concentration already in the works for undergraduates.
But the need for University cutbacks has spurred calls to slow down Harvard’s expensive expansion project, with news emerging this week that plans are being made that may keep the Department of Stem Cell Regenerative Biology—meant to be a centerpiece of the new Allston campus—in Cambridge.
University officials have yet to release a decision on the pace of Allston construction, leaving leadership at SEAS and elsewhere unsure about what the future will hold. Spaepen said hope remained that the economic environment would only affect the timing and the pace at which SEAS can achieve its original goals.
“It has not changed the object of what we’re doing,” Spaepen said. 
“The enthusiasm on the outside from potential donors remains quite high and we hope to get more means to supplement what we have to move things along,” he said.

Leadership from the Student Labor Action Movement and the Harvard-Radcliffe Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transsexual, and Supporters Alliance declared their support for the dining hall staff union’s efforts to strengthen the anti-discrimination language of their contract at an open meeting last night. The two student organizations also plan to campaign to broaden the scope of the university’s anti-discrimination policy to include all workers.Students met with four dining hall workers to prepare a reaction to allegedly anti-gay remarks made by a manager in a dining hall a few weeks ago.According to the president of Unite Here Local 26, the union representing Harvard’s dining hall staff, a dining manager asked two female dining hall workers, “What are you, lesbians?” Union president Janice Loux said the two women were chatting, and the manager may have wanted them to stop their conversation.As an immediate reaction to the remarks, BGLTSA and SLAM leaders are planning to raise awareness of the incident.“We would feel a lot stronger if we see strong student support,” said Edward B. Childs, Adams House cook and the union’s chief steward, at the meeting last night.Rainbow gay-pride pins have been available in bowls at some dining halls over the course of this week, but the students at last night’s meeting sought to do more. Suggestions included encouraging students to fill out dining feedback cards expressing their support for the staff, mass e-mailing student organizations and House lists to raise awareness, and covering a dining hall table with a rainbow flag as a tablecloth.“People will use the excuse of layoffs to get rid of problematic employees,” SLAM leader Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09 said last night. “As students, we can yell outside Holyoke Center, and we’re not going to get kicked out of Harvard.”In the long-term, the union members and SLAM said they want to draft stronger anti-discrimination language. Aguilera said she wants to use the dining hall incident to prompt a broad anti-discrimination policy that would extend to all workers at Harvard, including those who aren’t in a union.She and others at the meeting plan to draft an initial version of the new language this week and discuss it at a meeting next Thursday night.“All workers and students should be able to guarantee these principles and tenets that have been drafted by the community itself,” Aguilera said.Childs said he sees the incident as just one example of increasing intolerance, especially after the passage of Proposition 8 in Calif.“We’re a membership of mostly immigrants, mostly women, mostly people of color, and as upper management likes to say, ‘the lowest on the totem pole,’” Childs said. “If they can beat up on us, it leaves the door open to beat up on anybody.”—Staff writer Danielle J.

A creamy bed of ivory lentils, topped with seared root vegetables, and drizzled with a cider gastrique stole the hearts of students and judges at Winthrop House’s vegetarian cook-off last night.Four teams competed to create environmentally-conscious and delicious dishes from a table overflowing with produce that ranged from parsnips as thick as a forearm to piles of feathery-headed fennel. The student chefs also incorporated ingredients from a mystery box that contained apples, ivory lentils, bok choy, and organic tofu.Dishes ranged from coconut lentil soup with tofu croutons to a bed of sauteed greens topped with local apples and organic tofu.A panel of Harvard University Dining Services Managers and executives, as well as students in attendance, pronounced Alexandra Perloff-Giles ’11 and Madeleine E. Raffel ’11 the winners of the contest. The event’s top dishes will be featured in Winthrop’s Chef’s Choice nights. Perloff-Giles is also Crimson staff writer, and Raffel is a Crimson business editor.Before the cooking began, an unruffled contestant Lillian L. Erlinger ’10 rattled off her team’s plan: in the works, an “Asian slaw with fried lentil balls and garlicky, pan-seared broccoli,” but if all else failed, there was a plan B: “a spiced lentil apple curry with curry yogurt and sauteed apples.”As the cooking began, Bianca A. Verma ’10, Erlinger’s teammate, chopped up onions. “There may not be cumin, but other than that, it’s going well,” she said.Representatives from the Food Literacy Project and the Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program organized the contest after a debate on their open list about the selection of vegetarian options on the HUDS menu. “We decided to bridge the idea of sustainability and vegetarian food,” said Winthrop EcoREP Jonathan B. Steinman ’10. “Most vegetarian food has a smaller carbon footprint than meat-based food.” Steinman is also a Crimson sports writer.Serie Demelo, a HUDS general manager, emphasized that all the ingredients used at the event are normally served in the dining hall. She also said that leftover ingredients would be incorporated into the next day’s meals to reduce waste.“I’m really glad they’re accommodating vegans,” said Amary K. Wiggin ’09, a vegan who voted in favor of a coconut lentil soup. Wiggin said that the current vegan offerings in the dining hall are “decent.”According to Steinman, the competition was intended to “highlight to people that a diet with relatively less meat is a diet that’s easier on the planet.”—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

Despite being surrounded by Harvard students dressed in drag, Renee Zellweger could not escape one of her most celebrated movie roles as she rode down Mass. Ave. in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Woman of the Year parade yesterday afternoon.Halfway through the parade route, a man held up a cardboard sign reading, “You complete me,” a nod to the classic phase from Zellweger’s movie “Jerry Maguire.”Zellweger, also known for her appearances in “Bridget Jones’s Diary,” “Chicago,” and “Cold Mountain,” laughed with her Hasty Pudding escorts and lamented forgetting her gloves as she rode down the street in a silver Bentley convertible. The Oscar winner also talked to members of the crowd and struck comical poses with Hasty Pudding President David J. Andersson ’09 and Vice President of the Cast Thomas R. Compton ’09.“You were robbed in ‘Chicago!’” one woman yelled to Zellweger as she passed.“I got to do it!” a confused Zellweger replied.“But you didn’t get the Oscar,” the woman replied.“Well, don’t tell everybody!” Zellweger said.As the procession passed the Porcellian Club, a stuffed pig was tossed into the actress’s car. Zellweger kissed the pig and put a red rose she had been clutching into its mouth.Throngs of bundled-up students and locals lined Mass. Ave., anxiously awaiting the parade’s scheduled 2:30 p.m. start time. But it was not until 3:00 p.m. that members of the Harvard Juggling Club first bounced down Mass. Ave. on stilts.The procession ended at the New College Theatre, where Zellweger was led inside to be roasted by Andersson and Compton.Zellweger, who punctuated the roast with bouts of hysterical laughter, was repeatedly confronted by iconic roles from her past, as she met “Bridget Jones’s body double" and a jealous “Catherine Zeta-Jones,” with whom she was forced to do the Charleston. Throughout the festivities, the Texas native made it clear that she was less than thrilled by the frigid Cambridge weather. “Where was this an hour ago when it was ten degrees outside?” she said when asked to wear a fat suit during the roast.Before they presented her with the traditional golden Pudding Pot, Andersson and Compton required Zellweger to complete tasks including seducing a “proper British gentleman” by answering questions testing her knowledge of “British idiosyncratic slang” and providing the voices for a shark and a bee. In addition to the Pudding Pot, Zellweger was given a more practical gift—a pair of adult diapers, to mock her for being in the bathroom when her name was announced during the 2000 Golden Globe Awards. Andersson and Compton presented the gift, which she modeled for the audience. Zellweger said that before coming to Harvard, she was always impressed at the quality of students Harvard produces.“I’m really going to have to rethink all that,” she said. After Zellweger received her award, members of the Hasty Pudding cast previewed their upcoming show “Acropolis Now.” At the end of the roast, Zellweger made it clear she was not yet finished celebrating her award.“I love my Pudding Pot, and I will love it more tonight when I bring it to the party and fill it with vodka,” she said.—Staff writer Lauren D.
