After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a pandemic-era entertainment industry, nothing is the way it used to be. One day, a film’s release will be delayed several months; the next, the film will be moved to a streaming service; and after that, it might even become a television series for streaming. Such a shift in the status quo is simply unprecedented in the industry, and while it surely has its disadvantages, Joby Harold, for one, appreciates what it’s done for story possibilities.
Harold, who has taken on a number of creative roles in the industry, has spent the majority of his career working on films; some of his projects include “Army of the Dead” and “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum.”
“The world is changing really, really quickly,” he said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “Part of our jobs as producers and my job as a writer is to change with the times and embrace the opportunities therein. That most specifically applies to television and limited series and serialized storytelling, because that allows you more room to get underneath character. In that way it’s really liberating and exciting.”
In keeping with the recent TV surge that he describes, Harold’s own pandemic experience has largely been occupied with his work as a writer for “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” a limited television series about the classic “Star Wars” character that premieres on Disney+ this May. And while this project has given Harold the opportunity to inject his own creativity into the galaxy far, far away, his escapist journey into fantasy worlds like that of “Star Wars” dates back to his experience growing up as an only child in London.
“I spent a lot of time just kind of disappearing into those worlds,” Harold recalled of his childhood. “Most specifically, that meant ‘The Magnificent Seven,’ and ‘The Great Escape,’ and ‘Jaws,’ and ‘Star Wars.’ Those sort of bedrock movies really, I’d watch them over and over and over again.”
Having grown up with a single mom, Harold reflected on how his love for film was born of hardship. He likened the role of film and TV in his early life to that of a babysitter; while his mom worked several jobs to put food on the table, he spent his time discovering that the limits of London could not prevent his film-driven imagination from running wild. He soon realized, though, that these limits could indeed prevent him from following the career path he desired in filmmaking. He decided to apply to UCLA as a result, and from there, his journey to Hollywood was set in motion.
As he reflected on his time in film school, Harold considered his early experiences in directing and writing. While he recalled that directing was his preferred gig at first, when asked which role he has most enjoyed throughout his career, Harold exhibited a change of heart. “The only child in me would say writing, because I got to be by myself,” he laughed.
He described how the only path to directing in film school was to first write a script that was deemed good enough, and then to be the director attached to the project. While this route is the one he originally chose, he found himself on a wholly different trajectory from that point forward. “Off the back of that, I just kept writing,” he said. “Writing sort of overtook everything else, and my family is a family of writers, so that always came fairly naturally to me.”
Expanding on how he views his role as a writer, Harold made note of the grandeur that is expected from the action-packed, “tentpole” type of project he has often worked on in the past. He elaborated on the idea that such projects, at their core, require the same nuance and attention to detail that are central to any good story.
“[These projects], to me, are interesting on a character level and thematically, and they resonate for me emotionally because I’ve lived in those worlds,” he said.
With the onset of the pandemic, Harold was given an expanded opportunity to immerse himself in the worlds he speaks of. While the industry’s general transition towards longer-length television series meant that there would be more to write about, Harold also simply had more time to write, which meant he would be spending a lot of time with “Obi-Wan Kenobi.”
“I started working on [‘Obi-Wan’] just as the pandemic began,” he recalled, “so it’s very intimately associated in my mind, because for as long as COVID has been a part of our lifestyles, it’s been a part of my life as a writer.”
Harold also remembers the experience of being stuck indoors very differently than most. While work was reduced or put on pause for many, his own work days had never been more intense.
“Everybody else was complaining that they had nothing left to do and they’d already done all their jigsaws,” he said, “and I hadn’t had any time to do any jigsaws because I was writing 14-hour days trying to get ‘Obi-Wan’ into shape.”
This routine was Harold’s reality throughout much of the pandemic, making it abundantly clear that, pandemic or not, the entertainment industry requires a tireless grind. As such, when asked what advice he would give to young people hoping to work in film, he offered a telling anecdote from the days that preceded his career:
“My screenwriting professor in film school said you’re not good until your seventh script,” he said. “I would just say work and work and work. That’s what I tell my kids — you’ve got to work harder than the person next to you.”
At the end of the day, Harold’s journey is a true testament to this advice, as he has built a successful career crafting the types of stories that inspired him as a child. Offering a final reflection on what is perhaps at the very center of his love for his profession, Harold showed no hesitation in naming his favorite film.
“‘Jaws,’” he said. “It’s the perfect marriage of everything I love about film, and also it was a massive part of awakening my imagination when I was a child. One of the great thrills of being a dad is getting to watch ‘Jaws’ with my kids, and watch their eyes widen the way mine did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a sunny and pleasant afternoon on March 21st several years ago. As the warmer temperature began to melt the snow, it felt like spring had arrived. While walking on a street near Boston’s famous Fenway Park, I noticed a beautiful scene where the steam was whirling and rising from the ground to the sky like a whirling Dervish. Recalling that it was Nowruz day, I scribbled a poem instantaneously.
One month ago, members of the Uyghur community in the Greater Boston area participated in the Nowruz Festival organized by the Central Asian Student Association at Harvard University.
Sitting as one of the participants in the festival, listening to the congratulatory remarks of University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken ’84 broadcasted via video, I felt warm feelings among participants, be they from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, or Uzbekistan. Like everyone else, I felt joyful seeing every group’s festival performance, which included singing, dancing, and a fashion show. And on behalf of the Uyghur community, I, too, presented to the audience my poem written on Nowruz day near Fenway Park several years ago.
While watching festivities, I thought to myself — would it not be the absolute joy of Nowruz if the dark day ends and warm spring-like freedom embraces Uyghurs immediately?
Nowruz is the day of the spring equinox.  The celebration of Nowruz is one of our traditional holidays and has a long history among Uyghurs. I have been celebrating it since I was a kid; I particularly enjoyed the wrestling matches back then. The social atmosphere of the Nowruz festival is inclusive, immersed in unity and equality; people young and old participate in the holiday. Some tell epic stories, others read poems, some dance, and others wrestle. It is celebratory; people dress up with their new clothes and wish each other good luck — and they all share an exceptional food called “Nowruz Eshi.”
Nowruz day is philanthropic and inspirational. Able members of the community help the poor, sick, weak, and vulnerable, while the learned men encourage others to pursue knowledge, choose righteousness over wickedness, and protect and preserve the unity of the community.  Through those events, they turn Nowruz day into a day of joy which warms the hearts of everyone with friendship, compassion, love, unity, and hope.
For Uyghur people, celebrating Nowruz is not simply showing respect to the law of nature where the harsh winter ends and warm spring starts. It is also their longing for ending brutal and oppressive days and the beginning of peaceful times.
Uyghur immigrants celebrate Nowruz in any American state with a sizable Uyghur community, and Massachusetts is surely one of them, as around 200 Uyghurs reside in the Greater Boston Area. Until 2017, celebrating Nowruz might have been considered the continuation of a tradition from the so-called Uyghur “Autonomous” Region — as Uyghurs living there are not afforded much autonomy at all. But since 2017 — when the Chinese government began building internment camps to detain at least a million Uyghurs with baseless charges and cruel and extreme measures — celebrating Nowruz for Uyghurs abroad has been seen as one of the symbols in the fight against the Chinese government’s destruction of Uyghur identity.
Five years have passed since then. Although several world governments — such as the U.S., the U.K., and most recently, France — have declared China’s abuse of Uyghurs an ethnic genocide, China is not backtracking. Over a million Uyghur intellectuals, professionals, religious leaders, and ordinary people have yet to be released from the camps, many have died, and many more are still missing. Uyghur children are still suffering and their parents are taken from their homes against their will and forced to work in harsh conditions.
China’s policy directed toward Uyghur people is the mixture of the worst form of capitalism — exploitation, the worst form of communism — state terror, and the worst form of ultra-nationalism — forceful assimilation. Its ultimate goal is to erase everything Uyghur. Although a crime of this magnitude committed in the name of the Chinese state should have shaken the conscience of the world, more countries have publicly stood with China than against it.
Realizing that facing existential threat, Uyghurs are clinging to every bit of chance that gives them hope for a better tomorrow and Uyghurs across the diaspora are trying to pick joy among sadness, choose hope over hopelessness, and display our determination to keep our identity whenever there is even an iota of possibility to do so. And participating in the Nowruz Festivals like this one held at Harvard not only lifts our spirits but also gives us an opportunity to display our strong will to preserve our culture. When there is a continuity of our traditional culture, there will be a future for Uyghurs and the real Nowruz — the warm spring-like freedom — will embrace the Uyghur people at last.

To the Class of 2026,
Congratulations! We are so happy to welcome you.
As you process the feeling of joy, excitement, or even momentary disbelief that comes with acceptance into Harvard, know that you and your loved ones have much to be proud of. We’re very proud of you, too.
When you arrive in late August, you will likely find yourselves in a largely maskless community that resembles that of many campuses prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet more than half of those who will be here to meet you had far more unorthodox Harvard beginning, with a disorienting cavalcade of Zoom rooms, awkward mask-induced misidentifications, and anxious post-arrival Covid-19 tests. Your introduction to this community in late summer will be remarkable in all the ways that joining our community is always remarkable, but it will also be remarkable in that it will be beautifully ordinary. A return to convention, at long last.
We hope you will appreciate and enjoy this normalcy.
In some sense, you will have the first fresh start at Harvard in a very, very long time. This school is, well, old. Through a vast matrix of norms, traditions, and Crimson idiosyncrasies, that age touches us, influencing how we understand and engage with the institution around us. But when Covid-19 scattered us away from Harvard physically it also took away some of our precious cultural traditions and institutional memory that never quite made it back.
You — every single one of the newly minted Harvard affiliates — now have the rare opportunity to fill in those gaps. To create new traditions and institutional memories that will define your time here and that of generations to come; to choose which clubs, celebrations, and campus programs are worthy of your attention and energy. As you do so, we urge you to be better than we have been, just like we have strived to be better than those before us. You have a shot a reshaping this community to more closely reflects the core values of equality, educational excellence, and intellectual curiosity that we have yet to fully uphold and realize.
Special as it is, this school has its fair share of injustices and problems just like everywhere else. The institution you enter will be far from perfect — you will likely experience moments of frustration and, in all likeliness, burst out in tears at some point during your time here. You will be tested by incomprehensible administrative oversights, problematic lecturers, and overzealous, exhausting colleagues. The real Harvard isn’t always quite as glossy as the Elle Woods overview.
But do not let that intimidate you: This campus will be as yours as it is anybody’s. Yours to reside and change, yours to turn to in moments of triumph and pain. The world is yours.
And we will be right here with you. We will be here to welcome you into our communities, including this very Editorial Board. We will be here to share with you our traditions and our worries — Housing Day, courses, long walks to the Quad, the latest Harvard University Dining Services creation — and watch them become yours too. We can’t wait for your arrival in August to breathe new life into a historical campus and for you, the reader, to leave your own little mark. Above all, we hope you can find a home here that you love.
Welcome, Class of 2026. We can’t wait to meet you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amy Wax thinks America is “better off with more whites and fewer non-whites,” and she’s not shy about saying it.
Wax — the Robert Mundheim Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School — has collected outrage and fans since 2017, when she began speaking in interviews and on primetime television about what she dubs “cultural-distance nationalism.” This breed of nationalism, as Wax explained at the inaugural National Conservatism Conference, asserts that “we are better off if our country is dominated numerically, demographically, politically, at least in fact if not formally, by people from the first world, from the West, than by people from countries that had failed to advance.”
Put plainly, Wax favors non-white people being kept out of leadership positions and, ideally, the country. That’s in America’s best interest, she argues, because “countries ruled by white Europeans” simply have values that are “superior.”
“The third world, although mixed, contains a lot of non-white people,” she warns.
Tracking Wax’s declarations of white supremacy is genuinely dizzying. This month’s iteration is a viral clip of her on Tucker Carlson Today, in which Wax described her Indian colleagues at Penn as coming from a “shithole.” She then complains that “non-Western people,” particularly “American Blacks,” feel a “tremendous amount of resentment and shame” towards “Western peoples” because of their “outsized achievements and contributions.” Wax scrunches her face. “I mean it's this unholy brew of sentiments.”
Wax’s April interview with Carlson, who hosts America’s most-watched cable news show, has led to a resurgence in calls for her firing — a cause that last surged this January when Wax said the U.S. was “better off with fewer Asians.”
Yet whether Wax is fired from her Ivy is, of course, complicated by tenure — an academic appointment that insulates her, like a tortoiseshell, from such action.
In an emailed statement, Wax curtly declined an interview request: “I do not speak to student reporters, so I suggest you don’t contact me again.”
This is the part of my column where I come out as Black (to all those who don’t know me personally — surprise!). I remember, hazily, being four years old and introduced to the idea. On the playground, my sister’s friend announced that he wasn’t allowed to play with Black people. My sister, confused, ran to me, and we soon tattled. One angry phone call and parent-teacher conference later, our school sent the offender (a first grader) home with an MLK picture book.
I wouldn’t say I’m filled with tremendous shame over the West’s “outsized achievements.” I find Wax’s comments genuinely upsetting, but know (hope?) they’re fringe.
Wax was barred from teaching required classes in 2018 after implying, falsely, that Black Penn Law students never graduated in the top quarter of their class. This January, Penn Law Dean Tedd Ruger initiated the University’s process for formally sanctioning tenured faculty “to address Professor Wax’s escalating conduct.” Ruger declined to comment for this article to “preserve the integrity of this process.” He wrote, however, that “[t]he Law School has previously made clear on multiple occasions that Professor Wax’s views do not reflect our values or practices.”
This sanctions inquiry instantly met backlash. A coalition of professors known as the Academic Freedom Alliance, which counts many Harvard professors as members and in its leadership, came to Wax’s defense days after its announcement. In a public statement on behalf of the organization, AFA founder and Princeton professor Keith Whittington expressed the “firm view that Professor Wax should suffer no formal consequences.”
Jeannie Suk Gersen, a Harvard Law professor and founding member of the AFA, could not be reached for comment.
Whittington, who authored the public letter defending Wax, founded the Academic Freedom Alliance in 2021 after growing increasingly concerned about free speech issues in American society. To him, that encompasses efforts to roll back tenure protections to bans on Critical Race Theory, though his organization has yet to release a public statement explicitly addressing the latter.
After reading Wax’s remarks to Whittington, I asked if he’d call them racist — as major media outlets, normally averse to the term, have done outright. “I’ll leave it to others to sort that out and characterize them in that regard,” he told me.
The AFA’s opposition to sanctioning Wax hinges on the belief that her podcast and talk show appearances constitute “extramural speech” — a protected form of speech that occurs outside of the classroom which they argue is off-limits for University scrutiny.
“Using her platform in the classroom to do similar things as what she's doing in podcasts and on the Tucker Carlson show — then that’d be troubling,” Whittington told me. “The University would properly want to look into that.” Yet Whittington maintains that “extramural speech protections, by most university policies, are pretty close to absolute.”
Penn Law seems to be looking into two strains of complaints against Wax, according to a January statement by Ruger — one which Whittington would deem appropriate grounds for sanctions, and another which he would not.
First: “That her conduct is having an adverse and discernable impact on her teaching and classroom activities.”
Second: That Wax’s “pervasive and recurring vitriol and promotion of white supremacy” made it “impossible for students to take classes from her without a reasonable belief that they are being treated with discriminatory animus.”
Penn’s proceedings will try to discern whether Wax’s belief in the superiority of “white culture” has led, as complainants allege, to discriminatory conduct in her classroom. This, Whittington admits, requires a high evidentiary burden — since Wax is infamous at Penn, how many non-white students, or even those who disagree with her views, take her classes? — but could chart a less controversial path towards revoking Wax’s tenure.
The second bucket of complaints evokes questions that are, bureaucratically, hairier. Should you be allowed to teach if you assert repeatedly, as Professor Wax has, that your non-white students are culturally inferior to your white ones, and bemoan their very presence in the U.S.?
In his statement, Ruger writes that Wax has publicly demeaned “a majority of those who study, teach, and work here.” (Penn’s graduate schools are about 40 percent white).
Though tenured faculty’s “extramural speech” protections are, rightfully, strong, Wax’s case is an extreme test of the vague rules which govern tenure termination. There must be room within the tenure system to dismiss professors who so clearly impair their ability to teach, as Whittington concedes Wax “may well have.” because of inarguable racism. If a student knows their professor views them as inherently inferior, how can learning proceed?
I attended a majority Black high school but, during senior year, was the only Black student in my physics and math class. In them, I learned to shrink myself: never speaking unless cold-called or daring to ask questions, even when I desperately needed to. In those classes, Black students not on our school’s “advanced” track (teachers and students called them “the general kids”) only existed as the butt of cruel jokes — mocking, relentlessly, how they dressed. Spoke. Existed. So I chose to never say a word, terrified that if I did, I might slip up and confirm the worst I knew some assumed of me. My learning — which, ideally, should’ve allowed for fearless inquiry — undeniably suffered.
If Penn’s process rules that Wax’s public comments are un-sanctionable, it will be a depressing day. Such a decision would signal to all of academia that clean-cut advocacy for white supremacy is employable conduct if you have tenure — something unfathomable in nearly any other profession. Under such a system, it’s students that lose.

When he’s not working shifts as a custodian at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Luis M. Toribio — a native Spanish speaker — takes classes on the weekends through Harvard to hone his English skills and practice pronunciation. Two years ago, he said, he struggled to communicate in English — but today, he proudly exclaims he can now do an entire interview in English.
Toribio is one of many Harvard workers who take classes through the Bridge Program, a University-run Adult Learning Center that provides English as a Second Language classes, career development workshops, an adult diploma program, and citizenship classes.
“When I started the Bridge Program, it was difficult for me to express myself in English,” Toribio said. “And after I had been in the program, I’ve been learning English, I’ve been learning how to express myself. It’s been amazing. I met a lot of people.”
The program, started in 1998, is funded and run by Harvard’s Human Resources department, which makes tuition, books, and other course materials free to workers.
“I think this is an amazing program that Harvard has for the workers, for all the people that need it,” Toribio said.
Nicole “Niki” Radvany, a Bridge Program training manager, said “the goal of the courses and workshops are to provide skill improvement for the employees to be successful in their careers, as well as in their everyday life.”
Toribio said he thinks the program is “amazing,” but he added that it is sometimes difficult to balance classes with his work and family responsibilities.
“To be honest, it’s very hard to do the homework, because we have to be working, we have to take care of the family,” he said. “It’s hard, to be honest — it’s very hard.”
“You have to spend time with your family, too — you have to divide time for the family, time for school homework, time to work,” he added.
In addition to the Bridge Program, Harvard also offers a Tuition Assistance Program, which gives workers access to degree programs at a reduced cost.
The program partially subsidizes the cost of tuition for classes that employees take at participating Harvard Schools. It allows workers to take classes or pursue a degree for $40 per class at the Harvard Extension School or 10 percent of tuition at other eligible Harvard schools, such as the Graduate Schools of Education, Government, Public Health, and Design.
Employees taking advantage of TAP may pursue an undergraduate or graduate degree, as well as several graduate certificates at the Harvard Extension School, which provides hundreds of evening classes and flexible degree programs.
Rianna Brooks, a research specialist in the Access to Justice Lab at Harvard, has made use of the TAP program to take dance classes at the Harvard Dance Center, math and computer science classes at HES, and data analysis and visualization courses at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.
“To me, the TAP program is one of the most valuable benefits to being research staff at the University,” she wrote in an email.
Still, Brooks wrote that she would like to see “more Harvard graduate programs accept part-time TAP students into degree programs.”
Curt E. Rheault, the president of the Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guards Union, said he has found the TAP program to be “surprisingly good.” Rheault took an English course through TAP to help him run his small business, Compass Technology.
“I use that every single day, which is amazing to me. It really helped a lot on the managing side,” he said.
Rheault also praised the learning environment at the Extension School.
“Most of the people there are taking the courses because they want to take courses; they want to learn,” he said. “You don’t have people who don’t want to be there, which is refreshing.”
“You generally get very good teachers and good feedback — because otherwise they don’t last [at HES] — which is not my normal experience through undergrad and high school,” he added.
Rheault has now taken 17 classes and earned a master’s degree at the Harvard Extension School through TAP, and he said he may return to get a Masters in Sustainability, too.
“I wish everybody that works at Harvard that has an opportunity to use the TAP program would at least give it a shot for one class,” he said. “I’ve always pushed it, but I wish Harvard pushed it more because I think it’s a great asset that they have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 50 days into the war in Ukraine, Harvard affiliates are still calling for more public action and concrete support from the University for those affected by the conflict.
In opening remarks for a virtual panel four days after Russian troops invaded Eastern Ukraine, University President Lawrence S. Bacow decried Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “wanton aggression,” pledging “to share knowledge of Ukraine” and “speak against cruelty.”
Bacow’s speech was published online and posted to University social media channels. Deans from four of Harvard’s graduate schools followed suit.
The Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs compiled a list of resources on its website for affected affiliates, including links to Harvard offices, contact information for requesting school-specific accommodations, emergency funding options, and resources for scholars abroad.
But affiliates affected by the crisis say Harvard should do more.
“President Bacow has the power to condemn this,” said Taisa Kulyk ’22, whose parents hail from Ukraine. “He has the power to share what we can do, or to also support students here, and international students.”
Kulyk called the remarks Bacow published online “a very weak stance,” noting that Harvard has publicized University statements on other topics via emails directly to all affiliates.
Bacow defended his decision to publish his personal statement on the invasion online, as opposed to emailing it, in an April 8 interview.
“When people get a message from me, I want them to read it because they know it’s important, and if people are getting too many of those, then it loses its impact,” he said, noting that email blasts sometimes go to students, staff, faculty, and over 400,000 alumni.
“Frequently you will find, if you go back and look, that in response to a whole series of events I haven’t sent blast emails, but rather I found a way to make remarks and then I post them to my website,” Bacow added.
Bacow said producing an institutional response to current events requires a lengthy review process that often takes more time than if he drafts a personal statement, like his remarks on Ukraine.
“One of the challenges when events occur in real time — if you want the whole institution to respond — is to vet things with 12 deans, with 12 Corporation members, with the Alumni Association,” he said.
Beyond calling for public statements, a group of Ukrainian, Russian, Belarusian, Kazakh, and American students wrote a petition to Harvard administrators last month, which garnered more than 650 signatories and asked for academic and mental health support, financial aid, and immigration assistance. Two Russian organizers behind the petition, Alexander Zhigalin ’23 and Polina Galouchko ’23, said the University did not respond to the requests.
“We would like to hear a response from the University about those suggestions,” Galouchko said. “They could be like, ‘Okay, we cannot do this for those and those reasons. But, here’s an alternative.’”
She added some students are “just not receiving the help that they urgently need.”
“The administration has been very hesitant implementing those blanket policies or centralized policies, because I think they still firmly believe that it’s best solved on a one-on-one basis and case-by-case,” Galouchko said.
Zhigalin said students have been told to reach out to their resident deans for specific support, but said the resident deans “also do not know what to do.”
“The resident deans just have nothing to direct us to,” he said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
Zhigalin and Galouchko said the war in Ukraine shows how Harvard lacks the infrastructure to support its students when any international crises arise, adding that affiliates from other conflict zones like Afghanistan and Syria faced a similar lack of institutionalized support.
“We think it’s a general issue that’s uncovered by these circumstances, rather than created,” Zhigalin said.
Bacow said Harvard has “done a lot to try and help people understand where we’re at, the resources that we've made available to students.”
For Kulyk, the sign of the Ukrainian flag flying over University Hall in the Yard is “symbolic.” But it is also a reminder of the continual suffering of individuals overseas, she said.
“Every day that the flag remains flying, that’s a reminder to everyone in our community here that the war is still going on, and that we need to do more,” Kulyk said.

Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana celebrated the revival of longtime Harvard traditions this semester in a Thursday interview.
With Housing Day’s in-person format in March, Yardfest in April, and two Commencement ceremonies celebrating three classes planned for May, the spring semester resurrected a number of College traditions that have been held virtually since 2019.
Housing Day — an annual rite during which freshmen are sorted into one of Harvard’s 12 upperclassman houses or the Dudley Co-Op in groups of up to eight students — was held in-person for the first time in two years. Last month, upperclassmen “dorm stormed,” crowding freshman rooms to announce their housing assignments.
Khurana described the day as “amazing” and said he enjoyed seeing students’ pride in their houses.
“You could feel the pent-up energy from the last couple of years,” he said. “The enthusiasm, the energy, the dancing, was wonderful.”
Due to the pandemic, the Dean of Students Office modified Housing Day traditions, permitting groups of three upperclassmen to “dorm storm” freshman hallways for up to five minutes. Still, many students took to pre-pandemic ways, disregarding the guidelines.
Hundreds of students packed into Tercentenary Theatre earlier this month for Yardfest, Harvard’s annual spring outdoor concert, which was held in-person for the first time since 2019.
Khurana said he had “a great deal of fun” at the concert.
“I just really appreciated the energy and really that shared collective sentiment — I’ll never take us being together again for granted,” he said.
Khurana was also asked about the following additional topics:
Double Concentrations
Harvard faculty members voted overwhelmingly in favor of a proposal that will allow undergraduates to pursue a double concentration — a proposal Khurana called “thoughtfully presented.”
“We want our students to really see Harvard College as a place of intellectual exploration,” Khurana said. “I’m glad that we’re able to add another choice for students in addition to doing a joint concentration or single concentration.”
Some faculty worry that double concentrations may incentivize students to collect credentials, rather than explore intellectual interests. Asked about these concerns, Khurana said it is important that students make “authentic choices” about their academic paths.
“The goal of Harvard College is not to hit rewind on high school and play again,” he said.
Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 Confirmed to SCOTUS
Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92, who graduated from the College and Harvard Law School, was confirmed to the Supreme Court earlier this month. The first Black woman to sit on the bench, Jackson has served on the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing board — since 2016.
Khurana said he was “incredibly happy” to see Jackson confirmed.
“It’s always great when students can see our alumni, in the variety of different roles that they’re occupying, trying to make the world more just and fair,” Khurana said.

Gong Cha — an international bubble tea chain — is set to bubble into Harvard Square in early June.
The store will take over the previous Dado Tea location at 50 Church St., becoming the latest addition to the Square’s boba tea collection, alongside Kung Fu Tea located at 1160 Massachusetts Ave. Boston Tea Stop, another Harvard Square staple that served bubble tea, closed last year.
Founded in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Gong Cha — which translates to “tribute tea for the emperor” — opened its first overseas location in Korea in 2006. The Gong Cha USA franchise has more than 1,500 locations globally. The chain is known for its signature milk foam.
Anchal Lamba, a master franchisee for Gong Cha who manages stores in nine states, said the new location plans to target Harvard students as both employees and customers.
“We always love to open by college campuses. College students — what we've learned is that they love bubble tea,” she said. “We figure it's going to be a great addition to the Harvard area and to just have the Gong Cha brand nearby for students on campus.”
The company has 13 stores in Massachusetts so far, with locations in Allston and other parts of Boston. Lamba’s franchise currently has stores in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Oklahoma, with more opening soon in Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Lamba said she believes the quality of Gong Cha tea makes it stand out.
“I think our customers really do love our quality of tea,” she said. “We brew our tea every four hours in our store, which a lot of our customers love. When you walk into a Gong Cha store, you can smell the aroma of the tea, which is something that attracts our customers.”
“It kind of sets us apart from other brands,” she added.
The Church St. store’s grand opening will feature a “buy one, get one free” sale on their top ten drinks, according to Lamba. Lamba said her personal favorite drink is the milk foam green tea.
“It has brewed green tea on the bottom, and then a slightly savory cream topping on top,” Lamba said. “That's one of our top drinks as well, so I'm sure for the grand opening that drink will be included in the buy one, get one free.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard security worker filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board this month seeking to decertify the union that represents around 300 contracted security workers at the University, 32BJ Service Employees International Union.
Walter J. Terzano, who has served as a security officer at Harvard for 13 years, filed the petition on April 7.
Employees can file a petition with the NLRB requesting a representation election, which determines if a union can continue representing its workers in collective bargaining. If the effort has support from 30 percent of the bargaining unit, the NLRB is required to hold an election to determine whether the union will be decertified.
The petition comes following months of tension between 32BJ leadership and Harvard security workers, who are employed by Securitas, an international security services firm. Union leadership was at odds with the union’s bargaining committee for parts of its monthslong contract dispute with Securitas, which ended last month when members voted to ratify a contract.
“This is a terrible, terrible union, and the membership is howling for some way to get rid of them and get a proper union in here,” Terzano said of 32BJ in an interview on February 8, as he was preparing to file the petition.
Terzano, who serves as a union steward, said 32BJ has worked to subvert the interest of its members repeatedly throughout collective bargaining. Terzano said union leadership is often making “the company’s case to us rather than making our case to the company” in negotiations.
“They seem to be working on behalf of the company more than they are for us,” he said.
Harvard security workers rejected Securitas’ first contract offer in January, despite 32BJ backing of the deal. The union’s bargaining committee — tasked with representing general members in negotiations — called on workers to vote down the first offer, which ultimately failed, 127-84.
Terzano said he decided to draft the petition due to “the obvious disdain that the union leadership seems to demonstrate to the members — even the stewards.”
Terzano accused the union of rigging a 2016 contract ratification vote, though there is no direct proof of fraud. He said the union refused to conduct an audit of the election.
“It’s beyond rational dispute that there’s an enormous amount of questions about that vote,” he added.
Arun K. Malik, who serves on 32BJ’s bargaining committee, said he thought there was “election irregularity” in the 2016 vote.
“Both the custodians and the guards thought we had voted down our CBAs,” he said. “We were both stunned to find out it had passed.”
Malik also said the union did not issue an official communication about misinformation spread by a guard during the 2016 vote — “grounds for invalidating the election,” he said.
32BJ Executive Vice President Roxana Rivera did not respond to a request for comment about the allegations.
The NLRB is currently investigating whether the petition for decertification has received the necessary 30 percent support from union members.
William B. Gould IV, a professor at Stanford Law School, said a petition must be timely and garner sufficient interest within the appropriate units of a union in order to warrant an election. But measuring whether petitions have received the necessary 30 percent support from members can sometimes be complicated, he said.
“Sometimes, it’s difficult to determine whether that 30 percent is adequate because there may be some dispute about the scope of the unit,” he said. “You have to measure the 30 percent over the number of people who are in the appropriate bargaining unit.”
If sufficient interest is demonstrated, the NLRB will conduct an election through secret ballot.
Last year, there were 240 petitions to decertify filed with the NLRB, resulting in 125 elections — 55 of which were won by the union, and 75 of which were lost by the union according to the NLRB. Eighteen were dismissed and 91 were withdrawn.
32BJ spokesperson Amanda Torres-Price declined to comment on the petition, writing that the union “can’t comment on a pending legal matter.” Securitas and Harvard University spokesperson Jason A. Newton also declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a hard-fought battle, No. 13 Harvard (7-3, 2-2) succumbed to the No. 11 Penn Quakers in a tight 11-8 loss in Philadelphia. Playing at a much higher caliber than in its April 9 loss to Cornell, the Crimson brought energy and fight.
With Harvard leading 4-3 at the half, the game seemed to be quite even. However, Penn went on an unanswered six-goal run, outscoring the Crimson 5-0 in the third quarter. This was not due to a dip in Harvard’s play; it was due to a shift in Penn energy, as Quakers head coach Mike Murphy moved his senior midfielder Sam Handley to attack, forcing the Crimson defense to re-evaluate its matchups. Handley had five points on the day in the form of four goals and an assist.
“We played hard and competed well. We just have to play for all four quarters,” sophomore LSM Greg Campisi noted. “Giving up five goals and scoring none in the third quarter hurt us tremendously. We know that we can play with anybody; we just need a full 60-minute effort.”
The first quarter was sloppy for both teams, with the nerves of league play forcing some errant passes and questionable takes on the offensive end; it was a low-scoring quarter as a result, with Harvard entering the first intermission with a 3-2 lead.
Senior goalie Kyle Mullin again had a great showing, demonstrating his athleticism as a member of the 10-man ride unit. He also excelled during the clear, in which he on multiple occasions took the ball all the way up to the 50 in order to secure Harvard possession before the 20 seconds wound down.
On the other end of the field, the ride was a great point of emphasis for the Crimson; it was effective at slowing down Penn and even stopping the Quakers from clearing entirely. Penn went 19 for 25 on the day, while Harvard went 22 for 26 on its clearing attempts.
“Our 10 man ride worked really well against Penn,” first-year midfielder Owen Gaffney commented. “We were able to stunt Penn’s clearing game, which helped us make plays on offense and defense. It’s something that we found success with recently, and I’m sure we will continue to utilize it.”
However, the Crimson will look to improve on extra man opportunities as well as the face off. Harvard did not take advantage of its man-up sets, only converting on one of its seven. Working on striking during these plays has been something that the team has emphasized in the past. At the face off x, the Crimson only won four of the 22 faceoffs, allowing the Quakers to control the middle of the field. Losing the initial clamp gave Penn more possession time, and allowed it to build momentum on its goals in the third and fourth quarters.
Harvard made a valiant effort at a comeback in the fourth, scoring four goals. Gaffney noted that it was due to leadership on both ends of the field, which should translate into the team’s next showing against Princeton.
“[Mullin] and [Campisi] played great games, and they have been all year. They really energize the team with their focus and intensity,” he said. “We are excited for this upcoming game against a great Princeton team.”
Harvard will host the Tigers on Saturday at 1 p.m. The contest marks the last home game of the season for Harvard, and will be played as the team’s senior day, honoring current seniors as well as members of the classes of 2020 and 2021 who were unable to celebrate during the Covid-19 pandemic. The game will also be streamed on ESPN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A breezy Charles River Basin hosted the NEISA Team Race Championships over the weekend, with an injury-riddled Harvard side overcoming adversity to place second in the 12-team competition.
The Crimson, who finished the two-day regatta with a 11-5 record, won a 2/3rd sailoff vs. Dartmouth (11-5) on Sunday to finish in second behind Ivy league rival Yale (12-4).
In a disjointed round one, which was halted on Saturday due to weather and completed on Sunday, Harvard went 8-3, tied with Roger Williams (8-3) and sitting behind Yale (9-2) and Dartmouth (10-1).
“The first day was the most chaotic day of sailing I’ve ever had,” said junior Chris Wang, who raced as crew in a boat skippered by senior Henry Burnes.
“We only sailed five races…we were really distracted that day because they were constantly calling people on and off.”
Despite the frantic conditions, the Crimson came out of Saturday with three wins and only two losses against Dartmouth and Roger Williams.
The remainder of round one on Sunday saw an improved performance, with Harvard winning five races and only slipping up against Brown, a race which was mired by a bad start and numerous fouls.
Shortly following round one was a tightly contested Final 6 round robin, where no team won more than three races. Harvard was one of the teams to do so, claiming victories against NEISA heavyweights Dartmouth, Yale and Tufts. A 3-2 record brought their cumulative record to 11-5 at the close of the second round, pitting them against Dartmouth (11-5) in a Sailoff for 2nd/3rd. Wang highlighted the significance of the Crimson’s win against Yale.
“Yale is the number one ranked team in the entire nation, and we didn't lose to them all weekend, which was really good,” Wang said.“Sticking to what we know, our playbook, what we practice consistently despite how competitive or intimidating the (opposing) team was…sailing to our potential allowed us to win.”
Going into the sailoff, Harvard had the momentum on a stumbling Dartmouth team, who went 1-4 in the Final 6 racing after leading round one. After a long day of racing, the Crimson rallied one last time, winning 1-2-5 vs. 3-4-6 to finish the 2022 NEISA Team Championships in second place – just one win behind Yale.
“We had all wanted to go to Yardfest at this point because it was already five o’clock…we all had a lot of stuff to do, but we pulled it together and we beat Dartmouth,” Wang said.
With a second place finish on the weekend, Harvard put themselves in a strong position to be selected for the ICSA Team Race Championship after the first-place Bulldogs secured the lone automatic bid available.
The runner-up placing was a special moment for the team, which has had a tough run with injury this semester.
“What was really satisfying about this weekend was that we had gone through this whole year dragging our feet in the mud, seeing more people get concussions, hip injuries, back injuries…we were out six of our best people,” Wang said. “And we did the best we have in 13 years.”
Wang noted that in addition to overcoming an injured roster, the team witnessed their walk-ons step up to the plate. As a walk-on himself, he has had to step up to fill a role that would usually be a recruited position at counterpart schools like Yale and Dartmouth, according to Wang. He applauded his fellow walk-ons, such as first-year Alexandra Dorofeev and junior Cassia Lee, for stepping up in difficult conditions while many teammates are out of commission.
Wang also had high praise for sophomore skipper Dylan Ascencios, who has come a long way for the program since being recruited. “I think Dylan has shown exceptional improvement this semester, and everyone has seen that because he and Alexandra have been going incredibly fast.”
Wang attributed the weekend's performance to the work ethic of the team.
“We've been really accountable this season…having everyone fully committed to being as good as possible.”
The Crimson will now await selection for the ICSA Team Race Championship, which will be hosted by Tulane University in New Orleans, L.A. on May 16-18th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team saw its longest series of the season this past weekend, with the Crimson taking on Bucknell and St. Francis, achieving a key victory over No. 21 Princeton, and keeping up with No. 7 Michigan, who is undefeated in conference play.
“It was our last home weekend,” said junior defender Jaiden Miller. “Celebrating our seniors and being able to pull out those wins in front of all our friends and with our seniors was amazing. I think it gives us good momentum going into Brown this weekend and then conference championships next weekend.”
Meeting exactly one week after Harvard secured a victory over Princeton (18-8, 7-3 CWPA), the Tigers came out firing with a pair of goals within the first two minutes of the match. Nevertheless, the Crimson took a 5-4 going into the break. Throughout the entire match, no team gained more than a two-point lead over the other. Harvard was ahead by one goal in the last five minutes, but Princeton sent the game to overtime with a bar down shot in the last seconds of regulation.
“We started out at the beginning of the game being down,” said junior defender Brooke Hourigan. “We all knew from that point on that it was going to be a fight, that it was going to be a game. We knew it was going to be a tough game. We beat them at home on senior night, and they came out hungry.”
The Crimson managed to pull ahead to 11-10 during the last 90 seconds of the second overtime, but the Tigers took it to sudden death with 6 seconds remaining. Within less than 20 seconds into this final period, senior center defender Inde Halligan scored a perfect lob shot, securing another Harvard victory against Princeton.
“We were going to keep fighting until the last second,” Hourigan said. “We gave it everything we had. When we scored that final goal, it was such a relief, and we all knew that we could do it. It was nice to say, ‘look, we did it and didn't stop fighting until the absolute last second.’”
In the second game of the day against Bucknell (9-14, 3-8 CWPA), the Crimson fell behind 4-2 at the end of the first half, before turning it around to win the match 7-5 and complete its second comeback of the weekend.
Harvard had a tall order to win all four of its matches on the weekend, as Michigan (23-8, 11-0 CWPA) had been undefeated in the CWPA since 2018. The Crimson was able to keep the score differential to two points until the last six minutes, when Michigan took control of the match and scored four successive goals.
“Michigan is a very beautiful team,” Miller reflected. “They've been number one in our conference, I think for seven years in a row now. They have an attitude to themselves that they're untouchable. I think our mindset going into that match [was] we were hungry, and we wanted to prove that we're right there, that we're not someone you can shove over, and we're going to give them a run for their money for the conference championships this year.”
Both Miller and Hourigan pointed out the contribution of junior goalkeeper Zoe Banks to the mentality of the team.
“[Banks] is a brick wall of a goalie,” Miller said. “If things aren't going right, you could look at her, and she calms you down and also hypes you up at the same time.”
Miller and Hourigan also stressed the ability of the team to make changes and play full lines, as evidenced by the fact that the team has had games in which six or seven different players score: a difficult feat in collegiate water polo.
Harvard, now equipped with key victories and a competitive game against Michigan, looks forward to the CWPA championships this upcoming Friday, April 22.

Love It: April Showers Us With Smiles - Rhea L. Acharya
Walking through the Yard these days makes me happy. Long gone are the days when it would already be dark when I walked into my 4:30 p.m. section in Emerson. Now, as I leave class at 5:30 p.m, I am greeted by music playing from speakers or guitars, a game of frisbee, and the most adorable dogs in Cambridge running in front of me. Spring makes me want to be more efficient in my work and appreciate these simpler pleasures.
This time of year might seem fleeting, with the end of school sight. But because of this, spring encourages spontaneity and forces us to make the most of the time we do have left. Instead of rushing to the warmth of my dorm or my next commitment, spring makes me want to linger. I now meander between classes, taking in the cheerful scenes all around me. I want to eat lunch outside in the Yard or the Law School Library picnic tables, and I want to romanticize my life through walks along the river and pset sessions outside. I even want to skip the shuttle and walk to the SEC, feeling the wind in my hair and the sun in my face as I cross the Charles. Nature is a grounding presence in my life, forcing me to slow down and reflect, and spring brings added introspection.
As flowers start to bloom (Winthrop Courtyard, anyone?) and the grass gets replaced, this spirit of growing inspires me. I wonder what new adventures will come my way, what new friends I’ll make, and what new perspectives I’ll gain. Who is the person I’m growing to be? With the brighter days, I want to be more confident in reaching out to and making plans with friends, and I want to cross more items off my Cambridge-and-Boston bucket list. These are the moments we’ve dreamed of ever since opening up those picture-perfect college brochures and I’m here to make the most of it!
Hate It: April Showers Us With Summer Denial — Hailey E. Krasnikov
You know what I really hate? That feeling when you have a word stuck on the tip of your tongue and just can’t remember what it is. It’s beyond frustrating. And in my eyes, that is exactly what spring is. Sunny days and students hammocking in the Yard continue to remind me summer is coming upon us, BUT it’s not here yet. Springtime is just a reminder that I’m still stuck in class and buried under mountains of psets, while the sun shines outside and I dream of riding the Blue Line to the beach. Spring just means that we’re almost at the end of the semester as everyone chugs Red Bull, crams for finals, and wishes they didn’t have to.
Along with the nice weather fueling my pain that summer isn’t here yet, massive tourist groups have emerged in the Yard. The warm weather has enabled the tourists to crowd in the Science Center Plaza and block my path when I’m walking past John Harvard. But that’s not even the worst part: I will never understand why tourists take pictures of ~Harvard students~. I understand that I’m pretty cool, but I would rather not be subjected to being treated like a rare species in its natural habitat. The least they can do is not capture my post-3p.m.-chemistry-lab hair in a long-treasured photo.
There’s also the typical things that people hate about spring, like seasonal allergies. While I personally do not have allergies, I’ve seen enough red eyes and stuffy noses in the past week to know that I am truly blessed to not have them. And don’t forget about the bees. I know bees are important for the planet, but I would rather take four pset classes than be stung by one. In just a couple of weeks, I’ll probably be dodging the buzzing bees more often than I have to dodge athletes and their electric scooters on the way to class. I’m willing to co-inhabit this campus with the bees while they do their pollination work, but I hope they decide to stay far far away from me.
The warm weather is nice I’ll admit it, but I can’t say the same about everything that comes with it in the spring. I’m just counting down to summer.
