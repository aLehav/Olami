After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Acclaimed novelist Donna Tartt spoke at the Brattle Theatre on Thursday as part of the Harvard Book Store’s ongoing series of writer lecture events. She first read an excerpt from her latest work “The Goldfinch,” released on October 22, and then answered questions from the audience, dwelling particularly on her own writing process and its results not only in the new book, but also in her prior work.
“The Goldfinch” is the story of a boy, Theo Decker, whose mother is killed in a terrorist attack, and the excerpt that Tartt read was from that period immediately following the death of Theo’s mother. In the rich diction and visual detail that is typical of Tartt’s work, she describes his time at the apartment of his overachieving high school friend Andy.
Upon finishing her reading, Tartt first fielded a question about what authors influenced her most in her own approach. “I picked up different things from different authors over the years,” she said. While she cited the influence of Dickens and Nabokov, she particularly dwelt on that of Robert Louis Stevenson. “Stevenson is a wonderful stylist, but he’s also capable of a terrifying psychological realism,” she said.
She later returned to the topic of her own way of writing when one audience member asked, “Why do you take so long?” in reference to the fact that she has published three novels in two decades. Her answer, delivered to the laughter of the audience, was very simple. “Because that’s the way I enjoy doing it,” she said. “My Greek teacher used to say, if you’re not enjoying it, you’re probably doing it too fast.” She discussed how writing a novel slowly gives her time to get to know the characters well before discarding them, and further, allow her to add to the richness of detail for which she is so well known. “I’m really a miniaturist at heart,” she said.
Tartt is probably best known for her first novel “The Secret History,” which chronicles the murderous travails of a small, elite group of classics students at a New England liberal arts college. She mentioned obliquely the difficulty of killing characters: “There was a sad day’s work I had to do while writing ‘The Secret History,’” she said. When asked if the characters from this work, as well as her others, still lived with her, she responded emphatically, “Oh, yes, yes. They do."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Irving Zisman (Johnny Knoxville), aged 86, walks up to a seedy gas station vending machine, unbuttons his pants, and surreptitiously inserts his penis into the change return slot. After relieving himself, he discovers, to his horror, that he has become stuck within the enclosure. Initially calm, Zisman soon begins to panic and screams for help. Paralyzed patrons, loiterers, and attendants all watch with horror as Zisman leans backwards, his member stretching to cartoonish lengths as he wails in pain. So goes one of the more memorable scenes in Knoxville’s new film, “Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,” a simple, loosely plotted road-trip film in which Zisman, an astonishingly crude octogenarian, transports his equally distasteful grandson from his druggie, jail-bound mother in Nebraska to his white trash father in North Carolina. The film, which mixes fictional narrative with real-world reactions to stunts, is a pleasant, oddly relaxed tale that charms its way into the heart and funny bone through the infectious performances of its two leads and the continued ingenuity of Knoxville’s notoriously nasty exploits.
 Knoxville’s Zisman, an impeccably costumed, gravelly voiced recent widower, provides an ideal dramatic vehicle for Knoxville. Too often boxed in by his macho “Jackass” persona, Zisman allows Knoxville to explore both the limits of his crudity and the vulnerability of being elderly. Often repulsive in his delusional womanizing, alcoholism, and extreme disregard for his grandson, Knoxville resists making Zisman a complete caricature through sudden, uncanny flips into tenderness. At his wife’s funeral, Zisman delivers a tearful sermon about how he wished he had been less combative. Knoxville’s mastery of elderly vocal patterns shines as Zisman begins to break down. Moments later, however, his wife falls out of the coffin and Zisman attempts to put her back to no avail as the horrified, clueless crowd screams in disgust. Jackson Nicoll matches Knoxville’s impressive performances as Zisman’s grandson Billy, an overweight  eight-year-old whose world-weariness and honesty are both hilarious and touching.
 The intermingling between script and real-life stunts works surprisingly well, as the inevitable budding friendship between Zisman and Billy occurs against the backdrop of increasingly ridiculous hijinks. The two giggle and bond as they attempt to pick up overweight and extremely uncomfortable women, crash through windows, and poop on restaurant walls. The script, a joint effort between director Jeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze, and Knoxville, strongly evokes “Borat” in its combination between a buddy film and a probing into the American populace’s reactions to absurd situations. Zisman and Billy visit similarly trashy American haunts (bingo halls, strip malls, grimy corporate restaurants, beauty pageants) to those that Sacha Baron-Cohen highlighted in “Borat,” wreaking havoc on the often-depressing characters found within. 
Where “Borat” focuses on the ignorance, extremism, and xenophobia of real people’s responses to stunts, however, “Bad Grandpa” solely shows their shock. The stunts in “Grandpa” are often offensive and hilarious, but seldom provoke any reaction deeper than instinctive disgust. The results are usually funny enough to make up for the redundancy of people’s horrified reactions, but occasionally the stunts seem borderline cruel and pointless without a larger political agenda. The road trip through the Midwest and South semi-coherently explores working-class apathy and cluelessness, but doesn’t drive the point home in any meaningful way. The film would be stronger if the writers had made more of an effort to tease out some ridiculous and politically significant responses to match the stunts.
The film’s ideological shortcomings, however, are made up for by its even and relaxed tone. While “Borat” and other films where plot and real life mix rely heavily on overwhelming peaks and valleys in scripted intensity to retain audience interest, “Bad Grandpa” stays relatively consistent in tone. Nothing really changes over the course of the film, and the predictable and understated denouement actually feels like a relief given the typical reliance on bombastic endings. The resistance to extremism allows for the focus to lie entirely on the effective banter between Zisman and Billy and the creativity and crudity of the feats—and really, why else do people watch “Jackass” films?

The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” which ran until Saturday in the Loeb Ex, was among the best-executed student theater productions this year. The creative staging and mild text revision of director Alice Abracen '15 synthesized with strong performances on the part of the actors, resulting in an updated performance that maintained the dynamics and power of the original. This result provided a model for modern settings of classic works.
Abracen made some excellent decisions with regard to blocking that would have been wholly inappropriate in a larger venue but made tremendously effective use of the Ex’s more intimate dimensions. The seating was divided into three segments, and actors’ entrances and exits occurred along paths going through the audience, immersing viewers more fully in the action of the play. Since the space was small enough, the actors could freely orient themselves at any angle to the audience and still be heard, even while turning their backs partially or totally to the front of the stage. This freedom resulted in strikingly natural body language that is difficult to attain on a typical stage, where all lines must more or less be delivered outwards for there to be any hope of them being heard.
Of course, it was the skill of the actors that legitimized the creative use of the stage. Spencer J. Horne ’14 played Brutus with an understated tragic intensity that never dipped into melodrama; rather than being overwhelmed by this power, his colleagues complemented it with sophistication and elegance. Matthew B. Barrieau ’16 gave a strong Caesar, and managed to cast his shadow over the whole play, a difficult trick in view of the fact that his character receives a fraction of the stage time that Brutus gets. Two other performances were particularly worth noting. Lelaina E. Vogel ’15 played Cassius with all the complexity that character deserves, a dark, compelling foil to the shining sorrow and nobility of Brutus. In one or two instances of dramatic intensity, her diction quavered a bit more than some would allow, but never became grating or distracting. Mikhaila R. Fogel ’16 brought a surprising vigor to Casca, a figure who is typically marginalized by the giants of Caesar, Brutus, and Cassius. Her acidic delivery and brilliant command of gesture made her Casca one of the most complex characters in this production, truly giving the words of the text a life of their own.
Abracen also decided to cast a few female actresses in traditionally male roles, a change that she handled artfully. While the script confusingly kept some wording from the original text—“master” was not amended to “mistress," for example—the treatment was generally careful in execution. As gender dynamics are of secondary concern in the text of “Julius Caesar,” there was nothing marred by changing gender roles for characters, and indeed, the subtle sexual tension between Brutus and Cassius was a fascinating addition to the play. Abracen was careful not to overdo this, however, always keeping it as an undercurrent that contributed to rather than distracted from the main dramatic action.
This “Julius Caesar” provided a guide for other modern-style productions of classic works—while innovating the text, it did not fundamentally disturb the essential strength of the play as written. The production provided a subtle and elevated rendition, and the excellent work of the actors heightened the benefits of Abracen’s directorial decisions.

Amid the plethora of Harvard’s arts offerings, it might be easy to take the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players for granted. Year after year they mount solid productions of Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic operettas, typically eschewing gimmicks or eccentric stagings in favor of period costumes and a classic good time. Their new production of “The Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty,” which runs through Sunday in the Agassiz Theater, demonstrates the very best of this approach. Those who make the trek to the Agassiz will be rewarded with two and a half hours of glorious farce, brought to life by an ensemble whose effortless comic rapport is the kind that only comes through grueling practice.
First staged in 1879, “Pirates” is at its core a light-hearted Victorian satire. The eponymous hero of the story is Frederic (Alexander J. Raun ’17), who on his 21st birthday is preparing to leave his apprenticeship with a merry band of pirates. As a newly restored law-abiding citizen, he feels duty-bound to turn against his old friends; hilarity ensues. Along the way Frederic falls in love with Mabel (Allison A. Ray ’14), the daughter of a major-general. The script is riddled with quintessentially British humor in the form of puns, one-liners, and absurd turns of events, which feel surprisingly fresh thanks to the cast’s energetic delivery.
On the whole, the principal actors are excellent in most respects, with only a few minor complaints. While to-the-letter adherence to duty must be the defining trait of Frederic’s character, Raun’s Frederic is priggish in a way that can verge on irritating. As a singer, however, Raun is irreproachable, with a sweet voice and easy vibrato that convey Frederic’s earnest nature. As Mabel, Ray stuns from the moment of her entrance, unleashing a burst of sinuous coloratura  that understandably sets Frederic swooning. While Ray shows great vocal agility in the upper reaches of her range, she excels in slower passages as well. Her Act II duet with Raun, “Stay, Fred’ric, Stay,” is a touching departure from the overall levity of the show and provides a showcase for the leads’ gorgeous voices.
The supporting actors are equally memorable in their roles. As Mabel’s father, Major-General Stanley, Daniel W. Erickson ’14 shows an uncanny ability to inhabit the voice and mannerisms of a doddering old man. The potentially daunting “I Am The Very Model of a Modern Major-General” proves a triumph for him, and the major-general’s pompous bluster elicits some of the show’s biggest laughs. Other standouts include Ben M. Kelly ’17, who is dashing and totally at ease with his fellow actors in the role of the Pirate King. The weak point in an otherwise strong cast is Amelia H. Ross ’14, whose performance as the pirates’ maid Ruth seems forced and unnatural.
In a show filled with group numbers, much of the credit for the production is a result of the ensemble as a whole, under the capable stage direction of Allen J. Macleod ’14. Each section of the ensemble has a studied dynamic, from the almost parodic liveliness of the major-general’s daughters to the bumbling energy of the policemen who hop around the stage like bobble-head dolls. Every cast member is constantly interacting and reacting to events in a way that seems organic, making for a rich visual experience.
While the show’s quieter voices and rapid-fire lyrics are sometimes obscured by the orchestra, an unfortunate result of the sound level balance, music director George Baxter ’16 has done well by Gilbert and Sullivan’s catchy tunes. Particularly exciting are numbers such as “Poor Wand’ring One” and “With Cat-Like Tread” in which the cast manages to maintain vocal control while alternately skipping, leaping, kicking, running in circles, or lying flat on the ground. Hannah G. Sears ’16 has designed a set that allows the actors make the most of the Agassiz stage. Its most striking element is a lovely painted backdrop of an ocean sunset; beyond this, there is little to obstruct the cast from romping around the available space.
Ultimately, the most enjoyable aspect of the production is that everyone in it seems to be having a wonderful time, and this playful spirit is infectious. “Pirates” may not be the most emotionally challenging production at Harvard this fall—and there’s no need for it to be—but the show succeeds at what it sets out to do: it masters the beloved source material to create a light, funny, and charming experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot has been made this year about whether Harvard students need or should have a voice representing them on the Cambridge City Council. Having worked in politics prior to coming to Harvard, I couldn’t help but Google “Harvard” and “Cambridge City Council.” I came across an article in The Harvard Crimson written two years ago about Leland Cheung and was struck by this line: “For Cheung, facing his first re-election since taking office two years ago, politics is about fixing problems, not about putting on an act for a camera.”
The names working on the campaign may have changed, but I can tell you now from personal experience that everything in the article is still true. I’ve worked on campaigns from Barack Obama’s nationwide effort to one for local city controller race, and Cheung does have a unique and highly optimized style of campaigning he still keeps a trade secret. His dedication to residents and the job—not just campaigns—matches those of the best politicians I’ve known.
I also know Leland Cheung extends that dedication to Harvard students, even though we may not all know it and even though he graduated last June. Cheung is the leader that Harvard students need and fortunately, the leader that we already have.
When Cheung joined the Council in 2010 he radically changed the dialogue for the better. No longer could council members fault Harvard in general or attack its students without Cheung firing back. Videos from his early days on the Council show him explaining that members shouldn’t just make blanket statements—what the students want is often different from what the faculty wants, which in turn is often very different from what the administration wants.
Cheung has consistently worked to improve the lives of students here and represent our interests. He’s made campus safety one of his highest priorities by facilitating collaboration between university police and the Cambridge Police Department, getting lights put in on pedestrian pathways between campus and farther out dorms, and introducing BridgeStat, a statistical analysis program to stop crime before it spreads, which has led to significant improvements in Harvard Square and has been recognized for its effectiveness by the International Association of Crime Analysts.
Last term, when he was chair of the University Relations Committee, he regularly invited our elected representatives on the Harvard Graduate and Undergraduate Councils and gave them seats at the table. According to his office, he’s helped stave off eviction for off-campus students when a flood happened over spring break and the landlord threatened to dispose of all the possessions when they couldn’t move out or clean because they were away.
Leland Cheung has routinely been the go-to guy when student organizations sought permits to use public space for events. He tied Harvard closer to the community by introducing a program to broadcast events filmed on campus over local cable access TV. He’s marched alongside students in demonstrations and demanded the administration’s attention to our concerns.
Cheung has also helped bring about improvements to our life in the city that those of us just arriving on campus take for granted—from bringing Hubway to Cambridge, to promoting local retailers and late night eateries in Harvard Square, to bringing Wi-Fi to several nearby parks. He’s the one who’s proven he can get things done for us. A large factor in that is the fact that he was a part of the community before returning to graduate school here and is widely respected by long-time residents. So when he speaks on our behalf, they can’t dismiss him as someone who may be gone in a few years.
Leland Cheung isn’t just the councilor that Harvard students need; he’s the councilor we already have. Even if you haven’t yet heard of him and even if you haven’t had any reason to ask for his help, he’s the one you want. Leland Cheung has always kept an open line for students—remaining personally accessible via email, cell phone, Skype, chat, Facebook, Twitter, and even a “chat now” button on his website.
The reality is there’s no better candidate for Harvard students. He’s proven he cares about our interests and earned the respect necessary from the broader city to be effective in advocating for us. If you don’t know where to vote you’re likely either in Gund Hall or Quincy House. You can check whether you’re registered to vote and where to vote online.  Whether you’re already registered to vote or soon will be, make sure you vote Leland Cheung number one on November 5.
Henry S. U. Shah ’17, a volunteer for the Cheung campaign, lives in Stoughton Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday, New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly HKS ’84 was scheduled to give a lecture on “Proactive Policing in America’s Biggest City” at Brown University. But in a move that we believe was ill-conceived and ill-mannered, a group of aggressive protestors shouted him down before he was able to speak.
We are troubled by stop-and-frisk, the policy that grants the officers of Kelly’s NYPD broad leeway to question “suspicious” individuals—the burden of this incursion on liberty falls far too heavily on African Americans and Hispanics for us to believe that it is justifiably balanced by a countervailing interest in maintaining order.
But Brown protestors were wrong to silence the police commissioner. While stop-and-frisk may or may not be unconstitutional (had they allowed Kelly to give his talk, protestors would have had the opportunity to challenge him on the contentious policy), Kelly has unquestionably reduced crime in New York City—the homicide rate has plunged to a record low. In light of his successful tenure, Ray Kelly of all people deserves a place in our public discourse.
The hearts of the students who yelled things like “racism is not up for debate” were in the right place: We’d much rather live in a society where the instinctive reaction to what seems like invidious racial discrimination is one of repugnance and not (as was the norm for so long in this country) tacit or enthusiastic acceptance. But we believe the protestors’ unwillingness to engage with someone who thinks differently—to instead muscle the opposition into silence—was disrespectful and ultimately misguided. In shouting Kelly down, the Brown protestors came off as open-minded to the point of intolerance—the caricature of the leftist protestor.
Indeed, all speech, not just that from someone of Kelly’s stature, should be met with a willingness to listen and engage, not obstruct. As Justice Oliver W. Holmes, Jr. wrote: “[I]f there is any principle in the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those that agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.” The Constitution, of course, limits government from obstructing speech. But the principle enshrined in the First Amendment ought to be valued and respected by citizens as well.
The sole reason not to let an individual make his or her case is out of concern that that case might prove convincing. As such, censorship—which is what the Brown protestors’ actions amounted to—is evidence not of righteousness or courage but of narrow-mindedness and fear.

Don’t let the title worry you: This isn’t just a column about Logan Leslie—or at least about Leslie alone. It’s a column about Leland Cheung. It’s about Craig A. Kelley, Kenneth E. Reeves, and Minka Y. vanBeuzekom, not to mention Frank J. Addinola, Jr., Katherine M. Clark, James V. Aulenti, and James O. Hall.
Don’t recognize any of those names? Neither did I. That’s exactly the problem.
Cheung, Kelley, Reeves, and vanBeuzekom account for four out of seven incumbents in the 25-person race for nine seats on the Cambridge City Council. Addinola, Clark, Aulenti, or Hall will soon join the traveling army of civil servants who spend their weekdays in Washington, D.C. as members of the United States House of Representatives. Tomorrow, voters registered in Cambridge will get the chance to determine the outcome of the City Council election. And on December 10, they can choose who will fill brand-new Senator Ed Markey’s well-worn Fifth District shoes in the House of Representatives.
I’m one of these privileged voters. Though but a transient, bound to leave Cambridge and my halcyon college days behind to enter the dreary working (or graduate-school) world in a matter of years, I’ve chosen to cast my vote here in the Bay State rather than in my hometown. As I’ve noted before, much of my motivation stems from a desire to have the full say in the political process I’m deprived of as a sometime Washington, D.C. denizen (No Taxation Without Representation, am I right?).
If I’m voting here, though, I ought to know what’s going on, and not only when it comes to major national elections. And yet if I’d walked into the voting booth for the City Council election a week ago, I’d have stared blankly at the sheet in front of me, an unknown, unnavigable sea of names. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, I’d have made the only logical decision: vote for whichever sounds the coolest. So congratulations, Minka. One for you.
Thankfully, someone prompted me to change course in the nick of time. That someone was the one, the only, Logan Leslie. I’m not attempting to endorse Leslie here. Rather, I aim to disendorse the way the bulk of Harvardians responded to his candidacy.
Free bottle openers? Sign us up. Students at first flocked to Leslie like camera-bearing tourists to the shiny foot of the John Harvard statue. Then, a negative Crimson op-ed changed minds as quickly as undergrads using the statue for its true purpose flee from HUPD officers on a Saturday night. A defense from Leslie’s campaign manager softened some of us up once again. But at what point did we pull our eyes from Leslie’s friendly face and the newspaper’s pages to do a little of our own research?
Leslie’s platform centers on the idea that students, who account for over a fifth of Cambridge’s population, deserve representation on the City Council. Maybe so. If we believe Leslie, though, and feel that one of our ilk ought to occupy a council seat, we must have a reason we want our voices heard. We must take a look at what issues both our community behind Johnston Gate and Cantabrigians outside our walls face that the City Council could address. We must decide how we might want them solved, and we must identify what candidates we feel could do the job. If we don’t care about any of that, if we don’t think the council race worth more than a few minutes of our time, then where do we get off asserting our need for a seat in the first place?
I’ve been told time and time again that it’s my civic duty to vote. I agree. But there’s a little more to it: It’s my civic duty, and all of our civic duties, to vote informed. Otherwise, our votes mean nothing, and we demand representation based only on a vague, unproductive feeling of entitlement.
So tomorrow, let’s vote our conscience, but let’s also make sure our guts know what they’re doing. And for those too busy with midterms to study up this quickly, let’s at least pull it together before December. After all, representation shouldn’t be just something we get. We should also try to give a little in return.

To the editor:
It is clear from the article “Sexing Discourse” (October 29, 2013) by Reed E. McConnell ’15, that the author simply does not understand why groups like the Anscombe Society, Harvard College Faith and Action, the Catholic Student Association, the Knights of Columbus, and the Daughters of Isabella are concerned about the widespread use of pornography.  If anything, her critique of White Ribbon Against Pornography Week, which the aforementioned groups jointly sponsored, demonstrates precisely why these groups are wise to draw attention to this issue.
Put aside, for a moment, the issue of whether WRAP Week is right to raise concerns about pornography.  In this article, the author rejects these concerns without even knowing what they are.  In addressing the substance of WRAP Week, she only mentions problems related to the sex trafficking industry, implying that pornography could only possibly be harmful because of trafficking and exploitation in the industry.  These are only the beginning of the problems with pornography, however, and WRAP Week spent most of its time and energy raising concerns that this author seems never to have heard of.  For example, she views the title of one of the talks, “Collateral Damage: How Pornography Affects Women,” as “highly offensive.”  She does not actually say why, but the reason (alluded to a few paragraphs later) seems to be that it “den[ies]sex workers…any agency.”  This event was not about sex workers, though; rather, it was about the potential harms to women from living in a world in which the majority of men view pornography frequently, something this author seems never to have considered.
I have no doubt that this author is far from alone in her misconceptions.  For some reason, many people think that viewing pornography could not possibly be harmful to a person and his or her relationships, and that widespread, frequent viewing of pornography could not possibly be problematic for a society.  (On both counts, there is ample evidence to suggest otherwise.)  The article “Sexing Discourse” criticized WRAP Week and called for a more nuanced discussion of pornography.  In fact, WRAP Week delivered nuance, and McConnell’s column ignored large parts of the issue.

Japan’s Senior Vice-Minister of the Cabinet Office Yasutoshi Nishimura emphasized the need to revitalize Japan’s stagnating economy and explained the different components of “Abenomics”—Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s plan for economic revitalization—to Harvard affiliates Saturday afternoon.
According to Nishimura, decades of sluggish economic growth in Japan have generated a sense of stagnation in the country.
“Japanese economy and society have become introverted,” Nishimura said. “In the meantime, China and other emerging economies have developed economic powers and increased their presence in the world economy.”
As the prime minister’s cabinet member, Nishimura’s speech at the Harvard Kennedy School focused on the controversial economic reforms that have been implemented in Japan since Abe’s election one year ago. According to Nishimura, “Abenomics” is designed to “boost the metabolism” of domestic industry, globalize the Japanese economy, and stimulate domestic and foreign investment.
Nishimura pointed to the 3.8 percent real GDP growth rate for the April to June quarter this year as evidence of the effectiveness of reforms, which include an aggressive set of monetary, fiscal, and structural changes. So far, Japan’s central bank has implemented a large-scale quantitative easing program that aims to double the country’s monetary base in two years to pull the economy out of deflation.
However, according to Nishimura, economic revitalization will occur through private initiatives, not through the government.
“The role of the government, rather, is to create the proper environment for such initiatives,” he said.
To boost industry, the new administration plans to stimulate investment in emerging companies through corporate tax cuts to boost foreign investment and the establishment of national strategic zones to attract business projects.
“Abenomics” plans to combat Japan’s decreasing population and labor force participation rate by creating more opportunities for women in the workforce and drastically increasing the number of child care centers, according to Nishimura.
Nishimura also expressed his belief that “the deepening of the Japan and U.S. alliance in the growth sense will bring significant benefits in various areas such as economic development, peace, and stability in the world.” Japan’s economic resurgence, Nishimura said, would enable it to cooperate with the U.S. to improve global trade, foreign, and security policies.
In a question-and-answer session following the talk, one audience member asked about current Sino-Japanese relations. Nishimura chose to answer in Japanese with the help of an English translator.
“In terms of security issues, Japan is strongly against China trying to change the status quo with the use of force,” Nishimura said. “We need [China] to abide by international rules.” Nishimura said that Japan is always willing to engage in dialogue with China.
Despite Nishimura’s comprehensive overview of Japan’s new economic policies, some audience members said the speech was one-sided.
“Today’s speech was more along the lines of what the government’s policies are rather than a candid appraisal of what may or may not happen,” said John A. Shane, founder of the Japan Society of Boston, one of the sponsors of the event.

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and columnist Nicholas D. Kristof ’81 shared his thoughts on the state of the news industry and gave advice for future humanitarian efforts to an audience of students and parents in Kirkland House Saturday afternoon. 
“I am slightly intimidated about speaking at Harvard,” said Kristof, a former Crimson news editor. He recalled watching crowds of people passing through Harvard Yard when he was scheduled to give a speech on campus a few years ago, only to learn that Bill Clinton, too, was speaking that day.
His appearance on Saturday as part of the Conversations with Kirkland speaker series took the form of a question-and-answer session. Kristof, whose work focuses on social and economic problems around the world, fielded a variety of questions ranging from the role of the media in society to the allocation of humanitarian resources.
News sources have a growing tendency to conform to and affirm people’s points of views, Kristof said, a change that he attributed to greater political segregation in the American population. Kristof explained the merits of reading different works and considering opposing opinions on social and political issues.
“I work out not because I like it but because I think it makes me a better person,” Kristof said.
“I read the Wall Street Journal editorial page in the same spirit,” he added jokingly.
Subsequent conversation focused almost exclusively on social issues. When asked about how students can make an impact on the world, Kristof emphasized the use of evidence and randomized data collection to determine the value of social works.
For example, Kristof described the politicized solutions proposed in response to the AIDS epidemic in Africa. On one side, liberals proposed contraception, while conservatives believed abstinence was the cure, Kristof shared.
Ultimately, the most cost-effective option was neither, Kristof said. Providing training to young women and warning them of sexually interacting with much older males proved to be the most cost-effective preventative measure, according to Kristof.
Kristof also spoke about the importance of balancing humanitarian efforts internationally and at home.
“If you are trying to address various inequities and problems around the world, you get much more bang for the buck trying to save lives in Bangladesh than in the U.S.,” Kristof said. At the same time, however, he warned of ignoring poverty problems that exist locally.
Students at the event said they appreciated the advice Kristof had to offer about social justice and action.
 “We are really fortunate to have had the opportunity to have him come here,” said Lily Ostrer ’14, a student organizer for Conversations with Kirkland. “He has obviously captured the attention of people all over the world, but particularly young people in this country about motivating them to action on issues of global justice."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Archbishop of Boston Seán Patrick O’Malley joined members of the Catholic community for a celebration of All Saint’s Day on Friday at St. Paul Catholic Church in Harvard Square.
“That the cardinal is here today is a particular blessing,” said Rev. Matthew J. Westcott, the undergraduate chaplain at the Church of St. Paul. “He is the shepherd of the flock in Boston, and it’s a wonderful opportunity to hear his words in person.”
All Saint’s Day is celebrated every year the day after Halloween to commemorate Christian saints and spirits. Seated underneath the ceiling and stained glass adorned with images of holy persons, observers were visually reminded of the good works of known saints.
Gregory M. Malecha, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who attended the service, said the day was a celebration of saints as role models of the Catholic faith.
“We look to them to see how they dealt with various struggles,” he said.
The holiday is also meant to commemorate and honor the lives of those who may not have been formally recognized by the church but nonetheless walked in holiness.
“As Catholics we believe that saint’s souls are in heaven with God,” Westcott said. “This is obvious for the famous saints, but today is dedicated to saints we don’t know.”
The archbishop is one of 115 cardinals in a conclave that elected Pope Francis earlier this year and is one of eight cardinals chosen to advise the Pope on reforming the governance of the Church. Cardinal O’Malley visited Harvard Square as part of a special program of outreach and evangelization to young adults and college students.
In his homily at the Church of St. Paul, the Archbishop connected the recent Red Sox win at the World Series to the work of the community’s Catholic “teammates,”  adding that “holiness demands a constant effort.”
“It is an important day for Catholics, but this service was obviously a really big deal with the Archbishop here,” said Curtis W. St. Pierre ’16, a self-identified Catholic. “It is nice to have the opportunity to get together in the community, and the Archbishop himself is really personable and nice to interact with.”
The service was also accompanied by the music of St. Paul's Choir School, the only Catholic choir school for boys in the United States.

Members of “Red Sox Nation” lined the streets of Boston to catch a glimpse of this year’s World Series champions as they rode on the city’s iconic duck boats for Saturday’s victory parade.
Proudly displaying their 2013 World Series trophy, the players started at Fenway and headed down Boylston Street before launching into the Charles River waters, following a similar route to the 2004 Red Sox parade.
For Dan Wheatman, a Bostonian and longtime Red Sox fan, this year’s win was especially significant because of the tough year Boston has gone through.
“We built over the bombing, but now, with an event like this, it brings us back together.” Wheatman said. “We’re still strong. We’re one city.”
In a somber moment, members of the Red Sox paused and gave tribute to victims of the Boston bombing by placing their trophy and a team jersey on the Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street.
Other attendees at the parade said that they were especially ecstatic this year because of how unexpected the Red Sox win was. Although the team swept the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, the Sox have grappled since then, finishing last in their division at the end of the 2012 season.
One Red Sox fan at the parade carried a sign bearing the words “The Worst-to-First Red Sox,” a moniker fans gave the team after they clinched the title by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals 6-1 on Wednesday.
“I had given up on them. No one thought they were going to do anything.” said Kevin George, a fan from greater Boston at Saturday’s celebration.
Bostonian Jeff Fagan agreed with the unexpected success of his hometeam.
“The players this year had more heart. They started to get better and better and better, but no one expected this,” Fagan said.
Some fans in the passion-filled and diverse crowd trailed the parade route from beginning to end, and many members of the Harvard community were in attendance.
“Being a student here, and being so close, it’s so easy to get over to Fenway Park,” said Andrew G. Kalina ’14, a senior who watched the parade from the Charles River.
Kalina described himself as a fourth-generation Red Sox fan, who lived in Arizona for 11 years and moved to Minneapolis, but whose mother was raised in New England.
“We’ve never been to the parade. It was quite the experience,” said Kalina, who also attended several Red Sox games in the year, including the Series win.
Unlike the Red Sox’s previous parades, this year’s rally took place on a Saturday, which many families said was a factor in their ability to come.
Jackie and Joey Broza, who brought along their two young children, said that they left New Hampshire at 3:30 a.m. in order to make it to the duck boat parade.
“We were born into being Red Sox fans,” Jackie said. “Hopefully [our children] will grow up to be Red Sox fans too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 7, 2013, at 2:40 a.m.
This weekend, Harvard affiliates presented inventive solutions meant to make the world safer and confront public safety issues during the first annual Public Safety Innovation Hackathon at the Harvard Innovation Lab this past weekend.
Tony Huang ’12, the Hackathon organizer, described the event’s mission as encouraging students to utilize their skills and technological prowess to create software that can be used by law enforcement.
“Why can’t these students help prevent tragedies like the [Los Angeles International Airport] shooting and apply the model used in Silicon Valley to public safety?” Huang said.
The Hackathon was coordinated by the student organization HackHarvard and digital management firm, Evidence.com.
The competition involved about 10 teams made up of Boston area college students tasked with creating software to help tackle one of several “Public Safety Problem Statements”–improving cross-agency communication, visualizing big data, and integrating social media tools for law enforcement officials.
Beginning Saturday afternoon, competitors spent the night coding, and presented their finished product on Sunday to a panel of law enforcement and IT specialist judges. A grand prize of $1000, sponsored by Evidence.com, was awarded to Robert T. Bowden ’13 and Ben B. Shryock ’15 for creating a crash reporter web application.
The Hackathon officially kicked-off Saturday morning with speeches from public safety and law enforcement professionals, including retired Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis.
“I see unlimited potential [in the Hackathon],” said Davis, who this past year oversaw the capture of the Boston Marathon bombers.”Our profession is ripe for improvement. We are using technology that looks like it came from the 80s.”
Scott E. Crouch ’13, who founded Mark43—a law enforcement startup that brings new information management abilities to police officers—characterized methods used now by police to record and find evidence as antiquated, citing practices like relying on paper records to find suspects over software.
That is where creative college kids can come in, Huang said.
“We tend to see that government tech lags behind consumer tech,” Huang said.. “Right now we are at the inflection point where government wants to use consumer technology.”
Davis noted that technology has historically helped advance crime-fighting tactics, allowing police to be preventative, rather than reactionary. But, Davis told the competitors, there is still much to do.
“The work that you do in this area can save lives,” he said. “If you can put something together that moves us from Microsoft Word to the cloud…then we can reduce some of the inefficiencies that are driving the crime rate up and help us save lives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what will likely be the first of many votes in an Undergraduate Council effort to revise UC rules, representatives voted in favor of a revision to a portion of the UC Bylaws governing the structure of Council committees at a general meeting on Sunday.
The Committee Bylaws Update Act, which passed with unanimous Council support, amends Article III of the 33-paged UC Bylaws in order to officially bring the Bylaws in line with the current structure and role of each UC committee.
“[The Bylaws] was outdated and did not reflect the structure and organization of each committee on the Council,” UC Rules Committee Chair Kevin H. Xiong ’17 wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The UC is made up of six committees. The Finance Committee accepts and approves grant applications for student groups, the Student Life Committee is charged with representing undergraduates to College administrators on student life issues, the Education Committee considers issues related to undergraduate education, the Student Initiatives Committee works both within the Council and with other undergraduates to develop initiatives, the Student Relations Committee publicizes Council activities, and finally, the Rules Committee revises the Constitution and Bylaws and oversees the UC referendum process.
Representatives from each committee met with the Rules Committee Friday to draft the legislation and identify potential improvements to the text of the Bylaws. Almost all of the changes to the Bylaws make the structure of the committees less rigid.
For example, what once was the Student Life Committee vice chair for college life and Committee vice chair for house life has been consolidated into two general vice chair positions and language specifying the procedure for the Student Relations Committee was entirely dismissed.
The revision of the Bylaws to accommodate the recent such recent restructurings may be the first of many changes to the UC Constitution and Bylaws in the coming months.
According to Council updates sent over the UC general email list Sunday night, the Rules Committee will discuss potential changes to the mission statement of each committee this Friday.
“The goal is to make [the Constitution and Bylaws] more readable [and] shorter,” said Xiong during the meeting, referring to the fall semester push on the part of the Rules Committee to improve the Constitution and the Bylaws.
The Council also briefly discussed the status of the “We The Crimson” initiative which is now on “pause,” according to Student Relations Committee Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16. Nasrollahzadeh said to the Council that with the recent transition in College administrative leadership she was looking to reconnect with the administration about the initiative.
The initiative, which was launched in last November, allows students to vote on petitions suggested by students on an online portal. The top three petitions each month are presented to College administrators for review.
The UC also approved more than $15,000 in Large Venue Grants funding at Sunday’s meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 2012 Valentina Perez ’15 found herself working in Mather dining hall to ensure that students were registered to vote and that they were aware of the different ways their votes would count in their home state versus in Massachusetts. To some, she suggested voting in their home states because of the importance their votes could have in the presidential election. To others, she recommended registering in Cambridge, in large part because of the hotly contested race going on between then-Senator Scott Brown and current-Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Her work was part of an initiative by the Institute of Politics to maximize the number of registered Harvard students and make it easier for students to vote, which included collecting sealed absentee ballots and mailing them appropriately.
“A lot of people at Harvard are...busy,” Perez told The Crimson Saturday, adding that the bureaucratic obstacles to voting were, in her view, a large factor keeping students from submitting ballots. “A lot of what we did in H-Vote was saying, ‘Okay, the IOP can stamp your envelope…. A lot of what we did was to try to reduce the hassle.”
Now, a year later, Cambridge City Council candidate Logan E. Leslie ’16 is trying to mobilize the Harvard vote on the municipal level. Though the Harvard sophomore says that he is focusing on putting together a broad base of support across the city, many of his efforts have been focused on easing the process of voter registration in Cambridge for Harvard students and motivating Cambridge’s student population, which has historically been indifferent to municipal elections, to head to the polls on Tuesday.
Leslie’s campaign could benefit from the recent increase in the number of Harvard students registered in Cambridge, which followed from last year’s efforts to register students for the 2012 presidential and senatorial races. But some question whether he can successfully maintain student interest in such a small-scale race.
“It’s just not as exciting a race as a presidential or senatorial,” said Daniel Ki ’15, director of campaigns for the Harvard College Democrats. “I think awareness is the initial issue, but now it’s a question of getting people excited enough to take the 10 minutes they need to get out and vote.”
COUNTING ON STUDENT VOTE
Logan Leslie is not the first candidate to attempt to bring the student voice to Cambridge City Council elections. In 2003, Matthew DeBergalis, an engineer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from MIT, attempted to mobilize Cambridge’s student population around a campaign platform that promised better late-night transportation, the preservation of local nightclubs, and licenses that would allow businesses to stay open later.
DeBergalis won the endorsement of The Harvard Crimson’s editorial board. He said at the time that he had registered 800 students from Harvard and MIT and that 400 of those university students had pledged him their votes. In the time since then, an average of 33 people registered in Harvard dorms have voted in municipal elections each cycle, according to data from the City of Cambridge.
But when DeBergalis ran in 2003, 131 dorm residents turned out to vote in the City Council elections.
According to local political analyst Robert Winters, DeBergalis actually won enough votes to place him eighth in the first round of voting. But, because of a lack of broad-based support and Cambridge’s system of proportional representation, he came in 10th place in his attempt to win a seat on the nine-person Council.
“You still have to get transfer votes from other candidates...and no one else knew him,” Winters said. “So he just sat there while other candidates walked right by him.”
In an interview with The Crimson last month, Leslie said that he was not relying on the student vote for his election.
“You can’t count on any vote—I’m not counting on the student vote,” Leslie said. “I expect to have a strong student response, but I’m not basing my entire campaign on students.”
In addition to creating a student advisory committee, Leslie has proposed reforming zoning ordinances and licensing distribution in the city. Leslie has said that he hopes to preserve Harvard Square’s mom-and-pop stores while easing the process of opening new businesses in the city.
But in an email sent out this weekend to students registered to vote in Cambridge, Leslie portrayed himself primarily as a student advocate.
“I’m running to begin a conversation between students and our city’s leaders,” wrote Leslie. “I will fight to create an unprecedented student advisory committee and provide more opportunities for undergraduates to give back to the city we call home.”
Leslie called on students to head to the polls Tuesday, saying in the email that each of their votes will “truly make a difference.”
‘A SHORT-TERM OPPORTUNITY’
Rajiv Tarigopula ’14, president of the Harvard Republican Club, told The Crimson that, this fall, Leslie approached both the Harvard Republican Club and the Harvard College Democrats seeking endorsements.
Neither club ultimately chose to endorse anyone in the Council election. But Tarigopula estimated that about 10 members of the Harvard Republican Club have chosen to work for the campaign of Leslie, a registered Republican.
Ki told The Crimson that, this semester, the Harvard College Democrats’ have not been prioritizing local elections. Last year, the Democrats had worked to mobilize the student vote for the Warren senate campaign in the fall and the Markey senate campaign in the spring.
Asked about the obstacles in mobilizing the student vote in local elections, Ki discussed the differences in student interest in the Warren and Markey campaigns.
“People like voting for president and for senatorial races,” Ki said. “We had a Democratic primary for the 5th congressional district to replace Ed Markey and the turnout was a lot lower because I think people are less excited about those types of races, even though I think you can make the argument that...because fewer people are voting and because it’s on a smaller scale, your vote matters more.”
While Ki noted the difficulties that Leslie would face in motivating registered students to head to the polls on Tuesday, others discussed how Leslie was benefiting from a recent increase in the Cambridge’s student voter population—an increase that followed from the 2012 Massachusetts Senate election.
“There might be a short-term opportunity,” Winters said. “There was always a problem that people were registered in Ohio or something.”
The Massachusetts senate race between Republican Scott Brown and Democrat Elizabeth Warren had sustained national attention throughout 2012, as the election’s outcome would have an impact on the Democrats’ power in the Senate.
Perez told The Crimson that the IOP had assisted interested students in switching their voter registration from their home state to Massachusetts. That year, the Harvard College Democrats registered more than 154 students to vote in Massachusetts, with an eye towards the Warren campaign.
The national spotlight on the Warren-Brown race helps explain the uptick in the number of Harvard students who voted in Cambridge during the 2012 election cycle. According to data from the City of Cambridge, 585 people registered in Harvard dorms voted for the 2004 November elections and 385 voters from Harvard dorms did so for the 2008 November elections. But in 2012, 994 people from Harvard dorms cast their ballots in Cambridge.
‘I ACTUALLY LIVE IN NEW YORK’
Perez told The Crimson, the motivation for students to vote in the Warren-Brown race was the election’s promised effect on the national political scene.
“People would say, ‘Keep the Senate blue. Elect Warren,’” Perez said.
Perez suggested that students, since the Warren race, have shown little interest in congressional and local races, because they lack a sense of ownership in Massachusetts politics.
“A lot of students don’t really associate with the Massachusetts community,” said Perez. “They think—I live here temporarily. I actually live in New York.”
Two weeks ago, as Leslie’s team was kicking its canvassing efforts into high-gear, a Crimson op-ed on the City Council election written by Sam G. Greenberg, James B. Pollack, and Simon Thompson touched on the issue of Harvard students’ being registered in Cambridge but not identifying as Cantabrigians.
The op-ed questioned whether Harvard students were right to be fighting for a seat on the Council. The piece asked its student readers, “But are we entitled to one-ninth of the decision-making power in the city when we are only temporary residents, when many Council decisions don’t even affect us, and when we contribute so little of its revenue?”
Two days later, Eric M. Cervini ’14, campaign manager for Logan Leslie, penned a rebuttal that was also published in The Crimson.
“We live in Cambridge, and we live in a nation where voting in one’s place of residency is a right—not a privilege earned after a citizen is deemed worthy,” Cervini wrote.
Sietse Goffard ’15, Director of National Campaign for the IOP, acknowledged these concerns and pointed to some city issues that are relevant to Harvard students.
“I know there’s sort of a debate about how much legitimacy we have to be in that process because of course we go to Harvard and we’re not the sort of median voter in Cambridge,” Goffard said. “But there are lots of issues relevant to us—for example, combating crime in Cambridge and making sure that housing is affordable.”
Sara Rosenberg ’16, a native Cantabrigian and graduate of Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, said that she was glad to see Harvard students becoming involved in local politics. But she questioned whether the Harvard students who plan to vote on Tuesday have taken a close look at the election’s core issues.
“I don’t think that all Harvard students will necessarily be informed of all things that are affecting Cambridge city residents that are on the ballot,” Rosenberg said. “It takes a little more consciousness.”
Winters offered a more simplistic appraisal of student voters.
“There’s only one thing they’re interested really, which is, ‘Oh he’s one of us. Sure, we like to vote for one of us,’” Winters said. “That’s really what you’re appealing to.”

                    When Cambridge voters head to the polls on Tuesday, Nov. 5, they'll pick from among 25 candidates, all of whom have different ideas about how best to negotiate University relations, fight crime and promote safety, interact with the environment, legislate housing, and foster Square business in the city. Click on the tabs to examine the five women and 20 men vying to fill the Council's nine seats: who they are and where they fall on the issues.
                  
As residents we are honored to live in the shadows of two of the greatest learning institutions in the world, but we cannot just live in their shadows. We can't thrive as a city when we have two different populations, one wealthy and one poor. Close to 50 percent of the kids in the public school system live in near-poverty. We need to face these challenges.
If any group, university or not, wants to build at the neighborhood edge, they have to live by a common sense of community. You have to play by what I call a neighbor bill of rights.
You have to recognize that [Cambridge and Harvard's] histories are intertwined and that one would not be successful without the other. So I think you can't unbundle the image of Cambridge as a liberal, well-functioning bastion of good governance from Harvard University.
I'm not sure that the residents always respect the University and that the University always respects the residents… I'm a firm believer in having open and honest conversations. Historically there's been some tension because there's been some mistrust. There has to be a conversation.
The mix of businesses is really important. Having small locally owned businesses and larger chain businesses is good... I'd like to see a more convenient, reasonably priced grocery store. I love Tasty Burger but I miss 7 to 11. Where do you go to buy a coke in Harvard Square or, god forbid, munchies at 2 a.m.? That's a loss.
More police on the spot as opposed to more surveillance cameras is certainly one of the things we can do. If we need to take a little money out of the Cambridge rainy-day fund to help pay for that, it's certainly there.
[The first housing policy I would implement is] rent control: to make an orderly market for people who need a place to live, who need shelter. This means regulation.

The son of Puerto Rican and Dominican immigrants, Benzan says that Cambridge is the city of dreams for him as much as it was for his parents. Benzan, a practicing attorney, says that he is committed to improving access to job training and industry for Cambridge residents.
A 1976 graduate of Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, Carlone is running under the banner of “planning for people.” Carlone, an architect and urban designer by profession, says that one of his top priorities is to create a city-wide, people-centered, comprehensive master plan that conforms with state law.
While running in 2009 for the Cambridge City Council seat he now occupies, Cheung was pursuing a joint master’s degree in public administration at Harvard Kennedy School and an MBA at MIT Sloan School of Management—making him the first currently enrolled student to be elected to the Council. Cheung is also the first Asian American to be elected to the Council. Since taking up his seat, Cheung has paid particular attention to promoting affordable housing, government transparency, and job growth. In the last term, Cheung has served as chair of the Cable TV, Telecommunications & Public Utilities Committee and the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning Committee.
The daughter of a policeman and schoolteacher, House says she learned early about the importance of public service. She now serves as the director of member and community relations for the Kendall Square Association, a nonprofit dedicated to improving, protecting, and promoting Kendall Square. She has a master’s degree in urban planning and has put her background as a planner to work while serving as the first executive director of Cambridge Local First, another group dedicated to fostering a strong local economy for Cambridge. A native of Salt Lake City, House has lived in Cambridge for just over five years.
Kelley is running for his fifth consecutive term on the Cambridge City Council. He has chaired the Council’s Traffic, Parking and Transportation Committee, the Public Safety Subcommittee, and the Veterans’ Committee. Kelley was born and raised in nearby Wellesley and later attended Boston College Law School, where he earned the Susan B. Desmaris award for Public Service Achievement and Leadership for his work on environmental issues. Kelley and his wife Hope say they can’t imagine raising their two children anywhere outside Cambridge.

A Harvard sophomore and a former Green Beret, Leslie is running on the platform of bridging Cambridge’s town-gown divide. If elected, Leslie says, he will represent the student voice on the Council, in part by establishing and soliciting advice from a committee of university students. If he wins a seat, Leslie will be the first Harvard College student to serve on the Council in recent history.
A Cambridge native and former city mayor, Maher brings a wealth of business and nonprofit experience to the City Council. His priority as a candidate is to use his experience as former mayor, seven-term City Councillor, and four-term School Committee member to improve and deepen his involvement with quality-of-life issues in neighborhoods.
Mazen, a lifelong resident of the Greater Boston area, aims to bring his experience as a small business owner and educator to the Cambridge City Council. His priority as a candidate is to use self-imposed term limits to ensure that new voices frequently enter the Council. Mazen said he hopes his new system will encourage politicians to work for generational change and put the city’s best interests ahead of their own political ambitions.
A fourth-generation resident of Cambridge and father of four, McGovern has lived in Cambridge his whole life. He has served four terms on the Cambridge School Committee, during which he has championed early childhood education. He began his career a social worker working with children with special needs children in foster care and now says that he hopes to bring what he describes as the systematic, common-sense approach of social work to decision-making on the Council.
Mello has lived in Cambridge his whole life and said he is primarily running in this year’s election because he is “disturbed by the way the city spends money,” and is “worried about the long-term effects of our largesse.” Mello said he plans to find ways to reduce overall city spending while also prioritizing spending on public healthcare.
Mirza, a native of India, has lived in Cambridge for the past 40 years. The environmental engineer said that after traveling to Antarctica and witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change, he plans to prioritize the improvement of Cambridge’s environment policies. He also hopes to focus on increased access to affordable housing.

Smith was born in Lawrence, Mass., and moved to Cambridge 10 years ago to work with Councillor and State Representative Timothy J. Toomey Jr.’s Public Safety and Security Committee. Later, as legislative director for MassDOT under Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78, Smith helped draft the governor’s Way Forward Plan, which brought in about $6 million for transportation in the Commonwealth. He has also worked with Mass Recycle and the Cambridge Democrats. Smith says that in this election, his main priority will be housing affordability, specifically making rent more affordable for young professionals and new families.
Toomey has held a seat on the City Council since 1990 and has served as a Massachusetts State Representative since 1993. He is a lifelong resident of East Cambridge and an avid supporter of affordable housing, job creation, and sound fiscal management.
VanBeuzekom was elected to her first term on the Cambridge City Council in 2011. Although she originally hails from New Jersey, vanBeuzekom has lived in Cambridge for 33 years—ever since she graduated from Wellesley College. During her tenure as Councillor, she has spearheaded environments proposals such as introducing an ombudsman to coordinate the introduction of solar panels to Cambridge. On the Council, she now chairs the Environment and the Transportation Committee and Traffic & Parking Committee. If reelected, she hopes to continue to bring good listening skills and transparency—qualities that, she says, the Council often lacks.
A 25-year-old lifelong Cantabrigian and the son of Latin-American immigrants, Vasquez describes himself as an “activist of the youthful go-getter generation.” After he graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School in 2006, his plans to then pursue higher education were halted when he became a father at the age of 19. The experience of being a teenage father, he says, has inspired him to guide young people and serve the Cambridge community. He identifies his political priorities as providing greater opportunities for affordable living in Cambridge, aiding nonprofit organizations, providing a support network for the graduates of Cambridge public schools, and encouraging health and fitness among Cambridge’s youth.

Currently Sustainability Manager for the Cambridge public school system, von Hoffmann, 29, is running for City Council in the hopes of attending to a wide range of municipal issues including education and environmental sustainability. If elected, she hopes to work on bringing universal pre-kindergarten to Cambridge, creating a comprehensive sustainability plan for the city, and increasing the number of family-friendly affordable housing units.

Williamson, a Cambridge resident for the past 42 years, takes pride in his knowledge of the city. If elected to the City Council, he says, he will focus on keeping Cambridge rents down, raising the percent of housing units allocated to affordable housing, encouraging greater communication between the Council and local universities, and strengthening the relationship between Harvard University Police Department and Cambridge Police Department.
Yarden is running for City Council in part because he wants to make the government more open to the citizens of the city. He believes that the City Council and Cambridge’s local government are ignoring what’s happening in the world, namely climate change.

In a running series for The Back Page, contributing writer Patrick Xu breaks down the high school mixtapes of members of the Harvard men’s basketball team. In this post, Patrick looks at junior swingman Wesley Saunders.
To us basketball fans at Harvard the name Wes Saunders, brings a couple of things to mind. The junior guard is consistently called on to take the shot when Harvard’s offense runs stagnant towards the end of the shot clock. He has the funky, Kevin Martin-esque shot, yet still manages to hit more than 50 percent of his attempts from the field and 50 percent from three. He can throw some vicious dunks down (tl; dr: Yale sucks). And he literally looks like he’s never trying on the court. Seriously, search his images on Google. Does he even sweat?
When I checked out some of his high school mixtapes and interviews, I noticed some things have clearly changed but some things, however, clearly have not.  In the first mixtape that I look at, Saunders absolutely destroys one of my favorite high school teams, Salesian, in a championship game. He has numerous powerful blocks, especially at 0:32, where he ruins Dominic Artis’ (a current point guard at Oregon) attempt to finish a pretty sick play.
Another thing we don’t really see too often from both Saunders and the Harvard team as a whole is any sort of pull-up game. Yet, at 0:17, we see Saunders executes it perfectly. We can also see that Saunders’ Kevin Martin shooting form hasn’t changed since high school.
One thing we are used to, however, is Saunders’ athleticism. At 1:13, he absolutely throws it down on two Salesian players with a two-handed slam.  Not quite Sportscenter Top 10 worthy (#sctop10?), but still pretty sick.
I surprisingly couldn’t find many other full on mixtapes of Saunders, but I managed to scavenge for a couple of other pretty cool plays. In this clip, which is mostly an interview on Saunders and his coach, plus a tiny snippet on an apparent golf star Sandra Gal, we see Saunders display more of his athleticism. At 1:17, he pulls off a Rondo-esque ball fake and spin move for the score, and he runs back to D with the same little head nod and weird arm swaying that we’re used to.
At 1:31, we see him pull off a pretty fancy move on the fast break, swinging the ball around to avoid a defender going for the strip before ultimately finishing the lay up. A couple more plays feature much of the same: at 2:31, we see a slick spin move off the rebound. At 1:45, Saunders displays his trademark ability to finish with contact.
The coolest part about this clip, however, probably has to be this quote from Saunders old coach, Miguel Villegas: “I remember his freshman year he would never say anything. He would just come to practice and he did what we told him to do. Sophomore year, he woke up a little bit and he found how to put the ball into the basket and how to step out on the perimeter. Last year, he kind of just blossomed. This year, he’s out there. You can’t stop him now.”
With Saunders having made the sophomore leap last year—going from a small bench role (3.3 ppg) to an All-Ivy first team performance (16.2 ppg)—he is well on his way to going through the same progression here at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Triple overtime games are few and far between, yet Harvard has already played two games that took three extra frames to complete this year. In Saturday’s 48-51 loss to Princeton, both teams were able to rack up a substantial amount of stats in a game that saw over an hour and a half of playing time on the field. The Back Page takes a look at some of the noteworthy statistics from the 99-point game.
970 — Combined yards of total offense from both teams
122 — Tackles executed by Harvard’s defense
190 — Total number of plays run from scrimmage
53 — Combined number of first downs
23 — Harvard’s rank in the FCS before the game. The team has since dropped from the rankings
39-34 — The score of last year’s game in which Princeton handed Harvard its first loss of the season on a last minute touchdown drive (sound familiar?)
30:02 — Princeton’s time of possession during regulation
52.3 — Harvard quarterback Conner Hempel’s completion percentage
481 — Combined yards punted by each team on 12 punts
5-1 — Record of both teams following Saturday’s result
15 — Harvard’s undefeated home game streak snapped on Saturday

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In ‘Quotes of the Week’, The Back Page will look each weekend at the five best quotes of the week, providing context for the five best moments from the past seven days in Crimson sports.
“Our coaches have been stressing keeping the intensity and visualizing tackling people that we walk by on the streets to get in that mindset of having to do it on the field.” –Brandy Machado ‘13
In just the Crimson’s inaugural season, the women’s rugby team is two wins away from claiming an Ivy League championship. The team has not played since October 19 (a 36-0 blowout win over Princeton), but Harvard is staying ready as it preps for its first tournament game against Brown on Saturday. With a win, the second seeded Crimson would play either Dartmouth or Princeton for the Ancient Eight crown on Sunday.
“It is fun at artificial breaks, like the end of the season for example, to ask ‘How did we do?’, and ‘Are we working on the right things?’ If we measure ourselves against the competition we had, we had three wins and… it was a pretty successful fall. I am very proud of what the team did. I am very proud of how we worked as a team. Nobody takes days off, nobody is selfish.” – Women's golf coach Kevin Rhoads
The Harvard women’s golf team wrapped up its fall season this weekend at the Lehigh University Invitational in Pennsylvania. The team’s overall score of 600 was enough to seal a victory, earning the Crimson its third tournament win in four tries this fall. Junior Tiffany Lim led the way for Harvard, shooting a 74 and a 72 on Saturday and Sunday respectively. However, the Crimson were victorious on account of a well-rounded performance as all five of its players shot in the 70’s in both rounds.
“We knew that if we stuck to our game plan and just pressured them the whole field, they weren’t going to be able to handle us. We had trouble in the first half, but we refocused at halftime and just got back to our plan. The whole season we’ve been saying it over and over. If we just stick to our process, then we know good things are going to come, and you’re seeing it now.” –Daniel Smith ‘17
After opening the season 1-6-2, the Harvard men’s soccer team has initiated a massive turnaround. The team has won three straight conference games, propelling the Crimson (4-7-2, 3-1-0 Ivy) to second place in the Ancient Eight. In its most recent win, Harvard came back to beat Princeton 2-1 after freshman Daniel Smith scored the game-winner in the 83rd minute.
“We take pride in winning Ivy League games. We take pride in winning any game. But certainly it’s fun to beat Princeton...they’ve always been a rivalry of ours.” –Hilary Crowe ‘15
The seventh ranked women’s hockey team has opened the season with back to back wins, beating Quinnipiac 4-2 on Friday and Princeton 4-0 on Saturday. Since Quinnipiac is a member of the ECAC, both wins are conference wins for the Crimson, but the win over Princeton marks the team’s first true “Ivy League win.” Hilary Crowe had two goals and an assist, while goalie Emerance Maschmeyer notched 44 saves in the shutout.
“I think you’re going to learn just how resilient we are. Our kids have a tremendous amount of pride. Some years you lose a tough game like this, and you’ve got a maybe average opponent. We don’t have that luxury.” –Coach Tim Murphy
The Crimson football team saw its unbeaten streak come to an end this week when Princeton emerged from Harvard Stadium with a 51-48 victory in triple overtime. Despite coming up just short, Coach Tim Murphy is confident that his team will be quick to rebound.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
October is over, and there are plenty of reasons why you should be thrilled. First off, the halfway point of the semester has passed, and Thanksgiving break is just weeks away. Secondly, Boston has crowned another champion! The Red Sox have claimed an improbable World Series title, and you should be thrilled for your local team! Otherwise, you should be thrilled that you will no longer be surrounded by bandwagoners who bought their first Sox apparel moments before heading to Kenmore on Wednesday.
Lastly, the most important portion of the season has arrived for the fall sports teams at Harvard. Each team is preparing for a title run, and many teams are in great positions to do so. In fact, on Saturday afternoon, the women’s soccer team became the first Crimson team to clinch the Ivy League crown this year.
Meanwhile, many Harvard athletes have been taking to Twitter this week, especially underclassmen and men’s lacrosse players. Here are some of our favorites here at The Back Page from the past week!
6. Most freshmen decide how to set up their rooms during Opening Week, but Maggie Hartman, a forward for the basketball team, took a little longer to make an important decision.
“JUST UNBUNKED MY BUNK BED, life has improved exponentially :-D:-D:-D”
One downside…a lot less space to do activities.
5. Bryan Moore, a sophomore goalie for the men’s lacrosse team, had to be upset with the amount of electricity that Sox fans brought to the ballpark on Wednesday night.
“All the Cards need right now is a power outage in Fenway to spark their comeback.”
Fenway has been around for over a century and no power issues yet. Take notes, Detroit.
4. A valuable lesson can be learned from a situation that Sydney Daniels, a freshman forward for the women’s hockey team, was recently involved in.
“To the man I just gave completely faulty directions to, I'm sorry. You're probs going the wrong way, but enjoy your walk along the Charles?”
Never take directions from a freshman.
3. It’s not lacrosse season yet, but sophomore defenseman Stephen Jahelka is already beginning to get competitive.
“Coming out victorious in The Battle for the Mutually Shared Arm Rest in lecture with the kid next to me is one of the bigger W's I have had.”
Needless to say, it was a demoralizing loss for his opponent.
2. Tyler Grimaldi, a freshman on the wrestling team, got his first taste of Halloween at Harvard this year.
“Spending Halloween like a true Harvard student, in the library…”
Do Harvard students ever don nerd costumes for Halloween? The irony…
1. The only upperclassmen on our list, Danny Eipp, a senior midfielder for the lacrosse team, has likely seen far more at Harvard than his preceding counterparts. However, prior to last week, he certainly had not seen it all…
“Bringing your book to read at the urinal is too much. ‪#doless”
And this is what Harvard looks for when filling its classes every year: students full of ambition and capable of multitasking. This generation at its finest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a running series for The Back Page, contributing writer Patrick Xu breaks down the high school mixtapes of members of the Harvard men’s basketball team. In this post, Patrick looks at junior big man Kenyatta Smith.
Remember last year when Harvard basketball had the awkward platoon of big men with no one clearly leading the pack? Jonah Travis began the year off as a starter, while Steve Mondou-Missi also played big minutes and had a couple of huge plays (awkward reverse, anyone?)
And then, out of nowhere came Kenyatta Smith, who was playing less than 10 minutes a game up until he started against Penn at home and proceeded to have an out-of-body Dwight-Howard-like performance. Smith dominated from start to finish, effectively destroying Penn’s interior game on both ends with 20 points, 10 blocks, and nine rebounds.
Just think about that. A bench player randomly starts a game and finishes one rebound off of a triple double. That would be like Juwan Howard coming off the bench for the Heat and, I don’t know, notching more than ten minutes in a single game (is he officially player-coach yet?)
Anyhow, a look into Yatta’s past is less surprising than it is oddly familiar. He still seems the same size, although he’s probably put on a little muscle since entering Harvard. There’s still no semblance of an outside game, which is completely unnecessary for the interior role he plays, and he still has that rebounding prowess that we saw all of last season. Plus, he still has that faint little mustache that he’s always sporting.
In his first highlight clip, he’s taller than everyone else on the court by a complete head. Consequently, Yatta pulls down multiple vicious rebounds like it’s a game of keepaway from little children. We can also see a somewhat awkward drive to the basket at 1:06 that was called a travel—probably the wrong call—the sort of game we don’t really see from Kenyatta anymore. It seems like most of his shots are back to the basket hook shots, which he makes with remarkable accuracy.
The funniest part of the video has to be at 2:14, where Yatta saves a weird shot by one of his guards by flipping the ball over his head. As he runs back, he has this disappointed, irritated look on his face as he throws his hands up in both disbelief and anger. I can’t tell if he’s pissed that his guard took a terrible off balance shot, or because he should’ve flipped the ball in a slightly more gracious manner.
The coolest part of the video is seeing Yatta operating from the high post, as he constantly floats around this area while his guards swing the ball around the three-point line. As mentioned, we see him mostly down low with his patented hook shot, but it would have been interesting to see some of his moves from up there and leads me to wonder if he has a jump shot that might be displayed this season.
In this second interview/highlight reel—the video has 10 views and I think I’ve accounted for more than 50 percent of them—we learn that Yatta was averaging 20 points and 15 rebounds a game in high school and that he started playing basketball in the seventh grade. Oh, and that he used to play soccer… oh, the money I’d pay to watch that. Finally, we get this quick scene at 1:05 where Yatta completely backs down a player on his team who’s a hell of a lot shorter than he is. Some things don’t change.

With its Saturday win over the Dartmouth Big Green, the Harvard men’s soccer team (5-7-2, 4-1-0 Ivy) is alone atop the Ivy League standings. After finishing winless in the league a year ago, the men’s soccer team has surpassed preseason expectations. The Back Page takes at a look at the numbers behind the team’s rise.
8 — Assists for senior midfielder Ross Friedman, which leads the Ivy League
2 — Number of freshmen—forwards Ashi Geberkidane and Daniel Smith—who have won Rookies of the Week
.848 — The save percentage of sophomore goal keeper Evan Mendez, who leads the Ivy League in that category. Mendez is second in the Ancient Eight with a 0.82 goals-against average
26 — Fouls in the Oct. 12 game between Harvard and Cornell. The Crimson won 2-1 over last year’s Ivy League championship by outshooting its opponent 6-0 across both overtimes
0 —Crimson players among the top 10 league scorers. Geberkidane is tied for 14th in the league with three goals
7 — Consecutive one-goal decisions for the Crimson. Harvard began the streak by losing two straight games, but has since won four of the five decisions
29.4 — Percent of the team’s 17 goals scored by freshmen

With the announcer counting down from 10, the Harvard women’s soccer team held its collective breath as a Dartmouth midfielder launched a desperation kick before the buzzer. But the ball deflected off a Harvard defender and the Crimson earned to right to raise Ivy League championship trophy for the fourth time in six years.
“Winning the Ivy League, it’s a day you remember forever,” co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “And it got to be at home, and because it was senior day all our parents were here. Just to share that with so many people is something we’re not going to forget.”
Predictably so, it was Johnson, who previously hoisted the Ivy hardware in her sophomore year, who put the Crimson (11-3-2, 6-0 Ivy) on top for good in the 2-1 victory. But the way the defender sparked her team was not so predictable.
As freshman forward Midge Purce dribbled up to just above the box with some space to work with, surveying her options, she could have chosen to take the shot herself. After all, she had blown by two Dartmouth (7-6-3, 3-3 Ivy) defenders and shook a third before scoring her Ivy League-leading 11th goal 15 minutes prior.
But this time, Purce decided to spread the wealth a bit and settle for the assist. Catching the Big Green defense out of position, she threaded a perfect pass to the sprinting Johnson, who chipped the ball over charging Dartmouth goaltender Tatiana Saunders for her first goal of the season to put Harvard up, 2-0.
“The ball had a lot of momentum going forward and didn’t want to stop—it just kept going,” Johnson said. “Midge led me a great ball and somehow I had the composure to finish it.”
“[The goal] gave me chills because it was her first goal of the season,” Purce said. “It was her senior night. She plays awesome every single game, so consistently, and I’m so glad she scored that goal.”
Though the Crimson was up, 2-0, at the half, Johnson’s goal gave Harvard some breathing room it ended up needing.
Out of the break, the Big Green offense came out firing, taking 11 shots and scoring off a corner kick in the 64th minute. The goal was the first given up by a Harvard goaltender in two games and the first in three games by freshman goaltender Lizzie Durack.
But the Crimson was able to hold onto the lead even as Dartmouth turned up the offensive pressure.
Big Green forward Jessica Lukas had just Durack standing between her and the goal with a few minutes left in the contest. But her left-footed hook shot didn’t quite curve enough, hitting the side of the goal, and Dartmouth would not get another chance to equalize.
“Talk about saving the game,” Purce said. “Our goalies were like Supermen back there—they saved the game. So many times they get their hands on balls that I can’t even imagine, and they keep us in [the game].”
Keying the Crimson offense the whole afternoon, Purce was all over the field from the start, beginning the game with a shot from the center of midfield that went wide of the goal. But a little bit later, her shooting did not fail her.
Advancing down the middle of the field in the 19th minute, Purce used her speed to leave two green shirts in the dust before encountering the Big Green’s Jill Dayneka. Seconds later, the 6’0” sophomore was lying on the turf, the victim of a Purce crossover. She could only watch as Purce blasted the ball to the top right of the net.
“[Junior forward] Meg [Casscells-Hamby] made a really good run, and she opened up a lot of space,” Purce said. “Our team moved really well off the ball…. It was an amazing team effort with the chemistry to know where we were going.”
Harvard dominated on offense the whole first half with 12 shots, while the Big Green only got off a single shot. The Crimson nearly scored twice in the first 15 minutes, with senior forward Elizabeth Weisman getting two opportunities and just missing each time. Her header in the box got past Saunders but a Dartmouth defender standing in the goal headed the shot out of harm’s way.
Just a minute later, a Harvard free kick from just outside the box bounced right to Weisman as she sprinted into the goalie box, but her shot soared high over the crossbar.
Along with clinching the Ivy League title with the win, the Crimson extended its unbeaten streak to 13 games, the longest since 1999.
“It’s exciting, and I wouldn’t want to share it with anyone else,” Purce said. “When you win [the championship] with people you’re close to it makes it that much better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this point last season, the Harvard (5-7-2, 4-1-0 Ivy) men’s soccer team was sitting dead last in the Ivy League without a single conference win.
This year, after its 2-1 victory Saturday against Dartmouth (5-6-4, 0-5-0 Ivy), the Crimson is in first place in the Ivy League with sole control of its championship destiny.
“[The players] continue to fight, they continue to prepare really well, they show up the same way they did in the early part of the season,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “They work, they work, they work.”
“What we’ve done is take everything one step of the time,” junior defender Philip Fleischman said. “Everyone has been really good about…working on a few things that make us better and [then moving] on to the next tasks and to focus on those. It’s really just reducing things to small steps.”
The team has been on a hot streak, winning four of its last six contests. The offense has scored two or more goals in each of its last five games, which is a marked improvement from the beginning of the season, when the team scored only three goals in its first five games.
“It’s all just a team effort,” Fleischman said. “We defend from the front and we attack from the back. It might be one person who’s scoring them, but it’s a team effort to get the ball up the field, and to defend to get the ball in the first place.”
For this match, however, skill, hard work ,and teamwork were not the only factors necessary to keep the streak alive. The Crimson also benefitted from a non-call, confusion, and a heads-up play by senior forward Pascal Mensah.
In the 41st minute, a non-call by the referee on a sliding tackle near midfielder allowed Big Green goalie James Hickock to gain control of the ball. Instead of kicking the ball out, Hickock instead let the ball sit as vehement arguing from the two sides essentially stopped play.
Mensah was the only player on the field who seemed to realize that the ball was still live, and he was able to maneuver the ball away from a diving Hickock and walk the ball into the net. This goal, which put Harvard up 2-0, proved to be the game-winner in the victory.
“It all comes from our mentality of fighting every single day and fighting every single play,” said Fleischman. “We all embody it, and Pascal embodied it in that play, and it’s something we pride ourselves on.”
Harvard’s first goal came in the 12th minute, as sophomore midfielder Andrew Chang was able to control a rebound at the top of the box and send a strike just over Hickock’s outstretched arm, narrowly missing the top of the goal post.
“We pride ourselves on taking advantage of every opportunity that we can”, Fleischman said. “It was a great strike by Chang, and it was great to get an early goal and set the tone for the rest of the game.”
Although the Big Green was unable to score in the first half, the team was able to generate numerous opportunities. In the 23rd minute, sophomore goalie Evan Mendez came out of the box to head an incoming ball to one of his defenders.
A Dartmouth player was able to intercept the ball and take a shot on goal that just missed high as Mendez scurried back to the goal.
Harvard continued weathering several Dartmouth attacks as it attempted to hold onto its lead in the second half. The Crimson’s defensive mindset reduced the number of attacking opportunities the Big Green had, which factored into its scoreless second half.
Dartmouth finally broke through in the 82nd minute, when junior midfielder Gabe Stauer was able to head in a goal off of a free kick.
Throughout its four-game Ivy League winning streak, the team has been led by seniors Kevin Harrington and Ross Friedman, according to Lehrer. Friedman, who leads the Ivy League with eight assists, added another on Saturday and had three shots on goal.
“Both of those guys have been unbelievable,” Lehrer said. “On the field, in the locker room, in meetings, those guys just lead from the first moment to the last moment. It sets a great standing for the rest of the group, and it pulls the group higher to a different level.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a season of many firsts, the Harvard women’s rugby team reached another milestone on Sunday, capturing its first ever Ivy League Championship title. It was a fitting conclusion to the Crimson’s inaugural varsity season, as Harvard (5-2, 5-1 Ivy) bested an undefeated Dartmouth squad, 29-0, for the victory.
“It was amazing when that final whistle went today,” co-captain Xanni Brown said. “To look back at where we were in August and where this Harvard Radcliffe team has gone to now is just amazing. It gives us so much hope for our spring season and for the future. Everyone is just so happy right now.”
Coming into the final weekend of its fall campaign, the Crimson had high hopes for its success on the field. A loss to the Big Green in September was the only blemish on an otherwise perfect Ivy League season, and second-seeded Harvard hoped for a chance to come out on top in a much-anticipated final rematch.
But first up for the Crimson was Brown, who Harvard had easily handled in a 57-7 win earlier this season. The Crimson came out strong in Saturday’s semifinal battle and never let up en route to a 31-5 victory over the Bears.
“It was our first taste of playoff rugby,” Brown said. “It was good and eye-opening for us, coming out here, playing a hard game, and running into a Brown team that was not going to give up. It showed us that we have the guts and confidence to stick with it in playoff rugby. It was a little bit of a wake-up call to how hard this whole tournament was going to be.”
Dartmouth edged Princeton, 12-10, in the other semifinal match to secure its berth in the championship game. With the short turn-around time, Harvard spent the rest of Saturday resting and preparing for its final game against its Ancient Eight opponent.
“We had a team meeting to talk about all the things we had to fix from the Brown game, and with the turnaround we could implement them the next day,” co-captain Ali Haber said.
With memories of a disappointing regular season contest against the Big Green still looming, the Crimson hoped to come out a stronger and more determined team than Dartmouth saw just a few weeks ago. Harvard did just that, bringing the intensity and jumping out to an early lead.
“We came out with a lot more heart,” Haber said. “We’ve been working on our technical skills since that first game [against Dartmouth]. It was part mental and part physical. We were up to our standards in both those departments, and it definitely showed. They didn’t seem to know what hit them.”
Brown ran in a try early in the half to get the Crimson on the board. Fellow senior Cayla Calderwood added another score later in the first, and Harvard took a 12-0 lead into the half. Even with the advantage, the Crimson still had to put the pressure on a formidable opponent in the final forty minutes of play.
“It was a really hard-fought, scrappy game today,” Brown said. “Even having a lead going into the second half, it was a huge battle the whole time.”
Harvard’s second game in as many days could have taken a toll on the weathered team, but strong performances off the bench kept the squad fresh and strong throughout the tournament and in Sunday’s championship game.
“We brought in a lot of subs yesterday, and we brought in a lot of subs today, and we didn’t see any sort of dip in intensity when that happened,” Brown said.
The Crimson continued its offensive charge in the second half of the title game, as Brown, junior Kaleigh Henry, senior Shelby Lin, and junior Lenica Morales-Valenzuela each added tries for Harvard in the final 40 minutes of play to seal the 29-0 victory.
Wrapping up the regular season with an Ivy championship proved to be a fitting end to the Crimson’s first season as a varsity team and bodes well for the future as the team looks towards its spring season and beyond.
“When I started freshman year, we didn’t even have an Ivy League,” Haber said. “We sort of struggled the first two years to make out our presence in the league. This year, we had so much more behind us, so many more resources and a lot more to work with, and we turned it around. We have so much talent and heart on the team, and it really showed in this tournament. It’s been incredible the progression of this season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team remained perfect at home this weekend, as it defeated both St. Francis and Iona on Saturday and Fordham on Sunday to stay undefeated at Blodgett Pool and claim the Northern Division Collegiate Water Polo Association regular season title.
Despite being down in the games against both the Terriers and the Gaels and facing a strong comeback effort from the resilient Rams, the No. 19 Crimson (16-11, 11-1 CWPA Northern) was able to pull out close victories in all three contests. Harvard beat St. Francis, 8-7, and Iona, 18-15, on Saturday, and Fordham, 9-5, on Sunday.
“The weekend went really well for us,” senior captain Jimmy Field said. “We were able to battle in some tough games and come out on top, and manage battling through the adversity of each game. It provided a lot of growing opportunities for us.”
HARVARD 9, FORDHAM 5
The Crimson came out strong against the Rams, as freshman Dan Stevens fired a shot into the back of the net just 25 seconds into the game. After Harvard dominated for much of the first half, Stevens struck again with just seconds to go before halftime, and the Crimson headed into the break with a 6-2 lead.
“I thought we came out hungry for the No. 1 seed in our division,” Stevens said. “In my opinion, our teamwork and communication have never been better.”
Fordham slowly came back in the second half, however, as it shut down Harvard’s offense for the entire third quarter and drew within one to make it 6-5 with just over five minutes to go. However, sophomore Ben Zepfel made a penalty shot to put some breathing room between the two teams. Just a minute later, the Crimson then scored two more quick goals to finish the game with a 9-5 win.
Field stood tall in goal throughout the game, making 11 saves in his last regular season home game to take the win over the Rams.
HARVARD 18, IONA 15
In an intense physical game with six ties and five lead changes, Harvard managed to come out on top to claim its second victory of the day over Iona.
The score went back and forth throughout the first half, as Iona took an early 2-0 lead only to watch the Crimson come back with three straight goals. It appeared as though Harvard would go into halftime with a 9-8 edge, but Iona junior Jake Lloyd managed to get the ball past sophomore goalkeeper Colin Woolway with only 14 seconds left in the half to tie it up.
“Iona was able to be a little more successful in their offense than we would have hoped, but I think overall we learned a lot of things and we did a lot of things well on the offensive and defensive ends,” Field said. “And when our defense wasn’t doing as well, our offense stepped up so we could pull it off.”
The Crimson came back with five straight goals in the third quarter to take a 14-11 lead and did not relinquish it for the rest of the match. The Gaels brought themselves within one with five minutes to go in regulation but could not muster any more offense, as Harvard scored the last two goals of the match to come out with the win.
Zepfel put on a show on offense, netting a career and season-high seven goals to lead Crimson scorers. Noah Harrison also had a strong offensive effort, finding the back of the net six times over the course of the match.
HARVARD 8, ST. FRANCIS 7
In the first match on Saturday, Harvard faced the 16th-ranked Terriers, with whom it had split its two previous games. It was a strong defensive effort for the Crimson, which limited St. Francis to only 3 goals in the final three quarters of the game.
After being outscored, 4-2, in the opening period, Harvard ramped up the intensity on both ends of the pool to come away with the 8-7 win. It was a group effort, with five players combining for eigh goals and eight registering at least one steal.
Harrison led the team both offensively and defensively, leading the team in both goals and steals. The sophomore posted his ninth hat trick of the season and made five steals in the victory.
Stevens also got familiar with the back of the net with two goals, while Zepfel, Joey Colton, and John Holland-McCowan added one apiece. Colin Woolway made 12 saves for Harvard in net to preserve the close win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard’s women’s ice hockey team (3-1-0, 1-0-0 Ivy) fell short against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2-5-1, 1-1-0 ECAC) in a 2-1 matchup on Friday night. The loss was the first of the season for the Crimson, who had outscored opponents 13-4 going into Friday’s affair.
“I think it’s safe to say the game didn’t go the way we wanted it to,” freshman defender Briana Mastel said. “It was our first loss of the season and we had the potential to win, but came up short.”
The deciding goal came with ten minutes left. RPI forward Katie Rooney fired a shot from the slot after the Crimson was unable to win the battle for a puck behind the net.
“It was a tough game,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said. “Giving up that goal in the last eight or nine minutes was unfortunate and was a pretty big defensive mistake that was costly for us.”
The Crimson allowed eight RPI attempts on goal in the first period. However, the rest of the game saw 24 attempts by Harvard and seven by the Engineers. The Crimson recorded a season-high of 30 shots to RPI’s 15.
“We didn’t start the game the way we would have liked to,” Crowell said. “We gave up a goal in the first period and it felt like we were trying to play catch-up from that point on.”
The Engineers managed to score after an RPI power play left forward Laura Horwood undefended in front of the net.
“We needed to start the game with a greater sense of urgency,” Mastel said. “We should be able to maintain that drive throughout the entire 60 minutes of play.”
Maschmeyer had 13 saves, while RPI goaltender Kelly O’Brien had 29 saves. Harvard also spent eight minutes in the penalty box on four infractions.
“[RPI] is not really a team that traditionally opens up and the score is usually pretty tight,” Crowell said.  “They’re physical and clog up the ice so it’s hard to use our speed, which is a key part of our game. They did a pretty good job of executing this game plan.”
The Crimson put itself on the scoreboard when sophomore forward Dylanne Crugnale slapped a shot into the back of the net four minutes into the second period.
“She had a pretty fantastic goal,” Crowell said. “Any time we score a goal that’s always a big momentum shift. From that point forward we had pretty good energy for the rest of the period.”
Crugnale’s goal is her third of this season. Junior forward Hillary Crowe found Crugnale for her third assist of the year.
The one-goal affair was Harvard’s first of the season.
“It’s a young group and we’re trying to work out the kinks and trust each other and put together a good 60 minutes of hockey,” Crowell said. “[The freshmen] didn’t have much time to adjust to college hockey. They were thrown into big situations and it should be great for us in the future.”
O’Brien staved off several desperate attempts by the Crimson offense in the last minute.
“We battled and we pulled the goalie and did everything we could all the way down to the last buzzer and just fell a little short,” Crowell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior captain Marissa Gedman needed less than three minutes to get the puck rolling for Harvard women’s hockey Saturday.
Two minutes and 45 seconds into the team’s game against Union, Gedman put Harvard up 1-0, taking control of an errant puck and sending it through the Union defense and into the goal.
The Crimson came out with intensity on both the offensive and defensive ends in the contest, and managed maintain that momentum throughout the entire match.
After dropping Friday night’s contest to Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute, Harvard hit the ice with intensity from the very beginning against the Dutchwomen.
“One of our goals was to come out a lot faster and with more jump than we did yesterday,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said. “It was good to see us playing with a sense of urgency right away.”
This sense of urgency was evident in Harvard’s dynamic offensive performance, which was present from the get go.
“I think the key coming into this game was starting faster,” sophomore forward Miye D’Oench said. “I think everyone was pretty fired up right from the start.”
This aggressiveness played a key role in getting the Crimson on the board early.
“Marissa Gedman's goal was a huge play,” Crowe said. “Scoring the first goal is always big, and I feel like that gave us good momentum that carried us throughout the game.”
Managing just 18 shots on goal, Union was unable to find the back of the net.  The main contributors to the Dutchwomen’s offensive efforts were sophomore forward Jessica Kaminsky, junior forward Christine Valenti, and senior forward Mac Purce, each of whom notched three attempted shots in the match.
“We have so much respect for Union,” Crowe said. “They are well coached, and never give up. I thought they moved the puck well up the ice, transitioning quickly and really testing our forecheck and backcheck. That being said, we had to make sure to stick to our game: fast and simple.”
The Dutchwomen squad’s efforts were not enough to break the stronghold of the Crimson’s defense.  Anchored by sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer, Harvard denied the Dutchwomen’s offensive efforts throughout the entire matchup.
With 18 saves in the contest, Maschmeyer managed to notch her second shutout of the season in just four games. These saves make for a total tally of 94 saves for the sophomore. Harvard’s solid defensive line, led by Marissa Gedmen, contributed to the shutout.
On the offensive end, D’Oench led the Crimson’s efforts.  The second-year player stepped onto the ice with an intensity that led to her first goal of the season. Minutes later, she added a second goal, notching her first multi-goal performance this year.
“She was on fire tonight,” Crowe said. “She is extremely skilled and was rewarded for all of her hard work all over the ice. Not only did she snipe, but she won key wall battles, backchecked hard, and was all over the defense on our forecheck.”
D’Oench’s first goal of the match was scored when the forward backhanded a strong pass from freshman defender Robyn White past the Union goalie.
“It was a really great look from Robyn,” D’Oench said. “It was the type of composure that you don't always see early in someone's freshman year.”
In D’Oench’s second successful shot of the period, junior forward Samantha Reber supplied the assist, giving D’Oench the opportunity to power a rebounded puck into the net.   This quick move rounded out the score for the Crimson at 3-0.
“We were really flying in the second, and that was reflected on the scoreboard,” D’Oench said.
This commanding performance on the ice came after Harvard’s loss to RPI Friday evening, the Crimson’s first loss of the season. It came in tough fashion, as Harvard fell to the Engineers, 2-1.
“We talked a lot about improving our starts,” Crowe said. “I think making that a priority and focus was key. Also setting the pace right away allowed us to maintain the game.”
These changes ultimately proved successful for Harvard squad, as it earned the win and boosted its season record to 3-1. The Crimson will look to build on its momentum in its next game, at St. Lawrence Nov. 8.

@cuteincurrier: Thinking about transferring to Lesley College. It’d be closer to my dorm. #Quadded
 
@55forever: Partying… in Lamont. Up all night doing… proofs. Chugging… crappy Lamont café coffee. #HarvardNightlife
 
 
@Harvardfroshguy: Spent a whole two minutes in The Owl! Got kicked out after bouncer realized that despite androgynous haircut, am not a girl. #HarvardNightlife
 
@pfangirl: I loved seeing “Pops Gets a Clue.” Almost as much as I loved reading your lovely e-mail, Donald. #PfansOfPfister
 @diggingthedean: Just reserved a spot on your tree tour! Botany has never been so attractive. #PfansofPfister

It appears that Stanford students are bad at kissing. At least bad at kissing without infecting the entire student body in the process. Yes, it seems that germs are running rampant over on the West Coast, where the Stanford tradition of "Full Moon on the Quad" (imagine Incest Fest for the whole school) has exposed undergraduates to the risk of campus-wide flu and mononucleosis epidemics. Smh, Stanford.
 
According to the New York Times, Stanford has tried to outlaw the annual mass kissing orgy, which traditionally takes place at the end of October, and has attempted, an administrator said, "to create an environment in which [the students] don't feel they must participate in the exchange of oral secretions." Mmm.
 
Clearly, Stanford students can't restrain themselves from swapping secretions, so, as the New York Times reports, university administrators have implemented a number of strategies to deal with the consequences of all that saliva, including the following three.
 
1. Stanford's student health center now offers shots to prevent kissing diseases, such as the flu and meningococcal meningitis.
 2. "Student sobriety monitors" attend the event, holding signs that say things like "Consent is Sexy."
 
3. Freshmen are taught safe kissing. Apparently, flossing before playing a round of tonsel hockey can create microabrasions in your gums that germs can settle in. 
Kirklanders, take note.
 
Last month, you may have seen several excited statuses over social media from your athlete high school friends celebrating their commitments to various colleges. Some of these statuses may have even included a picture of your friend signing a letter to formalize his or her commitment.
If your friend was signing a letter, he or she probably didn’t commit to an Ivy League school. Unlike other Division I NCAA schools, the eight institutions that comprise the Ivy League do not offer athletic scholarships and therefore cannot have committed recruits sign National Letters of Intent—agreements recruited athletes make with Division I and II universities to attend a full year of college in exchange for one year of athletics-based financial aid. As long as the recruit completes the school’s application process, an NLI essentially guarantees admission to a college.
So how was your Brown-bound or Crimson-committed friend so confident of his or her admission? Your friend probably received what is known as a likely letter.
 
Months before colleges mail the final, fat acceptance envelops, Ancient Eight coaches provide admissions officers lists of athletes, usually committed, for whom the coaches want extra consideration. If the admissions officer gives the thumbs-up to a recruit, the athlete receives a letter from the admissions department.
 
A likely letter is not an explicit guarantee of admission. Rather, it states that the school fully intends to admit the applicant as long as he or she continues to excel in the classroom. Recruits are not the only ones to get this prestigious postage; other exceptional applicants may also receive these letters, which are usually mailed around mid-October for the early application round.
 
Although Ivy League universities are not bound to admit recruits in the same way as universities who offer NLIs, the Likely Letter serves a similar function as its scholarship-promising counterpart: it dissuades them from pursuing other academic options and allows them to breathe a sigh of relief.
On-campus interviews are not required. In fact, there are a great deal of schools that do not offer them. Even those that do have on-campus interviews often do not have them year-round. In general, schools will contact you for alumni interviews in your area. Below is a list of some schools, broken down by whether or not they offer on-campus interviews:
YES: Harvard (offered from September to November), Yale (offered from mid-June to mid-August and mid-September to mid-November. Note: Yale cannot accommodate all requests for on-campus interviews)NO: Princeton, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, Brown, Dartmouth, Stanford
