After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In another impressive display of program dominance, the Harvard women’s squash team defeated 15th-ranked Williams for the 32nd-straight year. Strong performances across the board by the Crimson women led to the group’s fourth straight 9-0 shutout of the year.
“We went up to Williams [Tuesday] morning and took the match very seriously as sort of a practice for this weekend, [with] two of our biggest matches [against Princeton and Penn] coming up,” co-captain Haley Mendez said. “So everyone had their game plans and was focusing on what they needed to work on.”
With the non-conference triumph, top-ranked Harvard (4-0, 1-0 Ivy) has now won its first four matches of the season for each of the past ten years, while the Ephs (6-6) fell to seventh in its conference.
While Harvard has the No. 1-ranked collegiate squash player in the country in junior Amanda Sobhy, the rest of the team continued to demonstrate that the squad is far from a one-trick pony. As a whole, the Crimson came into the match having dropped only three sets the entire year.
With Sobhy sitting out of the contest against Williams, it was up to Mendez, who finished the previous season as the tenth-ranked individual player nationally, to take the lead in the No. 1 position. The Brooklyn, NY native got the Crimson off to a fast start, sweeping the Ephs’ Alyssa Northrop in straight sets.
“I had a good match, I was coming off a…tournament this past weekend in Philadelphia where I lost to Amanda in the final,” Mendez said. “But it was a good weekend for me, so I was feeling good about how I was playing. I wanted to continue that trend.”
Mendez’s victory was a sign of things to come, as Harvard didn’t yield a single set the rest of the evening.
Playing in the No. 2 position for the first time this season, Karki earned her third match win of the season, defeating sophomore Nicole Feshbach, 11-6, 11-2, 11-4.
Among the other winners was freshman Katie Tutrone who, after competing in the No. 4 position in her last appearance against Drexel, moved up to No. 3. Tutrone easily dismantled her opponent, winning in straight sets of 11-2, 11-2, and 11-1.
The freshmen front of Dileas MacGowan, Caroline Monrad, and Emily Jones followed with three-set wins of their own in the No. 5, No. 8, and No. 9 positions, respectively.
“[In] their first matches in the top nine, [Monrad and Jones] had 3-0 wins,” Mendez said. “That was exciting to see two freshmen, in their first varsity match, perform well.”
“The freshmen have really added another dimension to the team,” said sophomore Saumya Karki, who earned a win out of the No. 2 position. “They’re very confident when they go out…. I think [we’ll] really have to watch out for them this season.”
Continuing the strong play in the No. 6 and No. 7 positions were sophomore Isabella Dowling and junior Meghan Murray, who similarly handled their opponents in shutout fashion.
Though all Crimson women may have brought the brooms to Williamstown, Mass. on Tuesday, there were a few close calls on the day.
After winning her first two sets handily in the No. 4 match, Harvard junior Julianne Chu found herself deadlocked with junior Ellie O’Neill, with the score tied up at eight. Unfazed and unfaltering, Chu calmly rallied for the next three points to put the match away.
Monrad also gave up eight or nine points in each of her sets but eked out a win each time as well. But otherwise, the day was a one-sided affair in favor of the Crimson.
“I think today was a pretty decisive win,” Karki said. “Our [goal] going into today was to get a good warm-up, to get things going before our big matches against Princeton and Penn this weekend…. We did our best and won comfortably.”
Moving to conference play at the end of the week, Harvard looks to avenge last year’s loss at the hands of then No. 3-ranked Tigers, which prevented the Crimson from repeating as Ivy League champions. Now at No. 4 nationally, Princeton will travel to the Murr Center hoping to replicate its 5-4 victory in 2013 over Harvard in a math that came down to the final set.
Even after the loss to the Tigers, though, the Crimson bounced back to win the Howe Cup at the CSA National Championships for the 14th time and will be looking to make it 15 and four in five years in a little over a month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been exactly a month since the Harvard men’s squash team last saw play action, but the hiatus changed absolutely nothing. The No. 2 Crimson (5-0) returned from its winter vacation to down Williams (4-8) in dramatic fashion at Williams’ Simon Squash Center, keeping its pre-break winning streak alive.
“We were a lot stronger than them today,” sophomore Sam Goldberg said. “But it’s always a good experience to play them each year, and it’s always good to get that out of the way.”
Harvard easily kept its perfect record intact, claiming victories in all nine positions in the meeting. Having not dropped a match yet this season, the Crimson have now shut out their last five opponents, making this the longest sweeps streak for Harvard since 2006.
“I feel really comfortable with how we did,” senior Gary Power said. “Everyone played well today, everyone looked prepared, and I thought that was the most important thing. We just came back from a long break, so it was a good win overall.”
Senior Tom Mullaney, sophomore Matt Roberts, and Goldberg each managed to make strong returns from their vacations, recording wins for the Crimson at the eighth, ninth, and tenth positions, to maintain Harvard’s undefeated record at the end of the contest.
The only game won by Williams was garnered at the number four position by Williams’ Andrew Maruca. Maruca managed to rebound after two dropped games, 11-9 and 11-6,  to win the third set, 11-7, against Harvard’s Nigel Koh. Koh responded with a decisive 11-1 victory in the fourth game to claim the match for the Crimson.
Sophomore Nicholas Hopcroft and junior Tyler Olson also notched wins, in very similar fashion, for Harvard, overpowering their opponents with almost identical scores, 11-7, 11-4, 11-5 for Hopcroft and 11-7, 11-5, 11-8 on Olson’s end.
Six different players for the Crimson improved their personal records to 4-0 in the contest, while the remaining team members boosted their own records to 3-0 with the wins picked up against Williams.
“I think we’ve really been working hard lately, so we’re very physically prepared for these games,” Power said. “You can definitely see that there is a very strong desire to win on this team.”
Senior Brandon McLaughlin kicked off the fiery performance for Harvard with a win in straight sets at the number one seed.  McLaughlin managed to handily defeat Williams’ Christopher Wilkinson in consecutive games, 11-1, 11-1, 11-2, to give the Crimson a substantial advantage at the start of the competition.  With this win, McLaughlin brought his personal record to 3-0.
“Brandon really had a standout performance,” Power said. “He held his opponent to four points, which was the lowest allowed on the team.”
Following McLaughlin’s strong showing, Power also contributed a win at the second position, knocking out Williams’ Jamie Ruggiero in consecutive games 11-9, 11-6, 11-6, moving his season record to 3-0.
The Harvard squad kept this trend going, notching wins by substantial margins all competition long.  Eight of the nine matches were won in consecutive games as the Crimson continuously managed to outmaneuver Williams in straight sets.
“The highlights for me were getting all the cobwebs off from the short time we had off,” Goldberg said.  “It was really exciting to not lose a match. We went in there and did what we were supposed to do and came out on top, which is always good.”
The two freshman of the squad, Dylan Murray and Bryan Koh, also contributed big wins for the Crimson.  Murray shut out Williams’ Taylor Foehl 11-3, 11-6, 11-4, while Koh managed to outplay his opponent, Galen Squiers 11-9, 11-9, 11-7.  Both of the freshmen have seen their records improve to a 4-0 standing.
With this commanding win notched, Harvard is now looking to its next showing, as it takes on highly ranked teams in the upcoming weeks.
“So far things are going really well this year,” Goldberg said. “But we have a few hard matches which are coming up this coming weekend.  They should be really good matches in testing our ability.”
With formidable opponents in the very near future for the Crimson, the squad maintains a steady confidence going forward.
“We’ve yet to have our big matches of the season,” Power said. “But I absolutely think we are ready for them.  We are well prepared.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The game looked to be over. The Harvard men's hockey team, facing one of the top backlines in the nation in Quinnipiac, found itself down 2-1 with less than a minute left.
But the Crimson (5-7-3, 2-6-3 ECAC), with the extra attacker inserted in the game, was able to tie it up with just 49 seconds remaining in Tuesday night's ECAC contest at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Junior Patrick McNally passed the puck up to freshman Alexander Kerfoot who then threw it towards the net while streaking down the across blue line. Sophomore Kyle Criscuolo was able to win the battle down low and send the puck back across the baseline to the goal. Bobcat goalie Michael Garteig made the initial save, but Kerfoot was able to punch it back in to knot the score at two.
The score would remain tied the rest of the way despite an eventful overtime period, in which a hard shot by sophomore Brian Hart clanged off the crossbar and senior goalie Raphael Girard made three of his 29 saves as Harvard skated to a draw against No. 8 Quinnipiac (15-3-5, 6-2-3 ECAC).
“I don’t think it was a pretty game,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But I think from our stand point there is a lot to be gained out of scoring the late goal to get the tie and to have a few chances to walk away with the win.”
“It was a tough start for us but we battled back and we found away to squeak out a point there,” Kerfoot added.
Harvard enterred the contest off its highest scoring game this season with seven goals against BU and a nine-goal outburst in a exhibition match against the Russian Red Stars the game before. It would take the strong Bobcat defense – who entered the game allowing a nation-low 1.82 goals per game – to neutralize the Crimson's offense, holding the team to 22 shots for the game.
Quinnipiac's nation-leading penalty-kill also slowed down Harvard, with the Bobcats now improving to a 92.2% kill rate with an 0-4 shutout of the Crimson's power play. Harvard also shutout Quinnipiac on the power play, 0-4, improving to an 86.2% kill rate, good for eighth in the country.
The Bobcats struck first with a goal by senior forward Kellen Jones, as he netted a wrist shot from the right circle skating down the ice after a feed from freshman forward Sam Anas. Both Jones and Anas lead the team in points, now with 27 each on the season.
The Crimson knotted the score at one midway through the second period. After receiving a pass from Kerfoot, junior Max Everson deked a Quinnipiac defender with a toe drag before feeding it to Criscuolo, who was then able to fire a shot from the left circle past Garteig.
But the Bobcats were able to jump out to a lead quickly in the third period, as Matthew Peca beat Girard stick-side with a wrist shot from the left side as he skated down the left side after a pass from Connor Clifton.
The game would remain scoreless until the tying goal by Kerfoot, who picked up his eighth point in his last four games.
“Alexander is a tremendous player and he’s been a little bit snakebit in the sense that he’s made a lot of plays and they’ve haven’t always resulted in points,” Donato said. “But I think he’s really turned the corner and he looks very comfortable in college hockey. He’s been excellent as of late and that’s what we expect.”
Harvard was able to take some of this late game momentum into the extra period, but Quinnipiac had a few chances early on in overtime. Hart responded with his shot that was reviewed by the officials but eventually ruled no goal.
“We were pushing the pace,” Donato said. “I thought that certainly we had a little adrenaline going from scoring the tying goal late…We wanted to be aggressive and we have a lot of confidence in our ability to create chances. Overall there was a lot of good signs coming out of the game.”
The Crimson will look to keep these good signs going over the next month, with five straight games after Tuesday against ECAC rivals, starting on Saturday night against reigning NCAA champ Yale at Madison Square Garden.

A new year, a new batch of weekly college admissions news updates!  Here are some tasty morsels fresh out of the oven:
HOLISTIC ADMISSIONS HOOEY. Maybe college  rejections feel so personal because U.S. admissions offices say they evaluate you as a whole person.  But that claim is false,  writes Phoebe Maltz Bovy in The Atlantic.  Her article cogently argues  that the "holistic" college admissions process is just a nicer-sounding  name for the self-serving desires of universities and wealthy parents.  Ouch.
DIVERSITY DECEIT. When it comes to racial diversity, researchers discovered that campus brochures lie. A study found that "the whiter the school, the more diversity depicted in the brochures."
PRICE WARS. The Ivy League and other selective schools tend to treat tuition like Kohl's treats prices: high sticker prices, big discounts.  But now some schools with less brand-name appeal are moving to a another model: lowering tuition across the board.  Converse College, for instance, just slashed its rates by 43%!
TESTING TRANSITIONS. The SAT, ACT, and AP tests are all undergoing some big changes.   The ACT is going tech-savvy, AP Physics B and U.S. History are being revamped, and in 2015, the SAT will debut its latest attempt at being  relevant—more linear functions and fewer arcane  vocabulary questions (which means you probably won't have to memorize words  like "arcane"!). According to U.S. News & World  Report, the new SAT writing section promises to "discourag[e] students  from simply making up facts to argue their point."
QUEEN BEES OR WANNABES? You know that high school girl who thinks she's so cool and has a little posse of friends pumping up her ego all the time?  She's got a counterpart in the higher-ed scene, in the form of colleges ranked highly by high school counselors but ranked fair-to-middling by officials at peer academic institutions.  According to U.S. News & World Report, colleges who seem to have peaked among high school counselors include St. Mary's University of Minnesota, Biola University, Soka University of America, and Purchase College—SUNY.
THE BENEFITS OF STUDENT DEBT. A Tufts University senior makes the claim that low-income students should take on significant loans if it means being able to attend prestigious colleges.
WELL-ROUNDED VS. ANGULAR. Move over, high cheekbones: "angular"  has a new definition.  The director of college counseling at Phillips Academy in Andover claims that, in the  hypercompetitive college admissions world, well-rounded is out, angular is in.  Having a long list of extracurriculars won't work anymore. Kids have to be great at something and be able to explain why they love it.
BATMAN'S BACHELOR'S DEGREE. For those of you battling the blues over early admissions rejections, here's a funny take on superheroes' college years.
