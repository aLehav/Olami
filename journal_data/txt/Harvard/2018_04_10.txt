Ramen chefs, poised mere feet away from their customers, are generous stewards of a hallowed, religiously meditative experience—the proper way to eat ramen is to “slurp it up without a word.” The film’s director and narrator, Koki Shigeno, is as much a ramen head as Japan’s most acclaimed chefs and their loyalists. He provides breathy side commentary to orient the audience on its pilgrimage into the kitchen. The notion of simplicity, broached spontaneously by the chefs, serves as a signpost throughout the documentary that genuinely and consistently captures the essence of ramen. The perfect ramen “exists perfectly in the moment and then disappears,” and its impact is in its unceremonious deliciousness. The documentary’s structure is also thankfully contained and to the point: The famed Osamu Tomita and his overarching story allow for easy segues into a diverse pageant of other chef narratives, and a culminating anniversary bit beautifully ties up the film, leaving the audience with a keen nostalgic warmth characteristic of the best ramen. The film’s most obvious flaw is that it becomes aesthetically tiresome and almost indulgently tacky, with constant slow-motion shots of noodles slopping against porcelain bowls, and an especially unsavory history segment that would otherwise have been enlightening if not for visuals that seem inspired by Microsoft Clip Art.
The feat of the chatty Shigeno’s casual recounting is a tell-all spirit that somehow makes intimately familiar a sacrosanct art. All the chefs he features display a monastic devotion to ramen. Tomita’s hole-in-the-wall shop, in the unassuming Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture, is known for producing Japan’s best ramen, available for only eight dollars. Tomita’s ever-changing signature is a muddy, blended broth. Shigeno duly informs the audience of its privilege: Unlike more secretive top-chefs, Tomita shows the camera everything, proof of his self-assurance and his alignment with the democratic spirit of ramen, historically a workingman’s dish. His oil-stained notebook from his own apprentice days is replete with cartoonish diagrams that resemble the machinations of a mad scientist. The ramen bowl derives its perfection from robust fundamentals: It’s not the ingredients that matter, but how the chef uses them. Tomita’s handmade noodles are the result of a painstaking selection process out of hundreds of Japanese flours. He aims for a quality he calls “slurpability,” ensuring that his noodles are longer than most so that his customers can savor their flavor for just the right amount of time. His apprentices, cultish with their toweled heads and matching robes, partake in a shared ritual, tasting from the same bowl at the end of each working day—an ongoing initiation in a deeply traditional yet ceaselessly inventive craft. By the end of the work day, Tomita hasn’t gone to the bathroom even once, soldered in place above his cauldron of boiling broth, entranced.
Shigeno himself heightens the mysticism of ramen devotion, likening one broth to “a witch’s brew from children’s books.” Though Shigeno’s whispered awe provides welcome companionship for the audience, the true essence of the lifetime ramen devotee can be observed in silence, as the camera picks up on the smallest moments in which a normally strict, buttoned-up maestro unwinds. Shigeno allows Tomita such freedom that he’s unguarded before the audience, unabashedly grabbing a stranger’s leftover bowl and draining it on one of his personal field trips to competitor ramen shops. When Shigeno embarks on a brief history segment on the origins of ramen that is visually distracting and bewilderingly ugly, it momentarily cheapens the ramen mystique that he spends the entire film dutifully peddling. Patchy and mismatched visuals aside, he recounts fun ramen lore: In 1947, a cook overslept while preparing broth, resulting in a white cloudy soup that today is known as tonkatsu broth and the basis of Tomita’s famous ramen.
The documentary aptly concludes with the passing of the mantle: Tomita’s young son already evinces the self-flagellating disciplinarian tendencies of his father, grumbling, “I’ll have to get this stupid tongue of mine into shape.” Shigeno successfully imparts his own deep reverence for Tomita’s gift of culinary sensibility, and the artistry behind an unassuming, everyday dish that is not prim and fancy like sushi, but that is a lifelong and messy project as cloudily complex as its broth mixtures. Though it can become tiresome without an avid culinary curiosity, as glamorous cinematic thrills are not the film’s strength, the documentary can be riveting to someone who has even a passing interest in ramen.

Madeline Miller knows how to weave a story. More precisely, she knows how to pick well-worn strands from separate ancient Greek myths and twist them together into novels that feel simultaneously fresh and timeless. The pitted olives and the ship-battered wood that Miller conjures stimulate the senses, and her treatment of the interplay of gods and men resounds in wizened phrasing. In short, “Circe,” Miller’s second novel, published six years after her 2012 prize-winning debut, “The Song of Achilles,” does not disappoint.
Circe, the eponymous Titan divinity and the daughter of the son god Helios and of the Oceanid nymph Perse, is the protagonist of this intricate novel. Though divinities like Circe do not age like mortals, the novel traces Circe’s development from a misunderstood and outcast daughter to her solitary mastery of witchcraft on the island Aiaia, to her various brushes with love and loss, motherhood and friendship. Circe’s immortality enables her to encounter heroes whose stories are separated by thousands of years. Miller judiciously incorporates into Circe’s narrative the well-known myths of Prometheus, the Minotaur, Icarus and Daedalus, Medea, and Odysseus, which are typically depicted as discrete stories in seminal collections of Greek mythology like Edith Hamilton’s 1942 “Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes” and 1962 “D’Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths.” Circe’s story unfolds at a slower pace than Miller’s nail-biting ‘The Song of Achilles,” in part because Miller now has centuries of material to cover rather than the decades-long Trojan War. But it is Miller’s strong crafting of Circe herself that stitches these threads into a new epic, further revitalized with a feminine perspective.
Perhaps best known for her turning-men-into-pigs cameo in Homer’s “Odyssey,” Circe in Miller’s hands becomes less divine and more human, an evolution that is central to the novel. Exiled on Aiaia by Helios, Miller’s Circe still transforms the brutish men who stumble across her island into swine. But Miller offers Circe’s refreshing perspective, contemporizing the stakes of the encounter and imbuing Circe’s side of the equation with more gravitas and power. Even after Circe’s hearty welcome, the men who ostensibly seek shelter attempt to assault her when they realize she has no relatives, friends, or guards to protect her. Circe, though, is no doormat, and Miller’s writing crackles with her power. “It was my favorite moment, seeing them frown and try to understand why I wasn’t afraid,” Circe’s narrative voice explains, “In their bodies I could feel my herbs like strings waiting to be plucked. I savored their confusion, their dawning fear. Then I plucked them.” In an early stage of her exile, Circe experiments with her sorcery and is quite vicious and vindictive toward the men who assume she is powerless. “Circe” transfigures the canonized tale from one about men—and later about the wily Odysseus and his comrades—into one well-rounded episode in Circe’s bildungsroman-of-sorts.
At its core, “Circe” is a case study in how to storytell for modern-day readers, and not for ancient Greek listeners. The novel’s page-bound format, however, does not thwart its capacity to preserve and play into the performative, community-building aspects of oral tradition that carried its source material across thousands of miles over thousands of years. Rather, Miller’s magically exacting language—somehow both economical and luxurious in its use of verbs, nouns, and especially the hyphenated adjectives that Miller sprinkles with care—simulates the best of ancient prose and poetry. In particular, the novel’s frequent musings on the gods and mortals, and their mishaps and morals, model the effortlessness of Miller’s storytelling. “[G]ods are born of ichor and nectar, their excellences already bursting from their fingertips,” Miller writes. “So they find their fame by proving what they can mar: destroying cities, starting wars, breeding plagues and monsters. All that smoke and savor rising so delicately from our alters. It leaves only ash behind.” Ichor, nectar, and ash; each noun evokes a vivid material world that seems light years away from the 21st Century. Yet Miller makes each word drip with honeyed brightness or looming destruction, a balance of beauty and danger that transcends time and place.
It is that very tension between divinity and mortality that grounds Circe’s endless and sometimes repetitive lifetimes. The pattern of her life on Aiaia, tending her herbs and waiting for something more, does make the novel drag a bit, its plot twists notwithstanding. This pacing makes sense, though, in contrast with the ticking clock that governs the lifeblood of several choice humans and demigods whom Circe grows to care for and ultimately watches wither and die. Unlike the Titan and Olympian gods and goddesses who occupy their eternities by staging petty quarrels among mortals, Circe feels the real pain that accompanies the loss of a human life. “[I]n a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth,” she thinks, grappling with the words to describe what one mortal means to her. In “Circe,” Miller links together these “rare moments” to illuminate how Greek mythology can continue to provide mortals (and perhaps even goddesses) with the space to reflect on the wonders of being alive.

Conductorless groups have the unique opportunity to engage in musical democracy. As a result, it’s both charming and humbling when a group of 16 members weave their individual talents together without a conductor, as The Brattle Street Chamber Players do. On Thursday, April 5, the ensemble performed a relatively brief but impressive program featuring the works of Mozart and Richard Strauss. The ensemble held its spring concert, “Contrasts,” in the University’s Paine Hall, including guests from the Grammy-winning Parker Quartet, the current Blodgett Artist-in-Residence at Harvard.
The Brattle Players opened with Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola Kv. 364, featuring the technically pristine violinist Daniel Chong and musically striking violist Jessica Bodner. Bodner, wearing a black dress with a pattern of sparkling gold shells, plays impressively. Chung’s solo in the second movement chilled the audience with soulful richness, accompanied by The Brattle Players’ steady rhythm, which remained attentive to the melody. Joined by Bodner, the two string artists built of each other with lovely coordination. The graceful dipping and swaying of the guest performers’ bodies matched the sounds that streamed out of their instruments, a treat to both the eyes and ears. Bodner and Chong’s synchronization and chemistry carries off the stage too—it’s unsurprising that the couple is married, given their perfect harmony.
Perhaps the most gripping moments of the Sinfonia Concertante were those filled not with sound, but rather with silence. During measures of rest, Bodner stood with her eyes closed, creating an aura of tranquility that elevated the musical experience to a spiritual level. Similarly, Mozart’s composition leaves many of the violin solo parts with a suspension after an arpeggio climb to higher octaves, which Chong handled powerfully. The last movement bursted with bright colorful sounds and dazzling speeds, showcasing the ensembles’ technical adeptness. Though normally a string-only ensemble, The Brattle Players also successfully incorporated two guest French horn players and two guest oboists for the Sinfonia Concertante, maintaining a singular connected body.
Strauss’s “Metamorphosen” served as the score that highlighted the title of the program, providing irregular tones and a sharp contrast to Mozart’s more rigid structure. Though Strauss wrote the piece for 23 solo strings (10 violins, five violas, five cellos, and three double basses), one would have hardly noticed anything missing in the wealth of emotional and dynamic sound of The Brattle Players’ Thursday performance.
The cellos opened with a deep, rich sound that blended to a murmur as the viola developed into a melancholy melody. A smooth silkiness connected the different tones of the piece, from tender plucks and trembles to sections of swelling intensity. Whereas The Brattle Players’ stood in the back of the Mozart selection to allow Chong to stand in the forefront, each instrument and member subsequently plunged into expressiveness. An exciting charge overtook the bodies of the 11 members of the ensemble, that stood with their instruments as they danced to Strauss’ alluring waves. The three notes in the diminuendo tremored into the rumination of the composition, extraordinary in the depth of concentration and feeding into the allure of the Brattle Players’ “Contrasts.”

It might be easy to slot her into this trope, especially given her Boston show’s ethereality—a video of a children’s choir, a floating cage, the bizarre onset costume change—but Lorde is not lost in her own world. If anything, she’s keenly connected to ours. “This one is for the kids who grew up in the suburbs,” she said at TD Garden on April 3, before launching into “400 Lux,” a song from her debut album “Pure Heroine.” The crowd cheered, and my own hand flew into the air in an act of involuntary self-recognition. “We're never done with killing time,” she crooned. “Can I kill it with you? / 'Til the veins run red and blue.”
Lorde is firmly planted on the ground with us, and that’s exactly where she finds her magic as both a musician and a performer. Lorde’s art derives from the banal and average—songs about high school politics, long drives with close companions—and her shows rely on the fact that she talks to her audience like she talks to an old friend, with a loving honesty that mirrors our own common insecurities, our own common need for expression. “Sometimes I see myself as a mess, kind of cluttered, a lot of emotions—and dreams,” she confessed, while the crowd stayed as silent as it could. “You just have to take me for exactly for who I am,” Lorde added. “Because when I’m great, I’m fucking great. And I want you to know that you can be vivid. You can be wild.”
“I bet she says that to all her venues,” I joke-yelled to my friend, but no amount of half-hearted cynicism could draw away from the feeling that Lorde just understood. Understood what exactly, I’m not sure, but almost every interlude between songs was about validation. “Boston, Boston, Boston,” she repeated at one point in the night. “For the most part, I write my records very quietly, very privately...You emerge from the cave and wonder are people going to get it?” People got it. As she sung “Writer in the Dark,” hundreds of cell phones lit up on cue, illuminating the arena with a hazy gray fog. Before singing “Royals,” the trademark single that elevated her to fame, Lorde said “Bring the lights up! I want to see,” and the arena lit up once again, revealing thousands of fans swaying to the music with her. We were yards away from both Lorde and the lights, but we couldn’t shake the feeling that she wanted to see us too.
Lorde cares. She cares about the experience, and she cares about her sound. This was evident in the way she sang “Tennis Court,” one hand cupping the air around her microphone like she was holding onto something precious. In “Homemade Dynamite,” Lorde knelt, touching the ground. “But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries / How you'd dance for me,” she sang, eyes pressed intently shut. Lorde moved with a fervent sort of energy during “Supercut,” jumping up and down as her voice punched through the air, pausing for breath in every line: “I'llbeyourquiet — afternoon — crush / Beyourviolent — overnight — rush / Makeyoucrazyover — my — touch.” At the concert, Lorde experimented with pitch, and an electric guitar played in reverse. But she was always careful to keep her voice steady, flawless.
Lorde cares about her art, but she doesn’t care about snide comments deriding her eccentricity. A few songs into the setlist, my friend whisper-yelled to me, concerned: “When is Lorde going to start dancing like Lorde?” But when “Buzzcut Season” came on, Lorde flew into action, arms punching the air, legs kicking wildly. We breathed a sigh of relief. If Lorde doesn’t care what she looks like when dancing, then why should we?
That’s part of the reason why it felt like Lorde was our friend during her own concert. It’s not just because she changed costumes on set like she was changing clothes in her best friend’s bedroom. It’s not just because Lorde continuously addressed Boston the city, continuously invited Boston to join in on the experience with her (“Hey Boston. You wanna go somewhere with me?” she asked slyly before launching into “Perfect Places”). It’s because Lorde is unabashedly herself, in the way self-assured people are, but with a sort of genuinity that breaches the line between performer and confidant, the go-to-person to text after a bad day. She has learned—or is learning—self-love, spreading this generation’s newly-coined term’s message across all her audiences.
The next day, someone showed me the Instagram account @overheardcambridge’s post: “I hit up, like, five of my usual booty calls last night, but literally all of them were too busy at the Lorde concert and feeling too empowered to come over after.” It’s funny, but it also accurately captures the message of “Melodrama,” and the tour that takes her sophomoric album’s name. “Melodrama” is a whirlwind of the kind of pain that comes with broken hearts, lost nights, and a sense of hopeless confusion about our place in this world. It’s something that so profusely embraces the anguish of young adulthood, that validates those feelings. “This song is about being alone,” Lorde said during her concert before singing “Liability.” “I understand, I'm a liability / Get you wild, make you leave / I'm a little much for / everyone.”
But Lorde wasn’t alone in that moment, and she knew that. Before launching into the first piece she released from “Melodrama,” “Green Light,” she turned to the thousands and thousands of audience members once more. “All those emotions we talked about—the joy, the pain,” she said. “I need you to feel it in your fingertips and in your feet. We’re going to let it all go.”

Candice Breitz’s “Love Story,” an exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts that opened March 31, is housed inside a dark room with an emerald green glow. There’s a long carpet, perfectly mirroring back a shamrock movie screen. On the screen, a man and a woman tell stories about refuge and asylum.
“I know that when [Breitz] will share [this story] with the world, it won’t be the same as if it were just me,” the woman says. “I don’t think all those nice people would come just to listen to my story.”
The woman is Julianne Moore. She is reading the words of a refugee, exactly as they were told to Breitz in a series of interviews. The man, doing the same, is Alec Baldwin.
According to the artist’s website, “‘Love Story’ raises questions around how and where our attention is focused.” The exhibit follows the stories of six refugees, first as they are portrayed by Moore and Baldwin and then through their own voices. “What kind of stories are we willing to hear? What kind of stories move us?” Breitz’s website demands. “Why is it that the same audiences that are driven to tears by fictional blockbusters remain affectless in the face of actual human suffering?”
Over the course of the 73-minute series of videos, Moore and Baldwin read the refugees’ stories without embellishment or glitz. Recording equipment is in the background. Sometimes, a phone will go off or an actor will stop to get water. “Love Story” does not show actors acting—instead, it shows them talking, just as the refugees themselves do later in the movie. Breitz allows Moore and Baldwin’s fame to stand alone, completely unadorned and unexplained.
“I didn’t get what was going on initially,” said exhibit visitor India M. Rawnsley. “I think that’s kind of the point—that you don’t understand. It was eye-opening when I figured it out.”
The exhibit at the MFA is the US debut of German-born “Love Story,” giving it added significance in the eyes of MFA curator Liz Munsell. “While immigration and the refugee crisis are global issues, we knew that this work would have particular resonance in the US, which is viewed as the epicenter of celebrity culture,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
Of the six refugees, two sought asylum in the United States directly. But all six of them brought vastly different perspectives on the global refugee experience. Alec Baldwin reads the words of a Venezuelan political dissident, for example, and an ex-child soldier from Angola. Julianne Moore reads the stories of a war refugee from Syria and an Indian transgender academic.
Breitz’s exhibit juxtaposes fame with misfortune, and power with helplessness. Exhibit viewer Serena K. Borch, however, said she believed that the refugees’ narratives could stand alone.
“These are white people who are very famous and rich, and I’m like, why are these white people talking about this?” she said. “Why are they the ones telling the story?”
Breitz might agree that in an ideal world, refugees would always be listened to. But for now—as long as refugees’ stories remain unheard—“Love Story” will be at the MFA’s Gallery 259 for the rest of this year.

Hundreds of the drowning and drowned dot the rich blue waters of the ocean depths. A woman swims toward her child. Breathing oxygen into her daughter’s lungs, the mother pulls them both into the world above in an act of pure desperation. It is the scenes like this opening one—dramatic images that beget more questions than answer them—that drives the pilot of new ABC show “The Crossing” forward. This episode follows the sudden appearance of 500 people, only 47 of them alive, just off the coast of a small American town. They claim they are refugees—from the United States 180 years in the future.
While the new arrivals adapt to life in the present day, local and federal security forces, like local Sheriff Jude Ellis (Steve Zahn) and Department of Homeland Security Agent Emma Ren (Sandrine Holt), rush to protect the town and find answers in a situation that only becomes more complex as it unravels. With all its questions, alliances, betrayals, and subplots, “The Crossing” should be a fast-paced mystery drama, but the pilot is generally boring and passable at best. The episode never provides basic answers to questions about its world, and having such an ill-defined world—not understanding why, how, or what is at stake—disengages the audience instead of keeping them hooked. The success of the series will depend on when and how ABC plans on fulfilling its promise for answers.
“The Crossing” starts with a complex premise: Refugees have time traveled from the future in order to escape a genetically-engineered superhuman race, Apex, bent on their destruction. Time-travel and Apex are crucial parts of the overall story, but the pilot lacks sufficient explanations of what their implications are. When Sheriff Ellis questions the refugees on how time-travel developed, they simply say that the method they used was experimental.
Yet the series expects its audience to be surprised when it is revealed that the current refugee group wasn’t the first one to travel in time. It’s framed as a major plot point in the pilot, but there isn’t enough information in the first place to be certain that the specifications of experimental time travel only allowed for one group. Instead of getting new answers, there are just more questions (“What are the goals of the new group?” “Where are they now?”), adding uncertainty to an already very uncertain world.
Constant questioning and faux revelations distract from developing the context. Characters and world-building—important parts of any plot—remain undefined. The background on Agent Ren is sparse and inconsistent, and her details only emerge when a specific part of the plot requires it. For example, Ren reveals that she was a refugee at age six only when trying to pressure a refugee into revealing any of the group’s security risks. This is never discussed again with anyone, and her background as a refugee doesn’t differentiate her opinion and treatment of the arrival group from any other regular DHS agent. It is superfluous. The throwaway nature of Ren’s background is unfortunate because it could have given her a stake in fixing the refugee problem. The pilot never clarifies the stakes that the characters have in the central conflict.
The pilot of “The Crossing” provides a lot of questions, but it fails to define the context in which these questions exist. Moving forward, the series will need to do a lot of world-building and character development for any of its revelations to have some weight. Hopefully, this will come naturally as more mysteries are revealed because without an established context, the things that make mysteries engrossing—plot twists, false leads, and betrayals—don’t matter.

21 Colorful Crimson is a music collective composed of 21 Harvard freshmen who  will open for Lil Yachty and Wale at Yardfest. The Crimson sat down with their president, James A. Mathew ’21, and a member of their business team, Jasmine Hyppolite ’21, to discuss their upcoming performance, the challenges of navigating an artistic group dynamic, and the role of diversity in their art.
The Harvard Crimson: Tell us a bit about the principles of your music.
James A. Mathew ’21: The central piece [in our name] is “colorful,” which speaks to diversity, which speaks to the fact that the class of 2021 is the first year at Harvard to be majority-minority. We have lots of different racial backgrounds, lots of different socioeconomic backgrounds. We count our three pillars as creativity, inclusion, and love, which is what we’re really trying to communicate here. If someone hears our music, we hope that they—when they get to know a little about our group—not only enjoy the music for the musicality, but also for those pillars, what we’re standing for.
THC: One of the admirable things about your music is that it sounds eclectic while simultaneously managing to coherently meld diverse genres—what is the specific artistic process of crafting this sound?
JAM: One thing we do, speaking to diversity, is obviously have visible diversity in our members but also reflect diversity in our music. In the art we’re creating, we do very diverse things in terms of our stylistic endeavors in music. We have an opera singer and we have a rapper. Fusing the two and combining elements of rock and jazz gets people's minds going in terms of this creativity and this diversity and we are still establishing our craft. Talking about that process is difficult, and we’ve had many meetings where we’ve been quite argumentative because 21 minds are never going to agree perfectly.
THC: What are some of the arguments you’ve been dealing with concerning your Yardfest set?
JAM: We’ve fallen into two camps when it comes to designing our set. Some people were calling for a more equal representation in terms of the style of music and the other people wanted more hip hop because of the what the Yardfest show is going to be. Some people said, “I hate that idea. That’s too slow. People are going to think that that’s boring.” Other people said, “We need that otherwise we’re just a rap group. We’re no different.” We ended up striking a balance. We found a good compromise of how to show that we are more than just hip hop. We are all these genres that our great artists bring to the table.
Jasmine Hyppolite ‘21:  Something that I loved [about formulating our Yardfest set] was that every single person sitting in that room had a marker on the drawing board, and every single person was able to say, “I think this is right, I think this is not.” It’s: this is all our art, I can’t tell you how to do your art, you can’t tell me how to do my art, but this is our product at the end of the day.
THC: Your group is navigating a lot of concerns dealing with how to balance these individual interests. Are you are producing the best art that you can while keeping everyone happy?
JAM: I think one thing that I find so beautiful about art is the subjectivity of it. What I’d say is that so far we’ve managed to produce some great work because we don’t just do something to do it. You know if our jazz singer says, “I think I don’t have a good enough of a role right now,” we don’t just put her on the track to kind of appease her. If we’re going to do something, we try and put a lot of work into it and do it right, and I think that that commitment to quality work does make for a good product at the end. But I think that initially we did have that struggle. Some of our hip hop artists thought that the inclusion of the other genres on the hip hop track kind of devalued that product.
THC: In this process of integration of styles, in this almost inherent intersectionality in your art, do you ever feel as if you’re almost diluting hip hop as a specific genre? Do you feel like you have any responsibility for upholding musical categories that were born from a specific history?
JH: I would say no. Our team is a melting pot. Our music is a melting pot. It’s just going to happen, and I don’t really think that we’re super focused on having one song for each genre, or upholding a genre, because we’re not looking to assimilate or affirm something that already exists. We’re trying to break a new norm. We do that through who we are as well as what we make, so I think that we have a very little amount of focus on working on the preexisting structures.
THC: We’ve talked a little bit about the melding of styles that you guys have, but could you speak a little to if and how personal diversity has influenced your music?
JAM: Our group [gives] a platform for friendships to form that very likely wouldn’t have occurred otherwise. I think that personal diversity, how different people are, just makes their friendship and their coming together all the more beautiful. It’s really a family already.
THC: In what ways do you see these relationships manifesting in and impacting your music?
JAM: I think that those friendships allow some more spontaneous collaboration. If you’re not too friendly with someone, you’re not comfortable with that person, [and] your collaboration will be very formal. That formality can be kind of restricting, if you’re more comfortable, you might critique the other person more honestly, you might let them know that that note was a little off, we should do another take. That comfort leads to better art, better creation, because again, it's authentic. It’s real.
THC: It seems like your groups see your music—correct me if I’m wrong—as having some sort of political or social message. I’m curious, in a group as diverse as yours, how do you deal with differences in political and social values in the messaging of your music?
JAM: I think that when it comes to what we want people to take away from our art socially and politically, I think that one—there are two sides to it—there is one that is implicit and one that is more explicit. The one that is more implicit: When you take a look at a picture of us, there is kind of a statement in that professional collaboration that does not restrict itself to any lines that we think about—racial, socioeconomic, any of those things. More explicitly, what we’re trying to say in our music, we’re trying to make statements. We’re making a track right now that deals with some social issues, that touches on things like police brutality, issues such as that. You do bring up a good point, in that everyone is coming from different backgrounds, people are not all going to have the same political beliefs. How we navigate that is over a space where there is a forum for people to chime in that is very respectful. We get to hear all of the views of our members. If someone is concerned with something, they voice that concern.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Creator and writer of “The Last O.G.” Jordan Peele, after the success of his critically-acclaimed and Oscar-winning movie “Get Out”, has taken on another project with the intent of tackling social issues within a digestible premise. Whereas “Get Out” is as much a thriller/horror film as a comedy, “The Last O.G.” is purely funny. While it is still unclear whether or not “The Last O.G.” can execute compelling character development, the pilot episode addresses relevant issues with humor.
Protagonist Tray Barker (Tracy Morgan) is an ex-con who has just finished serving a 15 year sentence in prison and is planning to jump right back into his old life in Brooklyn with his girlfriend Shay (Tiffany Haddish). However, he returns to a gentrified neighborhood completely different from the one he grew up in. Much to Tray’s dismay, Shay is now married to a white man named Josh (Ryan Gaul), prompting Tray to attempt to win her back. While Tray’s central motivation is not particularly original, the show’s focus on the effects of gentrification provides an interesting critique and angle.
One effect of gentrification manifests in the way Shay’s character develops in the time between Tray’s arrest and release. As Tray discovers, Shay has become the leader of an organization seeking to end homelessness, and in order to get donations she must present to a room full of rich, white people. Tiffany Haddish does a fantastic job altering her body language, tone, and vernacular between when she is speaking to an old white couple and when she is speaking to Tray one-on-one. Tray views this as an abandonment of her true self, while Shay, who goes by Shannon now, sees it as a necessary part of her success. Both seem to have a point.
Along with Morgan and Haddish, the show features other great comedians in the characters of Gaul and Cedric the Entertainer. While Gaul only has a cameo in the pilot, Morgan and Gaul show hints of comedic chemistry in a brief on-screen interaction. One of the funniest scenes of the episode is a conversation between Mullins, the halfway house owner played by Cedric the Entertainer, and Tray, as Mullins defends his right to make sex-related jokes. Even in scenes where Tray is not meant to be the main source of humor, Morgan’s delivery and demeanor are enough to maintain the energy of the show.
The show’s main weakness is its plot, a fault of its all too familiar central trope. While the pilot just provides a taste, it is still not evident that the characters will become sufficiently compelling to make up for this mundane objective. However, in the meantime, the social commentary and humor of the pilot are interesting enough to generate hope for the rest of the series. As a whole, “The Last O.G.” promises to be at the very least a watchable show, but without compelling characters, it won’t break through to greatness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At its best, “The Americans” manages to interrogate issues of childhood, citizenship, assimilation, marriage, and the parents’ responsibilities to their children. However, even a quick thematic scan of “The Americans” would be a reductive exercise. Throughout its first five seasons, what made the FX product richly compelling was the ease with which it was able to deal with a plurality of thematic problems—problems that inherently resist neat categorization—through the marriage of two Russian spies posted in America.
The premiere of Season Six displays a similar intellectual nuance. However, here our married Russian spies are placed in opposition to each other—with Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) aligned with the pro-Gorbachev liberals and Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) allied with the KGB hawks—placing into sharp focus alternative visions of the responsibilities of the self to state. The stakes of the action are raised dramatically; the specter of mariticide—in the backdrop of mutually assured destruction—looms over the narrative.
I would be remiss not to note that “The Americans” remains one of the best shows on television. Its thematic complexity renders more intelligent thought per episode than many shows can convey in a season. Despite aspects of its unmitigated success, some of the premiere’s smaller moments lack the nuanced craft that previous seasons consistently maintained. “The Americans” is on the cusp of getting stale.
Russell is stellar; Rhys is not as sharp. Perhaps it is a product of his more narratively limited role in the premiere—a retired spy, Philip is contently confined to a typical bourgeoise American life (complete with a crumbling marriage). However, Rhys doesn’t fully convey the internal complexity that must be wrought from shifting careers from assassin to full time travel agent. He is at his best while playing off Russell’s Elizabeth and Costa Ronin’s Oleg Igorevich Burov. The understated aspects of his performance are rendered in sharper focus through an oppositional character. When dancing alone or giving pep talks to his travel office drones, Rhys lacks a refractory lens to illuminate his interiority.
That is not simply to place the blame for the premiere’s smaller problems on Rhys. Holly Taylor has lost some of the youthful curiosity that made her earlier representation of Paige Jennings, Elizabeth and Philip’s daughter, deeply compelling. She seems less comfortable, awkward even, as a college student. Ronin seems a bit complacent in his depiction of the complexly patriotic Burov. Intriguingly, it’s the episodes smallest characters—including a stunningly excellent Lyanka Gryu as Burov’s wife—that seem to be navigating the most interesting and novel artistic terrain.
Some of these problems may simply be a product of a show running for as long as “The Americans” has. After six seasons, it is understandable that various actors seem overly comfortable in their characters. Nevertheless, embedded in that comfort is an inherent complacency and lack of artistic innovation. Ronin’s acting, for example, isn’t terrible, but his performance is monotonous and stagnant. It lacks the intellectual artistry of the formulation and reformulation of a character that Gryu’s representation embodies.
Other than the actors’ often underwhelming representation of their respective characters, some aspects of the show’s depiction of certain scenes and general stylistic valence feel well worn. The show knows its narrative voice—which can be both a blessing and a curse. Its representation of spying feels so much like second nature that it often fails to add anything new to the cannon. Even the camera’s framing of scenes feels self-plagiaristic. As Elizabeth carries out a violent assassination, the visual setup of the scene feels uncannily similar to depictions of barbaric brutality in previous seasons.
This premiere in no way indicates that this season will veer from its history of crafting compelling television—to the contrary, its narrative framework of Philip and Elizabeth working against each other yields promise of future brilliance. Yet it must be noted that the episode lacks the innovation that is truly characteristic of uncomplacent art. Perhaps, after six seasons, this marks the best time for “The Americans” to end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


The Department of Justice recently filed an amicus brief calling on Harvard to unseal admissions data the University has argued should remain private. The brief comes as part of an admissions lawsuit first brought against Harvard by Students for Fair Admissions in 2014, which alleges discrimination against Asian-Americans in the admissions process. The department has asserted that the admissions lawsuit is inherently linked to the its separate probe into Harvard’s admissions process and “could directly bear on that investigation.”
As students, we are concerned that unsealing the admissions data as requested by the Department of Justice’s brief will infringe on our privacy. We agree with the argument repeatedly made by Harvard that students who entrusted their applications to the College assumed that their personal data would never be made public and never asked to be a part of this dispute.
The filing states that providing public access to all relevant admissions material would provide a plethora of benefits that outweigh any costs to student privacy. Specifically, it argues that making these materials public would allow parties outside the case to participate by filing amicus briefs. While adding more voices to the lawsuit would certainly aid in the free expression of ideas, this should not come at the expense of Harvard students’ right to keep their information private. Indeed, we find it nothing short of astounding that the Department of Justice’s lawyers would argue in favor of sacrificing the deeply personal information of college students in exchange for this comparatively minimal benefit.
On a more personal level, the release of these documents would tangibly harm the undergraduate student body. Making these documents public could drastically worsen the scourge of “imposter syndrome”—or the belief that one is not “good enough” for Harvard. Every student that Harvard accepts belongs here, but admissions files are filled with complex symbols and jargon that are difficult to understand, creating potentially highly publicized confusion over any given admission file with deleterious implications for its author.
We have previously opined that students should not look at their own admissions files for this very reason, but the potential ramifications of the DOJ’s decision are far worse. Indeed, student privacy is a “most compelling reason” to keep these documents sealed in and of itself.
Nevertheless, if the University’s hand is forced to release these files, it must do so with extreme caution, taking all legal steps to redact as much personal information as possible. Ensuring that students’ private information cannot be traced back to them by any party that wants to access the court documents must be a main priority for Harvard.
As this dispute continues to unfold, we are heartened by statements from the University that reaffirm its commitment to protecting its students’ privacy. It is disappointing yet unsurprising that the Department of Justice has failed to do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nicholas: For the past few years, the two of us have worked on numerous policies intended to benefit the lives of students of color at Harvard. One question we’ve been constantly forced to answer is: “What will these proposals do and mean for white students?” We’re told that we have to convince our opponents that white students will gain, rather than lose, something from these policies. While we seek to push for an act or movement that is explicitly designed to benefit students of color by alleviating white supremacy, we are forced to reassure white Harvard—who is privileged by this systematic white supremacy—that our liberation attempts are to their benefit.
Salma: In my experience, social change is, at its core, an alignment of self-interests: Those who have power remain apathetic or in opposition unless their self-interests line up with the self-interests of those who are pushing for change.
This establishes a really troubling framework for advocacy on campus. At its core, Harvard is a place where white people continue to have the most power; because of this, we’ve been forced into advocacy that centers white self-interest. We spend more time reassuring white administrators, faculty, alumni, and students that they have nothing to lose in the adoption of our initiatives than we do convincing them that our proposed policy changes will help alleviate issues that students of color face. Convincing the powers-that-be that the status quo for students of color is inherently oppressive, and that real tangible changes are necessary for us to feel like we belong—to even feel like we are human—has never been enough. White students must have something to gain in order for our proposals to become a reality.N: I’ve written about this before; I’ve written about how empathy is structurally the same kind of move. Too often, we have convince white people to support our attempts at liberation by making them feel, understand, and be a part of our struggle and suffering. It’s not enough for us to say “We are suffering, help us.” We have to include “them” in our “we”. Advocates of marginalized communities cannot simply advocate for their suffering community. We have to subsume those who actively benefit from our oppression into our advocacy.
Is that fair work for us? Why must our self-interest be subordinated to that of our oppressors?
This moves beyond any one policy. The phenomenon of the subordination of Black and Brown liberation to white comfort is a claim on what justice is, and to whom it belongs. Justice can never, in this world, exist for Black and Brown folks. We receive no reparations, because we are owed nothing. Justice is not for us. The project moves on above our heads, and we must exist outside of it. We don’t get justice—we get scraps. To get our reparations, we have to make sure white folks get them too.S: It’s as if the modern manifestation of the “Whites Only” sign is “Whites Also.” Both are constructed out of the same basic materials: the centering of whiteness, white prioritization, and a constant reassurance that white skin will never preclude you from entering an environment—that there will always be a space carved out for you. This is a luxury students of color have never had, especially not on Harvard’s campus.
And how can we achieve true justice when we are constantly forced, because of these power structures, to center and privilege those who are already ahead? How do we challenge oppressive institutions that center and prioritize whiteness with advocacy that, at its core, is also expected to center and prioritize whiteness? Are we getting anywhere with our fight for justice if we legitimize those power structures by appealing to them?
N: Justice isn’t about appeasing the oppressors. When the white men who founded this country declared war against their own oppressors, they did not waste time appealing to the interests of the British Empire. Their desire for freedom, a freedom they claimed to be owed by the grace of justice, was fundamentally at odds with the interests of that empire. An end to oppression is usually not compatible with the interests of the oppressor. How can it have been to the benefit of the American South to free their black slaves? It was not. It disrupted their economy. It disrupted their social hierarchy. It disrupted their politics. It disrupted their basic way of life. (Of course, this disruption was swiftly quelled, as one way of dismantling Black freedom was replaced by another—so much for justice!)If our battle against oppression must seek the permission of our masters, then are we not simply running in circles?S: It’s a constant negotiation. Will we work within a system that is inherently rigged against us in order to achieve social change or will we reject that system completely? Will we legitimize our oppression by agreeing to play a game in which the rules are necessarily skewed in favor of those who already hold the power?
On different days, we have different answers. What has kept me sane throughout our work fighting for students of color on campus is the recognition that white supremacy is pervasive—so pervasive, in fact, that it manifests itself in the very work required to dismantle it. My guiding light in the fight for justice is a vision for a world in which Black liberation does not have to ride on the coattails of white self-interest, a world in which the cries of Black and Brown folk are more than enough to change it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It should come as no surprise that the recent passing of English physicist Stephen W. Hawking has conjured a massive outpouring of fan love.
To many, myself included, Hawking’s life of the mind stirred a genuine sense of human goodness. Hawking never treated his disciplines (cosmology and theoretical physics) as the private property of intellectuals, nor did he hesitate to poke fun at himself or his work. He regularly published literature for the laity, including the bestselling volume “A Brief History of Time,” which topped the London Sunday Times bestseller list for over five years. His visibility had powerful consequences outside of science too: Hawking embodied the wide gulf between condition and pathology. All who watched him knew that his physical impediment was no handicap to greatness.
As the kindly ambassador from a foreign field, however, Hawking often intimated his discomfort with this world. “I believe that life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out,” he once divulged. “I think the human race has no future if it doesn’t go into space.” Hawking kept several such statements in his repertoire. At a science festival in Norway, he confessed, “The Earth is under threat from so many areas that it is difficult for me to be positive.”
In keeping with this grim survivalist sense, Hawking’s top priority was space travel. He hoped to avoid a string of possible worst-case scenarios for humanity: A take-over by artificial intelligence (potentially “the worst event in the history of our civilization”), global nuclear conflict, and “genetically engineered viruses.” In a world so treacherous, Hawking believed, mankind ought to abide by the simplest logic: “The human race shouldn’t have all its eggs in one basket.”
Of all humanity’s members, we Americans are perhaps the best equipped to understand Hawking’s worldview. Our politics during the past two years have laid bare the difference between aspirational policy (like reaching the stars for the sake of human achievement) and stopgap measures (such as Hawking’s hoped-for “tiny space probes”). Where only a short time ago Americans were warming up to the idea of an immigrant republic and overseeing a national shift to soft power in our foreign affairs, we’re now left longing for a pause in the ongoing partisan hostilities or a period without a vulgar presidential tweet.
These yearnings for civility, like Hawking’s longing for cosmic travel, may seem like a commendable response to the times. They are not our better angels, though. They’re reminders of how low we’ve stooped.
Part of the problem is a growing sense of alienation from politics, as much as our shared humanity. News about our government reads like that of a foreign putsch. Trump has been likened to Latin American caudillos, European fascists, and Third World dictators. Alongside these claims, the “America First” mantra has left many of us wondering whether, in fact, we can claim anything in common with those beyond our borders.
Our times—abundant with confusion and lacking in obvious emancipatory strategies—recall Walter Lippmann’s assessment from nearly a century ago that being a private citizen feels like spectating from “the back row.”
The fondness for escape is palpable in this environment. Recall the list of celebrities who threatened to leave the country if the current president should ever achieve national office. In the aftermath of election night, some of those celebrities retracted their promises; others recanted them as jokes. We understood their sentiments either way.
Even the government is afflicted with this escapist urge. Three Republican senators have promised to resign after 2018, two of them openly dreading more embarrassment-by-association. Cabinet-level appointees have taken so vigorously to jumping ship that taking stock of casualties has become nearly impossible.
These are the circumstances in which we negotiate our potential futures. Some long for simple civility; others (the wearier moderates) demand a return to normalcy.
More entrenched liberals (myself included) are committed to these positions contingent on other important victories: a lasting resolution to gun violence, an end to nationalist sloganeering, renewed commitment to Herbert Croly’s “promise of American life.” These maneuvers give us firmer footing in the turf of values.
As with Hawking’s work, there is something profoundly humanist in the American creed—its call for constant democratic renewal, its framing of American advancement within a grander human project. But this humanism is not self-actualizing.
Physicist though he was, Hawking was performing a very old, unscientific ritual by aspiring to escape Earth. He was fantasizing the heavens as a reprieve from our earthly suffering.
In the age of Trump, we must learn to aspire for simpler rewards—respect, justice, and increasing opportunity. Once these are achieved, we can pursue the cosmos for its own sake.

A recently published study on racial disparities reveals that, in the vast majority of American neighborhoods, black boys earn far less in adulthood than white boys raised in families with comparable incomes, showing that race is a powerful indicator of social mobility for boys across all social classes. The study proves through data what many of us know through lived experience. Race shapes opportunities and outcomes, regardless of social class.
This fact speaks directly to a debate raging within our courts on the issue of race-based affirmative action. While some conservative legal strategists seek to end race-conscious admissions policies in favor of a class-based approach, these efforts pit marginalized communities against each other and do nothing to level the playing field for underrepresented racial minorities. One such lawsuit against Harvard College argues expanded socioeconomic preferences should replace race-based considerations because they are fairer to Asian and low-income students. Conflating race and class, the lawsuit claims that giving more weight to an applicant’s socioeconomic status can achieve similar levels of “diversity.”
The lawsuit wrongly ignores the reality that race continues to matter in our society separate and apart from class, as reflected by the aforementioned study and my own experience. I was a low-income, white student when I applied to the College in 2003, later attending from 2004 to 2008. Harvard’s admissions policies were in no way “unfair” to me. As an applicant and a student, I witnessed firsthand the importance of policies that affirmatively seek to bridge the racial divides persisting in society today.
In a country riddled with racial biases, race-conscious admissions ensure that fair opportunities for advancement are open to equally qualified students of color from disproportionately marginalized groups: namely, black, Latino, Native American, and Pacific Islander students. Just as importantly, these race-based policies foster greater levels of diversity in university classrooms, which enrich all students through the exchange of different ideas, backgrounds, and experiences.
My own path to Harvard was shaped by race, as I received opportunities as a white student that were denied to my black and Latino classmates. I grew up living, learning, and loving in Richmond, Calif., a predominantly low-income black and Latino community. I played in the same parks as my black and Latino neighbors, and I went to the same public elementary and middle schools challenged by chronic underfunding. My parents did not graduate from college, and we lived paycheck to paycheck. But I was white, and this was a huge advantage. Countless interactions made this advantage apparent.
Consider my study partner in elementary school. She and I were both devoted students, and we received nearly identical grades on tests. Unlike me, however, she was black. While our teacher tracked me for gifted classes, she did not give my study partner the same opportunity. This disparity in treatment occurs in classrooms across the country. A 2018 national study found that black and Latino students are less likely to participate in gifted programs across income levels.
Divergent treatment in discipline represents another type of systemic bias in schooling. There is ample evidence that black and Latino students receive harsher consequences for the same behavior in school. For example, a 2013 study by the Population Reference Bureau exposed various discipline gaps, including dress-code violations, where black students were suspended at a rate six times higher than white students, and cellphone use, where it was eight times higher.
The reality is that racial prejudice impacts the academic credentials collected prior to college. Race-conscious admissions rightly allow universities to be sensitive to such differences when considering each applicant’s capacity for academic excellence, leadership, and resourcefulness in the face of challenges. The result is a better learning environment for students of all races who are confronting in the classroom many of the issues playing out in society today.
As a student at the College, I vividly recall a debate about whether employers receiving identical resumes from two applicants—one with a name, say, “Jamal,” sounding as though it would belong to a black applicant, the other, say, “Brendan,” to a white applicant. My peers were debating whether the employers were justified in summarily rejecting “Jamal” but hiring “Brendan,” his seemingly-white equivalent. Stereotyping ensued, as one male student argued rejecting Jamal was justified from “an efficiency standpoint” if ethnically-named individuals were generally “less productive.” It was only after students from diverse backgrounds spoke up that the majority-white class expressed heightened understanding of the inherent bias that black and brown Americans face every day. Lessons around today’s most pressing issues—which often intersect with race—become real, better informed, and ultimately more effective in a diverse classroom.
These conversations are critical to dismantling prejudices harming our country, but they place an unfair, heavy burden on minority students, who bear the weight of these challenging discussions in classrooms, where they are too often racially isolated and tokenized. Studies have shown that higher same-race representation better supports underrepresented students who constantly encounter prejudiced scenarios. It also better ensures that racial stereotypes can be addressed and overcome in our rising generation of leaders. Race-conscious admissions is the strongest tool for fostering such diversity.
For all these reasons, I am fighting to protect race-conscious admissions. My organization, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, is representing black, Latino, Native American, and Asian American students at Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, to defend their universities’ race-conscious admissions policies, so that students on those campuses can benefit from the kind of culturally and ethnically diverse experiences that are in the national interest. I am privileged to help amplify their voices.
Just as some within the Asian community have refused to become a wedge to support conservative attacks on affirmative action, I refuse to let anyone use low-income white kids, like I was, to justify policies that stoke the flames of racial resentment and ignore the experiences of students of color in elementary and middle schools like mine. Increasing access for low-income students should complement—but not replace—increasing access for underrepresented students of color.

Harvard was “barraged” with spoofed phone calls Monday morning, according to an alert issued by Harvard University Information Technology.
The spoof calls began at 9:30 a.m. Monday and affected “several of Harvard’s professional schools,” the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the University’s central administration, HUIT spokesperson Acacia Matheson wrote in an emailed statement.
Matheson wrote that the source of the robocalls appeared to be a “valid phone number” belonging to China’s Embassy in the United States.
She added that HUIT was making efforts to resolve the matter.
“Harvard University IT has taken steps to block incoming calls from the number temporarily and will continue to work closely with our telecommunications provider to investigate this incident and pursue a longer-term solution,” she wrote.
In the email, Matheson reiterated the original alert’s message to recipients of the robocalls: Ignore the calls.
“These calls are a scam. Recipients should hang-up or let the call go to voicemail,” she wrote. “Do not respond to the phone message or menu options, and do not provide any personal information.”
At 3:37 p.m, a second alert on HUIT’s website notified Harvard affiliates that the issue had been resolved: “Inbound call volumes have returned to normal levels.”

The School of Public Health and insurance company Aetna announced a research partnership last week intended to examine data on employee well-being.
Tyler J. VanderWeele, an Epidemiology professor at the School of Public Health, is co-directing the project with Eileen McNeely, an instructor at the school.
Aetna executives interested in improving employee well-being contacted the researchers in 2016, VanderWeele said, and they first met to discuss the project that spring.
“It was clear almost from the beginning that this was going to be a good match with regard to interest and the potential for research,” VanderWeele said. “We’ll have quite an extraordinary and rich well-being data research resource.”
Aetna employees will voluntarily take longitudinal well-being surveys for five years, the results of which will be sent to researchers at the School of Public Health.
Harvard well-being researchers have worked with employee data from companies in the past, but not on the scale or duration of the Aetna project, according to VanderWeele.
Aetna and Harvard officials both declined to state exactly how much funding Aetna will provide to the school, but said that it was a substantial amount.
“It’s in the millions of dollars,” VanderWeele said.
Aetna spokesperson Ethan Slavin said “this is a pretty sizable funding arrangement for this type of research.”
Kay Mooney, vice president of employee benefits and well-being at Aetna, said the partnership is part of Aetna’s efforts to improve employee well-being.
“We ended up interviewing a lot of different companies and institutions, and felt like when we met with Eileen that we had a similar vision for what we were trying to accomplish,” Mooney said.
In order to allay data privacy concerns, the data transmitted between Aetna and the School of Public Health will not be attached to employee names, Mooney said.
The new partnership seeks to expand the traditional four-factor understanding of well-being,  physical, emotional, social, and financial, to include purpose and character strengths.
After a pilot program testing a subgroup of the company in 2018, the well-being surveys will be expanded to all of Aetna’s employees next year.
Mooney said the company also hopes to make its well-being model available to Aetna customers in the future.
Stanford Law School professor Michelle M. Mello, who previously worked at the School of Public Health, characterized the arrangement between Aetna and Harvard as standard for similar research.
“Most research that is done in medical schools and schools of public health is funded by grants or contracts from people outside the school,” Mello said. “It’s quite common for research projects to be attached a grant, and it’s also common for those grants to come from industry.”
This partnership is not the first time Aetna has worked with Longwood researchers. In 2011, Aetna partnered with Harvard Medical School’s Center for Biomedical Informatics to analyze healthcare claims data.

UPDATED: April 10, 2018 at 8:20 p.m.
Ahead of the second unionization election next week, some Harvard graduate student assistants away from campus say they are disappointed there will not be mail-in ballots for the election.
The election—which is slated to be held on April 18 and 19—will only be conducted at three in-person polling sites on Harvard’s campus, per a pre-election agreement between the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers.  The results of the poll will determine whether eligible graduate and undergraduate student assistants may collectively bargain with the University.
A number of the students unable to vote next week include those completing fieldwork or remote research for their degree. For Ph.D. programs such as sociology, history, and anthropology, this off-campus work is often integral to a student’s dissertation.
Sociology Ph.D. student Amy H. Tsang, who is spending a year researching for her dissertation in China, said she was surprised to find out she would not have the opportunity to vote.
“We received emails that were supposed to explain things about the union and the election process, but given that so many students are always away from campus for research, I found it strange that we weren't told about this very important fact,” Tsang said.
In an email, Anthropology graduate program administrator Marianne Fritz estimated that, at any given time, roughly 15 percent of the program’s more than 80 graduate students are working in the field. This work typically occurs during the fourth and fifth years of the degree program, according to the department’s website.
Tsang remarked that her department has a similar timeline for advanced graduate students to perform field work.
“Since we're more advanced [graduate students], we've also had experience being TFs and research assistants and working,” Tsang said. “So we have experience relevant to try to decide whether or not we feel a union would benefit our working conditions.”
Anthropology Ph.D. student Shuang Lu Frost, who is also currently completing fieldwork in China, wrote in an email that she thinks the policy is “biased” against students in the social sciences and humanities.
“Students in these disciplines have particular working experience and face particular challenges during their graduate study; and their voices are crucial to include,” Frost wrote.
According to National Labor Relations Board procedure, unionization elections may be conducted using either “manual” in-person ballots, mail-in ballots, or both. While the final say on election procedure lies with the NLRB’s regional director, the agency usually defers to the employer and the proposed union if a pre-election agreement between the two exists.
HGSU-UAW organizer Andrew B. Donnelly wrote in an email that the decision to have an in-person election was made early on between the University and HGSU-UAW before the original Nov. 2016 election.
William B. Gould IV, a former NLRB chairman, said the board accepts postal ballots in “a wide number of circumstances,” though the decision varies case-by-case. Gould has argued in the past that mail-in ballots lead to a better representation of the voting population.
“They would have to agree upon it, but postal ballots are provided where it's infeasible to vote under whatever other method is provided,” Gould said.
In order to vote, some off-campus graduate students have resigned themselves to making the trek to return to Cambridge.
Sociology and Social Policy Ph.D. student Nathan J. Robinson, who criticized the lack of mail ballots, said he plans to travel back to Cambridge from his field studies in order to vote in next week’s election.
“Imagine if you were allowed to vote in presidential elections, but only if you went to the middle of the Nevada desert,” Robinson wrote in an email.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 10, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Nathan Robinson as a Ph.D. student in Anthropology. In fact, he is a Ph.D. student in Sociology and Social Policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 120 people have signed a petition urging the dean of the Kennedy School to invite a wider array of international speakers and moderators to campus.
The petition, organized by several international students and widely circulated around the school, specifically cites the choice of Ohio Governor John Kasich as the school’s 2018 commencement speaker as “reflective of this trend.” The students requested that HKS replace Kasich as the main addressee or add another speaker to the commencement program who better represents the international student body.
Yusaku Kawashima, a master in public administration degree student originally from Japan who helped organize the petition, said the organizers did not have a partisan perspective on Kasich, but argued that choosing Kasich demonstrated the school’s lack of awareness of global voices.
“I totally respect [Kasich], and I’m not saying his political perspective is right or wrong, but the administration should have paid more attention to how students would feel about him as the commencement speaker,” Kawashima said.
“I expect that Governor Kasich will deliver a commencement address that will be meaningful to many, many of our students,” Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf said in response to the petition. “I understand that different speakers in different years seem particularly meaningful to some students or others, but I think our speakers have over time been very interesting to all of the students and parents that have been graduating and I think that will be true again this year.”
The petition also included an analysis of past speakers from recent weeks at the Kennedy School’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. Out of 14 speakers and moderators hosted by the Institute of Politics, the petition notes that only one speaker was not from the United States.
“While HKS states that it convenes an intellectual exchange among global leaders at the Forum, the experience is not aligned with the copy,” the petition reads.
International students from more than 100 countries represent 47 percent of the HKS student body, according to Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel.
Elmendorf said he was working on inviting more international speakers to the Kennedy School by collaborating with the individual research centers that invite speakers to campus.
“A fair number of [speakers] are from outside of the United States, but I think the students are right to want to have more speakers from outside the United States and I hope we can accomplish that in the coming years,” Elmendorf said.
According to the petition, only one Kennedy School commencement speaker since 2009 has been from outside the “Global North”—a region that includes the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Asia.
Students involved with the petition met with Elmendorf Thursday to discuss their requests. Luna D. Kim, a second-year master in public policy student who helped organize the petition, said the dean was “adamant” about maintaining this year’s commencement program.
“He showed some understanding about where we were coming from, but I don't think he understood the gravity of our claim or concern about international students,” Kim said. “For me, it was highly disappointing, and I don't think he was willing to make any significant changes.”
Elmendorf said he would not change this year’s speaker, but said he would solicit student opinions for future years’ commencement speakers.
“I was very clear on Thursday that I want the students to participate in choosing future commencement speakers, and I was very direct that we will set up a mechanism in which the students through the student government can play that role in the future,” he said.
Aditya Todi, a first-year master in public policy student and the vice president of international student affairs in the HKS student government, said the school would benefit from including more of these voices at its events.
“For a school that prides itself on bringing a diverse set of opinions and point of views, if those points of view are restricted to what the Global North is and what those Western perspectives are… it is a huge disservice not just to the domestic student population here but also the international students that the school attracts,” Todi said.

Contrary to national trends, Harvard College reported that it received an increase in the number of international applications while other colleges across the nation continue to experience decreases in foreign applicants.
Robin M. Worth ’81, the director of international admissions, wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has not seen a decline in the number of undergraduate international applicants. Indeed, William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, dean of admissions and financial aid, said the College has seen “an 8.9 percent increase in people applying from other countries.”
But other U.S. colleges and universities are experiencing an overall decrease in foreign students. This past fall, reports by the Institute of International Education found that the number of newly arriving foreign students declined an average of 7 percent. In total, 45 percent of campuses reported a decrease in new international enrollment.
In its own data, the College distinguishes between individuals who apply from a foreign country and those who apply with a non-United States passport. In the recent record-setting admissions cycle, Harvard saw a 10.4 percent increase in applicants with a foreign passport, according to Fitzsimmons.
According to State Department data, the number of F-1 visas issued to foreign students seeking to attend college and other types of academic institutions in the United States decreased by 17 percent from Sept. 2016 to Sept. 2017.
Harvard’s applicants to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences similarly defied the downward trend in international applicants to graduate schools. In 2018, GSAS observed a 2 percent increase in international applicants while graduate schools across the country saw a 3 percent decline in international applicants since fall 2016, according to a survey released in January by the Council of Graduate Schools.
The study found that applications from the Middle East and North Africa notably declined for the second consecutive year in the wake of the Trump administration’s proposed travel bans from those regions.
“Since the issuance of the travel ban, the graduate education community has carefully monitored changes in the flow of international graduate students from the Middle East and North Africa region,” the report reads. “The 175 institutions contributing data for both Fall 2016 and Fall 2017 reported, in aggregate, a decline in both final applications (-17%) and first-time graduate enrollment (-5%) from this region.”
President Donald Trump signed three iterations of travel bans against Muslim-majority countries between January and October 2017. Federal judges have since blocked all three.

The Classroom to Table program—a College initiative designed to bring together students and faculty members for fine dining in Harvard Square—has shut down after exhausting its budget for the year.
An update on the Office of Undergraduate Education’s webpage for the program said funding has run out for the semester, and the online form to schedule new dinner reservations closed on Wednesday, April 4 at 12 noon.
“As we stated at the start of the term, program funding is limited. We have had a very successful term and have reached our funding limit,” the webpage reads.
The closure comes shortly after the initiative announced new restrictions for the spring 2018 semester. The guidelines imposed a limit of two dinners per student—half the number allowed during the fall, before which no cap existed at all. The system also restricted sign-up form access to administrative office hours.
This is not the first time Classroom to Table has shut down due to financial difficulties. In spring 2017, the Office of Undergraduate Education halted the program around the same time of the term after running out of funds.
The initiative, first piloted by the College in Sept. 2015, typically brings together three to five students with a professor for a subsidized lunch or dinner of up to $30 per person in Harvard Square. The program has been well-received by students, increasing its popularity over the last two years, with 2,880 students and 528 faculty members participating in 894 total gatherings in fall 2017.
James G. Anderson, a Chemistry professor who teaches Physical Sciences 11: “Foundations and Frontiers of Modern Chemistry: A Molecular and Global Perspective,” said the program is conducive to connecting with the students in his class. He called the decision to end the program mid-semester “both remarkable and disappointing.”
“I consider the Classroom to Table program to be a reflection of very creative thinking by the College, and it has served as the most important venue for me in Physical Sciences 11 since its inception, providing both the time and the setting for extended conversations with students in the class,” Anderson said. “I was profoundly disappointed when it was announced that the program has been terminated for lack of funds.”
University spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in a statement the College recognizes intense student and faculty interest in the program and has made its future funding a priority.
“Harvard College values the Classroom to Table program, which seeks to foster conversation and academic connection among undergraduate students to create additional opportunities for intellectual, personal, and social transformation," Dane wrote. "We know that students and faculty alike value this program too (as noted by its high participation rates) and, as such, the College has made it a top priority in our fundraising efforts."
“The program has exceeded our projections and the amount we had allocated for the program this year, and so the College will continue its efforts to raise funds to support this popular program moving forward,” Dane added.
Jason P. Mitchell, a Psychology professor who teaches the spring semester of Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science,” said that though students can no longer book Classroom to Table reservations, students shouldn’t see this as an impediment to getting to know their instructors outside the classroom.
“I would tell anyone who is interested in sharing a meal with a faculty member to remember that it isn’t the promise of a restaurant meal that is appealing to us—it’s the chance to get to know our students outside of classroom hours,” Mitchell said. “For many faculty, eating in Annenberg or one of the Houses is a special treat, and I would encourage students to carry on the impulse behind Classroom to Table, and just move it closer to home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several legal experts said the Justice Department’s recent intervention in a pending lawsuit challenging Harvard’s admissions practices will have little effect on the outcome of the case—though the department’s interference signals a desire to become more deeply involved going forward.
The department on Friday filed an amicus brief seeking to unseal admissions data that Harvard has repeatedly argued should remain private. The filing also asserted the lawsuit is directly relevant to the Justice Department’s separate, ongoing probe into Harvard’s admissions practices and mentioned the department may want to join the suit in future.
“I think this is a signal that the DOJ is going to be continuing to watch the case and will want to continue to participate,” said David B. Oppenheimer, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
The lawsuit, brought in 2014 by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions, alleges the College discriminates against Asian-Americans in its admissions process—something Harvard has repeatedly denied. In prosecuting the suit, Students for Fair Admissions has insisted Harvard admissions data should become public, sparking vehement disagreement from the College.
The issue may come to a head Tuesday, when the two parties are slated to meet at the U.S. District Court in Boston to discuss the handling of previously confidential admissions information, including redacted applications and internal communications. It is not clear whether the court will make a final decision on the issue at that meeting.
Experts said the Justice Department’s filing is unlikely to shape any possible verdict the court might reach Tuesday.
“Given that the privacy rights of students and potential students may be at issue here, I doubt the court will presume as DOJ suggests,” W. Burlette Carter, a law professor at George Washington University, wrote in a statement Monday. “On the other hand, it won’t let Harvard protect all aspects of its admissions process generally. The answer is somewhere in between.”
Kimberly West-Faulcon, a law professor at Loyola Law School, agreed. She said she does not think the Justice Department’s briefing will carry any more weight than any other party’s filing.
Several advocacy groups filed briefings urging Harvard to make its admissions data public over the weekend. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions directly sparred over the issue in clashing briefs both parties filed Friday.
“I do not think the fact that it is the Justice Department making this claim should change Harvard’s legal obligation to protect student data,” West-Faulcon said. “I’m not familiar with any legal reason it should.”
Oppenheimer speculated the court may give less weight to input from the Justice Department under the Trump administration than courts traditionally have during previous administrations.
He said the court may be “more skeptical” of what he called a “very political filing,” despite the fact the department has historically wielded significant influence over matters of civil rights.
Oppenheimer’s comments do not mark the first time the Justice Department has drawn criticism from analysts for so-called political behavior. Some experts made the same claim after the department—citing allegations of discrimination against Asian Americans—opened an investigation into Harvard’s admissions process over the summer. That probe is ongoing.
Oppenheimer called Justice Department involvement in the lawsuit at this stage of litigation “typical” for high-profile civil rights cases. The outcome of the admissions lawsuit against Harvard will likely have far-reaching implications for affirmative action in the United States.
“What's unusual is the side they're taking,” he said. “You would normally expect the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to be intervening or to be filing an amicus brief on behalf of Harvard.”
West-Faulcon, however, said the Justice Department’s involvement in the case may stem in part from a desire to publicize the case in the media. She particularly pointed to recent coverage in The Harvard Crimson, the New York Times, and Newsweek.
“To get involved in this case so early brings a lot of media attention,” she said.
The court has set a tentative timeline for the suit, marking Jan. 2, 2019 as a possible date for a trial, if Judge Allison D. Burroughs determines the case should go to trial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Merrick B. Garland ’74, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, visited Harvard Monday afternoon to talk with undergraduates about public service and the law.
Garland was nominated for the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Barack Obama, but the Senate declined to vote on Garland’s nomination, which expired in Jan. 2017.
Around 50 undergraduates gathered in the Winthrop Junior Common Room for the talk hosted by the Office of Career Services.
Garland regaled students with tales from his time as an undergraduate at the College, and then as a student at the Law School. He also reminisced about his experiences working on the infamous Unabomber case, and the time he met J.K. Rowling while she was on campus to give Harvard’s 2008 Commencement address. Garland, a former member of the Board of Overseers—Harvard’s second-highest governing board—was influential in Rowling’s selection as speaker.
Incidentally, the “Harry Potter” series was at the top of Garland’s recommended reading list for students, followed by John Ely’s “Democracy and Distrust.”
Garland, a former Crimson editorial editor, offered multiple pieces of career advice to attendees.
“Please think about pursuing public service,” Garland said. “It doesn’t have to be a lifetime where that’s all you do. There are different ways to do public service, and it’s not that easy to have a career full-time in public service.”
Garland also entreated students to keep their options open by avoiding what he called “golden handcuffs”—financial barriers to pursuing their goals.
“Pay off your loans,” he said. “Don’t lock yourself into payments that you can’t afford on a public interest or government salary.”
He also advised students to stay open-minded.
“You really don’t know what you’re going to be interested in,” Garland said, reflecting on his own career, which he said took many twists and turns. “You have to take opportunities when they come. Don’t worry about the title.”
Several students said they attended the discussion because of their own interest in pursuing legal careers.
“It was comforting for him to say, sometimes you don’t know until you try something and you realize, ‘Wow, I actually have this whole interest that I didn’t really realize I had before,’” said Danielle D. Davis ’21, who attended the event.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who moderated the event, said he first reached out to Garland about a possible visit “a couple of years ago.” The original plan had been for Garland to give a larger lecture for undergraduates.
Garland, however, had a different idea in mind.
“He said, ‘I don’t want to give a lecture. I really want to have a chance to talk to students,’” Harris said.
“Chief Judge Garland’s openness and comfortability with the students was evident,” said Zachary D. Steigerwald Schnall ’21, who also attended the event. “His willingness to dive into the past, in terms of stories that he told, really was eye-opening to me.”

UPDATED: April 10, 2018 at 11:50 a.m.
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 called the Justice Department's recent intervention in a lawsuit challenging Harvard's admissions process "perplexing" and "entirely unnecessary" in a public letter Monday.
Lee sent the letter to the federal judge presiding over the ongoing suit, which alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions system. Advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions filed the lawsuit in 2014.
“Harvard does not, of course, dispute the Department’s authority to uphold the nation’s civil rights laws for all its citizens,” Lee’s letter reads. “But the Department’s belated interest in this case, and its submission on this confidentiality issue in particular, cannot help but give pause.”
The letter almost directly follows the department’s Friday filing, in which the federal agency asked the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts to unseal previously confidential applicant information and data related to Harvard’s admissions process. The briefing asserted the court should unseal the data so the department and the public can effectively participate in the suit as “friends of the court.”
Harvard has repeatedly argued the data must remain private to protect student privacy and “highly proprietary” admissions information.
Lee wrote in his Monday letter that the Justice Department’s request came as a surprise to Harvard. He wrote the department had not previously expressed concern over the University's desire to keep documents relevant to the lawsuit private.
“Before submitting its Notice on Friday afternoon, the Department never raised with Harvard any concern that it would not have access to summary judgment filings,” Lee wrote.
Lee—who wrote the letter only in his capacity as a lawyer, and not in his capacity as senior fellow of the Corporation—claimed the department has already gained full access to all relevant filings, which it likely obtained as part of its own separate, ongoing probe into Harvard’s admissions policies. The Department of Justice initiated its investigation in 2017, after originally—under the Obama administration—choosing to take no action on a complaint filed in 2014 that also alleged Harvard discriminates in its admissions process.
“To the extent the Department wished to ensure its own access to the summary judgment materials in this case, it already has that access,” Lee wrote.
Lee added the department’s filing comprises an “incomplete portrayal” of the body’s previous involvement in the lawsuit, which is separate from its probe.
“SFFA’s complaint was filed in November 2014, and yet for reasons that are not articulated, the Department waited until April 2018 to suggest that it has a ‘substantial interest’ in this litigation,” the letter reads.
Justice Department spokesperson Devin M. O’Malley declined to comment Monday evening.
Another Monday filing, submitted by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, states that students serving as amici curiae in the lawsuit share Harvard’s concern that confidential documents in the case could make past and present applicants personally identifiable.
Lee’s letter comes a day before attorneys for the parties will meet at the U.S. District Court in Boston to deliberate over the handling of confidential materials in the case and determine a more concrete timeline for future developments in the suit.

UPDATED: April 12, 2018 at 3:40 a.m.
Harvard’s final clubs are not preparing to file suit against the University for its social group policy any time in the near future and view legal action as a last resort, multiple club affiliates said Monday.
Harvard’s policy, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships. Since its debut in May 2016, the policy has sparked turmoil on campus and significant backlash from members of social clubs—including a recent push by some final club graduate members to lobby Congress for legislation that could threaten Harvard’s ability to enforce the sanctions.
The Wall Street Journal reported in Feb. 2018 that some final club graduates are lobbying members of Congress in favor of the PROSPER Act, a piece of legislation—meant as an update to the Higher Education Act—that contains a provision that could force the University to choose between the sanctions and millions of dollars in research funding.
In its current form, the PROSPER Act does not apply to Harvard; final club members hope to change that by altering the wording of the legislation. Multiple leaders of final clubs said these lobbying efforts remain their main focus and that the clubs do not plan to sue the University in the next few months.
“It’s the type of thing that you allow for the possibility but you don’t plan for its being an eventuality,” said Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78, the graduate president of the all-male Fly Club. “I know litigation is always the sexiest thing to go for [but] the legislative remedy is of most promise to us.”
He added the clubs consider the lobbying effort the “most prudent and effective thing” to do in the “near term.”
Harvey A. Silverglate, a lawyer who has represented the Fly Club since the group retained legal counsel in Sept. 2016, wrote in an email that litigation was “always seen as a last resort.”
Silverglate wrote that the decision to sue—not yet made—will depend both on the outcome of the lobbying push and on the “details” of Harvard’s ongoing implementation of the social group policy. As part of that implementation, the College’s Office of Student Life is working to create a “new framework for governing primarily social organizations”—a framework set to be finalized next fall, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote in a March email to students.
Silverglate added he and his law firm, Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein, will continue to explore the possibility of litigation “just in case” the Fly Club decides that a lawsuit “becomes necessary.”
The final clubs are not alone in their efforts to oppose the sanctions; some have joined forces with various Greek organizations to form the Cambridge Coalition, a group comprising the Fly Club, the AD Club, the Porcellian Club, and the national organizations of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternities. This group has engaged the law firm Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP to help conduct its lobbying efforts, according to public filings.
The Yale Daily News reported Monday that the final clubs and Greek organizations comprising this group are preparing a lawsuit against Harvard. Citing speculation from one anonymous source, the Yale Daily News reported that—unless lobbying efforts are successful—the coalition will likely file suit in the next two months.
Multiple final club affiliates said Monday that this timeline is incorrect.
The coalition does not have a definite sense of when it will consider legal action if lobbying does not succeed, but it will almost certainly not be within the next two months, Porteus said.
“As far as the timeline goes, no, we don’t know exactly how things will unfold,” he said. “So, we’re prepared to stay the course.”
Congress must reauthorize the Higher Education Act—legislation that the PROSPER Act would renew—approximately every six to eight years. Porteus said this gives final clubs and Greek organizations an “opportunity to influence” the terms of the act so as to cancel Harvard’s sanctions.
Heather M. Kirk, chief communication officer for the North-American Interfraternity Conference, wrote in an emailed statement Monday that the group plans to fight the sanctions however possible.
“We will vigorously defend students’ right to choose the organization that best suits their needs and are actively weighing all options—including legal and legislative routes—to protect students’ rights,” Kirk wrote.

CORRECTION: April 12, 2018
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly identified the firm retained by the Cambridge Coalition. It is Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, not Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholar.

Harvard College Interfaith Forum announced plans to launch a peer educator program for spirituality in undergraduate residential Houses last week; the program is slated to officially begin in the fall.
The peer educators, dubbed “Facilitators of Religious, Ethical, and Spiritual Inquiry,” will comprise undergraduates who will “facilitate conversations, journaling exercises, meditation practices, and other activities,” according to an online application for the program. The Interfaith Forum intends these activities to engage students both College-wide and more specifically within the upperclassman Houses.
Benjamin J. Schafer ’19, president of the Interfaith Forum, said in an interview Sunday that he believes the high level of engagement among individual House affiliates will give the FRESIs a good opportunity to interact with students.
“The House system is such a beautiful thing in that people really engage in their House communities unlike other stuff,” Schafer said. “I can host a campus-wide dinner and have 12 people show up or I could host a house-wide dinner and have 16 to 18 people show up.”
The FRESI initiative is modeled after the currently active Diversity Peer Educators program, Schaffer added.
“We’re taking our cues from the Diversity Peer Educators program,” Schaffer said. “They’ve been really successful this year in running House program that has been meaningful.”
Diversity Peer Educators—a team of 20 trained undergraduates who conduct outreach for the College’s Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion—organize student dialogues across campus and hold workshops for a number of student organizations.
The launch of the program resulted from conversations with chaplains, House faculty deans, and administrators at the Office of Student Life, including Roland S. Davis, associate dean of diversity and inclusion, according to Schaffer.
“This program came out of conversations of how we engage the Harvard community in such a way that people have to talk about religious spiritual and ethical life, and we worked really closely with a lot of people,” Schafer said. “The Freshman Dean’s Office has been super helpful, Dean Davis from the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion has been a really great resource for us.”
The FRESI program is the first step in a longer journey to found an office for religious life at the College, Schafer said.
“Harvard doesn’t have a multifaith chaplain. Harvard doesn’t have an office of religious life,” Schafer said. “But just going in and saying, ‘Hey we want these two things,’ is not enough.”
“It’s really building the infrastructure to say, ‘We now have a peer educator program that an office of religious life could fund and administer and be a part of,’” he added.
The facilitators will be paid at least $300 for their work each year, according to the application.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 10, 2018 at 11:45 p.m.
A small, redacted portion of more than 90,000 pages of Harvard admissions documents—including applicants’ files and internal correspondence between admissions officers—will become public information in coming months after a judge’s ruling in a lawsuit against Harvard Tuesday.
At an April 10 hearing at the U.S. District Court in Boston, Judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled that, within the next two months, lawyers for Harvard University and advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions must file two near-identical sets of previously confidential Harvard admissions documents—one unredacted set to be filed under seal and one redacted version of the set to be filed publicly. These filings could total thousands of pages but will only comprise "a small fraction" of the 90,000 total pages of documents designated as "Confidential" or "Highly Confidential" that the University has given over as part of the ongoing lawsuit, according to a filing made by Harvard lawyers last week.
Nonetheless, most of the confidential information related to Harvard's admissions will not be contained in these filings. If the case goes forward, much of that information could become public at a later trial.
That trial is now likely going to take place this next fall after hearing participants discussed moving up the tentative date at the hearing Tuesday. Instead of a previously proposed date in early January, the judge, Harvard, and Students for Fair Admissions spoke about holding a trial in mid-October.
Judge Burroughs determined that Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions must work together over the coming months to agree on redactions for the public set of documents prior to filing. She instructed both groups they should not redact the files to the point of being “incomprehensible.”
Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action group, first filed the lawsuit against Harvard in 2014; the suit alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. Harvard has repeatedly denied this accusation.
In Oct. 2016, Harvard provided Students for Fair Admissions with data for hundreds of thousands of students who applied to the College between fall 2009 and spring 2015. This information, evaluated in the discovery phase of the ongoing lawsuit, omitted the names and social security numbers of applicants.
Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions previously battled over whether this College admissions data should become public in clashing briefs filed last week.
In its brief, Students for Fair Admissions argued that “Harvard already has redacted all personally identifiable information of applicants, alumni, and donors.” Harvard, however, asserted in its filings that even the redacted admissions data could render College affiliates identifiable.
Harvard asked for the documents to “be filed provisionally under seal,” citing concerns regarding student privacy. Students for Fair Admissions requested the documents be filed publicly, arguing the public has a “profoundly important” interest in the documents.
Representatives for both Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions said their respective institutions are content with the outcome of Tuesday’s hearing.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that the College is satisfied with Judge Burroughs’s ruling.
“Harvard College is pleased the court today affirmed our responsibility to protect the confidential and highly sensitive personal information of our applicants from unwarranted public disclosure," Dane wrote. "The process the court set forth will allow for the careful consideration of confidentiality before any private information is made publicly available.”
Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said his organization is optimistic for the future.
“We are encouraged that the American public will soon have access to the full record in this lawsuit and look forward to the scheduled October trial,” Blum said.
Andrew D. Bradt ’02, an assistant law professor at University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an email Tuesday that he thinks Judge Burroughs sought a “middle ground” between Harvard’s desire to keep the admissions data entirely under seal and Students for Fair Admissions’ request to make it public.
“Judge Burroughs's ruling does not surprise me,” Bradt wrote. “This seems like a wholly appropriate middle ground solution for this phase of the litigation.”
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, numbered among several lawyers representing Harvard at the hearing—acting only as an attorney, not on behalf of the Corporation.
The Department of Justice has taken a strong interest in the lawsuit and in the confidential status of Harvard’s admissions data, filing a brief Friday as part of the lawsuit that argued Harvard should make the data public. Lee sent a letter to Judge Burroughs Monday calling the Department of Justice’s intervention “perplexing” and “entirely unnecessary.”
“The United States agrees that applicants to Harvard, their families, and the general public have a presumptively paramount right to access the summary judgment record in this civil rights case,” the Justice Department filing reads.
Justice Department spokesperson Devin M. O’Malley declined to comment on Judge Burroughs’s decision Tuesday.
The hearing comes a few months before a June 15 deadline—set by Judge Burroughs Tuesday—for the parties to file motions on whether the lawsuit can be resolved without a trial.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: April 10, 2018
This article and its accompanying headline have been updated to reflect and clarify the fact that the vast majority of Harvard admissions data will remain confidential until a trial likely to take place in mid-October. That data would only become public if the case goes forward after that trial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Staying hot in Ivy League contests, Harvard women’s tennis finished off the weekend with two wins to stay undefeated in league play. The resounding victories over Ancient Eight rivals prepared the team for its next two home matches against Columbia and Cornell this upcoming weekend.
HARVARD 6, YALE 1
On Sunday afternoon the Crimson commuted to New Haven to take on Ivy League rival Yale (6-14, 0-3 Ivy). The lowly Bulldogs remain winless in league play while Harvard lengthened its winning streak to five matches.
The Crimson (11-8, 3-0) actually started out the match losing the first doubles point. Junior Erica Oosterhout and sophomore Natasha Gonzalez were the only pair to win a doubles match.
“It was great to see everyone come out ready to go in singles after we dropped the doubles point,” sophomore Jenna Friedel said. “Everyone was able to mentally turn the page and get after it from the start of singles.”
Harvard turned around the result entirely and completely dominated singles play. Harvard won all six matches. Oosterhout led the charge and beat Yale’s Samantha Martinelli 6-4, 7-6 in first singles, earning her 18th singles win of the season. In third singles, Crimson sophomore Irene Lu battled the Bulldogs’ Valerie Shklover in third singles. Lu was trailing 1-0, but quickly battled back to dominate the match, 6-1, 6-0.
Sophomore Lexi Milunovich had a close match against Yale’s Elizabeth Zordani in fifth singles. Milunovich defeated Zordani in three sets, 6-2, 5-7, 10-2. Senior captain Annika Ringblom finished off her successful weekend by defeating her opponent Lauren Gillinov, 6-0, 6-1.
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
Both Harvard and Brown went into Friday off of victories in opening conference contests. As with Yale, the Crimson dropped the doubles point to Brown, but ended up winning the match by winning five out of the six singles points.
“I’m just so proud of our squad,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We came back after losing the doubles point. It didn’t look great out there for a very long time but we fought tooth and nail and came through today so I’m really proud of the resilience primarily but overall heart of our team.”
Oosterhout and Gonzalez performed well in doubles and was tied 5-5 with their Yale competition before the doubles point was determined. In singles play, Gonzalez had a stand out performance by clinching the win for the Crimson in her sixth singles match, a tightly contested matchup against the Bulldogs’ Juliana Simon. Gonzalez won the first set 6-4, but then Simon responded to win the next set 7-5. In the final set, Gonzalez solidified the win against Brown for the Crimson by defeating Simon 6-3.
“A lot of the matches went three sets which means it was a battle either way. Natasha really stepped up nicely again,” Green said. “It is the second time clinching in a row for us which is huge. She's only a sophomore so we expect more great things to come.”
Even though Harvard had already clinched the match, Oosterhout and sophomore Jenna Friedel continued impressive play for Harvard. Oosterhout defeated her opponent, Alyza Benotto in first singles (7-6, 4-6, 6-4). Friedel also had a standout performance in the match, defeating Brown’s Maddie Stearns in three sets (6-2, 1-6, 6-2) in second singles.
“And Erica she has been batting a few injured here and there and I’m really proud of the way she came through there in the end even when the match was already clinched,” Green said. “Annika as always had super energy out there and she gets the team fired up. Jenna Friedel she was a fighter out there totally, she came out with a fast start and got tripped up a little bit but turned it around in the third for us.”

With the NCAA men’s hockey tournament finally concluded, Harvard will jump from its brief offseason into spring training. Before looking ahead to 2018-2019, though, the team must reflect on a season full of ups and downs, perhaps best exemplified in the ECAC semifinal overtime loss to then-No. 10/8 Clarkson that put the Crimson out of business.
“It was just a chess match,” said tri-captain forward Jake Horton, thinking back to the mid-March showdown. “[But] as a hockey player, you want to be in those kinds of games that are intense with a lot of good players in it.”
After jumping out to a 4-1 lead mere seconds into the third period, the Crimson was staring at the chance to earn a second straight Whitelaw Cup, given to the postseason conference champion. In the earlier semifinal, Princeton—a team that Harvard swept this season—had bested then-No. 2 Cornell. With a streaking yet beatable Tigers squad waiting ahead rather than the Big Red, which shut down the Crimson in both of the teams’ meetings this year, Harvard liked its chances to play its way into the NCAA Tournament. The team, of course, never had that opportunity.
Instead, the Golden Knights escaped the jaws of defeat, scoring three unanswered goals to tie the game and then another to steal it in the extra frame.
And so it was all season. While the Crimson witnessed spurts of offensive brilliance and a banner year from junior forward Ryan Donato, the group seemed unable to find its groove for sustained periods of play, and uncertainty in net didn’t help either.
“The season was basically characterized by learning curves,” Horton said. “It gave a lot of guys...that didn’t necessarily get those experiences over the past few years...the experience that they’re going to need to be great [next] season.”
A FRESH START
Short of winning a national championship, Harvard managed to accomplish almost everything a Boston-area hockey program could hope for in the 2016-2017 season—a Beanpot title, an Ivy League crown, ECAC regular season and playoff championships, and the school’s first Frozen Four appearance since 1994.
After the historic season finally ended at the hands of tournament runner-up Minnesota-Duluth, the Crimson graduated the highest-scoring senior class in the country and began 2017-2018 with the aim of fulfilling its own high expectations.
“Coming off the season that we did...the expectation is that you just kind of want to repeat that,” said tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen. “[2017-2018] was a reminder that what we did that year was not an easy thing to do, and it takes a lot of hard work.”
Preseason polls this year demonstrated exactly how high outside expectations were. Both the coaches’ and media polls projected Harvard as the top ECAC seed, while national rankings put the Crimson at No. 2/3— matching its highest USCHO position since the ranking system began in 1997—even without its dynamic class of 2017.
The spring prior, Harvard had chosen three captains for the first time in program history to guide the squad back to the Frozen Four. Madsen, Horton, and fourth-year forward Eddie Ellis would wear letters for the team.
“To be elected as a captain...means you have the respect of your teammates and your friends,” Ellis said. “To be elected captain after such a successful season by such an accomplished team even means all the more, for them to be able to trust me and [Horton] and [Madsen] to carry on that torch and that culture, and uphold that expectation. That was, personally, very humbling.”
A promising freshman class joined the Crimson, including two NHL draft picks in forward Jack Badini and defenseman Reilly Walsh. The new team tested the waters on Oct. 21 in an exhibition game against the United States National Team Development Program’s U-18 squad.
While the 7-2 Harvard victory meant nothing for the season in terms of points, some aspects of the game foreshadowed the season to come, such as Donato’s hat trick—completed less than five minutes into the second period—and offensive contributions from Walsh.
The yearly turnover was also happening behind the scenes, as younger players took on greater leadership roles.
“I learned a lot of things, freshman year, from those older guys,” said sophomore defenseman Adam Fox, who led all NCAA blue-liners in scoring in 2016-2017. “Coming in your second year, you kind of want to take on a bigger role…. I wanted to step up, and that was a focus coming in, trying to be more of a leader.”
A week later, the Crimson began its season in an unusual Sunday tilt against Ivy opponent Dartmouth and put on a clinic for a 5-0 win. This was Harvard at its best: a perfect save percentage from Madsen, execution on the power play, and a high-octane mentality even after taking the lead.
Freshman forward Henry Bowlby broke the ice, snagging his first collegiate goal before the halfway mark of the opening period. The Crimson carried the spark of its auspicious opener into the following weekend, when it played host to rivals Yale and Brown.
There, the team hit an unexpected stumbling block and fell, 5-2, to the Bulldogs for the first time in over a year, breaking a long stretch of undefeated play at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. When the tied contest grew heated, Harvard—normally one to play fast rather than physical—took one too many penalties, and Yale made the squad pay.
Such stumbles would frustrate the Crimson throughout the early portion of the season. As head coach Ted Donato ’91 put it in November and again after other tough losses, the team “beat [itself] to a certain extent.”
“Early on in the season, we found some ways to not end up with the result we wanted,” said coach Donato, reflecting on the season.
A shutout win against the Bears offered some consolation, with the offensive-minded Walsh notching his first two goals and cementing his slot beside Fox on the top power play unit. But with Brown dispatched, Harvard was set to face the most daunting stretch of its season: a program-record nine-game road stint that would keep the team away from home until 2018.
THE LONG ROAD
Granted, those nine games spanned two months and the holiday-season hiatus, so the Crimson did have some breathing room in between road series. Additionally, one tilt was just across the river at Boston College.
But November and December would still present Harvard with some of its most challenging opponents—as well as its most hostile venues—of the campaign. The fishy jeers of Cornell’s packed Lynah Rink, not to mention the team’s largest crowds of the season at Minnesota’s 3M Arena at Mariucci, made the road gauntlet that much more taxing.
Harvard was immediately put to the test against an underestimated Colgate squad. A tight contest ended in a 2-1 loss, chiefly at the hands of Raiders sophomore net-minder Colton Point who would once again punish the Crimson in late-January.
The very next night, the visitors suffered a heartbreaker against the Big Red, then ranked No. 14/12. A tense tie game was broken just 2.3 seconds before the final horn by Cornell senior defenseman Alec McCrea, sending Lynah into seventh heaven and handing the hosts a 3-2 win. Meanwhile, Harvard left frustrated and without a point on the weekend.
“[We played] at Minnesota twice, at Cornell, at BC, with a relatively young group,” Horton recalled. “And you’ve got to think that a lot of guys that were in our lineup this year, even though they weren’t freshmen academically, were pretty close to freshmen...in terms of their experience and their role in previous years.”
During Harvard-Yale weekend, the Crimson jetted to St. Paul, Minn., for a rare two-game matchup against the No. 6/7 Golden Gophers. The Crimson hoped to put a dent in  its all-time winless road record against Minnesota, but as was frustratingly characteristic on this roadie, the squad still fell short, first by a score of 4-2 and then 2-1 in overtime.
All the while, the team saw its place in the rankings slip until Harvard dropped out of the USCHO’s top 20 for the first time in 78 weeks. After the Crimson lost four straight games for the first time since Feb. 7, 2015, its record stood well below .500 by the time it faced then-No. 13/14 Boston College.
The Eagles had begun their season with a dismal 1-5-1 record in October, playing against only ranked teams, before completely reversing their fortunes and winning seven straight contests in November. The head-to-head resulted in a raucous 4-4 tilt that entertained audiences as much as it must have dismayed both coaching staffs.
For Harvard, the battle at Conte Forum closed out a November best left forgotten: the squad was outscored 15-20, and tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen, thought to be the runaway choice for starter after his stellar 2016-2017 campaign, was the owner of a disappointing .897 save percentage. Perhaps the only bright spot in the winless month was a career-best eight-game point streak for Donato (4–6—10), who led the team in scoring.
BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE THE CRIMSON
Harvard opened its December play with an impossible-to-miss difference. When the squad traveled to Quinnipiac and Princeton, the coaching staff chose to swap Madsen for junior backstop Michael Lackey, breaking the fourth-year’s 55-game start streak and giving rise to a goalie contest that would persist through the end of the season.
The change energized the squad as much as it gave Madsen a chance to rest and reset. For the first time all year, the Crimson cruised to back-to-back triumphs as it defeated the Bobcats, 6-2, and then prevailed over the Tigers, 5-2.
“The two-game sweep right before our break...set the tone for what we could become as a team in the second half [of the season],” coach Donato said.
Though the team still owned a sub-.500 record, it looked like the Harvard group that most people, including and especially the players in the locker room, expected ahead of the campaign.
Entering the December break, Lackey was named ECAC Goaltender of the Week, and offensive playmakers such as Donato, junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage, and Walsh were marking up the scoresheet.
Donato tallied his second career hat trick against Quinnipiac, and Walsh’s scoring burst seemed to arrive at the perfect time, as the Crimson would be missing the dynamic talents of Fox for the last weekend of December. The sophomore sported the red, white, and blue at the World Junior Championships for the second year in a row, this time donning the “A” as well for the bronze-medal team.
Fox or no Fox, Harvard split its Catamount Cup contests against UMass Lowell and UVM. The first matchup resulted in a 5-2 loss, while the latter was a 4-1 victory on the back of yet another Donato hat trick. The junior’s whopping eight tallies in four December bouts earned him national Player of the Month awards and extended his scoring streak to 12 games. More importantly, perhaps, it also helped propel the Crimson to .500 in conference play.
“We started to figure it out, find an identity, close to Christmas,” Horton said. “We go home for break, come back with a hiccup in the [Catamount Cup], and then we begin to start slowly building up.”
“Building up” is exactly what happened. January marked a welcome return to the friendly ice of Bright-Landry, and Harvard played host to Union and RPI. Madsen turned over a new leaf against the Engineers, stymying the visitors for his 10th career shutout, 50th win, and a 3-0 victory. Bowlby played spoiler against the Dutchmen in a 4-3 overtime win, scoring the tying goal as well as the sudden-death winner.
The two wins weren’t the only happy news for Crimson fans as they rung in 2018. On New Year’s Day, Donato, in addition to former captain and defender Noah Welch ’05, was named to the Team USA Olympic roster. For Harvard, however, Donato’s February departure would mean the loss of its top point-getter and goal scorer. For the next few weeks the Crimson would have to prepare for the void left by his absence.
Harvard completed its sweep of Princeton and tied both RPI and Quinnipiac before heading up to the “North Country.” Between ECAC bottom-dweller St. Lawrence and then-No. 2 Clarkson, the latter was the obvious competition, but both contests were close.
The Golden Knights wreaked havoc in a 6-6 contest which featured an avalanche of goals that all net-minders involved probably would have liked back. The following evening, a three-point night from Zerter-Gossage and an OT winner from rookie Badini vaulted the Crimson past the Saints, 4-3, giving the team three of four points on the weekend. The squad’s dramatic turnaround had yielded a respectable 8-3-3 conference record.
But ahead lay a home double-gamer against Colgate and Cornell, teams that had frustrated Harvard back in November. Two formidable foes awaited in net: Point for the Raiders, and Big Red freshman Matthew Galajda, critical pieces in shutting down the Crimson earlier in the season.
Unfortunately for Harvard, revenge was not in the cards. Despite outshooting opponents by an incredible 86-49 margin, the Crimson was held entirely off the scoreboard that weekend, falling 3-0 to Cornell and 2-0 to Colgate. A 4-1 win at Dartmouth the next weekend, though it provided some redemption for Madsen in net, did little to dispel the frustration of a season sweep at the hands of both upstate New York teams.
Suddenly, the goaltending question seemed all the more urgent, and Donato’s trip to South Korea was looming. There was no time to sit and ponder these concerns, however. It was February, and that means Beanpot season.
HOME STRETCH
In a rematch of last year’s Beanpot final that handed Harvard its first title in 24 years, the team headed to TD Garden to face Boston University. In some respects, the local hockey classic means as much to coaches and teams as a Frozen Four appearance does, and the Crimson’s desire to repeat as champions clashed with the Terriers’ desire to avenge 2017’s 6-3 defeat.
The teams were an even match for most of the contest—and it was certainly a long contest, with the confident net-minders keeping play going into a second overtime frame. Harvard, however, hadn’t scored on 15 straight man-advantage opportunities, and failure to cash in on those chances inevitably led to heartbreak. A seemingly innocuous shot beat an otherwise solid Madsen, and the door shut on the Crimson’s Beanpot defense.
Offensive worries compounded when Donato departed and Harvard fell, 3-1, to Union between Beanpot matchups. The early part of the Beanpot consolation game against Boston College seemed just as lackluster, despite sophomore backstop Cam Gornet making a surprise start—his first. But then, the action ramped up.
A 1-1 tie became a 4-2 Crimson lead, only to be snuffed out by Eagles rookie forward Logan Hutsko, who completed his hat trick in less than 12 minutes to bring the score to 4-4. Senior forward Seb Lloyd, though, played the hero for Harvard, scoring early in the extra frame to secure third place in the tournament.
“Personally, it turned out to be my last collegiate goal,” said Lloyd, looking back on the memory fondly. “It was a nice way to end my Beanpot career, but also [it was] a big win for the team in overtime. That’s something I’ll remember for a long time.”
As the senior class skated away from its final Beanpot, more lasts lay ahead. For senior weekend, the Crimson hosted St. Lawrence and Clarkson, looking to end the fourth-years’ time at the Bright on a high note and clinch an ECAC tournament bye. What followed was a pair of contests characteristic of Harvard home hockey.
“[Donato] is obviously an unbelievable part of our team,” Zerter-Gossage said. “[But] when he wasn’t there and everybody stood up and had a good stretch, it was good to see what everybody could bring to the table when they had the opportunity. I thought that was special.”
Adam Fox hadn’t tallied a single goal so far in the 2017-2018 season. But when it rains, it pours, so Fox notched his first career hat trick against the Saints, the first trio of tallies by a Crimson defenseman since 2011. Lackey was particularly sharp in net, keeping out every St. Lawrence attempt en route to a 5-0 Harvard win.
The momentum stayed with the hosts against the then-No. 7 Golden Knights. The power play fired on all cylinders and Madsen redeemed his January performance in a 5-2 Senior Night victory, the team’s most complete game of the season.
“Getting home ice and a bye is not an easy thing in our league,” coach Donato said. “I thought our guys handled that pretty well.”
With a conference playoff bye in hand, the Crimson prepared to close the season out at Brown and Yale, adding Olympian Donato to an already surging team.
But the Bears stunned a disjointed Crimson squad, 6-4, and a raucous night at the Whale witnessed the Bulldogs complete their sweep of Harvard after a goalie duel ended 2-1 in the Elis’ favor. The Crimson would have to settle for fourth seed in the ECAC after winning the Cleary Cup the year before.
NOTHING PLACID ABOUT IT
Having trained through the bye week, Harvard opened its Whitelaw Cup defense against familiar Ivy foe, fifth-seeded Dartmouth. The Big Green had defeated St. Lawrence in three games, and stormed into Cambridge with a noticeable jump. Senior goaltender Devin Buffalo had suffered much at the hands of the Crimson in the regular season, but his glove was hot—a fact that showed in Dartmouth’s decisive 4-1 win in game one. Harvard’s offensive surges met unflinching resistance in the Big Green’s defense, and the hosts could only resolve to be better in game two.
“Once again, for a lot of these guys going into playoffs and Placid, it was the first time they’d played in the games themselves or had significant roles in the games,” Horton said.
For the first time, the Crimson had more than just honor on the line—a game two loss would mean the end of the 2017-2018 season. But luckily for Harvard fans, the squad stepped up to the plate, scoring four times in the second frame for a 7-1 drubbing of Dartmouth. The message was clear: coach Donato’s group was far from finished.
In game three, a hat trick from none other than Donato and a two-point night from Fox powered the Crimson to the ECAC semifinals for the fourth consecutive year, meaning not a single athlete on the Harvard roster had ever missed the tournament in Lake Placid.

Yet, with the NCAA Tournament in sight, the Crimson stumbled at the hands of Clarkson, and just like that, the 2017-2018 season with all its highs and lows was over.
“It’s definitely the end of the season regardless of how it ends,” said Horton, when asked about the toughest part of that ECAC semifinal contest. “But when you a blow a lead...with those stakes, I remember sitting at the hotel after the game...just staring blankly and just saying, ‘how?’ That’s all I could keep saying to myself. Just, ‘how?’”
WHAT NEXT?
Harvard has now said goodbye to one of its winningest senior classes and closed the book on a fairytale Donato season and career.
“It didn’t [end up] being exactly what we wanted,” Horton said. “But for me, looking back on it all, it was a lot of success for our class over the four years. We’d have liked to make another run at it in the tournament, but going to Lake Placid four years in a row isn’t shabby either.”
In many ways, though, the team’s offseason retooling will be akin to 2017’s. Once again, the Crimson will have to replace its top-line center—perhaps sophomore winger Ty Pelton-Byce will find himself taking opening faceoffs, as he manned the middle of the ice quite ably during Donato’s Olympic sabbatical.
Sophomore John Marino seems poised to take over fourth-year Wiley Sherman’s role as primary shutdown defenseman, but if Harvard wants to replicate Sherman’s formidable 6’7” presence, it will need to look further. The team’s offensive-minded defenders, at least, are locked into place. Walsh and Fox will continue to have significant roles and anchor the top power play unit—Fox confirmed in March that he would not be joining the NHL’s Calgary Flames next year and would continue with the Crimson instead.
Madsen’s record-breaking career leaves a vacancy in net, too. Presumably, Lackey will find himself in that position, with Gornet backing him up. If Harvard’s faithful have learned anything this season, however, it’s that coach Donato is unafraid to reward merit between the pipes, even if it means benching his number-one backstop.
Before next year, though, comes this summer, a season devoted to recovery and training. Some players skate on their own in the offseason, while others will remain in Cambridge, fine-tuning aspects of their own game.
Come October, the curtain will rise on a new season, and even though the class of 2018 will no longer be suiting up at the Bright, its members will be cheering from afar.
“I said this last year, and I still stand by it,” Horton said without hesitation. “Harvard will win a national championship before [the class of 2020] graduates.”

"Look around, bro," Lil Yachty tells KYLE in the conversation that opens "iSpy." So look around, Harvard student! Come Friday, the sun will be shining (probably, but don't trust New England weather), block parties will be popping, and you will be beautifully buzzed. What's not to love about a Yardfest that's not headed by an EDM artist? Now that you, the uncultured Wale/Lil Yachty initiate, know about the headliners, it's time to dive into their music. Doesn't the pregame start on Wednesday?

My Love (ft. Major Lazer, WizKid, Dua Lipa) // Wale
Okay, so the odds that Wale is bringing Major Lazer, Wizkid, and Dua Lipa in tow are...pretty low. But this track will totally smash your expectations about Wale. "My Love" is danceable and has a strong bassline, but it manages to sound chill and tropical at the same time. This is the kind of song you could get down to and kick back to.
One Night // Lil Yachty
This right here is the song that announced Lil Yachty's presence on the music scene, making him a star overnight. It's slow and almost mellow, but all the commitmentphobes on this campus will definitely relate to Yachty needing no wife.
Chillin // Wale
Picture this: you're strutting into the Yard, it's a lovely 70 degrees, and no one can touch you. Coolly perch your shades on your head and let the breeze tousle your hair. You're chillin'. Wale captures this mood like no one else.
Minnesota // Lil Yachty
It's impossible not to enjoy this song's zamboni-cruising music video, but "Minnesota" is a bop in itself. The catchy hook and piano melody will stick with you for hours after you're done listening.
Bait // Wale
"Bait" is the kind of song that will instantly compel you to put your drink down and get on the dance floor. This is a club bop, and who can't appreciate Wale's many shoutouts to his native D.C.?
