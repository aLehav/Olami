After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before my sophomore year, I was terrified of deciding what foreign language to take. The idea of learning a whole new form of human communication seemed daunting. After a lot of stress and searching, I eventually landed on Tigrinya, an East African language spoken by the Tigrayan ethnic group in Ethiopia and Eritrea.
But despite the loving faculty and incredible culture that I have come to know during my time taking Tigrinya, I’ve noticed that surprisingly few students enroll in the African Language Program.
The ALP deserves more fantastic students in its ranks. To all current Harvard undergraduates: Consider taking a course in an African language.
The African Language Program at Harvard University turns 20 years old this year. Throughout its short history, the ALP has provided instruction in more than 40 languages spoken on the African continent, offering more than 10 courses every semester that fulfill the foreign language requirement for Harvard undergraduates. These courses are essential to those specifically concentrating in the African Studies track of the Department of African and African American Studies, but also relate well to a variety of other areas of study and people on campus.
There’s only one problem: Students aren’t taking these courses. Last fall, the elementary courses in Igbo and Yoruba, two of the major languages spoken in Nigeria, had less than 10 students enrolled. Introductory Swahili only had seven students, despite being a language spoken in over more than 14 countries across Africa and the Middle East. And I myself was one of only three students in elementary Tigrinya.
These small enrollment numbers obscure the fact that the African Language Program is directly relevant to Harvard’s purpose. One of the missions of a liberal arts education is to familiarize students with other cultures that aren’t their own. At Harvard, it’s easy to center languages that have always been at the forefront of Western higher learning. This historical precedent is apparent in the fact that the only language placement exams Harvard centrally administers are French, German, Italian, and Spanish. But the University has become more and more diverse over the last century, so students should move away from this precedent.
Harvard does not have to be a place that only values and encourages learning about Western history — it is just as important to learn about the African diaspora.
One of the most unique learning experiences you will get in the African Language Program is Theater Night. Each semester, students in every ALP course are required to participate in a performance of their choosing. For my first Theater Night, my two wonderful classmates and I did a Tigrinya rendition of “Little Red Riding Hood.” It’s an event unique to the ALP that brings people together through cultural food, arts, and warm welcomes from various people in the department.
Beyond Theater Night, I was taken care of in my first introductory course. As a foreigner with no direct attachments to Tigray, my instructor was patient with me. He walked me through the Tigrinya variation of the Ge’ez alphabet, a script which originated as a consonant-only alphabet that is now used for several Afro-Asiatic and Nilo-Saharan languages. Although I was going at a snail’s pace, my instructor consistently checked on my confidence in the material being covered. Before I knew it, I was able to butcher pronunciations of words, name body parts, and even tell time in Tigrinya.
If you are worried about not having a connection to the culture, do not fear. You will be welcomed with care by the African Language Program.
While I am a generational African American student, I also understand the extra hesitancy of white students who decide to take courses in African and African American studies. Coming into these spaces, it may feel like courses in ethnic studies are geared only toward students of their respective identities. However, white students who decide to pursue non-white language and ethnic studies are not accessing knowledge or occupying territory in which they aren’t welcome. The opposite is the case. I encourage more white students to explore, perhaps for the first time, brand new perspectives that they can learn a thing or two from.
If you’re a rising sophomore on the fence about what language to take at Harvard, you should consider joining the ALP. More new students in the department is exciting, and more engagement gives the program the chance to enhance existing events as well as make way for brand new traditions. By choosing to take an African language, you are affirming that this scholarship matters.
In the words of the program’s director, John M. Mugane: “A serious understanding of Africa begins with language study.” More students learning indigenous African languages, including those without prior connections to Africa, strengthens the intellectual soul of our University.
Learning an African language is deeper than learning some words — it’s about broadening our sense of which cultures can nurture our development as scholars and people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With such highlights as a ceiling panel falling in the Harvard Square stop, impatient parents in town for junior family weekend, and Harvard employees arriving late for work, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority seems to be the architect of nuisance for many Harvard affiliates.
But Harvard is not the biggest casualty. Our predicaments are only shallow reflections of a much deeper — and more literal — trainwreck for Massachusetts residents.
Across the state and over the last year, MBTA users have unfortunately become well acquainted with a train on fire, sparks and explosions, line shutdowns, newly imposed slow zones to protect vulnerable tracks, and even a passenger death — with not an end in sight.
Boston residents do not deserve these tragedies; they deserve a robust, accessible, and safe transit system. The benefits of such a system are plentiful: community connections for students like us, more movement outside immediate neighborhoods for residents, less congestion on busy roads, reduced air pollution, increased commuter productivity as hands are freed from the wheel — we could go on.
The ideal T would embody mobility justice: enabling people of all races, backgrounds, and abilities to feel safe in our streets.
Instead, transit fares are regressive — meaning fares constitute a larger proportion of income from low-income commuters, who make up 29 percent of T users, in comparison to their wealthier counterparts — and transport can be difficult to access during chilly Massachusetts winters. To solve these inequities, the T should implement fare-free or reduced fare allowances, as well as bus stops with overhead shelters to protect against harsh weather conditions.
The current sorry state of the T points to local and state governments seemingly having put the need for an equitable and secure transit system on the back burner — despite their earlier promises.
Last year, Massachusetts voters, in alignment with our own Editorial Board’s stance, passed the “Fair Share Amendment” to invest a projected $2 billion in taxes on the wealthy into transit and education. Governor Maura T. Healey ’92 recognized this majority will of the people in her inaugural address, when she pledged to allocate a portion of her first budget towards hiring 1,000 MBTA workers — but last month, her administration did not provide this funding in the state budget, saying that the T was already allocated the money last year. We ask Governor Healey to recommit to revitalizing public transit in our state.
One way to reinvigorate the T is by redesigning its management structure to focus more on the payment of workers and staffers. We support the proposal made by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 to add a Boston-specific seat to the MBTA’s board; we hope this new board member will be able to successfully change the MBTA’s priorities from the inside.
Our recent MBTA woes are not new. But we, as residents, should not accept a dysfunctional system. We need the T to get its trains back on track.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“A true humanist.” That’s what they said she was — or at least, what they said about her college application. Perhaps it was how she found comfort in the absurdism of Camus’ The Stranger, or her intrigue in the Tajik Persian language, or intention to address American isolationism by creating culturally-sensitive translation technologies. Compassionate and introspective, she appeared to be a talented writer.
***
This “she” is me. Or a version of me, reconstructed through my Winter 2018 Harvard application, my preparatory notes for my alumni interview, and my recollections from interviewer and application reviewer comments (which students can request to see via the Registrar). And indeed, I recall being a language nerd in high school, a passion that spilled into computational linguistics, writing, and an ambition to “enhance global communication” (a phrase courtesy of my writing supplement).
I think of this because a few days ago, Harvard sent out regular-decision acceptances for the Class of 2027. Welcome, and congratulations! I’d love to chat with you, if you have a moment.
It’s safe to say you have left a stellar impression on the entity that is Harvard Admissions™️ — a coherent semblance of your specific passions to change the world and your potential as a future leader that Harvard College would like to nurture.
But I hope you don’t feel beholden to that impression. As a social senior, I reflect on how many of my classmates swapped out their stated passions: art for technology, neuroscience for economics. I myself dropped Linguistics following a high-school career spent on that topic (I thought I could get enthused by semantics, but couldn’t).
And so, I want to say that it is okay to depart from the identity you applied to college with, since the admissions process often pressures us to craft identities that may fail to reflect who we really are or who we’ll become.
If you found a true calling in high school and genuinely expressed it in your application, that’s great! Still, the competitiveness of college admissions has skyrocketed in recent years, with historically-low acceptance rates and historically-high volumes of applications. These days, it seems crucial to be a specialist and to market yourself based on those specialities — “distinguishing excellences,” as one college consultant puts it, to stand out.
So admissions offices seem to notice those already on a mission. (Or those who can afford to package themselves in a palatable manner: In a survey of my social class, 18.6 percent reported receiving help from a private college counselor, and a whopping 53.4 percent of those students reported a combined family income of at least $250,000).
Thus, the college application process may pressure us into amplifying our interests into larger-than-life identities. For me? I did love personal essays and computation-like patterns in the Japanese language (due to teen angst and an anime obsession). But my family encouraged a lot of my achievements because they’d stoke the flames of my side-hobbies into a marketable brand.
It’s the chicken-and-egg problem: Even now, I wonder which came first, the activities or the passion.
So I hope you give yourself the grace to keep, and let go of, parts of the passions you came to us with. Because over the course of your time in college, you simply might change! Indeed, Harvard strongly encourages first-years to explore a breadth of fields through its diverse freshman seminars and its collection of introductory classes, including the famous computer science course CS50 (which advertises how two-thirds of its students have never taken CS before).
But it may be tough to internalize the idea that it’s okay to switch passions when the admissions process conditioned us to repeatedly assert our commitment to a path that may have merged with our sense of identity. (Just think of 2018 Vanessa, who put “absolutely certain” on her application when asked how definite her academic plans would be). This toughness may become more discomfiting if you encounter prodigies in beginner classes, who then are highlighted for their excellence — a sense I got after taking CS50 (which then led me to panic about software internships and attempt to honor my claimed affinity for computation before I finally admitted I’d rather write than code).
This discussion of the admissions process may broaden to how we encourage exploration of new passions after setting foot on campus. While Harvard values its liberal arts education, as evinced by its General Education program, I’ve occasionally felt discouraged from multidisciplinarity. I sometimes feel “too soft” for intense CS culture at the SEC, or “not deep enough” for the artsy Englishness at the Barker Center. When I earnestly asked about a CS and English joint degree, I was warned that I’d need to come up with a clear approach to bridge these disparate fields.
Prioritizing specialists stifles intellectual curiosity and our collective potential to help the world, particularly when complex problems may require jack-of-all-trade solutions (I think of the social, political, and technical complexities embedded in issues of racist technology). And so, I hope you consider the new double-concentration option, which seems like an approachable way to challenge the specialist mold — without a thesis requirement (and the imposter syndrome).
***
Right now, perhaps you’re very sure of your excitement for your intended concentration(s) — or perhaps you’re not sure at all. Regardless, you have ample time to discover your spaces of fulfillment at Harvard, as we all eventually do.
Anyway, in a 2021 Pew Research Center study, 79 percent of American college graduates said their education was extremely or very useful for personal and intellectual growth, whereas 65 percent said it’d be useful for developing workplace-relevant skills and knowledge. So how we grow as humans is perhaps the most important part of entering Harvard.
***
As a social senior, I enjoy reflecting on what has or hasn’t changed from my application self. Like how I dropped Linguistics but was still excited about Japanese to get a language citation. Or how I still am a calming force amongst my lovely friends (like the character Shiro in Voltron). Or how I said I didn’t like poetry, but embraced it in my gap year and even got to read my work with a youth poet laureate last week. Or how I hope that I was, am, and will be a warm, thoughtful, and intellectually curious person.
Regardless of how we change concentrations or other life trajectories, we’re always discovering — or rediscovering – parts of ourselves along the way. And I hope you decide to do that here at Harvard.
Best wishes,
Vanessa

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Award-winning author Ruth Ozeki discussed her works of fiction, writing techniques, and the different elements of Buddhism that inspire her style on Thursday evening.
The discussion was hosted by the Mahindra Humanities Center as part of the “Writers Speak” event series and featured Ozeki — a novelist, filmmaker, Zen Buddhist priest, and professor of Humanities at Smith College — in conversation with Meng Jin ’11, a visiting lecturer in the English Department and author of the multi-nominated novel “Little Gods.”
Ozeki kicked off the event by reading a passage from her latest novel “The Book of Form and Emptiness,” which follows the story of a boy who hears inanimate objects and was awarded the United Kingdom’s 2022 Women’s Prize for Fiction.
“I shouldn’t be surprised that the writer of a novel about inanimate objects is able to animate her reading so lovely,” Jing said following the reading.
Jing also raised attention to the “strange form” of Ozeki’s latest novel, which incorporates the Buddhist element of emptiness and is related to suffering, according to Ozeki.
“Emptiness is one of those concepts that is hard to visualize or wrap your head around. But the image that I like, and I think it works pretty well — it’s an image if you can imagine emptiness as being just a vast, vast ocean,” Ozeki said. “An endless ocean of emptiness, so enormous that there’s no horizon and there’s no edge to it.”
Ozeki, who explained that many people turn to Buddhism after experiencing suffering, said she became interested in Buddhism while watching her parents age. She said she learned to cope with these life changes and her new responsibility of being their caretaker at a young age through practicing Buddhism and meditation.
“I’m not sure I would still be writing if I weren’t also practicing Buddhism. There was something in that practice that keeps me engaged with the kinds of questions that make me want to write,” Ozeki said.
“It also helps me with things like patience. I’m not a very patient person by nature — I’m actually a very impatient person — but meditation teaches you patience,” she added.
During the event, an audience member asked Ozeki’s opinion on the new digital age, which led to a reflection on readers’ different interpretations of her writing through things like fanfiction.
“I know that there has been fanfiction that’s written with characters in my books, and I haven’t read it because I have my own experience with them,” Ozeki said.
Still, Ozeki acknowledged that others interact with her stories differently and expressed appreciation for her readers.
“Every reader has their experience of it, and if that’s how a reader wants to respond, then it’s not my business to object,” Ozeki said, “except to be grateful that they read the book and have been interested — which I am.”

Vico Style, a vintage fashion startup that opened last month, aims to help customers “be sustainably bougie on a budget,” according to its founder.
Located on the corner of 73 Mount Auburn St., the Harvard Square location is currently the only permanent Vico Style storefront, but another is set to open in Boston later this month, according to founder Cecilia Hermawan.
Hermawan said the idea for the store emerged from her own “pain point,” as she often purchased secondhand goods to save money while completing her MBA as a single parent.
“I learned that I had to be better with my money because I had to pay for my own tuition. So as a result, I started consuming secondhand goods,” Hermawan said.
Hermawan, who worked for nearly a decade in fashion in the Boston area prior to launching Vico Style, said she decided to start her own business after falling in love with a vintage Irish tweed cape.
“I caught the startup bug,” Hermawan said. “I am not going to wake up when I’m 50 and regret I’m not doing something that I’m passionate about.”
According to Hermawan, the collection of clothing will be rotated every three weeks given the store’s size restrictions. The location has just 200 square feet for selling space, Hermawan said, adding that each set will have its own “vibe.”
“Right now, we have grandparents-core, which is kind of like your grandpa’s blazer type of vibe and your grandmother’s florals and pearls,” Hermawan said. The next collection will feature bright, “dopamine dressing” clothing, with colors like fuschia and aqua.
“Curation is a big part of what we do,” Hermawan added.
Vico Style also offers a subscription service, Hermawan said. Each quarter, the business ships boxes to subscribers containing pieces catered to “life stage.”
“What are you looking for? Are you graduating or you’re about to have internships or whatever it may be? Do you hate animal prints? Do you like textured stuff or mostly solid?” Hermawan said. “We tailor that specifically to you.”
Hermawan said the startup gathers information on customers’ buying habits, with plans to train a machine learning algorithm with the data to “curate really personalized selections that could scale.”
Customers said they were drawn to the Harvard Square storefront by its unique selection and affordability.
“It looks like all the clothing pieces are special and unique,” said customer Emma C. O’Malley ’26. “Someone else you see on the street wouldn’t have the same clothes.”
“I’ve been really into sustainable fashion, vintage stuff these days. And I noticed that they opened and the clothes looked really cute.” Haesung Jee ’23-’24 said, adding that the shop was “welcoming” and “affordable.”
“I feel like a lot of vintage shops in Cambridge, sometimes they really mark up their prices,” Nayleth E. Lopez-Lopez ’23 said.
“You don’t want to try something on, love it, and then not be able to buy it,” Lopez-Lopez added.
Jasdeep K. Gurm ’26, who went to the store on its opening day, wrote in a message that the “vibes” at Vico Style are “immaculate.”
“All of the items were great quality and really reasonably priced! I loved their selection of vintage purses and jewelry,” Gurm wrote.

The Harvard Graduate Council on Monday elected Harvard Extension School student Brett A. Monson as president, marking the first time the Council’s leader will hail from the University’s continuing education division, according to HGC records.
The HGC is a student government body that represents the University’s 12 graduate and professional schools. Monson will work alongside Idongesit Sampson from the Harvard School of Public Health, who was elected vice president.
Monson ran against four other candidates — Harvard Divinity School student Keisha L. Bush, graduate student Janan Iranbomy, HES student Mir Jahanzeb “M.J.” Mehdi, and Harvard Medical School student Arya S. Rao — and won by a simple majority of the 11 schools present. Representatives from the Medical School were absent from the meeting and did not vote in the election.
“My curiosity helps me connect with different cohorts of students,” Monson wrote in an email. “It is rewarding to see conversations during HGC meetings about law, medicine, technology innovation all happening within our group.”
The only vice president candidate who did not also run for president, Sampson wrote that she will continue to promote the idea of a “‘One Harvard’ community.”
According to outgoing president Carlos A. Gonzalez Sierra, the size of the executive board of the Council decreased from 14 to seven seats this year. The council is instead delegating tasks to additional committees formed by school representatives.
“Every executive position, with the exception of the president, will lead in a committee starting next year,” he said.
Mehdi, the previous finance chair, failed to win a majority vote, leaving the position vacant until another election round in the fall.
Harvard Business School student Yilun “Bill” Ding was elected as the new programming chair against HDS student Maria M. Dueñas Lopez.
The election of candidates all from different schools was a “huge step” in the direction of increased involvement across all the graduate schools, according to Monson.
“This year, huge strides have been made for in-person experiences to be restored post COVID-19, and we are looking at ways to heighten engagement even more,” Monson wrote.
According to Gonzalez Sierra, Monson and Sampson’s “different personalities and skillsets” provide opportunities for future collaboration.
“They always show up for HGC and for students, and I can always count on them to volunteer and lead a new initiative for the Council,” he said. “And that’s one of the qualities that I appreciated the most from them.”
Sampson wrote that shared goals and working experience will allow for stronger collaboration on projects.
“Brett and I have had the opportunity to represent our respective schools and work together at HGC over the past year,” Sampson wrote. “With our similar interests, mutual respect, and shared vision for the University and the HGC, I believe we will make a great team.”
According to Monson, the Council must tear down the walls between the largely independent graduate schools to allow for more collaboration.
“Sometimes our greatest strength can also be our strongest weakness,” Monson wrote. “We have a lot of incredible individualized schools and programs at Harvard, and HGC has the challenge of breaking down silos to foster inter-school networking between them all.”

Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital researchers found a correlation between Covid-19 infection contracted during pregnancy and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in a paper published last month.
The paper, published on March 23 in JAMA Network Open, examined more than 18,000 health records of infants born in Massachusetts during the pandemic. Roughly 880 of their mothers had tested positive for Covid-19 during pregnancy. The researchers followed up with the cohort post-delivery and found that in utero exposure to Covid-19 was linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as speech and motor delays.
Specifically, the study found that male infants are 90 percent more likely to experience speech and motor delays than their female counterparts, according to study co-author Andrea G. Edlow.
Edlow, an associate professor at HMS and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at MGH, said the discrepancy between male and female infants is “multifactorial” and can depend both on genetics and environment.
“The male fetus in general has increased fragility in utero compared to the female fetus,” she said. “For example, a male and a female neonate born prematurely at the same age — the male will have an increased risk of mortality.”
Previous studies have established that exposure to other viruses such as influenza during pregnancy is correlated with neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The onset of the pandemic in 2020 prompted researchers at HMS and MGH to investigate whether Covid-19 infection would pose a similar risk.
The researchers believe the neurodevelopmental disorders may be attributable to the activation of the mother’s immune system during infection.
“It’s that factor, more than any specific virus or bacterial infection, that can result in these later neurodevelopmental outcomes in children or offspring,” Edlow said.
Still, the relationship between the severity of illness and its impact on neurodevelopmental risk has yet to be studied. According to co-author Roy H. Perlis, Psychiatry professor at HMS and director of the Center for Quantitative Health at MGH, dividing the births into groups based on the intensity of infection would require a substantially larger amount of data for accurate statistical analysis.
“Though 18,000 is the largest cohort that we’re aware of to date, even that size of cohort doesn’t allow us to tease apart those finer points,” Edlow added.
Edlow and Perlis said the long-term implications of the study remain unclear, and further observation is necessary to determine whether these disorders have lasting effects on children. The researchers plan to follow the cohort of children over time by tracking their electronic health records.
“A really important aspect of the study is going to be understanding not just how these children look at 12 months or 18 months, but coming to see how they look at two years and three years and five years and so forth,” Perlis said. “Now that we’ve established this cohort, we can continue to follow them over time.”
Edlow said pregnant women and children have historically been understudied in medical research, and this research is often underfunded.
“One of the best ways that we can help vulnerable, understudied populations is by performing research on them and including them in research,” she said.

Students, faculty, and affiliates across Harvard’s campus came together on the first day of spring for Nowruz, a celebration of the beginning of Persian New Year, during an event hosted by Harvard Iranian Student Association March 25.
Nowruz, a Farsi word that translates to “new day” in English, is traditionally celebrated on the spring equinox by cultures in South and Central Asia and the Middle East.
Janan Iranbomy, president of the Harvard GSAS Iranian Students Association and chair of student advocacy and engagement of the Harvard Graduate Council, described this year’s Nowruz planning as “a reset” after the Covid-19 pandemic. This event, which was held in Lehman Hall, sold out at 150 attendees.
“It’s maybe time to set a new precedent and one that can hopefully be a good one to continue in future years,” Iranbomy said.
The event included an introductory address by Iranbomy and performances by a band from Berklee College of Music and pianist Helia Kamal, a fifth-year graduate student studying Physics.
Harvard Law School professor Sabrineh Ardalan wrote that Nowruz is the “main holiday” her family celebrates, adding that she brought her daughter to the celebration.
“The gathering on campus was a wonderful way to honor a tradition that is thousands of years old and bring together Harvard community members to celebrate,” Ardalan wrote in an email.
Ardalan wrote that it was “especially important” for her to attend the celebration because of its dedication to the “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement in Iran. Protesters around the globe began chanting the phrase last fall following the death of Jîna “Mahsa” Aminî, a Kurdish woman who died after being arrested by Iran’s “morality police” for wearing her hijab too loosely.
“The rallying cry of Women, Life, Freedom chanted by protesters following her death has reverberated around the world, and it is critical that events on campus continue to raise awareness about it,” Ardalan wrote in an email.
Understanding the movement’s impact on Iranian women living in the country and abroad, Kamal said it was important to include the campaign in Nowruz this year.
“We couldn’t possibly have this event without mentioning the Woman, Life, Freedom movement in Iran,” Kamal said. “It has affected us to such a huge extent.”
Iranbomy said “one of the biggest takeaways” from the event was that many people wanted to take part in “promoting this cohesive cultural diversity.”
For Kamal, the Harvard Iranian Student Association provides a space that acts as a “second family away from home.”
“Being able to come together with other Iranians on this day and not be alone meant a lot,” she said.
According to Kamal, a goal of this year’s celebration was “to send that message of hope to all Iranians who are celebrating across the globe and hoping for a better future.”
“It’s very important for us to come together on this day, especially this year, with everything that has been going on, in the hopes of a new beginning and better days to come for our country,” she said.

A previous of this article incorrectly stated that Helia Kamal was a first-year graduate student. In fact, she is a fifth-year graduate student.

Author and 2020 MacArthur “Genius Grant” recipient Tressie McMillan Cottom discussed Black identity, pop culture, and restrictions on women’s rights during a talk at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Thursday evening.
Radcliffe Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin spoke with McMillan Cottom for the 2023 installment of the Kim and Judy Davis Dean’s Lecture in the Social Sciences. The lecture series annually invites a leading public figure in the social sciences to engage in a conversation about their ideas and perspectives.
McMillan Cottom, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, discussed her 2019 book, “Thick and Other Essays,” explaining that she approached each essay as a comparison of generational experiences.
Near the conclusion of the book’s titular essay, McMillan Cottom described this process as asking, “Why me and not my grandmother?”
“For all of its sociological realities, Black life in America today is inherently better than it has ever historically been. And yet, it is still empirically, cumulatively, structurally unequal,” McMillan Cottom said during the lecture. “And I try to hold both of those realities.”
“I try to recognize that my grandmother quite literally could not imagine my life,” she added. “And at the same time, she could absolutely imagine my choices.”
Connecting the themes of her essays to conversations about Black identity, McMillan Cottom said it is important to understand that identity and experience evolve with time and circumstance.
“My definition of Blackness is not the only one,” McMillan Cottom said. “We can’t own it. It’s not property to own; it can really only be shared.”
“I also think there’s room for us to honor the parts of the Black experience that are unique to where we came from, without dishonoring any other version of Blackness,” she added.
Brown-Nagin steered the conversation to pop culture and aesthetics, a central theme of McMillan Cottom’s work, asking McMillan Cottom about a recent TikTok ban over a post discussing blonde hair as a racial status signifier.
“Blonde is not a hair color, it is a signifier of a type of person,” McMillan Cottom said in a TikTok response to another user. “And they never want to talk about that.”
Her post led some users to mass report her TikTok account, resulting in a temporary ban from the platform. McMillan Cottom subsequently wrote a column piece for the New York Times on the controversy titled, “The Enduring, Invisible Power of Blond.”
“They reacted so strongly, I think, precisely because it is talking plainly about the aesthetics of power,” McMillan Cottom said in her Thursday talk, adding that these aesthetics are essential to understanding social power dynamics.
McMillan Cottom said people reinforce social hierarchies like racism, patriarchy, and classism in their everyday interactions — like the initial TikTok post on blondeness that she responded to.
“I think that we are uncomfortable with realizing that that’s what we have done, especially when you have — in the case of white guilt and racism — an entire system designed to make you feel blameless,” she added.
Brown-Nagin asked McMillan Cottom to reflect on how Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned federal abortion protections — would affect the status of women in the United States.
McMillan Cottom said the decision represents a larger effort to confine women to “the private sphere,” linking the new abortion restrictions to legislation banning gender-affirming care and privatizing education — describing the latter as a means of shifting educational responsibilities to women.
“I think that that is tied to our idea of reinstating the idea of biological gender being a governing public policy,” McMillan Cottom said. “All of these are connected, to my mind, as an all-out war on women in the public sphere.”
Ultimately, McMillan Cottom said, she feared these new laws would constrain women’s economic decision-making and social participation.
“You cannot participate in public life, when the definition of you as an autonomous citizen is negotiated state border by state border,” she said.
McMillan Cottom’s lecture also explored curriculum censorship, changing technology, and social media, and their societal implications.
At the end of her talk, McMillan Cottom fielded questions from the audience. In response to a question on navigating institutions, she acknowledged that Black women can feel additional burdens in their academic and professional lives.
“You keep the parts you love, the great library, the wonderful books, the great ideas,” McMillan Cottom said. “I don’t think you need to take the places that tell you, ‘You shouldn’t speak that way.”
This comment resonated with lecture attendee LaShyra T. Nolen, a dual-degree student at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Kennedy School.
“I think being a Black woman navigating Harvard, the last comment that she shared, when you come into these institutions, you take what you need and what you don’t, that is how I approach my every day,” Nolen said.
“There’s so much good that comes with being in this space, but there’s a lot of heaviness as well,” Nolen added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a crowd that started off the game screaming “Go Fish!”, its constituents ended the match playing a very different game: dodgeball. Electrifying weekend sets between Harvard and Penn State led to amazing plays on the court and free-flying balls off of it –– as onlookers dodged rogue high-speed torpedoes deflected from the action.
Rolling into the Malkin Athletic Center on Friday night, the Crimson (7-13, 0-6 EIVA) found themselves up against one of their toughest opponents yet.
Penn State (20-3, 6-0 EIVA) has yet to lose a conference game –– not only this season but in the past two years. The Lions are currently #3 in the nation for Division I men’s volleyball and briefly snatched the #1 spot last week before a close loss to Ohio State (16-9, 8-3 MIVA) brought them back down.
Though Harvard has often been able to hold their own, even coming off a 3-0 win against American International College (2-20) last week, the conference season has been a bit of a rough go for the team. Crimson has yet to win against a conference team and was swept by Pepperdine (14-10, 4-4 MPSF), #7 in the nation, in mid-March.
Against a team four spots higher in the rankings compared to their former sweepers, the Crimson’s prospects looked a little bit bleak. An unfortunate start to the game for Harvard reflected this, as the Crimson fell behind 10-5 from the get-go; Penn State’s dominance on the attack racked up a streak of points only offset by the occasional service error and the errant Harvard kill.
A Harvard timeout at 13-6 attempted to staunch the bleeding, but a strong kill by Penn State brought their lead to 14-6 right off the timeout. A back-and-forth, consisting mainly of service errors, calmed the momentum momentarily for Harvard to rally back. Yet the Lions would shut them down immediately, running up the score to 19-8, and onwards.
With little concern for the state of their win, the two-bleachers-worth of Penn State supporters alternated between cheering on their star player, Cal Fisher (“Go Fish!”) and heckling their #13 –– not due to a game-related fumble, but because his shoes were too big.
The only Harvard streak that had emerged in the first set was attributed to a fumble by #18 junior Toby Ezeonu from the Lions off an awkward receive. A service ace from Ethan Smith attempted to bridge the gap at 22-14, until a subsequent service error ended the Crimson’s brief reprieve.
Penn State would end the first set at 25-16 in their favor, off a massive kill from Ezeonu to win it.
Harvard’s second set would not fare much better. A service error from Penn State gave the team a free point to begin with, but a miscommunication error from the Crimson on the next play would leave the team fumbling for an unsuccessful receive.
This beginning appeared to set the tone for the rest of the set, as the Crimson’s stray bounces and awkward deflections combined with the Lions’ terrifying pace of play, put the impact in volleyball’s high-impact label.
Penn State’s volleyball isn’t necessarily new to Harvard. The team had played them twice last year, while they held #2 and #4 spots respectively. Harvard had been swept both times.
“It’s the same exact team as last year, I think every single one of them except for one player is like a fifth-year grad student,” explained setter and sophomore James Bardin. “We scouted them last year, and it’s the same deal –– they’re a solid well-rounded team, so they’re tough to stop even though we know them well.”
As the two teams fought back and forth, a kill from Penn State bounced off sophomore Owen Fanning’s face to make the score 2-2. As the Lions began to pull ahead, an awkward save from Harvard sent the ball flying into the crowd, as the screams of the bleachers ousted the groans from the bench. A kill from Harvard brought the score back to 6-5, but a poorly angled bounce off the net from a Fanning receive would only broaden the gap at 7-5.
A service error from Penn, coupled with a beautiful service ace by Fanning allows the team to tie it up at 7-7. Unfortunately, the tie would never be broached, as service errors and unlucky battles with the net kept the two teams at a point stalemate.
Another miscommunication from Harvard led to a series of attempted receives that would end up at the back of the bleachers, to make the score 16-12. Two rallies later, another flying ball off an unfortunate dig made its way into the masses.
A brief pause was granted by another timeout from the Crimson, attempting to cool the team off as Harvard trailed 18-13. Only a serve later, the crowd was once again forced to duck, as a bounce off a block by first-year Zach Berty ran astray.
Receiving troubles would bring forward another Harvard timeout, but troubles, as they often do, arrive in spades. The Lions’ offensive and defensive capabilities overwhelmed an overworked Crimson, with the only remaining points Harvard could pick up in the set stemming from Penn State’s own service errors. A final awkward blocking bounce, a service error, and an intense rally would end the set at 25-15, in favor of Penn State.
What doesn’t kill Harvard, however, ultimately makes them more annoying to play against. Harvard started out the third set with a bombastic block that, despite going out, a couple of Lions players had to duck from. Appearing to fully embrace the prevailing underdog label, Harvard shut down a serving streak from #19 Cal Fisher at 3-1.
A delayed set-up to a huge kill successfully fakes out Penn State, to give Harvard the up at 3-2. From there, a vicious back-and-forth between the teams, complete with a sprinkling of service errors, allowed Crimson to keep pace all the way to a 6-6 tie. Though the Lions would appear to break through the momentum, Harvard would claw their way back to 13-13 from a sequence of good kills, powerful blocks, and the occasional well-placed tip against the opposition.
Where Penn State’s previous leads would leave the Crimson back in the dust, resilience in the third set was where Harvard really began to shine.
“I think we just limited the other team’s serving runs,” Bardin noted. “Those other sets, they were kind of back and forth until Fisher or Wildman would go back and get a seven-point serving run –– and they’d take us out of the set. There was a four-point run in that third set, but that’s it.”
In terms of staying in the game, it was a service error by Ezeonu, following a Harvard timeout at 16-13, that would be the lucky break the Crimson needed.
A huge kill from the Crimson, directed right at Penn State #12 Brett Wildman’s ankle took the score to 18-15, and the momentum would continue on from there. A huge block from Harvard to bring the gap to 18-17 even had the Crimson bench players bench-pressing themselves in celebration, as the team got to its highest point total of the entire game.
As the teams once again stalemate, a solid kill from Berty would ricochet off its Penn State receiver, flinging itself into the crowd to make it 23-21, the first time in the matchup where Crimson had reached over 20 points.
A timeout was called, but this time, by the Lions, in their first called timeout of the game. It was ultimately unsuccessful – the very next play, a Crimson hit off a Penn State blocker flew out, bridging the gap to 23-22. A kill by Ezeonu hauled the Lions to match point, only for a remarkable kill by junior Trevor Schultz off Wildman’s serve to side out the Crimson once again at 24-23.
So close yet so far. A languishing rally would lead to a kill by Penn State’s #8, junior Michal Kowal, which bounced off a Harvard blocker and out into the stands. The Lions would capture the final set, 25-23, and ultimately the game, sweeping Friday 3-0.
Yet, despite the tough numbers on the paper, Friday’s outcome wasn’t necessarily discouraging. Key takeaways from the latter back-and-forth were fundamental in driving improvement in places such as the team’s serve receives. For Bardin, understanding the extent of Fisher and Wildman’s serving prowess seemed to be a valuable piece of knowledge entering Saturday’s match.
“They’re gonna score their points — but if we can just limit their serving runs, we’ll be good,” Bardin said.
And, in a sense, they were. Harvard’s Saturday afternoon seemed to pick up right where last Friday had left off, as both teams entered reinvigorated by the prospect of good volleyball. Though Crimson started off trailing –– and would end trailing to boot –– the Lions could not seem to shake Harvard off its tail, as the two teams traded points all the way til 11-10.
A series of unfortunate serves brought the score to 14-12, in favor of Penn State, until a devastating kill that Harvard’s sophomore Logan Shepherd, playing libero, couldn’t pick up. Ezeonu’s subsequent two service aces forced an unsuccessful timeout for Harvard, but a kill by the Lions only enlarged the gap at 18-12. Service errors and a final Penn State kill would end the first set at 25-17.
It’s at the second set where Friday’s sorrowed sows began to reap its reward. A serve from Penn State’s Fisher kicked off the set by hurtling straight into the net, giving Harvard 1-0. The two teams fumbled their way to 4-3, Lions leading.
A service ace from Penn State, barely knocking over a Crimson player, coupled with a tough block on a Harvard kill left the Lions pulling forward at 6-3, but a service error and a beautiful kill off Penn State’s own block brought the score back 6-5.
An intense back-and-forth on the scoreboard and a combination of service aces and errors on both sides would leave the score at 17-15, with the Lions leading. A huge service ace from Berty brought Harvard to 17-16, once again right up to the edge.
On Berty’s next serve, a rocky receive from Penn State found its way into the hands of senior Ryan Hong.
Hong was a new presence on the court for Harvard against the Lions. Despite not playing on Friday, he was added in on Saturday. Assistant coach Nick Clark felt that the position was well earned.
“Ryan’s been a guy off the bench for us all year long,” Clark explained. “We felt he deserved an opportunity and we wanted to give him a chance.”
The opportunity would pay its dividends. Hong’s tip left Penn State scrambling to receive, and ultimately failing to do so –– bringing the game to its first big tie at 17-17.
A Lions kill would take back its lead, but an answer from Harvard would bring it back 18-18. A topper from Schultz converted into a nail-bitingly intense rally, as both sides swapped chances and just-in-time digs. A cross-court Hong kill deflected beautifully off the Penn State receive and out of bounds, giving Crimson its first lead of the game at 19-18, and forcing a Lions timeout –– their second of the entire weekend.
Unfortunately, it’s the Penn State kill that’s kicked into gear following the break. Fantastic moves from Bardin, setting up for a kill and later an unexpected tip, would bring Harvard momentarily back up at 21-19, until the Lions came back to hunt, tying it up at 21-21 with a timeout for Crimson to boot.
A promising chance for Harvard with a kill from sophomore Kade McGovern was deflected off a Penn State arm into the bleachers, but a service error would bring the teams even at 22-22. It was once again a service ace from Ezeonu that sent Harvard into another timeout.
Though a startling echo of their third set last night, the Crimson wasn’t ready to repeat the narrative just yet. A strong Harvard block off a deadly Wildman spike ties up the game at 23-23. A Lions counter is swiftly answered by Harvard, bringing the game to 24-24, and forcing the matchup's first deuce.
For a team whose first matchup had ended in a brutal 25-15 loss, forcing a deuce against the #3 team in the country had seemed impossible. Clark credited the shift, not just from the people, but also from the plays.
“We switched up a few of our defensive schemes, and it worked for us,” Clark explained. “We had a couple more blocks, and we dug a lot more balls, and that was really important – that was probably the big takeaway.”
The two teams’ late-game stalemate made for a nail-biting scene. Penn State’s kill wrestled forward a point to get ahead, before the answering Harvard block evened up the score all the way to 26-26.
It’s when an ill-placed receive from Harvard sends the ball ricocheting into the crowd, that the Lions appeared to be in the clear. Up 27-26, with Cal Fisher’s serve next up on the block, a player whose number of service aces rivaled only those of two Olympic medalists, the match appeared to be set.
Fisher’s ball flew up in the air, as the Harvard bench jeered.
And smashed straight into the net.
Service error, 27-27. The Crimson were still in the game, even as a Penn block brought the score back into their rhythmic back-and-forth: 28-27.
Unfortunately for Harvard, Wildman’s next serve would be the Lion’s last. A devastating service ace that sent the crowd reeling, the second set was snatched for Penn State, 29-27.
The invigorating second match paved the way for a tense and, if possible, even harder-hitting third, as the Lions snatched an early lead and didn’t let go. Service aces from Ezeonu and Wildman proved deadly to handle. A service error from Penn State would bring the game to a tie, and a mishandle on a dig from the Lions shot its way back into the crowd to give the Crimson a temporary 9-8 lead.
An exhausted two teams traded both kills and fumbles in equal parts. Penn State’s Wildman barely misses a kill mid-air, and barely misses colliding with the referee on the sideline to boot. The play gives the Crimson an 11-9 lead on the scoreboard, and the Lion’s #6 Cole Bogner a towel and pseudo-timeout, as the crowd watches the graduate student mop up the court.
The net errors, unfortunately, appeared to be contagious. Crimson relinquished its lead from multiple kill misfires, and though a Bardin tip provided a brief lifeline for the 12-11 lead, the two would tread down their well-worn path of a point stalemate.
A service error from Harvard paved the way for the Lions’ final wind, going on a five-point tear to grab a 20-16 lead before another Crimson timeout attempted to stem the momentum. The band-aid would stop the bleeding, but would not heal the wound, however –– as the teams traded hits, Harvard couldn’t find a way to pull ahead.
An electrifying weekend would go the way of the world as, according to T.S. Elliot: not with a bang, but with a whimper. A final Crimson service error gave Penn State the win and the sweep, ending the third set at 25-21.
Despite the back-to-back sweeps, the experience was ultimately positive. For assistant coach Nick Clark, the noticeable growth from the team, even in such a short weekend stint, was admirable.
“I thought we got better from last night,” Clark said. “The team showed up, and they fought the whole time, and said, ‘we’re not gonna go down without a fight.’ I think that’s really important, and it showed: we had them in set two, it was really close, and it was back-and-forth in set three, so I’m really proud of the way we played.”
As for the players, the opportunity to face off against a big-name program was big in itself.
“These are my favorite matches, against highly ranked teams,” Bardin grinned. “I think there’s almost less stress in a lot of ways because you’re the underdog, so you can just come out and have fun. Playing at a high level –– it’s the best part of the game.”
Their high-level opponents won’t be going away anytime soon. Harvard looks forward to a stream of conference opponent games, each more critical as the last as the group heads into the dusk of volleyball season still winless. Crimson will be traveling to N.J. this coming Friday, April 7th, to face off against the New Jersey Institute of Technology (8-14, 2-5 EIVA).
In terms of their soon-to-be opponents, Clark only had four words to say: “Get ready for Friday.”

I’m not a junior, but Junior Family Weekend was absolutely fantastic to watch. The cute mother/daughter duo I saw ordering matching cappuccinos at Starbucks. The angsty 15-year-old pretending not to be excited when his brother gifted him a Harvard sweatshirt. I loved it. Sadly, not every moment is as spectacular, especially when it comes to parents. Yours (and mine) have probably done something on this chart. Check out where they fall, from reasonable to terrifying a little over-excited.
