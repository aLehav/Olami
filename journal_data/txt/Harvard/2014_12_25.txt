After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past two years, the push for Harvard to divest from fossil fuels has manifested itself in many forms—Valentine’s Day cards, a week-long fast, a blockade of Massachusetts Hall, and, most recently, a lawsuit. Now, one alumni club is joining the movement calling on the University to remove its holdings in fossil fuel companies.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Club of Vermont, which includes 276 members, endorsed divestment after 76 percent of its members who responded to a survey backed the measure. The Vermont group is the first alumni club to officially back the divestment movement, according to club president Charles A. Boright ’68.
The club’s position comes after months of discussion and research on the topic, Boright said. In early October, the club spoke with Jonathan Lash ’67, the president of Hampshire College, one of only a handful of colleges to have divested from fossil fuels. Boright also met with several members of Divest Harvard, the University-wide parent activist group, to discuss whether they would be supportive of the Vermont club voting on the measure, he said.
Benjamin Franta, a graduate student at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and one of Divest Harvard’s alumni coordinators, said he was immediately supportive of the Vermont group’s plans to debate and vote on the topic. Alumni are very relevant in the movement, he said.
“The clubs allow us to take that engagement to an institutional level, and that becomes harder for the Harvard Corporation to ignore,” Franta said. “I think the clubs have the potential to be extremely important, and we will do everything we can to help that happen.”
University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly argued against divestment, maintaining that Harvard should not politicize its investment decisions. She weighed in on the issue in an Oct. 2013 open letter, characterizing divestment as neither “warranted or wise” and arguing that “the endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.”
University spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment on Faust’s engagement with alumni on the topic of divestment.
William E. McKibben ’82, the founder of environmental advocacy website 350.org and a former Crimson president, predicted that the coming year will see stronger support from alumni, given the recent decisions of other organizations, such as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund charity, to divest from fossil fuels.
“As the largest constituent of the university family, I think it's crucial that [alumni’s] voice be heard,” McKibben wrote in an email.
McKibben, who supports the Divest Harvard campaign, added that while he does not expect alumni club letters themselves to “set off many alarm bells in Massachusetts Hall,”—home to offices of Faust and other top officials in Harvard’s central administration—he thinks that alumni are perceptive of climate change issues and will continue to question the University’s continued investment in fossil fuel companies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde has convened a group of students and House administrators to discuss the upcoming closure of Stillman Infirmary and work with Harvard University Health Services administrators on the change, which is slated to take effect at the end of this academic year.
The feedback group will include tutors, proctors, House deans, and House masters in addition to students, according to an email Lassonde sent to undergraduates on Saturday soliciting their participation in the effort.
Lassonde wrote that he hopes to involve up to 10 students in the group, which will meet three to four times in late January and February. Student members will also attend additional sessions to “identify the most important issues” to UHS and Infirmary users.
In his email, Lassonde invited students to request to participate or nominate their peers to “help us think through this transition.” The email also requested that students submit questions and concerns regarding the UHS changes to the group through a Google form that asks students what health services they consider important to undergraduates.
Lassonde’s solicitation of student feedback on the Stillman closure comes amid concerns among undergraduates over the upcoming health services restructuring. Following student outcry this fall, administrators decided that UHS will continue to offer in-person, 24-hour urgent care next year, but maintained that the the infirmary will close in favor of expanding same-day appointments and counseling and mental health services.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 Harvard undergraduates woke up Christmas morning to find another email message in their inboxes from the same address that was used to send hundreds of Harvard affiliates a racially charged death threat in early October.
The email, which students received at 8:35 a.m. Thursday, was written in broken English and appeared to apologize for sending the death threat earlier this fall. “I'm so sorry about the threats against you with death threats,” the message reads. “I would never kill someone.”
The email is the latest in a series of messages that Harvard affilliates have received from the “hotmail.de” email account since the sender or senders first threatened students, prompting a monthslong investigation into the episode this fall.
The messages have disproportionately targeted women of Asian descent and have come from two email accounts: the “hotmail.de” address that sent students the most recent message on Thursday and a Google Mail account linked to the threat that has been used to contact students since as early as this past April.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said Thursday that the police are aware of Thursday’s email and confirmed that the investigation into the threat remains ongoing, but declined to comment further.
After University affiliates received the first mass email in early October, HUPD conducted a two-months long investigation into the threat and determined that the emails originated overseas and did not pose a threat to student safety. HUPD has since concluded its investigation, which German authorities were leading as of early December.
The College administration’s response to the initial threats prompted concern among undergraduates who said the official response was neither timely nor sensitive to the racially charged nature of the threats. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana later hosted an open meeting at Phillips Brooks House for students to discuss their concerns.
