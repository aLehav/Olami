After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of researchers led by Dr. Peter H. Mundel at Massachusetts General Hospital has recently identified the first targeted therapy for a specific type of kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS.
Using a drug that has already been approved for rheumatoid arthritis–abatacept, also known as Orencia–Mundel’s group reported success in treating FSGS in five patients. Their work was published online on Nov. 8 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
“Similar to what is now being seen with cancer where researchers are looking for personalized treatments based on genetics, we found a specific biomarker, B7-1, which has been attributed to a subset of FSGS,” said Mundel, who is also an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Mundel’s group first identified the relationship between B7-1 and FSGS in 2004. Although previously believed to be a biomarker that was exclusive to immune cells, Mundel’s group demonstrated that B7-1 was also expressed by podocytes, kidney cells that play a major role in blood filtration.
Further work showed that the presence of B7-1 in podocytes was associated with a deterioration of the kidney’s normal filtration system. Mundel said one of the problems that occurs as a result is proteinuria, or the loss of protein in the urine,
“In addition to the immediate and obvious effects of protein loss on the body, proteinuria is also significant because it is a prognostic indicator of progressive kidney disease and potentially cardiovascular disease,” Mundel said.
After uncovering the role of the biomarker B7-1 in proteinuria, Mundel’s team discovered that suppressing the B7-1 biomarker could potentially remedy the FSGS disease. Abatacept, a drug that was previously approved for rheumatoid arthritis, is coincidentally a B7-1 inhibitor and the group decided to test the drug on five patients with FSGS who expressed B7-1.
Follow-up testing showed that all five patients saw improvements in proteinuria.
“Orencia [abatacept] is now in use in 50,000 to 100,000 patients for rheumatoid arthritis, and we can repurpose the drug for kidney disease,” Mundel said. “We also know that it is relatively safe to use the drug, based on this arthritis experience.”
A large-scale clinical trial to confirm the findings and test the efficacy of abatacept is currently in the works. In addition, Mundel said he also hopes to tackle the bigger challenge of understanding why only a subset of patients with FSGS have the particular B7-1 biomarker and how to treat those individuals as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
From HUDS workers to House Masters, the College strove to give students who remained on campus this Thanksgiving break a warm, familial experience.
In Quincy House, white tablecloths, barrels of apples, and even two prepared turkeys lined the dining hall tables—until a HUDS chef carved the turkeys up and served them to students.
Quincy House, the only dining hall open during the Thanksgiving break that lasted from Wednesday to Saturday this year, prepared traditional Thanksgiving dishes and extended Thursday’s meal service from 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Students were able to enjoy everything from the classic turkey with gravy to mulled apple cider to four different types of pie while taking in Quincy dining hall’s festive decorations.
“Today we wanted it to feel as home-like as possible,” Kishan Jagmohan, a HUDS general cook in Quincy House, said. “We can’t have everyone sitting around a big table together, but we try our best.”
Jagmohan said that the Thanksgiving menu was special because it features items that are on the regular menu, but usually served separately.
“They’re never on at the same time,” he said. “And we don’t usually have sliced ham as part of our yearly menu.”
Viroopa Volla ’14 said she appreciated the HUDS staff’s efforts.
“I feel like the Thanksgiving they offered here is pretty heartwarming,” Volla said. “They offer everything that you’d usually see at Thanksgiving,”
Volla added that she also thought the food was “pretty good.”
In addition to the campus-wide dinner in the Quincy dining hall, many Houses also organized their own celebrations for House members who remained at Harvard over the holiday. Eliot House hosted a game night that included desserts on Thursday evening. The House Masters in Adams House hosted a traditional New England Thanksgiving dinner in the Franklin D. Roosevelt suite.
Students who remained on campus cited various reasons for choosing to stay.
Vollaa said she did not travel home this year so that she could work on her senior thesis, as all of the data for her work was stored at Lamont Library.
For others, the trip home is not feasible.
Will D. Moyo ’16, a student from Zimbabwe, said that for her and her friends, many of whom are also international students, flying back home for a few days is not worth the price of the trip.
“It doesn’t make sense to go home,” Moyo said.
Moyo said she planned to spend Thanksgiving relaxing with her friends and her host family, who introduced her to the traditions accompanying the holiday last year.
“I knew of the holiday Thanksgiving, but not of how people take it really seriously here, and how important it is to them,” Moyo said.
“The idea of having time to stop and reflect about what you’re grateful for, I think that’s my favorite part.”

A recent study conducted by researchers from Harvard and seven other institutions suggests that methane emissions in the United States could be 1.5 times greater than the amount estimated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and 1.7 times greater than that estimated by the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.
The findings, published last week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses an innovative method for measuring methane emissions that its authors hope will result in a more accurate estimate. 
“With this research, we want to get a better idea of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and get an understanding of what the largest players are in the emission that we see,” said lead author Scot M. Miller ’07, a doctoral student in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Methane emissions are a byproduct of the oil and gas industries, ruminants such as cattle and sheep, landfills, waste water treatment plants, and coal mining.
 While both the EPA and this new study agree that the oil and gas industries and ruminants are the two largest sources of emissions in the United States, they differ in their method of estimating methane emissions. The EPA’s bottom-up, or counting type, method looks at all possible sources for methane emissions in order to estimate the emissions factor, which is the amount of methane believed to be coming from an average ruminant or oil and gas facility on a given day.
Researchers in this new study employed a top-down method, which attempts to calculate the total methane emissions in the United States and then works backwards to identify the geographic locations responsible for those emissions.
“The advantage of using a top-down method is that we get a very strong constraint on the total amount of methane emitted over a large region or over an area as large as the United States,” Miller said.
Besides employing this innovative method, the study also provides some insight into how society might combat the problem of rising methane emissions. 
“The results of this study may motivate increased consideration of efforts to mitigate methane emissions by looking at their sources and finding socially and economically acceptable solutions that reduce the emission,” said co-author Marc L. Fischer, who works in the Environmental Energy Technologies Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
In terms of future studies, Miller cited the importance of learning how emissions have changed over time.
“If we can examine methane emission from 2007 all the way up to 2013, we can get a better handle on how emissions may have changed over time and how [the] expansion of the fossil fuel industry could’ve affected total emission throughout the United States,” said Miller.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking for its first winning streak this season, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team faced up against a then-winless Dartmouth squad Saturday night.
But despite having scored half of its goals this season so far in the third period, the Crimson (4-6-1, 2-5-1 ECAC) could not muster another late goal and it was the Big Green (1-8-0, 1-6-0, ECAC) who netted the decisive score in the final frame, downing Harvard, 2-1, in the Thompson Arena in Hanover, N.H.
Though the Crimson had its fair share of chances in its second road game in a string of four straight, Harvard was only able to net one goal and unable to convert on any of its six power-play opportunities.
“We sort of shot ourselves in the foot,” freshman forward Sean Malone said. “We probably could have put a few in on the power play because we had a lot of power-play chances. But we didn’t capitalize.”
The failed night on the power play also snaps a streak of six straight games in which the Crimson had a man-up goal, after four straight games to start the season without a power-play score.
Sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey had the lone goal for Harvard, a second period tally that opened up the scoring on the night. Malone was able to intercept an opposing pass and then find Vesey in the slot who put it in the net on the far side past Big Green sophomore goalie Charles Grant.
The point makes Malone second amongst Harvard rookies in points, with his six points second to Luke Esposito’s seven. Overall the Crimson’s freshmen have had a fairly strong showing so far this season, with seven of the nine logging at least a point.
“The freshmen are starting to settle in,” sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo said. “They are starting to gain more confidence which is huge for us… We just need them to keep doing what they are doing and not try to do too much and understand they are going to be key players for us now and moving forward.”
Dartmouth responded soon after, with freshman forward Grant Opperman knotting the score at one-all just over three minutes later at 13:34 in the second frame, with help from sophomores Brad Schierhorn and Geoff Ferguson.
The score remained tied for most of the rest of the game, until Big Green junior forward Eric Neiley broke through with a goal at 17:19 in the third, assisted by junior Brandon McNally and sophomore Ryan Bullock.
With the goal Neiley builds on his team-leading eight points and six goals, and Bullock builds on his team-leading six assists as the top-scoring defenseman on the team.
Dartmouth was able to withstand Harvard’s extra-man attack with a pulled goalie with in the final minute, holding on for the 2-1 victory, the team’s first of the season.
Overall the Big Green outshot the Crimson, 35-23, while Harvard won the overall face-off battle, 30-24. Grant came up with 22 saves over the usual Dartmouth goalie, senior Cab Morris, to secure the win.
For the visiting Crimson, senior goalie Raphael Girard’s second straight game of 33 saves proved not to be enough on Saturday.
“He’s been solid for us,” Malone said. “[There was] a lot of point blank chances… and it’s huge to have him back there, someone you can rely on. Championship teams have really good goaltenders and having Raph in the net is huge for us and definitely helps out defensively.”
Harvard continued its strong penalty-kill, shutting out the Big Green on the two power-play chances, improving to a kill-rate of 90.5 percent, good for third in the nation. Advanced scouting and prep work, along with Girard in net, is a big reason why the Crimson continues to do well in this area.
“We always do work in terms of video before each game on each team’s power play and how we are going to prevent them from scoring,” Malone said. “It’s something we take pride and we have some good penalty killers.”
With its first win of the season, Dartmouth continues to plague Harvard, picking up its ninth win of the last 15 matchups, unbeaten in nine of the last ten. The Crimson will look to bounce back next weekend in its final two ECAC games of 2013, on the road against Brown and reigning NCAA champion Yale.

Well, it’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for. With That Which Shall Not Be Named looming around the corner, there are only a few days of classes left! Whether you are sad to be finishing Fairytales or overjoyed to leave CS50 behind, it’s time to shed your shyness and go a little crazy in the classroom. Here are a few things you could do in lecture or section to leave with a resounding bang.
IntoxicationPerhaps the most obvious choice on this list, but we couldn’t help mentioning it. Who knows, you could even end up passed out and naked. Your classmates are sure to love that.Les Mis: Instrumental EditionIf you’re in a musical ensemble, you should really enter the last day of lecture playing your instrument. Not only will you entertain the entire class and waste some time, but you’ll also make a kickass exit. Bonus points if you get the entire marching band to join you. Or you could channel the remains of your FAP experience into one spectacular High School Musical-esque score and dance.Channel MileyShe’s everywhere, so inevitably she had to appear on this list. Show everyone you ain’t a little kid anymore and twerk on the desk of your professor as they enter for class—the more people you get to do this the better. Props if you get it on video!Food TruckBring fragrant and delicious food to lecture, make the room smell heavenly and have everyone hate you. Chances are people have already done this (SLS 20 all the time) but with scramble of last-minute midterms and holiday planning, most of us won’t be properly fed, so the vengeance will be all the sweeter.Mary, Mary, Quite ContraryTired of listening to your section leader drone on and on? Try contradicting everything they say on the last day of classes. Another blissful, delicious sort of vengeance would be interrupting that one know-it-all throughout the entire section. Whoever said revenge wasn’t sweet was lying.Love ActuallyConfess your undying love to the attractive person in your section (props if it’s your TF). We recommend doing this with roses in front of your section with "A Thousand Miles" by Vanessa Carlton blasting in the background. Speaking in couplets always helps the love of your life (or the hookup of tonight) fall for you.

With the holidays right around the corner, many of your clubs and friends are probably planning gift swaps (Secret Santa, Secret Snowman, White Elephant, whatever your variant of choice is!). Here are some tips for making sure things go as smoothly as possible:
 
1. Set a budget everyone’s comfortable with. Even with your closest group of friends, keep in mind that some people may be doing multiple Secret Santas which can add up quickly!
2. Use Elfster to organize Secret Santa! It ensures that you won’t draw yourself, and if you end up getting someone you don’t know as well, you can just look at his or her wish list. 
3. Everyone loves sweets. When you really have no idea, go with a cupcake/Burdick’s treat/hot cocoa. 
4. Make a card! Homemade cards always seem really impressive, and adding a card to your gift is a sure way to make it feel 10 times more special. 
5. Where to shop: If you don’t have time to go into Boston, there are plenty of places in the Square. Hidden Sweets is filled with random, cute things, and has a student discount. Bob Slate’s Stationer has nice notebooks and stationery. Get something sweet from L.A. Burdick or Finale. Black Ink and Urban Outfitters are good for the more offbeat personalities in your group. 
6. Have fun with it! Remember, it’s the holidays—use Secret Santa as a time to relax and take a break from exam studying. Don’t stress too much, and just enjoy having an excuse to spend time with your friends.
 
Happy holidays!
