After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the first scenes in “Little Woods,” Ollie (Tessa Thompson) buries dozens of bottles of drugs she smuggled into the country from Canada. Right before she’s caught, first-time writer and director Nia DaCosta uses the dolly zoom to pull us into Ollie’s world, and from that moment on, we never really leave it. Her world isn’t particularly interesting — she’s broke, applying for a job out in Spokane, and trying desperately to avoid being dragged back into the drug-dealing world — but it doesn’t need to be. The intrigue lies in not in the world itself, but in the way Ollie draws us into her own experience of it: with both reluctant resignation and dangerous hope, with fear of leaving behind what she knows and anticipation for the next chapter of her life. It’s a dichotomy that DaCosta navigates precisely, quietly, starkly, resulting in a small neo-Western that builds without judgment of its characters or the society that has condemned them to their fate.
Unfortunately for Ollie and Deb, “your choices are only as good as your options are.” And in the small North Dakota town where Ollie is serving out the last 10 days of her probation, the options are few and far between: Stay and potentially get reeled back into the life that got her into trouble in the first place, or leave and start over. The answer would be clear — “The last thing I need is to implicate myself in something worse than I got caught doing,” she asserts — if not for her sister, Deb (Lily James, who plays a very different and much more interesting “Deb” than she did in “Baby Driver”), who is struggling to make ends meet for herself and her son in their illegally parked mobile home. When Deb becomes pregnant and the sisters find out their home will be foreclosed unless they can find $3,000 to pay in a week for what they owe, Deb is forced back into the drug-dealing lifestyle she had hoped to leave behind.
The film’s subtle nuance lies in its ability to bring up a panoply of issues — drug dealing, poverty, abortion, the American healthcare system — without making an indictment on them, as well as what its characters do within the confines of their limited options. Instead of criticizing the conditions that forced Ollie and Deb into their respective dire situations, DaCosta depicts what it’s like for the two to live through these dilemmas, always showing, never criticizing. When Deb goes down to the women’s clinic to ask about what her options are without health insurance, she gets a brutal wake-up call about the crippling expenses of even bearing a child without insurance. “Being pregnant costs $8,000?” she asks, incredulous at the prohibitive cost of prenatal vitamins and regular checkups. It’s an interesting and impressive balance that doesn’t shirk authenticity and commentary for complacency or fear of controversy and politicization. Rather, DaCosta simply draws us into Ollie and Deb’s world and allows the actresses themselves to imbue the characters’ lives with the tension and scrutiny they deserve. And like DaCosta, James and especially Thompson deliver commanding performances that elevate the film into the quiet powerhouse that it is.
Reflecting the movie’s tone itself, Thompson’s performance is understated and captivating in its meticulous characterization of a simultaneously jaded and hopeful young woman. And though Deb sees only the calm, composed version of the sister who always gets her out of trouble. “You, Oleander, are not hopeful,” she describes. “Practical, yeah. But you never hope, you do.” There’s always a glimmer in Thompson’s eyes, at times determined, at times desperate, that belies Ollie’s cool exterior. Thompson does more than just humanize Ollie; she enlivens the character by grounding her in a reality that she has wronged and that has in turn wronged her. James dexterously plays off Thompson’s controlled rendition with a slightly more eager performance, one that reflects Deb’s reliance on Ollie’s risky leadership. Where Ollie has enough foresight to know just how disastrously wrong her plan can go, Deb prefers to stay in denial — ignorance is bliss, after all — and is reluctant to do what she knows she must. Where Thompson is the film’s tour de force, relentless in her depiction of the slowly spiraling character, James is more reserved in her relatively safer performance, though the two clearly feed off each other’s energy to give credence to a relationship whose past is never explained, but informs their interactions nonetheless.
The film resonates the most in its silence — literally. The film barely has a soundtrack, and the dialogue sometimes comes to the detriment of the film, interrupting moments of quietude with phrases that toe the line between the surreptitious and the overt. “Money is money is money if you don’t got it,” Deb says, lamenting the sisters’ financial situation. And when Deb asks Ollie how she got caught dealing despite being so good at it, Ollie’s response is an expected one: “I forgot to be scared because I liked it too much.” But DaCosta makes up for what is perhaps a weaker script by letting her actresses do the speaking for her. Fortunately for DaCosta, neither Thompson nor James is afraid of Ollie’s neck of the woods — the ones protecting the sisters from detection — no matter how little they are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend was our version of fall break — one day off on Oct. 8. After not having seen my family for weeks and feeling like I needed a break from campus, I decided to go home for the so-called vacation. Yet, due to last-minute assignments given to make up for Monday’s missed class and meetings scheduled for Monday, I was forced to cut my trip short and come back to campus Sunday morning.
While hundreds of universities across the country give their students time off in the middle of the fall semester, outside of weekends, Harvard students have four days off from classes during the semester. (The remaining three are the week of Thanksgiving.) This is a serious problem that contributes to fatigue and stress, and the school ought to rectify it by establishing a weeklong fall break. This easy, bold step would send a clear signal to students that Harvard cares about our well-being, satisfaction, and mental health.
In general, the College does a good job making sure that the school year is not too long. We had 170 days off in the 2017-2018 academic year, second only to Princeton in the Ivy League, and our 115 days of summer vacation was second only to Columbia’s 116.
However, very little of that time off comes in the middle of the semester. Studies have shown that mid-semester breaks are important for physical and mental health. People who work for months without a break are more likely to develop fatigue, illnesses, and depression. That is why mental health groups on campuses across the country have been pushing for more intermittent school breaks, rather than two long breaks between semesters. Without any extended break between the start of school and Thanksgiving, a serious illness, family emergency, or mental health crisis can force students to fall far behind on classwork and sometimes even to withdraw from school for a semester.
Additionally, having breaks within the semester is better for retaining knowledge. Forcing students to cram class material for 13 weeks straight is not conducive to absorbing information. Studies suggest that having more frequent breaks improves academic achievement among students and particularly benefits students from low-income households. If, for example, Harvard were to make our four month-long summer vacation two weeks shorter and add a couple of mid-semester weeklong breaks, students would be less stressed, healthier, and more successful in the classroom.
The only existing break in the fall semester is during the week of Thanksgiving, yet even then Harvard gives less time off than many other schools. Weeklong breaks allow students to utilize both weekends. Especially when the Harvard-Yale game is played in New Haven and most of the school is leaving campus already, it is stressful to return to Cambridge just for two more days of class. Giving students off the Monday and Tuesday of Thanksgiving week would allow us to enjoy the Game more fully and not have to worry about studying for a midterm the next day.
This would also give students who live farther away a better opportunity to go home during the semester. For many international students or students who don’t live in the Northeast, the five-day vacation over Thanksgiving is not enough time to go home and spend time with family. I am privileged enough to live four hours from home, but the time and money that is required to leave campus often makes it hard to justify short visits home or to friends’ schools. For friends of mine who live in Miami, Arizona, or India, it is very hard to return home at any point between the start of school and winter break.
Four additional days off during the week of Columbus Day or two additional days during the week of Thanksgiving would go a long way in making students happier and less stressed, and the missed time could be made up in many ways. Starting school half a week earlier in the fall or ending the semester slightly later is but a small price to pay for a much needed break.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week I had a cold. Not a fake cold, but like an actual cold where I had to take Tylenol and everything. I ended up having to take two days off of school to recover, and all I had to do to save my grades was email my professor a doctor’s note and a short explanation. But taking a sick day wasn’t always this straightforward.
Most of the colds I had sophomore year weren’t actually colds. They were depression. Taking a sick day therefore meant deciding what kind of explanation, if any, I was planning to give. On the one hand, I could tell the truth and pray to god that my professor was someone both knowledgeable of and sympathetic to mental illnesses. On the other hand, I could supplement the purposefully nondescript doctor’s note with any innocuous lie that I felt like telling — sore throat, fever, allergic reaction — you name it. The options were endless.
So in sophomore year, I mainly told lies. It was just easier — so much easier than any explanation of depression I could fit in a reasonably lengthed email. When I told people I was down with a fever, it triggered immediate sympathy and an immediate “Of course you won’t be able to finish this assignment on time!” That’s the beauty of physical ailments. They are more or less universal experiences: easy to describe, easy to imagine, and easy to excuse.
Yet, over time I grew sick of these small lies. Even the white lie of just being “sick” bothered me. I knew I was entitled to medical confidentiality and that this cover-up was harmless, but I couldn’t help feeling that I wasn’t being true to myself, and certainly not standing up to the stigma I was trying to combat among friends and even acquaintances. I therefore made the decision to start telling the full, uncensored truth.
In a streak of hopeful naivety, I almost expected to be congratulated. I thought that maybe my professors would applaud my willingness to be honest, that their academic prowess would make it easy for them to trust in science over the folklore that mental illness is “all in your head,” that they would extend me the same sympathy they had extended when I told them it was all a fever.
I was wrong.
Sympathy immediately changed into skepticism. It didn’t matter that I had a doctor’s note or that I had pasted a literal piece of my heart into each email. The replies that were once along the lines of “Get better soon!” and “Don’t worry about coming to class tomorrow!”, suddenly became filled with a dead “When can you get the assignment in by.”
Because the most sadistic personality trait of depression is that you can have a near-suicidal crisis one night and show up the next morning looking absolutely fine. With no cough, no cast, no scar, no fanfare to testify that, yes, your mind really had dealt serious damage to itself, and yes, it was was so awful you had to take the day off to recuperate.
Harvard may have a stellar counseling and mental health service, and it may have all the institutional mechanisms needed for granting much-needed extensions and sick days, but the belittling of mental health issues by professors continues to be a terrifying reality — especially when a quarter of ushave been diagnosed or treated for a mental illness in the past year, and one-tenth of us have gone so far as to attempt suicide.
It’s therefore high time that Harvard professors began taking mental health seriously — as seriously as they take the average cold. My depression was not a lie, nor was it an excuse for academic incompetence. All I needed was time to heal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chris Heaton, the newly-hired head coach of Harvard’s diving team, was placed on leave and subsequently resigned after a class-action suit filed in Indiana alleged that he sent inappropriate photos to and solicited nude pictures from young female swimmers. According to University spokesperson Rachael Dane, Harvard was unaware of these allegations, which happened years ago, at the time of the hiring process. We are heartened by the University’s response to these allegations as soon as they came to light and completely agree with its course of action.
While we applaud the University’s current response, we cannot ignore Harvard’s history of ignoring allegations of sexual misconduct and protecting powerful men from punishment. This includes the recent case of Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez, who was allowed to keep his position for over 30 years after the first reports of sexual harassment against him emerged in 1983. All institutions must be vigilant in taking allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and preventing abuses of power. Harvard’s swift response in placing Heaton on leave following the allegations against him is a step in the right direction and hopefully reflective of the University’s commitment to protecting survivors.
While we do not know the extent of the background checks the University conducts on the people it hires, we expect that it maintain the highest level of scrutiny in hiring. To prevent cases like these — and others we may not know about— we ask the University to be more transparent in its hiring process and to remain uncompromising in conducting thorough background checks.
On the same note, we ask the University to be more transparent about the process for reviewing allegations of sexual misconduct that are made against Harvard affiliates from outside the University. With greater transparency, outside observers can make suggestions on how to improve the process, which will hopefully leading to improved reviewing practices. Moreover, where appropriate, we ask that Harvard consider involving the student body in these processes.
The University should be applauded for the actions it has taken to address these allegations of Heaton’s solicitation and distribution of nude pictures. We stand with the diving team as these allegations against their coach have surfaced. We hope that the Harvard community also stands with them, and that teammates receive support as needed during this difficult time.

It’s hard enough to get a Harvard student to commit to eating breakfast at 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning, let alone travel out of state to canvass. And yet — on a recent week in September — here sit more than 30 members of the Harvard College Democrats, bleary-eyed and battered, riding a school bus to Nashua, NH to canvass for a unified Democratic ticket.
Armed with clipboards, pamphlets, and the Minivan app, students pound the pavement in pairs for a total of six hours. At each door, they campaign for a blue ticket that includes gubernatorial candidate Molly Kelly and incumbent representative Ann Kuster. Rounding out the list are Democrat picks for State Senate, Executive Council, and other State House positions.
“I feel like at Harvard, you can never get someone to sign on to spend their whole day in a different state,” says Hank R. Sparks ’21, the College Democrats’ campaigns director. “So I think it’s a testament to how much interest there is in the midterms that people are willing to invest an entire day.”
The people who dedicate their Saturday mornings to canvassing are certainly outliers at Harvard. There are thriving political organizations on campus, certainly — the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, and the Institute of Politics (which houses internships, fellows, and many student groups), to name a few. But civic engagement among Harvard students is lukewarm at best.
According to the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE), the Harvard student body voting rate rested at 57.8 percent in 2016. That’s higher than the voting rate for the 1,000-plus educational institutions tracked by NSLVE — a dismal 50.4 percent. But both statistics are markedly lower than America’s overall 2016 voter turnout of 61.4 percent.
Midterm turnout in 2014 was worse. Voting rates at Harvard clocked in at 23.6 percent, compared to 36.4 percent nationwide.
At freshman convocation this September, University President Lawrence S. Bacow gave students their “first homework assignment”: to register to vote and cast a ballot. This was not a one-off line: It reflects a carefully orchestrated campus-wide effort to get out the vote.
This year — a midterm election year — has seen major pushes to shift Harvard culture by increasing political involvement and, with it, voting rates. At the helm of these efforts is a brand new nonpartisan organization called the Harvard Votes Challenge (HVC), which hopes to increase student turnout across all degree-granting Harvard schools.
“In terms of further goals, it’s unfortunately very easy to beat the benchmark set in the last midterm election,” says Derek Paulhus ’19, an HVC co-founder. “The obvious basic goal is to beat that — in fact, to far exceed that.” Harvard now faces the critical challenge of raising these dismal numbers in November.
Why are Harvard’s voting rates lower than those of the country overall? Answering that question, Assistant Professor of Government Ryan D. Enos says, is not an easy task. “I’m not sure if anyone knows exactly why it’s lower.”
Most noticeably, there are some logistical barriers. “Part of it is that you have this disruption. Students pick up and move, and they haven’t put ties down somewhere,” he says.
Professor of Government and Sociology Theda Skocpol corroborates this point. “I guess young people are often on the move, and this country makes it hard for people to register to vote in many places,” she says.
Enos also notes that, in studies, age has always been a consistent determinant of voting rates — which helps explain why student percentages are so low. “It’s just a fact, voter turnout is strongly correlated with age. The older you are, the more likely you are to vote, until you can’t get to the polls anymore,” he says.
“Americans in general don’t turn out at a very high rate compared to other countries. And our older citizens are the ones that follow politics the most closely,” Skocpol says. “They have a big stake in government policies like social security and Medicare.”
Skocpol speculates that social media’s ubiquity allows young people to feel politically engaged without actually heading to the ballot box. “It may also be the case that many young people think politics don’t have much to do with their lives, and think that other forms of expression like social media are a substitute for voting,” she says.
In an age when making a political statement can be as simple as putting a filter on a Facebook profile photo, it can certainly appear that students are more engaged with political issues than ever before. As for whether or not that translates into more direct political action — like voting — Skocpol says she is unsure.
“People’s social ties do matter in making them feel like they have a stake in voting, so maybe to some degree that can help,” Skocpol says.
For that reason, Enos sees college-aged voters as a challenge — but also as a unique opportunity. “All the conditions that are particularly present in the college environment are so valuable — so social pressure, strong networks, all those things are there.”
Catherine Fish, the associate director of the All In Campus Democracy Challenge, has observed efforts to increase voting rates at more than 400 colleges and universities over the past several years.
The most successful schools, she noticed, have a few key strategies in common. “I think it’s places where democratic engagement work is really institutionalized,” she says. That means voter registration and civic education are built into university life, both through events and in classes.
Northwestern recently won the award for “Most Improved Voting Rate” — it shot up a whopping 15.2 percent between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. Mechanical engineering professor Michael Peshkin helped direct this push as one of the creators of the NU Votes initiative. The most crucial part of their success, he says, was the physical station established by Northwestern’s Center for Civic Engagement as a mandated part of the freshman move-in process.
“We just make it stations 1-5, and station number 3 is register to vote,” Peshkin says. “It’s like you are here at college, everyone is an engaged citizen, and where do you want to vote?” Peshkin believes these personal interactions and direct conversations helped the voter registration rate at Northwestern skyrocket to 91 percent in 2016 (by comparison, Harvard’s that year was 74.5 percent). “I think that’s responsible for most of our increase — every student has been talked to one on one.”
A group of Harvard students wants to see those kinds of results this midterm year.
HVC co-founder Theodore N. Landis ’20 began leading an IOP polling initiative last spring titled the Harvard Public Opinion Project. “We saw a bunch of indications that young people are among the most engaged in politics they’ve ever been,” he says. “We had this moment, and then looked at the numbers at Harvard and found that we had a lot of work to do.”
Ashley Spillane, the former President of Rock the Vote who was a Harvard Kennedy School fellow at the time, brought Landis together with Paulhus, the chair of the IOP’s Community Action Committee. The two teamed up to co-found HVC — and they built the organization from the ground up throughout the spring and summer.
“The administration has been totally cooperative and helped us when we need it, but this has been student-run, student-organized, and student-driven,” Paulhus says.
HVC has now grown into a full-bodied, university-wide organization. Their approach is three-pronged. First, they lower the barriers to voting by helping students register, providing absentee ballots, and sharing information. Second, they energize voters through events, forums, and other political engagement activities. And finally, they want to ingrain voting into Harvard’s culture.
Each of the 12 degree-granting Harvard schools has its own HVC branch, led by a coalition member. “This challenge is rooted in collaboration — schools should work together to reach their goals,” Landis says. Landis runs the College branch, while Paulhus is in charge of university-wide HVC partnerships and programming.
HVC is striving to institutionalize a campus-wide culture of voting. “I think [our mission] is to make voting and civic engagement a fundamental piece of the Harvard experience and Harvard culture,” says Robert C. Watson ’09, an advisor to HVC at the IOP. “At Harvard, a part of what we do is produce leaders who impact the world. At Harvard, we are actively engaged citizens, we participate — and voting is one of the most fundamental ways to be a participant in democracy.”
HVC also wants to minimize the disparities that are currently present in Harvard’s voting breakdown. “We see in the report that students of color tend to vote at lower rates than white students,” Landis says. “There are a variety of factors that contribute to that, and we at HVC are looking forward to engaging with student cultural groups.”
Recently, HVC organized a “Black Harvard Votes” event and a “Break the Glass and Hit the Polls” event for women. “We want to engage different clusters of students based on different types of diversity that Harvard has,” Watson adds.
It doesn’t stop at voting, though. For one, not all Harvard students can vote. “For international students, and many other types of people who aren’t eligible voters — we want to make them feel like a part of this as well,” Watson says. He adds that the group holds a variety of political engagement events and activities that aren’t solely centered around voting.
And casting a ballot is only one piece of the puzzle. “I would say, first, any civic act can be a launching pad to a lifetime of active citizenship,” Watson says. “So I think our charge going forward should be: how do we use this momentum for other questions of civic importance?”

My first memory is of me waking up in a white room. I have no idea how old I was at the time. I have no idea where I even was. But I was awake. I knew I was awake. For years, for billions and billions of years before then, Jarele Soyinka was non-existent. Or asleep, as I sometimes like to think of it. I was eternally asleep, and then I woke up.
And from that moment, I entered the march of human existence. I became a cog rotating to the beat of humanity’s circadian rhythm. It’s a cycle, really. You wake up, you live, and you fall asleep. You wake up, you live, and you fall asleep. You wake up from an eternity of non-existence, you live 80 or so years, and you fall asleep forever. Each human is having their short little waltz with time. A three step. One, two, three. Four, five –
Sixth grade was the first time my cycle was interrupted. My memory of the day is fuzzy, but I’m sure it began with the graceless ballet of my morning routine. I woke up in a green bedroom in my family’s California home, and rolled out of an oversized bed that creaks every single time you move. I probably dragged myself to a bathroom sink that was covered in toothpaste crust (tweenaged boys are gross). I hopped into the bath. With hot water raining from the shower head, my idle thoughts of life flowed to the meter of day-to-day monotony.
It was a standard routine, until the tempo increased. The thoughts in my mind sped up. I couldn’t control the ideas dizzyingly dancing through my mind. I was in so much pain; my anxiety attack was causing me so much pain. I wanted it to stop. I was begging for it to stop. My heart was racing, my eyes were watering, and I was on my knees pleading for the thoughts to end.
And just as suddenly, they were gone. There was a single misstep and the tempo went back to normal. Maybe my mind was unable to process the thoughts and simply paused, or maybe the thoughts became entangled and quickly devolved into something my brain could handle. At that time I didn’t give a fuck either way. I was too terrified.
It’s a process I call waking up twice. These thoughts were not new. Questions like: Why am I trapped in a state of existence? What defines my consciousness? What does it even mean to be non-existent? had come to me before. But never with this rapidity. When I’m asleep I have no conscious control of thoughts. When I wake up I regain agency. I can describe what it means to exist, what defines my identity, or identify patterns of the human experience.
But when I wake up twice, I retain conscious thought but completely lose control. My mind is bombarded with every existential monologue I’ve ever articulated. Minutes or hours of internal dialogue are compressed into seconds, and my mind is overwhelmed as these thoughts relentlessly invade.
Over the years I’ve managed to piece together my family’s history with mental ailments. Anxiety, schizophrenia, depression, etc. meant that the Soyinka family members have persistently rebelled against humanity’s rhythm. We come into the world, quickly adapting to the beat, and find our place in the species’ musical procession. But at some point, we break the cycle. We’re thrown offbeat and we wake up again. It’s happened to me, my older brother Bo, and my father.
***
Wole interrupted the cycle for the first time somewhere between 1967 and 1969. In Nigeria, there was a civil war on the horizon. Dad was a political activist, whose efforts in brokering a peace deal to avoid a bloody clash earned him 22 months of solitary confinement.
His daily routine consisted exclusively of waking up, eating, and sleeping. The days blended into weeks, which blended into months.
My dad probably increased the tempo on purpose. One time, in our family kitchen, he told me that “Albert Einstein came into my cell” to discuss philosophy and “William Shakespeare taught me” to form an identity through writing. For my dad, waking up twice involved hallucinations; their presence kept him sane. If humanity was going to shackle his movements and leave him with the metronome of life in confinement, he’d hasten the beat and introduce his own tango partners.
For my father, it was a blessing. He heeded Shakespeare and smuggled toilet paper into his cell in order preserve his identity through writing. His sanity clung to sheets of one-ply. But if you asked him if the nightmares that still haunt him multiple times a week were a blessing…
I’ve had dozens of anxiety attacks since then, most of them much less dramatic than the first. They almost always occur right as I’m falling asleep or taking a shower. My mind is unguarded, because I’m following a pattern that I’ve obeyed literally every day of my life. The first thought pours in and before I can regain control, I’m already overwhelmed by the unceasing flow of information.
An interesting part is that when I wake up twice my pupils dilate. The colors around me become desaturated, so my environment appears less vibrant. It causes the world to feel inauthentic. Humanity’s metronome seems slightly delayed. It almost becomes an existential crisis: am I offbeat or is everyone else? Humanity marches onward like there’s been no change to the meter, and I feel like an impostor mimicking their movements.
But without fail, I adjust. My eyes reset. My mind calms down. Or I physically fall asleep and when I wake up, I’m moving smoothly to the beat of humanity’s biological clock. Everything is fine. I’m back in circadian rhythm. I wake up, I live, and I fall asleep. I wake up, I live, and I fall asleep. I wake up, I live, and I hope that I don’t wake up twice.

In a small, beige room in the basement of 20 Prescott, Jessica Ding ’19 and Peter Z. Hartnett ’19 yank on ropes and stomp on a floor pedal to clang several suspended bells. The sound fills the room and rings in your ears — but in gaps of silence, the hum of a vacuum and the drone of the laundry machines seep through. None of the grandeur of their former home, the Lowell bell tower, is present in their swing-housing practice space.
A set of Russian bells once sat atop Lowell House, sounding out deafening, harmonic peals every Sunday at 1 p.m. For years, The Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers ascended the belltower every week to play a wide range of material for Lowell House denizens ranging from tonal improvisations to Taylor Swift’s “Shake it Off.” Depending on who you ask, they’re either keeping alive a sacred tradition of Russian bell-ringing and promoting cross-cultural dialogue ­­— or robbing Lowellians of their afternoon naps and study sessions.

But during the renovations over the past two years, Lowell’s massive bells sat idle: “Mother Earth,” the whopping 13-ton bell with a seismic roar, no longer pounded the hungover heads of Lowell residents. Instead, the Bell Ringers have gone underground — literally. They now spend their Sundays ringing a scant collection of tiny bells in the basement of Prescott. What was once an out-of-body experience that lured freshmen begging to ring Mother Earth herself is now “kind of sad,” according to Evander L. Price, a Bell Ringer and a Lowell House tutor.

According to Ding, who may or may not have changed her last name to accommodate her Klappermeister lifestyle, “Attendance is thin.”

“Bell ringers are a little bit in danger,” Price says. “No matter what, the tradition isn’t going to die, but this is the thinnest [the] bell ringers have ever been.”

Ding is trying her best to attract new members to the Society of Russian Bell Ringers, but, without the bell tower, her job has gotten significantly harder. After all, she told us, sitting in the noticeably bell-less Lowell Inn, that she originally joined the Society of Russian Bell Ringers for the view. “You got a really great view from Lowell bell tower… I’m looking at the picture…” She gestured back towards a postcard-perfect picture of the old Lowell bell tower hanging on the back wall of the dining hall, which offers a stark contrast to the squat, fluorescent-lit Lowell House Inn. “You got a great view of the river, the Boston skyline,” she says wistfully.

The old bell-ringing lifestyle breached on fanaticism, and members still cling to their glorious past. Price describes sacrificing all to hear the bells at their purest form, sans earplugs. He likens the experience to looking right at the sun: painful, exhilarating, and entirely worth it. “You’ve gotta do it once. You won’t go deaf. Right? Right? I’m not a doctor.”

But right now the only way to experience the earth-shattering clang of the Lowell House bells is in a disappointing online simulation. And the Prescott replacement bell set is underwhelming at best. “It’s a little sad,” Price says. “There are just a few bells down there, in the basement. It’s not the inspiring experience of having your entire body vibrated by Mother Earth. It’s, uh, uniquely not transcendental.”

“One of our bellringers really wants to learn ‘Call Me Maybe’ but it’s pretty hard on our practice set,” Ding says.

Price is more disparaging: “We play Happy Birthday, barely.”

Even in the absence of the bell tower, though, the Society for Russian Bell Ringers have found other ways to amuse themselves. Ding and Price collaborated on an April Fool’s prank in which they told the unsuspecting Lowell House email list that their signature bells had been permanently relocated to the Eliot House bell tower. Nobody fell for it, but Ding got a few encouraging notes saying “Well played.”

Moreover, this summer the Society emerged from their subterranean lair to embark on their annual trip to Russia. They spent two weeks studying the art of bell-ringing with Father Roman of the Danilov Monastery. Roman is the “Justin Bieber” of bell-ringing, according to Price. A six-foot-four master bell ringer with a long beard and “sparkling eyes,” Father Roman can lead you up to any sacred belltower in all of Russia with a snap of his fingers. This man does not use earplugs — some say he has transcended entirely. Ding cites the fascinating history of the bells as her reason for involvement, but, at the very least, Price seems to have fallen under Father Roman’s spell. With a hint of awe, Price delcares: “He can ring bells infinitely.” Despite the sad state of the Lowell bells, followers of Father Roman remain true — and the Society of Russian Bell ringers plan to bring him back to campus once the belltower renovations are complete.

The bell ringers remain patient, awaiting the day they can return to their perch in Lowell. Until then, they are content with their humble practice set and the memory of their former glory.

We ask Ding: “Do you ever wander through the yard and hear the bells marking every hour, and get filled with deep sadness and envy?”

“Um... no?” she replies.
Correction: Oct. 14, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Lowell House "Mother Earth" bell weighs 800 pounds. In fact, the bell weighs 13 tons.

In August, after a summer of intense gastrointestinal pain, I went to my grandmother’s gastroenterologist. I lay down, belly up, as she pressed on my intestines and asked what was specifically wrong with my stomach. I launched into a several-minute-long description of the bloating I’d experienced almost every time I ate food shortly after moving to New York City for the summer. This was not a normal bloat — my stomach became so distended that my pants, 10 minutes prior a bit too loose, would barely fit around my body. Even after unzipping. My belly was so swollen I could barely walk. My stomach felt like a vat of corrosive acid. On the subway after dinner one night, wearing a form-fitting dress, I was offered a seat on the subway by a man who “thought I was pregnant.”
My grandma’s GI seemed unperturbed by this. After a few questions about my daily routine, she firmly concluded that I had a “mind-body problem.” I was imagining a stomach ulcer diagnosis, or something similarly intense, so this amorphous diagnosis seemed flippant. I felt sure it was not a mind problem, but a physical one — I had the bloat to prove it. When I asked how I might resolve said “mind-body” problem, she prescribed hypnosis.
Shortly after, I left the office. Instead of a concrete diagnosis and recovery plan, I felt my doctor had somehow undermined my physical pain by chalking it up to a mind problem, as if that implied I was merely willing myself into obscene bloating. I did not consciously decide to bloat and, similarly, I could not consciously de-bloat. The hypnosis prescription seemed like a cruel joke.
Since the appointment, though, I have thought incessantly about the prescription. I’m amenable to the idea that the mind and body are, to some degree, intertwined. So why did I feel slighted by my doctor’s conclusion?
***
Doctor Carol S. Ginandes ’69 leaned back into the leather armchair in her office, which smelled like Quaker-brand cinnamon apple oatmeal. I sat opposite Ginandes in a worn chair that squished around my body. Ginandes, who has been a psychologist since the early 1990s, seats her patients in the chair. Instead of a hypnotherapy session, though, I was there to interview Ginandes about her practice.
In both her clinical work — Ginandes is an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and staff associate at McLean Hospital — and her private practice, Ginandes works to alleviate mind-body issues. She clarified that this term includes a variety of ailments ranging from mental health issues like depression and eating disorders, to physically manifested issues like diabetes and bone fractures, to behavioral issues like smoking and stress reduction. For her entire career, Ginandes has incorporated hypnotic techniques in her practice.
Ginandes told me there is no “average” hypnotherapy session. The process resembles talk therapy: sessions center around a specific problem. Curing the problem depends on how the individual reacts to treatment and on the severity of the problem. And, much like talk-therapy, hypnotherapy sessions involve the patient and the doctor talking about the issue.
But, unlike talk-therapy, these sessions also include time for the patient to learn hypnotic techniques, which, according to Ginandes, might include “sitting in a comfortable chair and a provider teaching you how to shift gears.” The “shift” is from a normal, waking consciousness to a hyper-absorbed state, one in which the patient focuses so intensely on an image, word, or idea that peripheral concerns or images disappear. It’s a “state of absorption” that one can induce by conjuring up certain mental stimuli. Ginandes emphasized that it’s really “self-hypnosis” — the clinician teaches the patient techniques so they can elicit a specific reaction when they need or want to.
Ginandes is not really a hypnotist. She pointed out that “lay people will often say they are a hypnotist, whereas professional people will often say they are a psychologist who utilizes hypnosis or they are a hypnotherapist.” This distinction seems slight, but, as Ginandes put it, in a field where “words are currency,” phrasing matters.
By the end of our meeting, I reconsidered my original hypnosis prescription. Hypnotherapy seemed like the second cousin of cognitive behavioral therapy, a practice that uses talking through and creating mental imagery to modify the way your brain responds to a stimulus. Words may not exist as concrete, literal things, but as someone that studies them in school and has been in talk-therapy for five years, I’m confident they correspond to something tangible.
About a week after meeting Ginandes, I talked to Anne Harrington ’82, professor and undergraduate studies director in the History of Science department. Although I was relatively sold on the whole hypnotherapy thing at this point, she explained the sordid history of the practice. In the late 19th century, hypnosis usually consisted of a doctor (always male) controlling a patient (almost always female). Hypnosis could be, and often was, a sly manipulation technique. It was largely considered a mythical, discredited pseudoscience.
The idea of powerful men implanting ideas into my brain by illusion halted my unalloyed joy at the prospect of hypnotherapy. What if my stomach pain was not my own but, rather, a conditioned pain, something mistakenly internalized? What if my stomach didn’t actually hurt hurt but I merely thought it hurt? Did it matter if my stomach problems originated in my brain if I was certain I felt my stomach lining burning?
Ginandes explained that hypnotherapy researchers conducted experiments that would result in concrete data to resolve this dilemma. In 1999, Ginandes and Daniel I. Rosenthal, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School, conducted a randomized, controlled pilot study to test how 12 people with the same ankle fracture would heal with and without hypnotic intervention. According to the final report, after nine weeks, the patients with hypnotherapy had “greater ankle mobility, greater functional ability to descend stairs” and, for the first six weeks, “lower self-reported pain.”
There was a measurable outcome, but the enduring problem with hypnosis is proving that the actual practice exists. Unlike taking a pill with a measured dose of medicine, how can you quantify how potent mental imagery is? Even before determining its potency, if something is simply thought into existence, does it actually exist? Is not feeling pain as legitimate as curing pain? Ginandes had empirical results, as did several dozen other researchers who, around the early aughts, researched the relationship between pain relief and hypnosis, but the neurological mechanisms responsible for this were still a mystery. Researchers couldn’t necessarily explain how and why hypnotherapy worked.
A year or so after Ginandes completed her ankle fracture study, Stephen M. Kosslyn, former Dean of Social Sciences and John Lindsley Professor of Psychology at Harvard, and four other scientists, tested if hypnosis could modulate color perception.
Last weekend, over a cup of hot cocoa, Kosslyn explained his experiment to me. By using hypnotic techniques, eight subjects were asked to see a color pattern in a grey rectangle. While looking at the image, they had their brains photographed with PET scans. Those hypnotically induced to see color in the grey reported that they did in fact see color. And, thanks to the PET scan, a relatively new technology at the time, their reporting was verified — the hemispheres of the brain that activate when looking at color were actually activated. In short, their brains lit up as if they really saw color.
As Kosslyn recalls his study, he sips on hot chocolate (made with water). I drink ice water. My father had told me that acid reflux runs on his side of the family and, at least in him, is triggered by chocolate. My stomach feels tense, like a large rubber band is snapping my muscles towards my center of gravity. I had to read an entire novel and finish a problem set by the following morning, and though I was not thinking about my homework, stress lingered in my stomach muscles. I avoided chocolate.
Although the study won an award, no one ever really expanded upon Kosslyn’s research. When I asked why, he paused: “It was just too far off the beaten-track.” Despite the increased research around the physical component of hypnosis, hypnosis remained a small field, which Kosslyn partially attributes to “leftover behaviorism… the idea that to talk about mental activity is very squishy and unscientific. That you should just observe behavior. Stimuli, responses — what you can see.”
Hypnosis’s infamy is at least somewhat due to its history. But the infamy endures, in part because of the impossibility to prove that a feeling or a suggestion is something real. If a hypnotic suggestion is just that — a suggestion — does that make the subjective experience any less real? Why isn’t feeling less pain the same as having less pain? Unlike one’s temperature, one’s experience is not reliably quantified — but is quantification the marker of realness?

A week after returning to campus this fall, my intestines and stomach suddenly healed themselves. I stopped bloating after meals, even meals with lots of raw vegetables (which usually cause bloating, even in people with durable stomachs and duodenums).
I had quickly re-established routines that I had abandoned over the summer. The physical stress of traveling around the city via the subway, the train windows foggy with humidity and perspiration, was replaced by quiet, lush walks from the Quad to the Yard. I started sleeping and waking up at the same time — and doing so a door away from my three closest friends.
I am not quite sure why my stomach suddenly stopped properly digesting food or why it eventually cured itself. But the physical pain, even if a bodily manifestation of repressed feelings, definitely existed. Even that man on the subway saw it. Although I don’t know how my stomach relief came about, I’m certain that I feel the relief. That’s all I really wanted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the CambridgeHealth and Environmental Committee discussed the city’s progress towards achieving its “Zero Waste” goals as well as efforts to optimize recycling and composting systems at a public hearing Tuesday.
Zero Waste refers to the city’s attempts to substantially decrease the amountof discarded material it sends to landfills every year. As part of the inititative, Cambridge officials are asking residents to be more conscious of how they dispose of unwanted items.
“Zero Waste importantly does not mean zero trash, but it does try to bring us to a more sustainable waste diversion and recycling and reduction practice,” said Vice Mayor Jan Devereux, who co-chairs the Health and Environmental Committee alongside Councillor Quinton Zondervan.
The Zero Waste program comes as landfill capacity is shrinking in Massachusetts. More and more sites areclosing down — by the end of 2018, seven out of 20 state landfills will be inactive, according to government predictions.
“In 2008, the average household produced 22.8 pounds of trash per week. The goal by 2050 is to reduce that to four pounds per household per week,” Devereux said. “That’s going to take a combination of strategies, including getting organic food waste out of the trash.”
In the first six months since Cambridge began practicing city-wide organic waste collection — a method similar to composting — 1.6 million pounds of organic waste were diverted from landfills, according to Devereux. The program was entirely voluntary and only included households or buildings comprising12 units at maximum. Devereux said the initiative's early success proves thatexpanding the program would “certainly have a significant impact.”
As part of another ongoing city effort to promote environmentally responsible wastedisposal, Cambridge officials are teaching Cantabrigians how to recycle. The city now hosts a “Get Rid Of It Right” webpage that allows viewers to look up items they want to throw away by typing into a search bar.The website then provides information on how to correctly dispose of the item.
Some Zero Waste initiatives will aim to reduce waste production itself. Devereux suggested that the Department of Public Works could in future standardize the size of trash cans it provides to locals. If the trash cans are slightly smaller, it may encourage people to decrease their weekly trash output, Devereux said.
Waste reduction practices promoted by the city parallel Harvard’s own sustainability initiatives. According to Devereux, waste produced by Harvard and its affiliates is regulated by state laws includingthe Commercial Food Waste Ban of 2014. That ban is meant to decrease the amount of food waste in landfills by “at least 35 percent” by 2020.
On campus, sustainability efforts primarily fall under the purview of Harvard’s Office of Sustainability. According to the office’s website, “Harvard is focused on operating an efficient campus that incentivizes reuse and minimizes the amount of waste we produce.”
That can meandifferent things at different sites across the University. At the Harvard Kennedy School and Dudley House, dining hall patrons are encouraged toreuse plastic “clamshells” to hold their food.When they do, they receive tokens that can be used to help pay for future meals.
Harvard Athletics and the Resource Efficiency Program also recentlycollaborated on an effort to increase rates of recycling at football games.
According to the 2017 Harvard Sustainability Report, trash production per capita at Harvard decreased by 44 percent over the past decade or so, falling from 536 pounds per capita in 2006 to 302 pounds per capita in 2017. Food waste reduction contributes significantly to this number.Harvard University Dining Services, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Business School all began donating their surplus food in that time period.
“Whether we’re addressing challenges like energy, waste or health, the partnerships we have with the City of Cambridge, higher education peers like MIT, and leading businesses allow us all to identify shared barriers to change, discuss best practices, and develop solutions that can be widely replicated for greater impact,” Heather A. Henriksen, the managing director of Harvard’s Office for Sustainability, wrote in an emailed statement.
“It’s complicated for sure. It’s going to take a lot of creative minds thinking about how we change behavior, how we change the way things are manufactured, how we change attitudes about sending waste away,” Devereux said.

Days before a lawsuit alleging Harvard College’s admissions practices are discriminatory heads to a high-stakes and high-profile trial, University President Lawrence S. Bacow warned Harvard affiliates not to let the suit create rifts between them.
Bacow’s message — sent to students and alumni via email Wednesday — marked his first missivedirectly addressing the suit, which is slated to go to trial Oct. 15 in a Boston courthouse.
Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions brought the lawsuit against Harvard in 2014, during the latter half of former University President Drew G. Faust’s tenure. The suit charges that the College's race-conscious admissions policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants — an allegation Harvard has repeatedly denied.
In his Tuesday emails, Bacow acknowledged the case has the potential to “create divisions” among University affiliates onand off campus as the trial unfolds.
“Reasonable people may have different views, and I respect the diversity of opinion that this case may generate. I would hope all of us recognize, however, that we are members of one community — and will continue to be so long after this trial is in the rearview mirror,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow encouraged Harvard affiliates to “approach one another with mutual respect” despite possible differences of opinion.
Though students, faculty, and alumni may hold varying views on Harvard’s admissions practices, Bacow’s stance is clear.
“Let me be unequivocal: The College’s admissions process does not discriminate against anybody. I am confident the evidence presented at trial will establish that fact,” he wrote.
In his first full-length interview with The Crimson last month, Bacow similarly insisted that the College does not discriminate “against anybody” — and that Harvard will prevail in the Boston federal court.
What may unfold if the case reaches the Supreme Court is less certain, Bacow said. Experts have said that, with the recent addition of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, the highest court is unlikelyto rule in Harvard’s favor.
Bacow said in the September interview that he will refrain from commenting on the trial after it officially launches next week. He said it is “important to let the process play out” when thecase is in litigation.
“We’re right on the eve of litigation,” Bacow said. “It would not be appropriate for me to be commenting on it once the trial begins, and I probably won’t.”
Five days in advance of that time, though, Bacow did not mince words. He cautioned students and alumni about what he called the “provocative assertions” SFFA will likely make during litigation that he cautioned would spark increased media attention. He also reassured students that they belong at Harvard.
“I want all of you to know that each Harvard College student is admitted affirmatively,” Bacow wrote. “Each student brings something special to our community and contributes to our rich learning environment in a way that is unique.”
This is not the first time an administrator has directly discussed the lawsuit in an email to students. In his August welcome message to students, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana pointed to a spike in national news reports around the lawsuit following the summer release of documents that revealed previously undisclosed details of Harvard’s notoriously secretive admissions process.
“Let me be very clear – every one of you belongs at Harvard College. You are not just your SAT/ACT test score, nor are you just your high-school G.P.A. You are not just your race, ethnicity, gender, religion, concentration, sport, or legacy status,” Khurana wrote. “You will always have a home in Harvard’s diverse community.”
The lawsuit has also prompted student groups at Harvard to speak out in defense ofthe College’s admissions policies. The Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies has hosted several pro-affirmative action events on campus, including a week-long series of events entitled #DefendDiversity, in the run-up to the trial.
TAPAS co-hosted a panel on race-conscious admissions with the Harvard College Democrats on Tuesday that featured alumni speakers who canvassed the history of affirmative action, white supremacy, and strategies for protecting Asian-American applicants without pitting them against other minority groups.
Other student groups have refrained from taking stances on the lawsuit, though. In a recent interview, Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said theydo not plan to take a public stance on the suit — though some UC representatives said they disagree with that decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Kennedy School held a discussion featuring University of Virginia Professor James B. Loeffler ’96 Wednesday in honor of the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The Declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, articulates legal and moral principles for “fundamental human rights to be universally protected.” While legally non-binding, the document has been frequently cited as a basis for international agreements and domestic laws.
Wednesday’s discussion — which was hosted by the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy — focused on the history and modern significance of the document, as well as the evolution of international human rights recognition. The event was moderated by Mark L. Wolf, a senior judge on the District Court for Massachusetts and a senior fellow at the Carr Center.
The first portion of the event focused primarily on the history and drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Loeffler discussed the role activists played in forgingboth a revolutionary human rights proclamation and the state of Israel.
Loeffler, who specializes in Jewish history, drew much of the talk’s material from his recently published book “Rooted Cosmopolitans: Jews and Human Rights in the Twentieth Century.” During the event, Loeffler referenced several significant figures he featured in the book includingHersch Z. Lauterpacht, a Polish lawyer and key advocate for the creation of international human rights laws.
“It turns out that many of the building blocks of human rights that we think of as emerging out of World War II, out of the Holocaust, out of genocide, actually have their roots in Eastern Europe,” Loeffler said. He added that Jewish activists and lawyers were among the first to push for establishing a legal framework on the subject of human rights after the war.
Loffler also spoke aboutpresent-day dilemmas confronting anti-corruption movements. Wolf, who has previously written on the subject of corruption in human rights, said he believes these issues continue to be relevant and pressing.
“We should be battling to and creating institutions to assure that [UDHR] are not hollow promises,” Wolf said. “But that requires a kind of political will to fight for ideals and to not let them be hijacked for improper purposes.”
“It is not ancient history. These are battles that always need to be fought,” he added.
Kennedy School Professor and Carr Center Director Mathias Risse, who attended the talk, said he thinks it is crucial to continue educating people about the current state of human rights in the world.
“I was really gratified by the turnout,” Risse said.
In his talk, Loeffler also emphasized the perpetual relevance of human rights discussions throughout history.
“Humans rights are our language of justice,” he said. “We use human rights to articulate our aspirations, our ethics, and our morals.”
Loeffler’s talk is among several other events the Carr Center will host this year centered on the significance of the Universal Declaration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard continues to face three separate federal investigations into its compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX more than four years after the first complaint was filed.
In 2014, two College students filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights alleging that the College’s sexual assault policies at the time violated Title IX, which underlies the University's guidelines for investigating and adjudicating allegations of sexual misconduct.
Since the 2014 filing, the University has overhauled its approach to sexual assault prevention and response on campus — changing its policies and separating its Title IX Office, which provides resources and education, from its Office for Dispute Resolution, which investigates formal Title IX complaints.
The Crimson reported in 2017 that — on top of the 2014 complaint — there aretwo other ongoing federal investigations into Harvard’s compliance with Title IX: one probe into the College that officials launched in 2016,and one probe into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences that the government opened in 2017.
The federal government opened the 2016 investigation based on a complaint from an individual who claimed the College discriminated against him on the basis of sex during its efforts to addressa sexual assault complaint in which he was involved.
The specific date of the sexual assault claim in question was redacted from documents provided by the Department of Education, as were many identifying details about the individuals involved. It isunclear whether the filer was the complainant or respondent in Harvard’s Title IX probe.
The 2017 investigation is also examining concerns about promptness and equity in a Harvardinvestigation into a different sexual assault allegation, though it includes separate accusations against GSAS, too. That complaint also charged that the University failed to appoint a Title IX coordinator to oversee compliance with Title IX and failed to publish notices of non-discrimination.
A spokesperson for the Department of Education said OCR does not discuss the details of its ongoing investigations.
When The Crimson initially reported on the contents of the 2016 and 2017 investigations, a University spokesperson said Harvard responds “fairly and purposefully to allegations of sexual assault among its students, faculty, and staff.”
Much has changed since the federal government opened these investigations — at Harvard and on the national stage. Harvard has expanded its training efforts around sexual misconduct and has hired additional Title IX coordinators since 2014. Even as Harvard has strengthened its programming around Title IX, enforcement of the law at the federal level remains in flux. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos rescinded Obama-era policy guidelines that underlay Harvard’s Title IX policies and procedures in September 2017.
Harvard’s central Title IX administrators pledged at the time to uphold the University’s current policies and procedures anyway — but new federal Title IX policies she is reportedly considering could compel Harvard to change its approach to addressing sexual assault and harassment, according to legal experts.
The nationwide climate around sexual misconduct has also shifted as the #MeToo movement has taken off and encouraged women to come forward with their stories of sexual harassment. Harvard saw an uptick in reports of sexual misconduct last fall after the cultural movement began.
Despite changes in the University’s policies and procedures since the 2014 investigation began, students have continued to call on Harvard to do more to prevent and address instances of sexual misconduct.
Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy group, has been particularly vocal. Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a member of the group, wrote in an email this week that the group has “repeatedly” sought a meeting with new University President Lawrence S. Bacow to discuss Title IX.
“As of this writing, we have received no response from President Bacow,” she wrote.
University Spokesperson Melodie Jackson wrote in an email that Bacow has met with “a wide range of students and looks forward to meeting those focused on the important work of addressing and preventing sexual assault and harassment.”
“The safety and well-being of our community remains the University’s top priority,” Jackson wrote. “We have worked hard in recent years to develop strong policies and procedures, to significantly expand our training and prevention efforts, to increase the support services available to our community members, and to raise awareness of them across campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council discussed a proposal to add additional course start times to the new schedule and heard a presentation on the lawsuit alleging Harvard's admissions process is discriminatoryat its biweekly meeting Wednesday afternoon.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences registrar Michael P. Burke presented a proposal to the Council — FAS's highest governing body — that would allow courses that are scheduled from 12 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. or 3 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. to delay their start time by 45 minutes. If passed, the change would give students more time to eat lunch and would ensure courses aredistributed more evenly throughout the day.
The proposal follows a short presentation Burke gave at the Oct. 2 meeting of the full Faculty, during which he spoke about some issues raised by the new schedule.
The new system — implemented this fall after gaining Faculty approval in 2017 — extends the standard class block from 60 minutes to 75 minutes, adds 15 minutes of passing time between courses, and eliminates the tradition of "Harvard Time" which had allowed students to arrive seven minutes late to every class. It also requires departments to distribute their classes more evenly across the day and limits the times at which classes may begin.
Burke said at the Faculty meeting that the most popular time slot for classes is between 12 p.m. and 2:45 p.m.
Because dining halls originally opened at 12 p.m and closed at 2:15 p.m., many students missed lunch. On top of that, "Fly-By", the cafe underneath Annenberg Hallthat provides upperclassman with bagged meals during the day, saw longer lines than usual. Harvard University Dining Services has since begun openingdining halls half an hour earlier at 11:30 a.m. in an effort to combat this problem.
Council member David L. Howell called the suggested changes "commonsensical."
The Council will likely vote on the proposalat their next meeting before sending it off to the full Faculty in November for discussion, according to Howell. If approved, the alterations to the schedule would take effect during the spring semester.
Council members also heard from Harvard General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83, who gave an update on the four-year-old admissions lawsuit alleging the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Filed by anti-affirmative action group Students For Fair Admissions, the lawsuitis set to go to trial on Oct. 15 in a Boston courthouse.
During his hour-long presentation, Iuliano canvassed the main charges listed in the lawsuit, SFFA and its founder Edward Blum, and past Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action, according to Howell. Iuliano also gave Council members a chance to ask questions about the case. Harvard has repeatedly denied all allegations of discrimination.
The next Council meeting will take place on Oct. 24.

Student activists across the University say they will lead campaigns to increase campus voting rates and will work even harder to combat sexual assault in response to Brett M. Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court last week.
On Saturday, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh as an Associate Justice by a 50-48 vote — one of the closest margins in United States history. Kavanaugh, the second Supreme Court judge appointed during the Trump administration, received the confirmation a few weeks after at least two women stepped forward to allege he had sexually assaulted them decades ago. The allegations spurred national scrutiny, a federal hearing, and a series of anti-Kavanaugh protests on Harvard's campus.
A number of students interviewed by The Crimson said they are frustrated and disappointed by Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Several said the news was shocking but unsurprising.
Students also said they are dissatisfied with the way some Harvard administrators have responded to the allegations. Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning broke his weeks-long silence on the issue Monday when he sent an email to Law School students. But, though he wrote that the school wanted to support its students, he declined to take an official stance on Kavanaugh.
“When I speak out as dean, I am understood to be taking a position on behalf of our Law School,” he wrote. “But Harvard Law School is a large, diverse community that does not speak with one voice, and I cannot speak for all of you.”
Law School student Vail Kohnert-Yount, a member of advocacy group the Pipeline Parity Project, said she found Manning’s email hypocritical given he previously spoke out in support of the judge after President Donald Trump nominated him over the summer. At the time, Manning wrote a glowing statement published on a Harvard website that lauded Kavanaugh's teaching skills, among other traits.
“He was willing to violate that standard just weeks ago to speak in support of Brett Kavanaugh,” Kohnert-Yount said. “It made me not only disappointed but deeply angry that he would think that we wouldn't see that hypocrisy.”
Organizations at the Law School, including the Women’s Law Association, the Black Law Students Association, and Harvard Law Students for Reproductive Justice, plan to partner with each other to push for more support for women at the Law School.
“We will continue pushing for changes that we want to see in the legal community and at Harvard Law School to start,” said Isabel Finley, the president of the Women’s Law Association. “Things that have to do with how women are able to perform here, how they're able to progress their careers in a way that is on par with men, whether or not they're getting that support.”
She added this support is needed to ensure more women reach positions of power so “hopefully we will have fewer future Kavanaugh's.”
Throughout Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, students participated in phone banks and demonstrations meant to encourage lawmakers to vote against the then-nominee. Now that he's been confirmed, students are looking to the upcoming midterm elections to effect change in the Capitol.
Both the Harvard Law School Democrats and the Harvard College Democrats are pushing students to canvass and register to vote in the upcoming midterm elections. The Harvard College Democrats are organizing phone banks for different candidates twice a week and planning a canvassing trip to Maine, where Senator Susan Collins, one of the deciding votes in the Kavanaugh decision, serves as a representative.
“The single most important thing that we can do and were already going to [do] regardless of the Kavanaugh decision was to make sure that students have an opportunity to volunteer in these elections this fall,” said Devontae A. Freeland ’19, the president of the Harvard College Democrats.
“The only way to respond to this is to take back the House of Representatives, to take back the Senate,” Freeland said. “There really is no other course of action than to make sure that people know that the most important thing that they can do in 2018 is to go and vote on Nov.6.”
Other Harvard student leaders emphasized the importance of addressing sexual assault on campus in light of Kavanaugh’s confirmation despite the allegations against him.
In an emailed statement, Our Harvard Can Do Better, an organization focused on combating sexual assault on campus, wrote, “The recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States was a slap in the face of survivors and allies across the country.”
Priya P. Kukreja ’21, a board member of the Reproductive Justice Action and Dialogue Collective, said it is especially important now that the University’s Title IX offices are supportive of students. Kukreja said RAD will work with Our Harvard to promote Title IX and its accessibility on campus.
“It's really important to be able to, one, have a good system to document when sexual assault happens, so if there is another situation where we need evidence that someone like Kavanaugh has consistently and repeatedly assaulted people, there is documentation in Title IX offices that it has happened,” she said. “And second to just create a better culture on campus where people know that it's not okay to assault people and still be confirmed on the Supreme Court, which has now happened twice.”

On Oct.5, 2016, hundreds of dining workers traded in their punch cards for picket signs, walked out of the dining halls and cafes on Harvard’s campus, and demanded contract improvements in the first campus-wide strike the University had seen since 1983. Twenty-two days later, union and Harvard representatives reached an agreement highly favorable to striking dining workers during dramatic, late-night negotiations held behind closed doors in an office building near campus.
Now — two years later — the University and labor groups are still feeling the reverberations of the strike that shook campus.
The 2016 strike followed months of prolonged negotiations between the University and UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that represents Harvard University Dining Services workers. The union chose to escalate pressure on the University and conduct a strike vote when it found itself at a stalemate with Harvard over three main issues, HUDS Chief Shop Steward Edward B. Childs remembered.
The first issue was pay. In the weeks before the strike, University spokespeople told The Crimson that the average hourly wage for a HUDS worker was $21.89, translating to an average annual salary of $35,000; union negotiators, meanwhile, estimated that workers’ average salary at the time was closer to $31,000. In the final rounds of negotiation heading into the strike, the union proposed setting a $35,000 minimum guaranteed salary for year-round employees and requested a 22 percent pay increase over five years.
Healthcare was also a crucial concern for both union negotiators and the union’s members-at-large, Childs said. Kerry Maiato, a HUDS employee who works in Annenberg dining hall, said he was inspired to strike because, as the father of three children, he was deeply concerned by potential increases in healthcare co-payments.
“It was really important to me having good, affordable healthcare for my family,” Maiato said.
Anabela A. Pappas, a HUDS employee who works in Cabot and Pforzheimer dining halls, agreed. She said maintaining low out-of-pocket healthcare costs comprised one of two factors that drove her to strike: as a long-time diabetic, she knew she could not pay the cost the University’s insurance proposal would impose on her.
“I said that there was no way we would be able to afford doing that insurance, or even be able to afford to take care of our family, ” Pappas said.
She also wanted to stay healthy to feed the students she says are like children to her.
“700 people at Harvard came out and said, ‘Harvard can’t afford to have insurance for those who feed the students?’” Pappas said. “We have to be healthy for the students.”
“We want to take care of them and really do the best that we can,” she added.
At the time, Harvard Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran said the University offered Local 26 the same healthcare plan it extended to two other unions, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and the Area Trades Council, which eliminated deductibles but increased co-payments. University spokespeople estimated the average HUDS employee would likely see an increase in cost of less than $11 per month. Local 26 rejected that offer.
The third major issue that forced the union to the bargaining table was Harvard’s layoff system for dining services workers — union members hoped to seriously reform it. Childs noted that, when students leave campus for winter and summer breaks, seasonal layoffs for the workers who prepare their food can follow close behind.
“We had layoffs up to three months at some times for some people and no money,” Childs said. “We can't collect unemployment.”
For three weeks, HUDS workers walked the picket lines from the Quad to Longwood, beating drums and yelling chants like "Harvard, Harvard, you can't hide, we can see your greedy side!" During the demonstrations, they received just $40 per day, all of it drawn from Local 26’s strike fund. Hundreds of students joined the workers on the picket lines, the Cambridge City Council and the Undergraduate Council endorsed the strike, and some alumni chose not to donate to the University in support of the union’s endeavor. The strike also attracted national media attention.
With their usual workforce depleted, some campus cafes and dining halls had to temporarily shutter their doors. Those that remained open relied on stockpiled frozen food to feed undergraduates. Of around 750 total dining services workers, only 14 reportedly broke the strike and returned to work.
On Oct. 25, 2016 at around 1:05 a.m., The Crimson reported that the University and the union’s bargaining committees had reached "a tentative agreement." The final version of that agreement set year-round employees’ salaries at $35,000 per year, provided stipends to offset summer layoffs, and required that the University cover healthcare copayments. The 2016 contract — which the workers ratified in a 583-1 vote 22 days after they first walked out — will last until 2021.
Not long after HUDS workers concluded their strike, other universities started taking notice of their success.
In September 2017, workers at nearby Northeastern prepared for a strike to put pressure on their administration to bargain more constructively, citing Harvard's example. And in April 2018, dining workers at Tufts unionized with UNITE HERE, joining ranks with the HUDS employees they said inspired them to organize in the first place.
Pappas observed that, since the conclusion of the strike, Harvard has also gained another union of its own: the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.
“A lot of the students learned that together, you can accomplish greater things,” Pappas said. “We teach them you have to stick together.”
The effects of HUDS workers’ walkout were not limited to college campuses. Last month, hotel workers unionized with UNITE HERE began a strike against Marriott across eight U.S. cities including Boston.Childs said the striking Marriott employees have consulted with HUDS workers, some of whom participated in Marriott rallies.
Yet some dining workers say that, despite the changes they won in their contract, problems remain.
Pappas and Charlene V. Almeida, a HUDS employee who works at Quincy and Hillel dining halls, both said they still feel overscheduled and overworked.
“They’re trying to put more work on us, overwork us, in a lot of ways. I thought that would have changed some,” Almeida said.
Some workers also cited the “instability” of break periods as a major issue. Though the union’s contract contains provisions granting stipends to employees who are temporarily laid off during the summer recess, 42 days of paid time off to all workers, and a paid winter break from Dec. 25 to Jan. 1, Almeida and Pappas both said these measures have not provided sufficient support or stability for workers.
Almeida, Pappas, and Maiato also said they wish the University would make more summer positions available for dining workers.
“Having more stable jobs — they’re trying to change that, but it’s not going fast enough, you know?” Almeida said. “You still have a bunch of employees who are still home in the summertime.”
“More jobs need to open up, but they haven’t really done it yet,” she added.
Pappas said this dilemma is especially difficult for couples like her and her husband, Christopher M. Pappas, who also works for HUDS. In a situation like theirs, Pappas said, a household could potentially lose two sources of income during the period between the end of paid winter break and the beginning of the spring semester.
“We close on 21st of December, and a lot of [HUDS employees] don’t come back until January 21st,” Pappas said. “People have to budget.”
“We won the stipends, which was something that will help us a lot, but for those who have children, they need a little more than that,” she added.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement that the University “remains pleased” with the agreement the two parties reached.
“Two years into this five year contract, the University still remains pleased that it was able to reach an agreement that all parties involved recognize as a superior deal for these critically important members of the Harvard community,” Jackson wrote. “We deeply value the contributions of our dining service workers, as evidenced by our long-term commitment to ensuring fair and competitive wages, health care, pensions, retiree healthcare, and many other benefits.”
Despite the continued difficulties she said workers face, Pappas said she and her coworkers remain inspired by the long-term impact their strike has had, both within Harvard’s dining halls and without.
“I was so proud,” Pappas said. “We’d have thousands of people sometimes out in the strike, and everybody from all over the world — they got along, they hugged, they talked to us. We wiped each other’s tears.”
“That was a thing I’ll never forget, ever, ever. This will be embedded in my life forever,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scattered across the floor and on couches in the Harvard Women’s Center, over two dozen students sipped tea as they listened to upperclassmen discuss emotional labor and self-care Wednesday night.
The panel formed part of an ongoing Women’s Center series called “Let’s Talk” and meant to educate College students about issues that female-identifying students face.
The panelists, includingAndrew Pérez ’20, Jacqueline L. Kellogg ’19, Catherine Y. Zhang ’19, Salma Abdelrahman ’20, and Ruben E. Reyes Jr. ’19, a former co-chair of the Crimson’s Editorial Board, spoke about the causes of emotional labor and strategies to lessen psychological burdens.
Sociologist Arlie R. Hochschild first coined the term "emotional labor"in the 1980s based on the experience of flight attendants, arguing that their jobs force them to keep passengers happy at their own emotional expense. The term has since taken a broader meaning and now refers to the psychological pressure associated with living up to social expectations, accommodating the feelings of others, or dealing with family pressure.
Abdelrahman said that the expectations placed on Harvard undergraduates to advocate for their communities creates a particular emotional burden on minorities or women to change the University or student organizations from within.
“Everyone has a predetermined script based on their experiences. So often, because you’re a first-gen student, you’re expected to do first-gen advocacy,” Abdelrahman said. “Harvard brings us in to make the institution more inclusive and accessible… sometimes, you have to reject the script you’ve been given.”
In response, Kellogg offered advice for shifting the burden of increasing inclusivity away from minorities.
“If you are a white leader as I am, it is crucial to avoid standard excuses for lack of diversity, like, ‘If people of color don’t come to my meetings, I assume they aren’t interested,’” Kellogg said. “You must figure out why your space is not safe for someand rectify that by having conversations about what you need to do to lessen their emotional labor.”
The panelists also discussed self-care as a reprieve from emotional burdens.
“It’s okay to ease into things,” Pérez said. “You don’t have to do everything right away.”
“I promise that everything is not as high-stakes as it seems,” she added.
Dara M. Badon ’22 said she did not know what emotional labor meant before the talk, but that the definition reflects how she sees herself and her relationships. Badon added that she now has a better understanding of “the different forms that energy draining can happen in, and what ways to acknowledge it and counteract it.”
Janani Krishnan-Jha ’20, a Women’s center intern and organizer of the panel, said that the center hopes to hold similar events in the future.
“We like to make ourselves as supportive a space as possible, whether it’s through these kind of events, official programming events, or just our day-to-day operations as a space that a lot of people come in and out of to work, print, eat brownies and just exist in a wonderful, supportive area,” Krishnan-Jha said.

Former top Americandiplomat Wendy R. Sherman and Kennedy School visiting professor Nancy R. Gibbs discussed the future of public leadership in the United Statesat an Institute of Politics event Wednesday evening.
Sherman, a former U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs during the Obama administration, will soon join the Kennedy School as the director of the school’s Center for Public Leadership. At the event, which was hosted by the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, Sherman said that the current political climate in the U.S. motivated her to take on her new position at Harvard.
“There is a challenge of leadership at the governmental level. There is a challenge of leadership in business,” Sherman said.

Sherman said she believes the Kennedy school’s mission is“raising, in part, the next generation of leaders.”
As the discussion turned to contemporary politics, Sherman said it is important to consider populations affected by globalization and other social changes.
“People were concerned with losing their way of life, losing their identity, that modernity would mean they would no longer know where they stood and who they were,” Sherman said. “I think that anxiety has come to the developed world.”
Protest and speaking up, according to Sherman, are crucial to effecting change.
“If it means being in the streets, we are in the streets,” she said.
Sherman, who has served in a number of State Department positions, led Americanefforts to negotiate the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran to limit the country’s nuclear capabilities.
Following the event, Kiana N. Rawji ’22 said she appreciated the Sherman’s ability to explain and link complex ideas.
“She talked about a broad range of problems that the country is facing, but somehow she, I think, connected them all together,” Rawji said.
Philip R. T. Gagne, an Extension school alumnus, said he thinks Sherman’s perspective on “the world and the negotiation skills of the Iranians is very acute and quite pertinent to the trends in society.”
Sherman will join the Center of Public Leadership in January 2019, replacing David R. Gergen ’67, who will remain a professor at the Kennedy School. Sherman was previously a resident fellow at the Institute of Politics in fall 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sprinter Gabby Thomas has been described by many as prolific. As of last Thursday, she can be described as simply a pro.
On Wednesday afternoon, Thomas announced she would not be competing for the Crimson squad in her senior season. On Thursday, the tri-captain inked a professional deal with New Balance. The company announced the deal on Monday.While the sprinter will not compete for Harvard, she does intend to graduate from the institution.
“I was looking at other companies, pretty much all summer, and I guess New Balance heard that I was looking to go pro and they contacted me just one day,” Thomas said. “Their offer was really good so about two days later I went to their headquarters because they’re right here in Boston and I signed.”
Thomas is the third sprinter to join the team, and the only female. Team New Balance also features sprinters Vernon Norwood and Trayvon Bromell.
The deal marks the official conclusion of a storied Harvard career for the sprinter, one that has ended in multiple records in multiple events.
In track, the spring semester is split into two seasons, indoor and outdoor. Each has its own set of Ivy championships, national championships and record books. Thomas has inscribed her name in both sets.
For the Crimson, Thomas holds the indoor record for the 60-meter dash, the 200-meter dash and the 300-meter dash. In addition to the individual events, the Florence, Mass., native was a member of the program’s fastest ever 4x400-meter relay team.
At her freshman year Indoor Ivy League Heptagonal championships, Thomas ascended to the top of the podium in four events. Taking first in the the 60-meter dash, the 200-meter dash, the long jump, and assisting her team in the 4x400-meter dash, the freshman put herself on everyone’s radar within the conference.
Thomas won — or in the case of the 4x400 meter, helped to win — the 60-meter, the 200-meter and the 4x400-meter relay for the next two years. In 2017 as a sophomore, she broke the program record in both the indoor 60-meter and the 200-meter. In 2018, she broke her own school (and divisional) record in the 60-meter. She was the first Ivy League sprinter to win the two individual events three consecutive times.
In both the 2017 and 2018 seasons, Thomas was named Ivy League Most Outstanding Track Performer. That’s just the divisional championships.
In the same 2017 and 2018 seasons, Thomas advanced to the NCAA Division I Indoor Championships in the 200-meter dash. In her sophomore year, the second year made Ivy League history by becoming the first Ivy League athlete to make an indoor sprint final. In the race, Thomas placed eighth — naturally the highest finish ever by an Ivy Leaguer. Thomas wasn’t satisfied.
“Last year I came in dead last in this final with a really bad race,” said Thomas in a 2018 interview. “So I spent all [this] year mentally preparing and focusing on the discipline.”
In 2018, Thomas returned to the national stage in the event. This time she left with gold, shattering the collegiate record in the 200-meter dash. The record had been set for 10 years prior by Bianca Knight of the University of Texas. Knight went on to win the gold in the 2012 London Olympic Games as a member of the United States 4x100-meter relay team.
In the outdoor half of the competition, Thomas almost always replicated the feat. The tri-captain has school records in the outdoor 100-meter dash, the 200-meter dash and the long jump. In addition, Thomas was a member of the program record holding 4x100-meter, 4x200-meter and 4x400-meter teams.
As she did in indoors, Thomas twice won Most Outstanding Track Performer at Ivy Heps twice. In 2018 she also won Most Outstanding Field Performer of the meet.
In her freshman NCAA Division I outdoor championships meet, Thomas broke her Ivy and school record to finish third. In the next two years, Thomas finished second and third in same event.
The freshman season concluded in the USATF Olympic Trials. The then-freshman was Harvard’s only competitor in multiple events, finishing sixth in the 200-meter and 26th in the 100-meter dash.
Thomas finished her collegiate career an eight-time USTFCCCA All-American and a 25-time All-Ivy League competitor,
“She is extremely hard working,” said assistant head coach Kebba Tolbert. “To go from where she started at to where she is now, I think demonstrates the quality of the groups she’s worked with and how she’s pushed herself and how they’ve pushed her.”
Dubbed “The Florence Flash” by The Crimson Sports Board staff, Thomas won the Year in Sports Female Rookie of the Year (with Ngozi Musa) in 2016, Runner-Up Female Athlete of the Year in 2017, and Female Athlete of the Year last year.
Thomas has beaten Olympians her entire career. Now she’s on her way to becoming one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, I promised that if my analysis of Harvard football’s resurgence was inaccurate, you wouldn’t find a single trace of that edition of this column. I need to maintain my sterling reputation after all.
Well, it turns out my editor isn’t a fan of “deleting articles” and “deceiving our readership.” As a result, my prediction that Harvard would trounce Cornell is preserved for generations of readers to scoff at. Embarrassing, to say the least.
While my co-beat writer takes a week off to cover the burgeoning professional track career of Harvard’s Gabby Thomas, I’m filling in to deliver the locks of the week in the Ivy League. Aside from my miss on last week’s Harvard–Cornell contest, I’m not sure what my record is in my first two attempts at prognosticating winners. But trust me,I know what I’m talking about.
Here we go on another trip Around the Ivies.
HOLY CROSS AT HARVARD
Yet another Friday night game. Is it just me, or does it seem like the Ivy League (and all other football teams in the Northeast, for that matter) should do away with games under the lights?
I mean the league refuses to allow its teams to participate in postseason play out of respect for tradition, so why are games being played with the assistance of modern lighting technology? Helmets should be relegated to the FBS. We should reinstate the fullback and scrap the forward pass. Rip up the turf covering Harvard Stadium and lay down a mat of grass and mud. I’ll even do my part and write the next game story with pen and paper and record interviews in shorthand instead of using my computer.
All jokes aside, night games actually do seem to add some allure and intrigue to these games. If anything, the evening start times appear to dramatically increase first-half attendance among the portion of the student body that actually decides to show up.
The last time Harvard played Holy Cross was in a day game in week five of 2016. In that contest, the Crimson traveled to Worcester, Mass., and lost, 27-17. This year, however, the script should flip. Harvard has home-field advantage, and the Crusaders have been scuffling in the Patriot League, which is not super competitive.
Harvard by 3.5
CORNELL AT COLGATE
Turns out Colgate University is named for William Colgate, the founder of a soap company that is now one of the largest worldwide brands. I probably should’ve known that (or at least guessed it) since I’ve been writing these for three years now, but give me a break.
I personally prefer Crest myself, but that doesn’t mean I’m picking against Colgate this weekend. It currently sits first in the Patriot League, and it is far and away the best team in a conference in which the other six teams have a combined 6-27 overall record.
Colgate’s football team is nicknamed the Raiders, and as we all know, Jon Gruden’s Oakland Raiders are having a rough start to this season after trading away elite pass rusher Khalil Mack. However, this Raiders team is not having any issues on the defensive end. Colgate boasts a 5-0 record — including two shutouts — and has only given up 23(!) points all season, six in its last four contests.
This hardly sounds like a marquee matchup, but this game should actually be very entertaining. And Cornell is a team that can always pull off a surprise, as Harvard fans surely know by now. I’ll pick Colgate to wash away the Big Red in the end, though.
Colgate by 6.5
COLUMBIA AT PENN
The Philadelphia Flyers recently introduced a new mascot. Called “Gritty,” the orange monstrosity boasts an appearance eerily similar to that of the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Justin Turner.
It’s tough to draw parallels between centuries-old Ivy League academic institutions and the concept of grit, but each school’s football team would certainly like to dispel this notion. On that note, let’s power rank the grittiest Ivy League schools:
8. Princeton: Eating clubs and a fancy name disqualify the Tigers.
7. Harvard: Lost all its grit when the Chick-fil-A in the Science Center was replaced by Greenhouse Cafe, which in turn was replaced by yet another Clover.
6. Columbia: Its field is named after Robert Kraft. I’m a Patriots fan, but not the epitome of grit.
5. Dartmouth: Bridges the gap between gritty, woodsy New Hampshire and hipster New Hampshire, so it feels appropriate that Dartmouth lands pretty much in the middle.
4. Penn: Its press box consists of two rows of bleachers roped off by yellow caution tape. Now that’s grit.
3. Brown: Hard work does not go unnoticed; Brown has had to work the hardest to be taken seriously. Also, the Bears have easily the most minimalist football stadium.
2. Cornell: Closest to the blue-collar city of Buffalo.
1. Yale: This might be a surprising pick at the one spot, but we’re talking about New Haven here. Nothing further.
In terms of this list, Penn edges Columbia, so I’ll pick the Quakers in this weekend’s contest.
Penn by 1
BROWN AT PRINCETON
Well, I guess I learned my lesson.
I staked my reputation to the Bears last week, and how did they repay me? With a 48-0 loss to Rhode Island, of course.
Really, it’s on me —I should’ve seen it coming. I mean the Rams are a ranked team, and Brown is...not. I’ll do better next time (I think).
This week, the Bears match up against an opponent that is a few spots down from URI in the FCS rankings, but this team might just be better. No. 21 Princeton is now tuning up its collective opponents to an average final score of 53.0 to 8.3. Yep, you read that right.
However, if Brown pulls off this upset a week after failing to live up to my prediction, you have my word that I will immediately retire from the football beat and The Crimson as a whole.
Princeton by 60 (seriously)
YALE AT MERCER
The Mercer Bears are like the Brown Bears. Both schools’ athletic teams are called the Bears. And that’s about it actually. Mercer’s football program beats out Brown’s by a wide margin, but I’ll concede color scheme to the Providence, R.I., school. Mercer’s gray and orange mix does not really evoke “Bear” quite like Brown’s emphasis on...brown.
Mercer sits at 3-3 and has won three of its last four contests. Though Yale also sits at .500, it has scuffled out of the gate compared to its bullish preseason projections following an Ivy League title win last season.
Mercer is making a long journey up from Macon, Ga., to New Haven, Conn. I fear that the Bears do not know exactly what they’re dealing with, so I’ll tab the Bulldogs to take this one.
Yale by 3
SACRED HEART AT DARTMOUTH
The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris, otherwise known as Sacré-Cœur, sits perched atop the Butte Montmarte in France’s capital city. Sacré-Cœur seems to tower over the city, as its Byzantine architecture can be seen from all around. The view from the hilltop is equally striking: in “Monument and Myth,” David Harvey claims that in 1872, the Archbishop of Paris exclaimed, “It is here, it is here where the martyrs are, it is here that the Sacred Heart must reign so that it can beckon all to it!”
This Saturday, Sacred Heart will not reign. Dartmouth football is just too good.
The Pioneers have lost to Ivy League opponents in back-to-back weeks, dropping a 43-24 decision at Cornell before hosting Penn and suffering a 31-27 defeat. This week, Sacred Heart returns to the road to face off against a consensus top-two Ancient Eight squad.
The Big Green fell just short of a conference championship last season, and it responded by steamrolling last year’s champion Yale Bulldogs, 41-18, at the Yale Bowl last week. Once this Saturday has passed, Dartmouth may have to repent for its treatment of the Sacred Heart team.
Dartmouth by 21

Recently, new restaurants and businesses have been popping up all over the Square. We’ve seen the friendly breakfast nook Black Sheep Bagel Cafe, but what of its gelato-serving neighbor, Amorino? With its welcoming lights and its distinguishable rose-shaped cones, the dessert spot is hard to pass up. You may have dismissed its menu as too bougie, so we reviewed Amorino ourselves to satisfy your curiosity. But hopefully, you’ll take the leap and make the visit yourself.
Atmosphere: 9/10
When you first walk into Amorino, the first thing you see is a line in front of a bar boasting unique flavors of gelato. Certain hours of the night such as 7 to 8 p.m. tend to be busier than other times, but the wait is worth it. Warm lighting is coupled with a quiet seating area tucked away behind the serving counter. Amorino makes you feel like you’re somewhere special, so it's perfect for cute dates, self-care treat yourself days, or meetups with friends.
Price: 6/10
We get it. One of the greatest factors that deters people from trying Amorino is its overpriced menu. But consider that Amorino is more than just regular ice cream. Yes, you can go to Berryline for cheaper treats, but other ice cream joints such as Ben and Jerry’s actually serve ice cream for around $5, which is roughly equivalent to a small at Amorino’s. Considering that you can request unlimited flavors that are more unique than your average ice cream (Ever heard of Energy Mix or Stracciatella? What? Exactly), the price is worth the experience.
Presentation: 8/10
If you’re still hesitant about visiting Amorino, then at least try it once for their rose cones. The flower-shaped arrangement is undoubtedly the gelato joint’s selling point. Their cones make for a great Instagram post that will make your friends jealous of your new high-class lifestyle — but be quick about snapping a pic, because the petals tend to melt quickly. Why get real flowers for your significant other when they’ll be happier with a sweeter, edible version? Romance is changing, folks.
Taste: 9/10
The rich taste, coupled with the elegant presentation, makes this gelato worth the splurge. Amorino offers a variety of flavors both subtle and fruity, ranging from Tiramisu and Ecuadorian Chocolate to Mango and Coconut. As a personal recommendation from an experienced Amorino venturer, Stracciatella, Inimitable, Hazelnut, Energy Mix, and Pistachio are delectable. Some of the fruity flavors can be a little strong and thick, however, so be wary of mixing them with the creamier and lighter flavors. Oh, and, your order can even come with an adorable macaron wedge!Enough said.
Overall, Amorino deserves a solid 8/10 in our books. If you’re looking for a special night out or want to treat yourself to something different from the usual, make sure to stop by 50 JFK St., right by Boston Tea Stop and Black Sheep Bagel Cafe.
