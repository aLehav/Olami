The last time Rihanna graced fans with her voice on an officially released record was in 2016, on her album “ANTI.” As promises of an album drop in 2019 went unfulfilled, the hope for future music from Rihanna dwindled. Unfulfilled, that is, until Mar. 27, when PARTYNEXTDOOR featured her in “BELIEVE IT” on his new album “PARTYMOBILE.” Rihanna and PARTYNEXTDOOR have worked together before — he wrote “Work” and “Wild Thoughts,” to name a few. Although “BELIEVE IT” is fairly simple compared to their previous collaborations, it is still worth a couple listens. At its core, “BELIEVE IT” is a smooth R&B love song, heralding Rihanna’s return to the airwaves.
The structure of “BELIEVE IT” is undeniably generic — the track is made up of two verses predictably flanked by chorus sections. But despite this simplicity, “BELIEVE IT” is decorated with a host of musical embellishments as would be found in any other R&B song. Modulated vocal samples are interwoven with a fleeting guitar riff to supplement the unwavering beat. The bassline, expectedly, plays a significant role in creating the track’s relaxed, feel-good energy. In a way, the laid-back musical content allows PARTYNEXTDOOR and Rihanna’s voices to acquire a level of saliency in the track.
PARTYNEXTDOOR’s talent as an artist is plainly demonstrated in the way he delivers his verses. He seamlessly transitions between a variety of flows, making it impossible to predict the cadences he will employ in upcoming lines. Rihanna’s feature on the track is almost entirely incorporated in the choruses (“Best make me believe it / Believe you won't deceive me”) with momentary sections of harmony during the verses. She uses the lower portion of her vocal range with the slightest bit of rasp in her delivery, producing a sound that is free of tension.
It’s easy to get lost in a simple record like “BELIEVE IT” — it ends before a listener realizes, begging for another listen. With all the hype surrounding Rihanna’s return to music, this song teases at the prospects of her future projects. PARTYNEXTDOOR knows how to craft R&B with Rihanna’s vocal skills in mind. “BELIEVE IT” is an effective way of hooking listeners and encouraging them to listen to the rest of “PARTYMOBILE.”

5 Seconds of Summer could never have predicted just how pertinent the title of their fourth studio album, “CALM,” would be when it dropped on Mar. 27. Though the title is an acronym of the band’s first names (Calum Hood, Ashton Irwin, Luke Hemmings, and Michael Clifford) created by their dedicated fanbase, the name has taken on new meaning amid the anxiety of Covid-19, when music serves as solace for many. And despite canceled promotional activities, the album has found critical success, rising to number one on the UK charts in the week following its release. With threads of bright, energizing pop, honest lyrics, and sweet, nostalgic melodies, “Calm” brings 5SOS’ online community together and exemplifies real artistic growth by the quartet. The band has come a long way since they opened for the then far more massive One Direction and sang about a girl in American Apparel underwear. Now, One Direction is no longer but 5SOS is going strong. “CALM” comes after the global success of their 2018 album “Youngblood,” where the band proved both their staying power in the music scene and a newfound maturity. They’ve produced this album with more confidence and maturity and have grown as artists, without leaving their past — of Green Day-esque pop rock — behind.
The album transitions beautifully from “Youngblood” via the first song on the album, “Red Desert,” a powerful anthem featuring expanded harmonies in the chorus and verses that show off raw vocals in a “Youngblood”-esque style. A high-energy first half of the album follows, with the teaser singles following “Red Desert” in quick succession. “No Shame” is irresistibly catchy, a charming boy-band pop song with added introspection on lines like “I only light up when cameras are flashing.” The lead single, “Easier,” features tighter and more controlled vocals, and so does the syncopated, grittier “Teeth” and the reflective “Old Me.”
The middle of the album features two standout songs: “Wildflower” and “Best Years.” The last single to be released before the album dropped, “Wildflower” is unlike any other song on the album, featuring soaring vocals and lots of synth encased in ’80s inspired sound. The song is pure fun, delighting in the excitement of a romantic relationship (“Cause I know where tonight is going”) — it is impossible to listen to without smiling. “Wildflower” is followed by “Best Years,” which starts to take the album in a different direction from its lively first half, marking a two part split in the LP. Guitarist Luke Hemmings named it his favorite song on the album in a tweet (alongside a stripped acoustic rendition) ahead of the album release. The lyrics, written by Hemmings alongside big names like Ryan Tedder and the inimitable Benny Blanco, provide tender romance in lines like “You did all these things for me when I was half a man for you / I wanna hold your hand while we’re growing up.”
The second half of the album explores its fair share of angst, in both sound (as in “Lover of Mine”) and lyric (as in “Thin White Lies”). It’s softer, as “Best Years” foreshadows but still maintains moments of energy, as in “Lonely Heart.” “Not In the Same Way” is unfortunately one of the more generic songs on the album, with typical lyrics like “rip my heart out and leave,” but “High” makes everything worth it as the perfect closer. It boasts a simple, sweet melody, “a Beatles-esque song with quirky chords,” as Hemmings described it for Apple Music. Self-reflective and nostalgic with a touch of melancholy, the song’s lyrics feature clever end rhyme, with “I hope you think of me high / I hope you think of me highly,” and “lie / like me” in the chorus. “Da da da”s in the post chorus that often read as filler or lazy songwriting work well in this song to capture a childlike sweetness in the melody. “High” truly brings the album to an end with an air of serenity and calm.
The album showcases the band flexing their creative muscles, and coming across as stronger, more confident musicians who are discovering how to expand their sound and create more honest music. “CALM” is exploratory, demonstrating their continued growth and development as artists, with several standout songs that particularly showcase their strength and continued potential. The band has always pushed back against being called a boy band, and though they exhibit all the charisma and charm to warrant the label, they have proved to be more than a typical boy band in both staying power and talent.

Overtly vulgar and salacious, “Dolemite Is My Name” is an unabashed celebration of the spirit and life of 1970s blaxploitation-era film icon Rudy Ray Moore (Eddie Murphy). The film chronicles Moore’s unlikely rise from penniless recording artist to Hollywood star through his hilariously absurd alter-ego — the one and only wig wearing, pimp cane swinging, kung fu fighting Dolemite.
From its opening scene onward, the film is alive with the spunk and spirit of ‘70s style. Moore lives in the bustling streets of Los Angeles, amid its characteristic urban sprawl of clubs, liquor stores, adult theaters, and drive-ins. As a humble shop clerk at a vinyl records shop — one who has been turned down repeatedly as a recording artist — Moore’s aspirations of becoming a Hollywood star had begun to wither. That is, until he has a fateful encounter with street bum Ricco (Ron Cephas Jones), who tells him stories of “ghetto folklore” — including the legend of Dolemite. Inspired by what he hears, Moore believes he has found his opportunity, and decides to present himself as a “ghetto-pimp” badass of his own design. Afro? Check. Paisley suits? Check. Topped off with a pimp-cane and overstated saunter, Moore prepares himself to present “Dolemite” to the world.
In a beautifully shot sequence akin to a superhero “donning the mask,” Moore completes his transformation in his next appearance at a local comedy club. With a spotlight shining from above and a low camera angle, Moore appears at the podium like a giant, looming over the frame. It is in this moment that viewers understand he is no longer Moore: He is Dolemite, in the flesh. In response to this arrival, the rhythm of the scene changes — cutting more frequently, and panning across the crowd as Moore begins to speak. Slowly, the crowd at the bar begins to thaw and sway to Dolemite’s rhythm, finally receptive to Moore’s comedic voice.
The film recreates the conception of the iconic 1975 “Dolemite” film in a glittery audio-visual spectacle. The vibrant period costuming, set design and musical selection of “Dolemite Is My Name” pays homage to the spunky style and feel of the original film. On their way to a meeting with a film agency, Dolemite and company saunter through the frame with ‘70s peacock fashion sensibilities on full display. Fur collared midi-coats and pinstripe pant legs billow behind them as they walk in slow-motion, lockstep to the tune of Bomar’s funk-inspired “Dolemite” theme. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, costume designer Ruth E. Carter described how the diversity of fashion trends displayed in the film grant a dimension of realism to each character: “If you broaden the trends with more nuance, they won’t appear like caricatures,” she said.
Despite the titular character's spotlight-stealing flair, the “Dolemite” experience would be incomplete without Moore’s committed production team — an all-star supporting cast including Keegan Michael Key as screenwriter Jerry Jones, Wesley Snipes as director D’Urville Martin and Da’Vine Joy Randolph as actress Lady Reed. While the entire cast shares fabulous chemistry, the interplay between Wesley Snipes and Eddie Murphy, in particular, is comedic gold. Nowhere is this more apparent than their physical theatricality in the final scenes of Moore’s “Dolemite” film. Viewers have the distinct privilege of watching a bloodied Murphy scream like Bruce Lee in “Enter the Dragon,” as he gut-punches and rips the entrails from a wide-eyed Wesley Snipes, who in turn blinks and groans hysterically before flopping about in his “death throes” like a fish out of water. This outlandish scene ends up sharing the same energy as the “finish him” sequence in a Mortal Kombat videogame.
In contrast, Murphy's portrayal of Moore is far more grounded and vulnerable than his badass pimping alter-ego. In one scene, having sold his apartment, car, and records due to a financial crunch, Moore finds himself staring into the mirror in a moment of introspection. Gritting his teeth and reciting his lines, Murphy exudes a certain underdog charisma that bleeds through the screen. “Whatever it takes, I’m ready to do it,” he says. “I gotta be totally outrageous!”
At the film's conclusion, standing before the manifestation of his success at the premiere of his film “Dolemite”, Moore passes on his underdog creed to a young boy waiting outside the theater. Moore hands the boy his golden Dolemite cane, telling him, “Never let nobody tell you you can’t be anything you want to be." In this resolution, “Dolemite Is My Name” communicates a surprisingly earnest take on the value of self-belief and sacrifice. As the boy looks up at his hero, viewers see in his eyes the continuation of Moore’s legacy — the audacity to make a name for himself in the bright lights of the city, with nothing but swagger and a dream.

What does Tolstoy’s 19th-century novel about the intricacies of Russian aristocracy and the meaning of love have to do with filthy rich Korean-American teenagers living in New York City’s Upper East Side? Jenny Lee’s “Anna K.” undertakes the ambitious project of translating one of literature’s greatest works into a young adult novel, exploring the intricacies of private-school royalty in the age of social media and scandal in the process. “Anna K.” follows the first half of its source material without deviation, making it an accessible introduction to the Russian classic for young readers. But the premise also creates limitations — and when Lee decides to reform the narrative, the novel starts to feel more like a CW teen soap-opera.
Lee’s narrative begins just as Tolstoy’s does, though instead of couple Stiva and Dolly fighting over infidelity, teenagers Lolly and Steven squabble over Steven's playboy tendencies following the discovery of another girl’s lewd text messages on his Apple Watch. The introduction of characters follows the classic novel perfectly, with every major plot point and event until Part 5 reframed through the lens of the modern world.
When Anna K. arrives in New York City to calm her brother’s girlfriend, Lee further reveals the extent of her adaptation. Her characters may be part of a ridiculously tradition-bound upper class society, but they are still teenagers, not married aristocrats, and their emotions are easily dismissed as superficial, hormonal ramblings. Lee’s construction of this insanely wealthy group of socialites, however, make their drama just as addicting as a Daily Mail gossip column.
Take, for example, Lee’s reworking of Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, the wealthy statesman and Anna’s husband in the original text. He becomes Alexander W., Anna K.’s perfect, dedicated boyfriend who supports her all the way from Harvard, where he strives towards even greater perfection. While a college-high school relationship is much less binding than an aristocratic marriage, the reputation-based society Lee creates allows her characters to explore the same questions of love and fidelity that Tolstoy’s did.
Anna K. is thrown into familiar turmoil as she begins to reflect on her “perfect” relationship, scolding herself for being bored but despising herself even more as she struggles with her feelings for Vronsky — Anna’s lover in the original. While the stakes may not be as high, Lee proves that these greater questions are universal, effectively framing them within trivial circumstances.
While some of the Russian aristocracy’s absurdity is well-preserved in Lee’s retelling, her contemporary setting lends itself to its own humor and pitfalls. Count Vronsky earns the title “Count” not from his heritage, but from the Manhattan society joke that upon entering a room, he could hardly “count” the number of “it” girls he’d slept with. The intensity of Anna’s infidelity is both magnified and lessened, as her public display of affection towards Vronsky manifests in grinding at a rave and messaging over Words with Friends. There is humor in the framework of the story itself, with an extreme “Gossip Girl” or “Crazy Rich Asians” feel evoked by the number of luxury brands and celebrity name-dropping.
Lee’s premise falls short, however, in its ending. Throughout the book, “Anna K.” manages to follow Tolstoy’s original novel well, from Vronsky’s horse-riding accident to Dustin (Levin) and Kimmie’s (Kitty) romance. However, given the logical limitations as well as the length of the YA-novel, Lee creates her own ending to the story, one completely diverged from the original. After following the original narrative so closely, Lee’s ending feels wrong and rushed, even if it is the only logical conclusion for the novel.
Further, there is no way for Lee to progress into Tolstoy’s discussions around parental happiness and marital strife, so her novel simply ends with teenage bliss. It feels odd to end one of the greatest epics of first love with something so trivial, but Lee is writing a young adult novel under certain parameters, so it is difficult to fault her too much.
Much of the fun in reading this novel comes from spotting the references, events, and thematic discussions of Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina,” and enjoying the playful framework and ridiculous circumstances of the Greenwich and Manhattan elite. Lee’s work serves as an easy-to-read adaptation that will hopefully push its younger readers to take on the source material. Yet there’s always the wonder about what would have happened if Lee had continued adapting the original story, preserving the original fate of Anna K.

Working on the frontlines as a doctor in Massachusetts has been an exercise in courage and maintaining hope in the face of tragedy.
Currently, the United States is home to over 500,000 coronavirus cases, representing around 30 percent of the global disease burden. Over 20,000 deaths in America have been attributed to the virus. In Massachusetts, over 25,000 individuals, including hundreds of frontline providers, have tested positive for COVID-19. At our own community hospital, the intensive care unit has had to more than double its capacity to meet the demand for ventilators.
In addition to its emotional and physical toll, the pandemic has revealed the shortcomings of our healthcare system. Before the crisis began, nearly 30 million Americans lived without medical insurance. The Department of Labor now reports a record 6.6 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Experts anticipate that these numbers will add to the swelling ranks of uninsured individuals who in this moment of crisis must choose between financial security and essential care.
Meanwhile, hospitals are straining under the influx of patients. Despite efforts to reduce consumption of supplies by reallocating providers and canceling elective surgeries, demand continues to rise. Currently, the unit cost for surgical masks stands at nearly ten times pre-crisis levels. The federal government’s delay in invoking the Defense Production Act has also led to bidding wars between the Federal Emergency Management Agency and local entities, further driving up prices and delaying the arrival of essential supplies. Newly announced customs policies in China, which produces 116 million masks and respirators per day, threaten to further delay the availability of critical gear at hospitals around the world struggling to cope with the pandemic.
However, we cannot run out of hope.
From the moment the pandemic announced itself in the U.S., the crisis has been outmatched only by the solidarity shown by everyday Americans, from physicians and nurses to custodial staff and entrepreneurs. Crowdfunding efforts to provide hospitals with masks have been active across the country on websites like GoFundMe. At our own hospital, anonymous individuals have been phoning in donations and dropping off spare masks from local laboratories and other workplaces in Cambridge and Boston. Harvard alumni — like Vivian Kao who founded the organization M.A.D. Masks — have shipped thousands of N95 respirators from abroad to protect frontline workers at Cambridge Health Alliance and other hospitals.
The crisis has also sparked a wealth of innovation. Groups like Formlabs are 3D printing test kits, ventilator parts, and face shields. Coronavirus tests once required a five-day wait, but now results are available in just five minutes thanks to point-of-care advancements by Abbott Labs. Companies like L’Oréal, Bacardi, and Anheuser-Busch have redesigned manufacturing lines to produce hand sanitizer to support hospitals and protect healthcare workers. Following changes in Medicare policies to encourage telehealth services, doctors are now hosting virtual appointments and lowering the barriers to accessing medical care. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Nebraska and Duke University have pioneered the use of ultraviolet light and vaporized hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate N95 masks for reuse. Those researchers have openly shared their protocols, which are now being adopted across the country.
Most importantly, reports indicate that the spread of coronavirus is slowing in parts of the world. In New Rochelle, New York, once an epicenter of the outbreak, rates of new cases have declined. New diagnoses and deaths in Italy have also slowed. Though it is still early in the pandemic, these victories offer evidence that drastic containment efforts can flatten the curve.
These stories of solidarity, innovation, and progress give us reason to hope. In the hospital, hope has become our most essential resource. It’s the difference between making it through to the end of a shift and wanting to give up halfway. It’s what spurs us to arrive early and leave late, to put the health of our patients above our own. And it’s what gives us all the resilience to persevere regardless of what the statistics say.
This hope should not be mistaken for blind faith, misplaced judgment, or woeful ignorance. Rather, it’s an inner belief that despite the obstacles ahead, better times await — that through courage, patience, and strength, we will triumph and our sacrifices will not be in vain.
Every generation is faced with a defining moment. This is ours. In the process, we might run out of masks, but we can’t run out of hope.

A month has passed since I stayed behind with a few hundred students after campus’s official closure. During the first few weeks of quarantine, I was restless. I FaceTimed friends constantly, went for long runs, and binge-watched all the shows I’ve never had time for. But recently, I lost all my motivation. I had no energy to call friends and family through a screen or tune in to live Zoom classes. I would take long naps and scroll endlessly through Instagram and Facebook feeds. My day doesn't really get going until 5 p.m. Somehow, time both slips away and passes excruciatingly slowly. There seems to be a distinct quarantine fatigue that comes from being alone inside all day.
Adjusting to this isolation and exhaustion is not easy. Even so, every time I reflect on my quarantine situation, I would compare my circumstances to others and tell myself over and over again that I have no right to be sad or unproductive. “I should not feel sad when there are people who are sick. I should not feel unproductive when there are people who don’t have access to the resources I have.” I see this mindset of comparison in many others who are going through this experience and it is not only limiting but also decreases our empathy for others.
The coronavirus epidemic has brought us collective grief in different forms. David Kessler, the foremost expert on grief, explains that we are collectively grieving the loss of normalcy, connections, and plans for the future. “We’re feeling a number of different griefs,” he says, “We feel the world has changed, and it has. We know this is temporary, but it doesn’t feel that way, and we realize things will be different.” However, despite the fact that we are going through it together, we still compare the grief we are feeling to that of others. For a college student who has lost their graduation and the last two months of what was supposed to have been the best time of their college experience, their grief is “less” compared to the grief of people who are sick. For people who have been working hard on a project, a performance, an event for weeks, months, and years and lost the chance to see it come to fruition, their grief is “less” than the grief of people who lost their job.
By comparing one person’s grief to another’s, we are creating a sort of suffering Olympics. The suffering Olympics ranks everyone’s level of suffering and decides based on the ranking who has a right to express their feelings and who does not.
The worst side effect of this Olympics is that it diminishes the empathy we have for others. Brené Brown, University of Houston professor known for her research on courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy, explains in her podcast that when we deny our emotions, they double down and grow, inviting shame for feeling a certain way when other people have it worse. Brene says, “The exhausted doctor in the ER in New York does not benefit more if you conserve your kindness only for her and withhold it from yourself or from your coworker who lost their job. The surest way to ensure that you have a reserve of compassion and empathy for others is to attend to your own feelings.” We have to put on our own emotional oxygen mask first before assisting others. It’s not a zero-sum game; letting ourselves feel in the first place will allow us to have more love and empathy to share with others.
It is still important, however, that we feel grateful for the positive situations in our lives even now. Gratitude can coexist with a bit of sadness and grief. A college student can feel grateful that they have a safe home to return to, yet simultaneously feel sad for the lost two months of independence and memories with their friends. A parent can be grateful for the health of their children, yet feel overwhelmed with the noise and chaos of the whole family being home.
Feeling sad does not mean we are ingrates; it just means we are complex humans capable of having different emotions and thoughts at the same time.
All of this is unprecedented, including the stress and the quarantine fatigue. Although it sounds effortless to stay inside with all this free time, lack of outside stimuli and a feeling of entrapment can be taxing. It is more important than ever for us to be kind to ourselves and spend even a few minutes allowing ourselves to accept the sadness, fear, and anxiety of the moment instead of numbing or trying to distract ourselves. These personal emotions should not be subject to the suffering Olympics. They must be embraced. By allowing ourselves to feel, we open the door for others to do the same, ultimately infusing empathy and love into our grieving world.

Harvard Summer School will hold its 2020 session online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Summer School Dean Sandra A. Naddaff ’75 announced to registered students in an email Monday afternoon.
The announcement follows a Monday email from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to the undergraduates, which informed students of a shift to online programming for the summer. Students across the University transitioned to online courses for the spring term in mid-March.
The summer school hosts roughly 9,000 students every summer on Harvard’s campus for courses at both the collegiate and high school level. It also oversees Harvard’s undergraduate study abroad programs, which the University cancelled in late March due to pandemic-induced travel uncertainty.
Naddaff wrote that while on-campus programming will not occur, the program remains committed to providing students a “rigorous and enriching academic experience.” Much like the rest of the University, the summer school will hold courses and meetings over the Zoom video conferencing platform.
Citing variances in students’ ability to participate in courses based on time zone differences, as well as the change in course format, Naddaff wrote the summer school is offering students full-tuition refunds provided they meet the proper deadlines.
However, the new digital programming’s accessibility may actually increase enrollment at the Summer School, according to DCE spokesperson Harry J. Pierre. In an emailed statement, he wrote that the Summer School currently expects “an uptick in enrollment due to the move online, but it’s too early to speculate on exact numbers just yet.”
The Summer School’s online courses usually do not count for credit for students at the College, but this year, the University will make exceptions to that rule. The Summer School published a page on its website late Monday afternoon with a list of courses now eligible for College credit.
Some College students also participate in the summer school as proctors, a role which Bilal Wurie ’21 — a previous Summer School proctor — described as the “first point of contact from which [students] can find broader support networks.”
Wurie, who had originally planned on returning to the summer school as a proctor this year, expressed concern over the new online format’s ability to connect summer school students outside of the classroom.
“A big part of the experience beyond simply going in and taking classes was meeting people and interacting with people from all over the world,” said Wurie. “I think that that degree of personal interaction will be lost, or — if it will be maintained over Zoom — in a slightly smaller degree.”
However, Wurie said the efforts and adjustments would be worthwhile to stave the effects of the current pandemic.
“I hope that decisions made on administrative and governmental levels are done in a calculated, compassionate kind of manner, and we can all just collectively get through this crisis as quickly as possible,” said Wurie.

The Cambridge Public Health Department will make an aggregate count of all confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the city available online, including Cambridge residents living in nursing homes, the city announced Tuesday.
CPHD will provide a breakdown on the city’s website between cases that have occurred in a nursing home and those in the wider city. Previously, Cambridge reported these two counts separately.
In addition, Cambridge nursing facility workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 will not be included in counts unless CPHD can confirm that they are residents of the city.
These measures come off the heels of a city project piloted last week by the Broad Institute, which focused on rapidly testing those who live and work in Cambridge’s seven nursing homes.
“This rapid testing program has the potential to protect Cambridge residents living in our nursing homes and effectively and efficiently determine positive cases,” Cambridge Commissioner of Public Health Assaad J. Sayah said in an April 10 press release.
Experts have identified senior care centers as particularly vulnerable to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, both providing conditions for spreading the disease rapidly and housing populations with high mortality risk. The virus has infected swaths of nursing centers’ staff and members globally.
As of April 13, the Broad Institute’s testing revealed that 203 staff members and institutional residents of Cambridge’s nursing homes have tested positive. On the same day, the CPHD announced six more deaths in the city. All six were nursing home affiliates.
"I am deeply saddened to report these deaths, and extend my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of these individuals," Claude A. Jacob, director of the CPHD, said in a Monday press release.
The first death in Cambridge due to COVID-19 complications was announced by the city on March 29.
Jacob said he hopes that by continuing “surveillance testing” in senior care centers, the city "can rapidly identify positive cases and break the chain of transmission in these facilities."
CPHD does not currently know how many facility residents tested positive, were hospitalized, or are experiencing severe symptoms. The department will not provide a breakdown of the 203 cases by nursing home.
As of April 14, there are 438 aggregate cases in Cambridge. 39 percent of cases are related to Cambridge nursing homes.
The Broad Institute will conduct a second round of testing in nursing homes at the end of this week, according to a city announcement.

Researchers at Harvard and the University of Bonn published a study April 7 casting possible doubt upon the longstanding assumption that the universe is isotropic.
Isotropy is the principle that the universe has the same structure and is growing evenly in all directions; it forms the basis for many theories regarding the properties of the universe.
Gerrit Schellenberger, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and co-author of the study, wrote in an email that his team’s work focused on attempting to verify this principle using new technologies.
“We always have to keep in mind what fundamental assumptions we rely on in cosmology,” Schellenberger wrote. “New observatories, methods and discoveries are a good moment to take a step back and perform tests to ensure whether we can still safely rely on these assumptions.”
The study compared direct measurements of the luminosity of galaxy clusters to calculations of their luminosity from the clusters’ gas temperatures. The luminosity of a cluster is linked to how far away the cluster is.
Schellenberger wrote that inconsistencies in the two different measurements of luminosity suggest possible anti-isotropic behaviors — though interference by other materials in the universe may also have provided incorrect distance and luminosity calculations.
“For a specific region in the sky, clusters seem to have on average a higher luminosity than predicted from their temperature, and for another region a lower one,” Schellenberger wrote. “The discrepancy cannot be explained by statistical fluctuation. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that toward those two regions the universe expands differently than with respect to the average cosmic expansion across the sky.”
Konstantinos Migkas, a researcher at the Argelander Institute for Astronomy and another co-author of the study, said in a press release that disproving isotropy could lead to new discoveries about dark energy, a mysterious phenomenon known to accelerate the expansion of the universe.
"If we succeed in developing such a theory, it could greatly accelerate the search for the exact nature of this form of energy," Migkas said.
Schellenberger wrote that expounding upon this study to discover new information about dark energy would lend scientists an increased overall understanding of the properties of the universe.
“If we can confirm this finding with further studies, and also exclude all other explanations, this would have a big impact on our understanding of the universe,” Schellenberger wrote. “Dark energy was established as the driving force for the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, we still have little knowledge about the nature of this form of energy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 200 Cambridge residents — including Harvard and MIT affiliates — signed an online petition urging the two universities to house unsheltered residents and commit more resources to the city’s pandemic response efforts.
The petition, written by City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, states that Harvard and MIT’s $250,000 donations to the construction of an emergency shelter for homeless people are insufficient. The two universities, he argued, are attempting to “get away” with “doing only the bare minimum.”
“They love to talk about being strong community partners when it benefits them during more prosperous times, but in the middle of a global pandemic they are totally letting us down,” the petition reads.
“These funds are not nearly enough, and what is much more critically needed is physical space to provide safe housing for everyone who needs to be physically isolated, including all community members currently experiencing homelessness,” it reads. “Anything less is unconscionable and morally unjust.”
The City of Cambridge announced on Tuesday that the War Memorial Recreation Center would open as an emergency shelter for homeless residents, with a capacity of more than a hundred beds.
The request in Zondervan’s petition echoes that of another petition published by Harvard Divinity School student Christopher J. Diak in mid-March and signed by 1,500 individuals, which called on Harvard to house Cambridge’s homeless population in campus facilities.
In addition to the demands related to housing, Zondervan’s petition calls on both Harvard and MIT to donate at least $5 million each to a city disaster relief fund, as well as to devote the universities’ infrastructure to “vaccine development, antiviral drugs and other pandemic response tools.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment Tuesday about Zondervan’s petition. He wrote in a previous statement that Harvard was in conversation with state and municipal governments about providing aid in response to the pandemic.
MIT spokesperson Sarah E. Gallop said there is “no playbook” for responding to a global pandemic and that the university “has tried everything” to provide support for Cambridge.
“The things we’ve been responding to is what the city has been asking for,” Gallop noted.
Neal Chaudhuri, a case manager at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, said he believes the state needs as many sites as possible to house individuals experiencing homelessness, other than shelters.
“This is the time to use unoccupied spaces such as student dorms and hotels and all kinds of spaces to be opened up for this explicit purpose in the name of public health, in the name of trying to keep as many people alive as possible,” he said.
Chaudhuri added that opening dorms and hotel rooms to unhoused residents would specifically benefit people preemptively released from jail and prison due to the coronavirus.
“It's really important for all people who are eligible under the Supreme Judicial Court decision to get them to a safe home plan which could be these alternative housing sites like dorms and hotels,” he said.
Local homeless shelters, including the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y youth homeless shelter, have struggled to navigate the additional costs and health protocols imposed by the coronavirus, and some have closed their doors for the season.
In response to the financial damage wrought by the pandemic, University leaders announced Monday they would freeze hiring, reduce discretionary spending, and cut top administrators’ salaries, leaving the door open to possible layoffs and furloughs in the future.
In a Tuesday interview, Zondervan, an MIT alum, said he circulated the petition to address what he believes are unsafe health conditions for people staying at the emergency shelter. He said it was “absolutely astonishing” and “unacceptable” that the city’s makeshift shelter would allow people not showing symptoms of the virus to enter without testing, increasing the risk of exposure.
“We’re not asking anything of our university partners that they cannot give,” Zondervan said of the petition. “This is really a request — a plea for help — that says, ‘Our community is hurting. We need you to give us everything that you can.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard Law School clinics are shifting their focus to provide legal aid to vulnerable populations affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Legal clinics offer students the opportunity to gain practical experience and provide pro bono aid to real clients. The Law School currently offers 46 clinics and student practice organizations covering more than 30 areas of law.
Sabrineh Ardalan — director of the Immigration and Refugee Clinic — said the group is currently advocating for the release of its clients from densely populated detention centers where detainees are unable to practice social distancing.
“We've been doing policy advocacy to try to get Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release immigrant detainees from detention centers locally and nationally,” she said. “We've also been doing advocacy to try to get Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt immigration enforcement actions.”
Ardalan noted the clinic’s team at Greater Boston Legal Services successfully secured the release of one of its clients from a New Hampshire detention center Friday.
The clinic also continues to serve its clients who are not detained by connecting them to health services and financial assistance.
“Our social worker, Liala Buoniconti, has been busy with a lot of clients to try to connect them to unemployment insurance — to try to connect them to funds for undocumented workers,” Ardalan said.
Emily M. Broad Leib, who directs the Food Law and Policy Clinic, said the group is finding ways to aid food producers and farmers unable to sell their food to restaurants, universities, and other large buyers.
“Some of our work has been really looking at what are the ways that we can try to send funding to them to kind of purchase this food they produce and also make sure that it doesn't get wasted,” she said.
Broad Leib also said the pandemic has drastically increased the number of people facing food insecurity due to unemployment and reduced income, and that students at the clinic hope to find ways to address this growing problem.
“We've been doing a lot of work thinking about how can we get more money into the emergency food system and also about how we can get more opportunities for that food to be delivered to people in their home,” Broad Leib said.
The Law School’s Federal Tax Clinic also continues to serve its clients, but partial IRS closings limit its ability to operate, according to the clinic’s director, T. Keith Fogg. Still, students at the clinic are working to help those who need to obtain their tax rebates but cannot fulfill the necessary filing requirements on their own.
“The clinic has engaged in advocacy, to the extent allowed, to encourage the IRS to create rules that do not require individuals to file tax returns in order to obtain the rebate if they are otherwise identifiable by the IRS through Social Security or VA records,” Fogg wrote in an emailed statement Monday.
Fogg wrote stipulations attached to the clinic’s federal grant restricted its ability to help people prepare their current year tax returns or file other information needed to receive tax rebates. The Federal Tax Clinic can only represent taxpayers who have a “controversy,” or ongoing dispute, with the IRS.
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites typically provide current year return assistance, but many of these sites are closed due to the pandemic or require in-person meetings with the taxpayer.
“The people who need help because of the pandemic don’t need controversy assistance,” Fogg wrote. “If the grant administrators change their interpretation of the statute and if we can find students to assist us, we will expand our efforts to assist people with current filing requirements in order to obtain the rebate and to otherwise assist in filling the gap left by the closure of the VITA sites.”
The Low Income Taxpayer Clinic Program announced Tuesday it would allow temporary exemptions to the grant’s requirements due to the pandemic. Fogg said the clinic will now be able to more freely provide needed tax assistance.
Broad Leib said she applauds the extra work students in clinical programs are taking on through their efforts to help during the pandemic.
“A lot of them have just gone way above their workload hours to do this extra research,” she said. “We really rely on the kind of brainpower and research skills and creativity of the students that are really digging into these issues and helping us come up with solutions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the novel coronavirus spreads, conspiracy theories about its origin have spread with it — including those falsely alleging that the virus was made and sold by Harvard Chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber.
Posts falsely claiming that Lieber was arrested for creating and selling the novel coronavirus have been shared more than 79,000 times on Facebook as of April 7, according to Reuters. Thousands of posts on Twitter and several YouTube videos have made similarly baseless claims connecting Lieber with the creation of the virus.
In fact, Lieber was arrested in January for allegedly concealing Chinese funding and lying to federal agents. While he reportedly participated in Chinese government research programs in Wuhan — the same city where the novel coronavirus originated — there is no evidence to suggest that Lieber, a nanoscientist, engineered a biological agent, nor did the federal government press charges against him related to the coronavirus.
Lieber, who is currently on paid administrative leave, did not respond to a request for comment.
A growing body of scientific evidence suggests the novel coronavirus originated in nature, without data to the contrary.
A coalition of over 25 public health scientists and medical professionals signed a letter in the medical journal The Lancet to “strongly condemn” theories suggesting the virus was artificially constructed.
“Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,” they wrote. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”
Scripps Research — a renowned American medical research facility — wrote in a press release that analyses of the virus’s genome show it evolved in nature. The release cited evidence showing the backbone of the novel coronavirus does not mirror those of any known coronaviruses, but rather those of viruses found in bats and pangolins.
“If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness,” the press release notes.
Another study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature found that the virus’s genome is 96 percent identical to a bat coronavirus, concluding the novel coronavirus likely originated in bats.
Despite the scientific consensus, conspiracy theories regarding the virus’s origin have continued to proliferate online.
Experts said a variety of factors may have contributed to the popularity of these rumors: small kernels of truth, the uncertainty and fear created by the pandemic, and the peddling of the similar theories by political and media elites.
Fenwick McKelvey, an associate professor of communication studies at Concordia University in Canada, said coincidences like Lieber’s connection to Wuhan can raise people’s suspicions.
“In many ways you can think of a conspiracy theory as something that’s attractive and desirable because it’s offering a coherent explanation of the world and giving you meaning where there is none,” McKelvey said. “Finding these links could be helpful and allow people to manage at a time of great stress and uncertainty.”
Brian Levin — a professor of criminal justice at California State University, San Bernardino and director of the university’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism — said the unsettling nature of the pandemic lends itself to conspiracy.

“Whenever you see a catalytic event, you’ll see an array of unusual theories and sometimes extremism or propaganda around it too,” he said.
Levin added that while some people promote conspiracy theories to find a scapegoat or out of bigotry, others simply believe they are true without malintent.
“With this, there were enough kernels of truth that the lies between the gaps seem not as wide on the Internet as they do in reality,” he said.
Lawrence Rosenthal, chair of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies, also said conspiracy theories are often attempts to find someone to blame for complex situations.
He added that such theories are an attempt to use stories, rather than facts, to understand an emotional situation.
“This is a wholly different way of going about explaining things, or coming to terms with things, than trying to use empirical facts,” he said. “It’s closer at once to an explanation and a vehicle to express emotion.”
Joshua Hart, an associate professor of psychology at Union College who has studied what leads people to believe in conspiracy theories, said President Donald Trump’s dislike of China has fueled the theory by making it a partisan matter.
“The allure of a conspiracy theory is that it points to a kind of tractable source or culprit for the problem so that you can wrap your head around the idea of identifying the perpetrators and stopping them,” Hart said.
Hart cited a sense of powerlessness Americans felt after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. After the attacks, he said the false suggestion that they may have been an “inside job” was comforting to some because it meant Americans could “police ourselves,” while what happened in terrorist training camps abroad could not be controlled.
In addition to the anxiety created by the pandemic, the buy-in of some prominent political and media personalities has elevated these theories, according to University of Miami Associate Professor of Political Science Joseph E. Uscinski, who specializes in the study of conspiracy theories.
“Every pandemic winds up with conspiracy theories, whether it was the Ebola outbreak of six years ago or SARS or AIDS, there’s conspiracy theories about pretty much everything,” Uscinski said. “But because of how big and acute this one is, combined with the fact that many of our political and media elites are trafficking in these theories has made them a little more popular than some previous similar theories have been.”
Uscinski cited a claim made by U.S. Senator Thomas B. “Tom” Cotton ’99 (R-Ark.) on FOX News in February that the virus could have been manufactured in a Wuhan lab, as well as claims by Trump and radio host Rush H. Limbaugh that the effects of the virus are being exaggerated.
“When we poll on this, we find that Republicans are more likely to believe in some of these theories than Democrats, and it’s likely because Republican leaders and conservative media personalities are pushing these theories,” Uscinski said.
Uscinski added that although many modern conspiracy theories — including those connecting Lieber to the virus — do spread through social media, his research has not found evidence that more people believe in theories today than before the internet.
“In this country’s history, you didn’t need an internet for, you know, witch trials and red scares and Freemason freak-outs and Illuminati scares,” he said. “You don’t need the new communication technologies for these things to spread on their own.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Monday that Harvard has formed a committee to plan for an online graduation ceremony and begun to develop arrangements for its postponed 369th Commencement Exercises.
After heeding advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as its own faculty, Harvard announced on March 20 that it would indefinitely postpone its 369th Commencement Exercises.
Thousands of family members, faculty, and alumni normally travel from around the world to Harvard Yard to participate in the traditional Commencement Exercises, which Bacow wrote in his announcement are “almost as old as the University itself.” The exercises include graduates of Harvard’s 12 schools. Washington Post executive editor Martin “Marty” Baron was scheduled to speak this year.
“No virtual gathering can possibly match the splendor of our usual festivities, but we will come together online on Thursday, May 28, to award degrees so that everyone will graduate as expected,” he wrote at the time. “Each School at Harvard will also host its own special online event and afterwards deliver diplomas through the mail.”
Since the decision, administrators put together a committee to oversee the planning and logistics of the initial online ceremony. Bacow said the University is working celebrating the Class of 2020 in a “joyous” way.
Since the school’s first commencement in 1642, Harvard’s commencement exercises have been canceled roughly nine times due to “wars and plagues,” according to the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
For now, Bacow said the Class of 2020 should expect to receive their diplomas by mail.
“People will want the physical diploma, which they are entitled to and should receive,” he said.
During traditional commencement exercises, alumni also return to campus for class-wide reunions. Bacow said the May 28 virtual ceremony is aimed at conferring degrees and that the Harvard Alumni Association is doing its own planning for the annual reunions.
Bacow said the University has not yet selected a date for the postponed in-person celebration.
“We can’t have an in-person celebration until we can have people back on campus,” he said. “We’re waiting to see when that will be possible.”
Bacow added that Harvard would consider holding the postponed in-person celebration in conjunction with the Class of 2021's commencement.
“It’s possible,” Bacow said. “But we’ll have to see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University will receive nearly $9 million in aid from the federal government through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the Department of Education announced last week.
The CARES Act — the largest economic stimulus package in American history — was signed into law on March 27. It allocates nearly $14 billion to support higher education institutions during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Of the $8,655,748 Harvard is slated to receive, the government has mandated that at least half — $4,327,874 — be reserved for emergency financial aid grants to students.
The Department of Education will distribute the first $6.28 billion to colleges and universities to cover expenses such as course materials, technology, food, and housing students have incurred “related to disruptions in their education due to the COVID-19 outbreak,” according to a April 9 press release.
The Department of Education is requiring universities to sign a certification agreeing to the conditions of use before they can access the funding, but each school may allocate the financial aid funds at their own discretion.
The Department of Education allocated most of the $14 billion in funds based on two factors: the share of recipients of federal Pell Grants, and overall undergraduate and graduate enrollment numbers. It weighted the proportion of Pell Grant recipients as a factor at 75 percent, while enrollment was weighted at 25 percent.
As a result, the top 20 colleges which received the most funding are all public colleges and universities with enrollments in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Arizona State University received the largest relief package of any institution in the nation, netting more than $63 million.
Harvard’s aid package is the third-largest of the Ivy League universities’. Columbia University and Cornell University will receive the largest awards, at $12.8 million each. Yale University will receive nearly $7 million, and Princeton University will net around $2.5 million.
In an April 9 letter to college and university presidents, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos encouraged administrators to set a maximum amount for individual student aid grants.
“I would like to encourage the leadership of each institution to prioritize your students with the greatest need, but at the same time consider establishing a maximum funding threshold for each student to ensure that these funds are distributed as widely as possible,” DeVos wrote.
DaVos also wrote that the Department of Education is “working expeditiously to allocate the remaining funding that is reserved for institutional use.”
In addition to aid to colleges and universities, the CARES Act included student loan relief and other provisions aimed at alleviating students’ financial hardship.
Experts say that Harvard will likely continue to face “grave” financial consequences as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
University administrators announced salary and hiring freezes, discretionary spending reductions, leadership salary cuts, and the potential deferral of capital projects in an email to Harvard affiliates Monday.
The University will also sell $1.1 billion in bonds, according to a report last week from Moody’s Investors Service.
Its flagship faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, has already netted $30 million in expenses and lost revenue due to the pandemic, leaving it unable to cover its yearly budget, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced last week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, heavyweight rower Clark Dean had traded in his sophomore year for the chance of a lifetime: the opportunity to row at the Tokyo Olympics.
Prior to making this decision, Dean had plenty of highlights since he started taking the sport seriously in the eighth grade. He won sculling in both 2017 and 2018 at the World Junior Championships, which prompted his selection for U.S. Rowing Junior National Athlete of the Year two years in a row. The following year, he rowed for the United States senior team.
After receiving recruitment offers from many top-tier schools, Dean decided to attend Harvard because he considered it the intersection of fantastic rowing and great academics.
“It’s very lucky for the rowers how the top rowing schools are also the top academic schools,” Dean said.
ROWING AT HARVARD
While Dean clearly demonstrated his prowess for sculling (rowing in a boat for a single rower) in his high school years, his freshman year at Harvard highlighted his talent for rowing in a crew. He stroked the varsity eight at many big regattas, including the race against Yale, IRA National Championships, and Eastern Sprints. When asked whether he prefers rowing or sculling, Dean hesitated before offering his thoughts.
“It’s a good question,” he said. “[Sculling] is very straightforward and very simple to train… [Rowing in an eight] is bigger, it's faster, and you're surrounded by your friends… There are pros and cons to each.”
By early 2019, however, Dean announced that he would not be returning to Harvard in the fall; instead, he would be withdrawing from the College in the 2019-2020 academic year to vie for a spot to row in a U.S. boat at the Tokyo Olympics. This was not a new idea, but rather, it was an aspiration that had been percolating in his head from a relatively young age that increasingly became more realistic with time. He said that he has “always kept that option open,” so he was mentally prepared to possibly graduate with a different class when he began freshman year. Although Clark is an invaluable member of the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team, he received plenty of encouragement from his coaches to pursue his goals.
“The coaches here are totally supportive of the athletes in whatever they want to do,” Clark said. “It's about developing their athletes not only as rowers but as people. They were more than supportive.”
When the 2019-2020 academic year rolled around, Dean hit the ground running. The year kicked off with the 2019 World Championships at the end of the summer, which carried more significance in a pre-Olympic year by determining which boats qualify for the Olympics. Dean raced in a straight four, and the team successfully placed in the top-eight finishers and qualified the American boat for Tokyo. The American eight also qualified.
Although Dean was a large contributor to the American straight four’s success, there’s a catch: while Dean and his three boatmates qualified that specific boat type at the Olympics for the United States, he does not have a guaranteed spot in that boat. In order to earn that spot, Dean would have to train at the National Team Training Center in Oakland, Calif., with all of the other elite rowers who were competing for spots in the straight four and the eight. While it may help Dean’s case that he raced in one of the qualifying boats, he would still have to train and compete until final decisions on the boats were made in June of 2020.
TIME AT THE NATIONAL TEAM TRAINING CENTER
When the year began, Dean moved into an apartment in Oakland that was a minute’s walk away from the training center. He lived with two older rowers who had just graduated from Cornell University and the University of Washington respectively. While none of them had been teammates at school, they were all familiar after having raced against each other in the past.
A typical day for Dean while training in Oakland looked like this: he would wake up at 5:45 a.m. and have breakfast, and by 6:20 a.m., he would be launched for a morning row. At approximately 9:00 a.m., he would finish his row, shower, and start working remotely for a job he had started in the spring of 2019. Then, between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m., Dean would go to the boathouse again for either an individual workout or another row. At around 7:00-8:00 p.m., he would have dinner with his “rotating dinner club” consisting of his roommates and other members of the team. That schedule would repeat itself every weekday, and on the weekends, they would have a long row on Saturday morning and the rest of the weekend off.
AN EARLY START TO THE OFF-SEASON
When news broke that the Tokyo Olympics would be postponed to 2021 and that the National Team Training Center had to close, there were only 18 rowers left in the camp. Dean was the youngest rower by far; he had turned 20 years old this past February, and the youngest rowers after him were 23 or 24 years old. He said the average age at the camp was approximately 27-28 years old, and that some of them were just over 30 years old. Some of the older athletes were planning on retiring after the 2020 Olympics if they were selected to compete, so they are now facing the decision of whether they should continue training for another year. Understandably, Dean was disappointed by the cancelation, but he had more empathy for his older teammates.
“I definitely got off the easiest because I have school to go back to; I am now going to graduate right before the pre-Olympic Worlds to qualify for the next one, and it's absolutely not the end of the road for me,” Dean said. “A lot of people are in way tougher positions than I am.”
Needless to say, Dean’s training schedule has completely changed since the Olympics were officially postponed. While he was a couple of short months away from peaking, he now has to reverse his training schedule and essentially begin his off-season.
Dean is currently staying at his home in Sarasota, Fla., and the other rowers also went home until further notice. In order to take a break from the high-impact, repetitive motion of rowing, Dean is focusing on cross-training for now and is mostly running and biking. While it is unclear when he will begin rowing again, he has concluded that it “depends on what happens countrywide with the virus.”
From here, it is only natural to wonder about Dean’s next step: will he take another year off from Harvard to train for Tokyo, or will he return to school? The answer is that he is hoping to return to school to graduate with the Class of 2023. If Dean took another year off, then he would lose a season at Harvard, because he is only granted five years for four seasons, and now he has three years left for three remaining seasons.
“Harvard as a school, the rowing program, the coaches, and the team have already done so much for me that I definitely owe it to them to get my remaining three years of racing done,” Dean said.
Although it is now more difficult for Dean to qualify for the 2021 Olympics, his hopes are not completely dashed. “[The chance of qualifying for Tokyo is] definitely a lot smaller than it would have been this year, but it's not zero. I [also] have 2024, so it's not like this is my last run at it.”
Dean also looks forward to the prospect of potentially being back on campus again with his teammates and his friends, and he is excited to get his sophomore year back.
The Games are currently rescheduled for July 23–Aug. 8, 2021, but uncertainty remains as the questions of logistics and the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic loom.
