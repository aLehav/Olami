After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University of Maryland affirmed its students’ rights to view pornography last week. A policy included in the Maryland General Assembly’s budget bill last spring required state universities to develop an obscenity code to prevent the viewing of pornography on their campuses by December 1. If schools do not comply, they risk losing state funding. State Senator Andrew Harris introduced the budget amendment after University of Maryland students planned a screening of the hardcore pornographic film, “Pirates II: Stagnetti’s Revenge,” last April. By implementing this measure, the Maryland State Legislature overstepped its bounds. With the December 1 deadline approaching, the legislature should either allow defiance within the university system to continue without interference or, even better, reverse its misguided legislation.
The policy requiring an obscenity code represents a violation of free-speech protections and would likely incur an expensive lawsuit. The Jefferson Center concluded that, had the University of Maryland adopted the policy, it would have been alone among the nation’s colleges in banning public viewing of porn on campus. The move, moreover, would likely have drawn a costly and drawn-out court case. Civil-liberty disputes are often watched carefully by individuals and groups who are not directly affected by the policy in question. This makes it likely that, even had a low-level court found the policy constitutional, the university system would have then been mired in months of appeals.
Though the University of Maryland schools may have been driven by practical considerations as well as moral ones, their decision to neglect to develop a policy was a principled stand. It is undoubtedly difficult for a school system that includes parents as some of its main constituents to defend the right to watch porn. Yet by putting constitutional rights ahead of easy moralizing, the university has shown an admirable commitment to the rights of its students.
In fact, the proposed policy would certainly infringe on civil rights. The government should not be in the business of regulating what films can be shown at colleges. As adults, college students are capable of deciding what is and is not suitable for their individual viewing. Despite being in a publicly funded location, these students are acting in a private sphere within which government interference has no place. What might be the limits of what some politicians find offensive? The policy’s precedent invites worrying implications.
In the end the University of Maryland’s decision does not just protect porn; it protects students. The moral lessons of college should be learned in books and experiences, not a legal mandate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many in this country, I share the concerns of Lou Dobbs ’67 for sacred elements of democracy and the American dream. Although Lou and I rarely agree on policy, I’ve often appreciated his championship of honest, hard-working men and women as well as his attention to civic responsibility and the limits of the market.
It is unfortunate, then, that I believe his resignation this past Wednesday is appropriate. Notwithstanding his nominal commitment to improving the life of the average American, there’s a peculiar, troubling quality to Dobbs’s patriotism: his vision of a strong, hard-working America often fails to recognize the contributions of people of different cultural backgrounds.
His resignation has been a long time coming. For several years now, doubts have arisen as to whether Dobbs can separate fact from opinion, and even fact from misinformation. But even worse than his flirtations with journalistic integrity, Dobbs has used his platform on America’s most trusted news network to promote a vision of the country that has become more about exclusion and anxiety and less about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And he’s done it with a jaundiced eye. For some time now, “Mr. Independent” has spent less time offering fresh political commentary than giving credence to cultural prejudices.
Dobbs has done much to make clear that his advocacy of the average American omits not only new arrivals but also often American citizens of cultural backgrounds different from his own. Just this past March, Dobbs claimed that the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce was “effectively an organization that is interested in the export of American capital and production to Mexico, and Mexico’s export of drugs and illegal aliens to the United States.” For a journalist who consistently stresses we focus on the real issues (like the state of public education), Dobbs often pandered to conspiracy theories. He’s claimed that Latino immigrants bring leprosy to the United States. He’s sparked scandal about an impending North American Union between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. And over the summer, he gave voice to the factually bankrupt idea that President Obama is not a native-born American citizen.
Dobbs is not the only talking head to believe what he believes. But as an anchor claiming to represent ordinary America on a 24-hour news network, Dobbs has often flirted with crossing the line of respectability. Many journalists defend the exceptionalism of American citizenship or advocate for tighter borders. But Dobbs lost credibility when he began to provide a platform for hate groups and spread one-sided misinformation about immigrants. Many journalists advocate for the protection of a certain national culture. But Dobbs was often prone to mischaracterize and dismiss what many groups that make up America have to offer. It’s little wonder that a national grassroots movement played a significant role in forcing Dobbs off CNN.
I harbor no illusions that we have seen the last of Lou Dobbs or his particular brand of the American dream. He’s a private citizen and certainly has the ability to voice his opinion as to what the country should look and sound like. In the short run, at least, I’m happy to know that Dobbs will no longer have a home on a network that prides itself on providing objective news to the whole country. In the long run, I see Dobbs’s resignation as a promising sign that we’re moving toward a patriotism that sees “ordinary America” as great enough to include the dreams and contributions of all kinds of people.

Correction Appended
Former President George H. W. Bush once said, “Competence makes the trains run on time but doesn’t know where they’re going.” With Johnny Bowman and Eric Hysen, Harvard students have the opportunity to elect an Undergraduate Council president and vice president who not only possess an unparalleled ability to make the trains (or Quad shuttles) run on time but also present a compelling vision of the UC’s role in student advocacy during a difficult time for the university and its budget. As the presidents of the Harvard Republican Club and the Harvard College Democrats, we rarely agree on anything during an election season, but both of us believe that Johnny and Eric are the best choice to lead the UC next year.
The next UC administration will face one major issue: budget cuts. As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences prepares to cut another $110 million from its budget for the next two years, Harvard students need a passionate and dedicated representative to make sure that the entire Harvard community has a say in Harvard’s future, and we need a UC that can continue to improve student life without relying on increased funding from the administration.
Johnny and Eric have been leaders in the fight for an inclusive and transparent budget-cut process since the beginning. On the UC, Eric helped organize the “We Are Harvard” rally last May, which helped convince Harvard deans to reverse cuts in shuttle service to the Quad. As the chair of the Budget Cuts Task Force, Johnny is continuing the work he did last year as a member of the Student Labor Action Movement. When the decline in Harvard’s endowment was first announced, Johnny dedicated himself to becoming the most knowledgeable student on campus on the topic of Harvard’s endowment and budget, realizing that top-down budget cuts would hurt students and workers alike. He organized the Responsible Endowment Conference and proposed the Idea Bank, which gave the Harvard community an unprecedented opportunity to share ideas for the second round of budget cuts. While SLAM’s activities are often controversial, Johnny’s work has demonstrated such a mastery of the issue that even the Harvard Republican Club endorsed his campaign. This record assures us that Johnny and Eric will be the most effective possible advocates for a stronger student voice in the second round of budget cuts.
However, fighting with the administration will not be enough to guarantee success for the next leaders of the UC. In a year when the UC’s agenda will be severely constrained by budget cuts, the UC must be able to move ahead with tangible measures that will improve student life. Both of us are particularly impressed by Johnny and Eric’s commitment to political activism and public service. With the 2010 midterm elections approaching, we especially appreciate their commitment to supporting student groups of every political persuasion who want to travel to competitive states like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Johnny and Eric may be partisan in their own politics, but we have every confidence that they will be completely fair in using the UC’s resources to encourage students to get involved.
More broadly, Johnny and Eric are well versed and passionate advocates for student groups on campus—financial crisis or not. Eric’s experience as treasurer of the Dems gives him a thorough understanding of how important the UC is to the financial viability of Harvard student groups. Johnny, too, has demonstrated an impressive understanding of the UC Finance Committee. Intimate knowledge of the student group budgeting process is at the core of the UC’s relationship with student groups. We are confident that Johnny and Eric, as the only ticket with Finance Committee experience, are best equipped to manage this core function of the UC.
That knowledge doesn’t stop within the confines of the UC. In fact, Johnny has met with more Harvard administrators than any UC presidential candidate in our memory. Perhaps most importantly, Johnny and Eric have laid the groundwork for successful relationships with student groups so that they can hit the ground running as soon as their term begins. We believe that Johnny and Eric will be effective advocates for student groups not only as part of the UC budgeting process, but also with respect to Harvard’s administration as a whole. Effective interaction with the administration is an especially important attribute for student groups, as organizations across campus increasingly find themselves pursuing causes from preventing layoffs to reinstating ROTC that require administrative action.
Although we admire the accomplishments of all of the candidates in this race, we are convinced that Johnny Bowman and Eric Hysen are best prepared to call for a more inclusive budget cuts process and work with student groups to improve student life at Harvard. We urge students to vote for Johnny and Eric in this week’s election
Colin J. Motley ’10 is president of the Harvard Republican Club. Eva Z. Lam ’10 is president of the Harvard College Democrats.
CORRECTION: The November 17 Op-Ed "Bowman-Hysen for UC" should have identified Eva Z. Lam '10 as a staffer on the Bowman/Hysen campaign.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In the United States it is almost never said that virtue is beautiful,” Alexis de Tocqueville observed. “They maintain that it is useful and they prove it every day.”
By “they” he clearly meant “Harvardians.” Many students here treat morality like a get-rich-quick scheme: They practice virtue to advance their careers. True, some standards are better than none, but this ethical foundation is flimsy. If morality is merely useful, then it is expendable.
Consider: Last Thursday, the Leadership Institute at Harvard College, a student group “devoted to fostering the awareness, skills, and values of leadership among Harvard undergraduates,” held an event entitled, “Self Branding: The Art of Making Yourself Memorable.” The event featured an instructor from Dale Carnegie Training who schooled the dozens of students who attended in “interpersonal competence.” I don’t begrudge the club or the instructor for the effort, but their tips revealed the dark side of our culture.
Our careerist culture. To succeed, we need “brands,” the instructor counseled. Think Energizer Bunny or Jared the Subway Guy. Jared found his “niche market”—eating sandwiches—and now speaks professionally. How did he prepare the course? “He had amazing self-branding,” the instructor concluded. How do you “self-brand”? You sell yourself—or, in business-babble, “network.” Network at class reunions, at office hours, at wedding parties. “There could be CEOs there!” the instructor said.
But to sell yourself successfully, a customer has to buy. Before the event, students received packets with advice on “human relationships.” They learned never to “criticize, condemn, or complain.” Rather, you should encourage “others to talk about themselves” and make “the other person feel important.” If you need reminding, “do it sincerely.” Should someone ever err, “never say ‘you’re wrong.’” Instead, call “attention to people’s mistakes indirectly” and praise “the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.”
In business, this advice makes sense. You want to make money, and often that goal requires massaging people’s egos. Unfortunately, some students extend this approach beyond business. Many administrators do, too. For instance, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning urges teaching fellows to avoid telling students they’re wrong. One handout suggests that they “encourage students who have given wrong answers by praising them for taking the risk of speaking out.”
The problem with this approach is that it makes us hypersensitive. Students are less likely to challenge teachers—potential references—and teachers are less likely to critique students—potential meltdowns. If the “only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it”—as the packet asserted—we will avoid arguments worth having. And when we inevitably disagree, we will painfully patronize each other.
Watch a teaching fellow critique a student in section, for example. “You can’t just,” he starts, before realizing “can’t” sounds too negative. “Maybe it would be more effective,” he tries again, until recognizing “more effective” implies you are “less effective.” Finally, he capitulates. “Does anyone else have a different view?”
Or read the perfunctorily positive comments on your papers, like “You’ve written an engaging essay” or “You’ve got an interesting thesis.” That said, you wrote a paper on Bob Marley when you were supposed to write about Jacob Marley: B+. When you are “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise”—as the packet advised—people soon realize your praise is halfhearted. They also become so used to your praise that when they hear your criticism, they get insulted.
More seriously, careerism dehumanizes us. Friends and relatives become “contacts.” Marital bonds and professional rivalries become “relationships.” We see everything as a chance to get ahead—or at least to get more. Take this event as an example. At the end of the presentation, the instructor asked attendees to share their thoughts with the group. Hands sat grounded. Then, the instructor offered free copies of the book, “How to Win Friends and Influence People,” to the first eight people to volunteer. Hands shot up like firecrackers.
A frivolous example, yes. But it suggests why “business ethics” can be an oxymoron. When morality is just a step to get ahead, people will leave it behind—should the opportunity arise. And it is unnerving to think that each time you meet someone, he is placing your name in a mental Rolodex. So, to this careerism, here’s my message, my pitch, my “brand,” if you will:
“No thanks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. Dukakis and Boston Globe columnist Renee Loth advised aspiring politicians yesterday at the Kennedy School about media strategy and reminisced about the strength of press coverage in decades past.
Dukakis exhorted potential “public managers” and political appointees in former New York Times Public Editor and Visiting Lecturer Daniel Okrent’s “Writing and Reporting on Politics and Policy” class to take the press seriously and use media as a positive conduit between government and the people.
Dukakis graduated from Harvard Law School in 1960, served three terms as Massachusetts governor, and lost the 1988 election to former President George H.W. Bush. He said that politicians today do not face the same intense scrutiny from journalists they once did. “Nowadays, they don’t do investigative journalism well,” he said. “You can put a lot over on them.”
He said that some lessons from the past continue to apply. He urged potential politicians in the crowd to develop an effective organization at the grassroots level, a lesson he said he learned from both his success in races for Massachusetts governor and from his failure on the national level.
He advised the students to address questions from reporters frankly, and to let reporters know when they do not have an answer.
Loth, who first covered Dukakis during his campaign for governor in 1974 and went on to work for several Boston-area newspapers, talked about the changing dynamics of the media industry with the advent of the Internet and around-the-clock coverage.
“There is a lowest common denominator in the mainstream media because we’re competing with this new media... that puts a premium on speed and not accuracy,” she said.
Loth lamented the rise of “gotcha” reporting, a tactic meant not to highlight failures of governance so much as to contribute to a reporter’s career.
“There’s not the same kind of respectful ‘friendly antagonism’ that defined the relationship of the press and public officials,” she said.
“Today there is a lot more cynicism and ambition to get ‘gotcha’ moments with a scalp, to make government look bad,” she added.
Nick Rigas, a second-year student at the Kennedy School, said that he was intrigued by Loth’s comments. “I found the discussion of more breadth and less depth interesting, the change from reporters in your face to reporters in pajamas,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The two major tickets in this year’s Undergraduate Council presidential election—George J.J. Hayward ’11-Felix M. Zhang ’11 and John F. Bowman ’11-Eric N. Hysen ’11—have obstacles to overcome before they can develop a better rapport with top University administrators.
Both tickets agree that they will have to work with deans and administrators throughout Harvard if they want to accomplish their agendas.
In the case of Hayward, Hammonds told The Crimson in an interview last Thursday that she did not know who he was.
“I only know Johnny because he’s on one of the College’s working groups, but I don’t know the other candidate,” Hammonds said. “I don’t even know the other person’s name. Who’s the candidate?”
Hayward said he has in fact met Hammonds but only as a student attending public meetings in which she was in attendance.
“She meets a lot of students. I’ve raised a lot of points and have gotten feedback from her,” Hayward said. “I think the big thing is it’s not how many times you’ve met with the dean or the deans you meet with, but the tangible results you can get.”
While Bowman and Hysen have both sat down with Hammonds, Bowman said that he may have antagonized some administrators during his time with the Student Labor Action Movement (SLAM) last year.
“I did push their buttons a lot,” he said in an interview yesterday.
SLAM’s slogan last year was “Greed is the New Crimson”—a motto that did not sit well with some Harvard administrators.
“If I could do it all over again I would have a much more positive message and as a leader on the UC, I would make absolutely certain that the message of whatever advocacy campaign I led would be positive,” Bowman said.
SLAM’s slogan on its Web site is now “Community Equals.”
Bowman is still a member of the organization—which campaigns against layoffs at Harvard—but he said he has spent most of his energy this semester as a first-term member of the Council.
Bowman said he has worked to rebuild relationships by meeting with Hammonds and University President Drew G. Faust.
“I’ve proven to [Hammonds] that I am a reasonable person,” he said. “I’m trying to improve Harvard’s community.”
While UC representatives meet with lower-level deans and administrators, the Council’s president and vice president meet with Hammonds and Smith on a regular basis throughout their term.
Both Hammonds and Smith spoke positively of their time spent with outgoing UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 and Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10.
“I think we’ve had a great relationship. I mean we’ve had lots of conversations. We’ve talked a lot. We listened to their ideas,” Hammonds said. We provided support when we could. I think they were great to work for and I think they were great advocates for the students.”

The number of female faculty members has increased by 16 percent since 2003 and the number of minorities has increased by 23 percent over the same time, according to the 2009 Faculty Development and Diversity Annual Report.
The report—which was released last week—showed that women now hold 26 percent of the 2009-2010 ladder faculty positions at the University, which include professor, associate professor, and assistant professor.
But while the percentage of women in senior faculty positions (professor) has remained a constant 21 percent from the 2008 report to 2009, the percentage of women who are junior faculty (assistant professor, associate professor) has actually decreased from 37 percent to 36 percent.
Judith D. Singer, Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, who oversaw the report, said that the pipeline issues for women tend to be less problematic than the pipeline issues for minorities.
“I think there’s an increased consciousness that there are many excellent women on our junior faculty and elsewhere that we’d want to have as colleagues,” Singer said. “Increasing attention to issues for women and women faculty, this is a good news part of the story.”
The report suggests that minorities currently represent 17 percent of the faculty—a small increase from last year’s 16 percent.
“We’re trying to get more minority faculty into every level of the University in all fields,” Singer said. “The numbers of minority Ph.Ds who want to go into academia are simply too low, especially when it comes to blacks, Latinos, and Native American faculty. We’re making a conscious effort like our peers to increase the pipeline, even at the undergraduate level.”
In terms of Asian/Pacific Islanders, the report shows a 23 percent increase over the past six years.
The combined percentage of African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans has remained at approximately five percent over the same period.
According to the report, the total number of senior faculty members has risen by twelve percent during the past six years, but the percentage of junior faculty members has decreased by two percent.
Singer said that the University has placed emphasis on nurturing the junior faculty, hiring people who are initially qualified, and supporting them when they are here.
“We are hiring, we are continuing to recruit,” Singer said. “We will work very hard to aggressively retain our faculty.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a sweltering summer day in Portugal, a starving dog placed its head softly atop Illiana C. Quimbaya’s ’05 outstretched foot. The dog’s trust seemed remarkably absolute, she says—especially in light of the frequent mistreatment of stray animals she had witnessed on her trip.
“Something about it was incredibly moving,” she says. “I just remember wishing there was something I could do to help.”
The revelation completely reoriented Quimbaya, who says she embarked on this “soul-searching” trip after having second thoughts about pursuing a career in academia.
The veterinary path “wasn’t even on my radar when I [came to Harvard],” says Quimbaya, who is now juggling pre-veterinary classes at the Extension School and graduate studies in the Department of Anthropology. “People came here for medicine, business, or law. The pre-vet community was virtually invisible.”
This year, Jane C. Xie ’12 is in the process of reviving the Harvard Pre-Veterinary Society, which disappeared five years ago after the group’s founder graduated. So far, Xie has found roughly ten other pre-vets at the College, and Quimbaya says she knows of approximately 15 at the Extension School.
But Xie says the newly-born Society is still struggling to unite pre-vets as they navigate one of Harvard’s less established pre-professional routes.
‘YOU’RE PRE-WHAT?’
When people ask Xie about her career aspirations, there often isn’t time for a lengthy enumeration of the virtues of veterinary medicine.
“There’s usually an initial shock period where people don’t understand what I’ve said,” Xie says. “Sometimes I just say I’m pre-med because it’s easier.”
One question she says she’s rarely asked is what type of veterinarian she wants to be. Many people assume vets handle domestic animals, but in fact the profession encompasses a wide range of specialties.
Vet school students are required to do rotations in areas such as small and large animal surgery, exotic wildlife, avian studies, clinical pathology, and equestrian medicine.
Casey L. Cazer ’12 says she may be the only pre-vet at Harvard interested in large animal medicine. This summer, she worked on a dairy farm, monitoring the health of a herd of 3,000 cows.
Rachelle Ludwick ’13 has considered treating racehorses or going into animal health policy, while Julia Duke ’11 says she would enjoy working with squirrels, possums, or bunnies.
Xie says vet schools have distinct emphases and reputations—Tufts for small animal research, University of Wisconsin for livestock, and University of Pennsylvania for horses, to name a few.
GIVING A VOICE TO THE VOICELESS
Xie says she’s always felt pressure to either go into finance or become a doctor, but has recently dealt with nagging reservations.
“If I were to become a doctor, I feel like it would be for superficial reasons like high pay or respect in society,” she says. “But being a vet is compelling for me because vets need to find alternative ways of communicating with their patients. If vets didn’t stand up for the animals, who would?”
Xie is exploring her interest in animals by taking courses such as “Dogs and How We Know Them,” a class taught by Pre-Vet Society advisor and History of Science Professor Sarah Jansen.
Cazer, the aspiring large-animal vet, grew up on a farm in upstate New York and as a child, she presented rabbits, llamas, and cows at competitions. She says that as soon as she grew out of “that phase where all little kids want to be rich and famous,” she knew she wanted to be a vet.
After years of working at animal shelters and on farms, Cazer says she knows large animal medicine is “a dangerous profession.”
“But the most difficult part, in my experience, is the pet owners,” she says. “They’re something else.”
THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED
After opening its horseshoe-shaped doors in 1882, the Harvard School of Veterinary Medicine transformed from an “academically lax” academy to the most rigorous veterinary institution of its time, according to the Harvard Medical Alumni Bulletin. But financial woes forced the School to close only 19 years after its founding.
For Cazer, the failure of the vet school seems to have foreshadowed the relative unpopularity of veterinary medicine at Harvard.
“It’s been really discouraging being a pre-vet here,” she said. “I actually considered transferring last year because of the lack of available support.”
The United States has 131 medical schools but only 28 vet schools, making the admissions process uniquely competitive. Last year, the average applicant to Cornell—Cazer’s first choice vet school—had accumulated 1,335 hours of animal experience, according to the spring 2008 Veterinary School Admissions Guide.
But because Harvard is not an agricultural school, it is hard for students to get experience working with large animals, Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Advisor Ann Georgi wrote in an e-mailed statement.
And because Harvard has no vet school, none of the House pre-med tutors have a background in veterinary medicine, Office of Career Services pre-health advisor Jeffrey J. Glenn wrote in an e-mail.
In addition to typical pre-med requirements, pre-vets must also take microbiology, biochemistry, and zoology. But since Harvard doesn’t offer a pure microbiology course, students must take classes at MIT and the Medical School or make other arrangements with vet schools.
“We work closely with our pre-vet students around requirements issues and this often means a lot of communication with individual veterinary schools as they all have their own policies,” Glenn wrote.
He added that pre-vet advising at Harvard is adequate if students make an effort to utilize resources. OCS provides one-on-one appointments, alumni contacts, and a handout with volunteer opportunities and application details.
Georgi says she’s noticed an increase in the number of students seeking pre-vet advice in the last two years, and Glenn says he’s hopeful that the Pre-Vet Society will help OCS reach more pre-vets in the future.
But at this point, Xie says she thinks pre-vets are somewhat “left in the dark.”
TAKING IT INTO THEIR OWN HANDS
Laura G. Pena ’13 and Ludwick settle into beanbag chairs in Leverett Common Room for the Pre-Vet Society’s weekly meeting. The radiator hums loudly as Xie settles onto the floor with her laptop.
“Is anyone interested in testifying for a bill to guarantee healthcare for elephants?” Xie asks the small group of regulars, referring to an actual event on Nov. 16.
After Xie reminds the group to apply for shifts at a local cat shelter, discussion turns to a wildlife internship in Africa available for next summer.
These Pre-Vet Society meetings and events are key parts of Xie’s effort to bring Harvard’s pre-vets out of obscurity.
“We’re very isolated, which gives us the impression that there are none of us,” she said. “That’s probably not true —we just can’t find each other.“
While the Society is still in the process of being approved as a student organization by the Undergraduate Council, the club has been active, touring the Tufts vet school and inviting an alumnus to talk about his pre-vet experience at Harvard.
Xie says she is anxious to extend the pre-vet conversation to the greater Harvard community.
“I think a lot of the students here look at me and say ‘Why don’t you just be a doctor?’” she says. “But I’m really interested in helping animals. I’m going to throw salary out the window and go for it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Democratic Senate candidate Alan A. Khazei ’83 announced his opposition to proposals that would send more troops to Afghanistan and challenged his audience to envision a new course for U.S. involvement yesterday afternoon at the Barker Center.
Khazei, who seeks to fill the position vacated by the late Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy ‘54-56, outlined his 10-point plan for Afghanistan, which recommended returning to the original mission of destroying Al-Qaeda terrorist organizations, slowly recalling troops, establishing a timetable to transfer power to the Afghani government, and focusing on the threat posed by terrorist organizations as well as nuclear arms development in Pakistan.
“If you don’t believe in open-ended involvement, fighting, or prolonged counterinsurgency efforts, I want to provide you with a choice in this election and the opportunity to weigh in on the administration’s progress,” Khazei said. “We must fundamentally change our approach and bring our troops home.”
Khazei said that over time, the U.S. has strayed too far from its mission of fighting Al-Qaeda terrorism in Afghanistan, damaging relations overseas, and hurting its citizens domestically.
“The choices in Afghanistan are not easy. But with the right strategy, we can reinforce our mission and succeed in our fight against Al-Qaeda,” he added.
Khazei defended his emphasis on the war in Afghanistan and argued that it is currently the biggest threat to the U.S.
He said that the war has extensive consequences on domestic affairs, in addition to the loss of life incurred on the battlefield.
“The tremendous cost of this war will also be paid in larger taxes, slowed-down growth, and the inability to pay for jobs and education because we are spending the money on a bad bet in Afghanistan,” he said.
Members of the Harvard Republican Club said that they had a different position on the issue from Khazei.
“We as Republicans believe that the fight in Afghanistan is well worth the time of the United States and our military forces there, and it is something that we must commit to fully if we want to succeed,” said Colin J. Motley ’10, president of the HRC.
When asked by an audience member to explain the differences between himself and fellow Democratic Senate candidates, Khazei said that his background and comprehensive strategies distinguish him from his opponents.
“I’m the only movement builder in the race. That’s the vision I take to the Senate. It can’t be done by a single senator,” Khazei said. “We need citizen movement. I know how to coordinate that.”
“It’s an ongoing journey to form a more perfect union,” Khazei said.
A poll released earlier this month by the New England College Polling Institute in Springfield showed Khazei in fourth place with the support of just four percent of respondents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Old media may be dying, and career paths into journalism may be rapidly evaporating, but one Harvard Law School student may have found a shortcut from Langdell to the top of the Washington Post opinion page.
Jeremy L. Haber, a first year student at the Law School, is one of four finalists remaining in the Post’s “America’s Next Great Pundit” contest, the winner of which will write 13 weekly op-ed columns on a topic of his choice.
Haber, who said he entered the contest on an impulse, has emerged from over 4,800 entrants to outlast six other finalists — including a Nobel laureate in physics, an assistant secretary of commerce in the Bush administration, and a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.
But for all that, Haber describes himself as anything but the stereotypical blogger-columnist.
“I’m not a natural writer,” Haber said. “Blogging is not a natural form for me.”
Up to this point, the contest has included a variety of assignments that include a traditional opinion column, blogging assignments, and online chat sessions with readers.
Haber said he was skeptical about his chances of winning and that he was unsure of what he might devote his column to if he wins the competition. The contest so far has relied on reader voting to eliminate candidates but the coming weeks will give Post editors increased power to cut candidates.
Still, Haber hinted that he would devote his column to representing the voice of his generation, since it has traditionally been under-represented on the nation’s opinion pages.
“There are 70 million 18-34 year-olds, and none of them are invited to participate on the op-ed page,” Haber said. “There is a youth perspective on every issue, there’s no one on the Post’s opinion page, and I don’t think that’s sufficient.”
Ross G. Douthat ’02, a 29-year-old former contributor to The Crimson, was made an editorial columnist for the New York Times in April 2009. No Washington Post editorial writers or columnists are under the age of 35.
Though he has no experience as a reporter, Haber said he might use his opportunity to highlight under-reported issues with national significance. So far, he’s used his online column to interview Massachusetts Senate candidates Alan A. Khazei ’83 and Steven G. Pagliuca, and to discuss leadership and the Red Sox’ 2010 prospects with team president Larry Lucchino.
David M. Zucker, another first-year student at the Law School and a friend of Haber, described Haber’s decision to enter the contest as characteristic of a man who likes to take risks.
“He’s a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants kind of guy, and he’s obviously very successful at it,” Zucker said.
Haber received his bachelor’s degree in political science from Brown and travelled after graduation, taking trips through East Africa to work on development issues and spending time in Rwanda contributing to reconciliation efforts in that nation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Baylor University Law Professor Mark W. Osler delivered a litany of criticism against the American approach to prosecuting cocaine-related charges before an audience of students at Harvard Law School yesterday.
A nationally recognized expert on crack cocaine prosecution, Osler called mandatory minimum sentencing policies that target drug possession “ridiculous.”
He said that the government should instead focus on stemming imports of powdered cocaine.
“The people getting the money are the culpable ones, yet they’re not the ones carrying the crack,” Osler said.
The legal expert also criticized the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for its “oversized budget” and its excessive street presence, which he said has failed to shrink the market for crack cocaine.
“It’s simple supply and demand,” he said. “We put more agents on the streets, and we saw that doing so didn’t decrease drug trade.”
Osler instead advocated polices that would prosecute those who organize the trade of powder cocaine.
These people, Osler argued, are “white-collar” businessmen, whose imports of powdered cocaine local drug dealers convert into crack.
If the government were to pursue those businessmen, the amount of imported powdered cocaine would decrease, lowering the amount of crack on American streets, he said.
However, current DEA policies reward agents for the aggregate number of prison-years their arrestees accrue, Osler said, offering little incentive to pursue higher-level targets.
“Why go after somebody at the top, whom you may not even get, when you can easily get somebody for five years for carrying five grams of crack?” Osler asked.
Osler said that he was working on new laws for computing drug sentences.
A particular target, he said, is a federal provision under which possession of a given amount of crack cocaine triggers the same mandatory minimum sentence as possession of 100 times as much powdered cocaine.
That provision was part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and was mandatory until a set of mid-2000 Supreme Court rulings, but the guideline still bears on federal sentencing decisions.
The Law School chapter of the NAACP organized and sponsored the lecture.
James A. Nortey, a second-year student at the Law School and a member of the chapter, said Osler’s visit was part of an attempt to build awareness of criminal justice issues.

CORRECTION APPENDED
Former National Organization of Women President and current Institute of Politics Fellow Kim Gandy encouraged students in Quincy House yesterday to work together across divisions in the feminist movement to achieve larger goals like reproductive and equal marriage rights.
Addressing the intimate group of around 20 undergraduate students, Gandy discussed her own years of experience working with the different facets of the feminist movement. “I’ve been involved with the feminist movement since 1973, and one of the things that has been important from the beginning is building bridges across progressive movements,” she said.
“We’ve had success in small ways, but it continues to be a challenge,” she added.
Gandy’s talk was sponsored by Girlspot, the Queer Students and Allies, and the Radcliffe Union of Students (RUS) in the hope of fostering a dialogue about a wide range of feminist issues, including economic justice, same sex marriage rights, access to contraception, violence against women, and transgender advocacy.
“I think historically in the broader community there’s been difficulties in overcoming these divisions,” said QSA co-chair Marco Chan ’11.
Gandy opened the forum up for students to share their concerns. Students raised the issues of contraception access, the Stupak Amendment, and gay rights. Gandy stressed that all of these issues are inter-related and dependent on each other for success.
“If we had more cross-pollination, it would make a huge difference,” she said. “Until we start working across the issues and doubling our strength, we won’t make progress.”
Using the co-sponsors of the event as an example, Gandy told QSA and Girlspot how important it was for them to help rally against the Stupak amendment and for RUS to advocate for equal marriage rights.
“You need allies from outside your group because it helps lift you up,” she said. “You are all allies outside a cause that you can join and help.”
For many students in attendance, Gandy’s discussion filled a void in the Harvard community. “Multi-issue advocacy is sparse on this campus,” said Ridhi Kashyap ’10. “It’s through dialogues such as these that plural advocacy can be fostered.”
Gandy encouraged students to work together and take advantage of, not diminish, their diversity.
“There are so many issues for modern feminism to deal with. It’s unavoidable that there will be clashes of interest,” she said. “The good news is that there’s so much work to do [and] there doesn’t have to be competition. We need to work on all of them.”
CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Nov. 17 news article "Gandy Speaks on Feminism" gave an incorrect name for the student group Queer Students and Allies. The group is not the Queer Students Association.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Qunnipiac men’s hockey team has been a juggernaut lately, and on Friday, the Harvard men’s hockey team did nothing to stand in its way.
Led by forward Eric Lampe—who had a hat trick in the game—the No. 20 Bobcats (8-1-0, 4-0 ECAC) steamrolled the Crimson (1-3-1, 1-3-1 ECAC) in Hamden, Conn. this past weekend, by a score of 5-1.
The game started off slowly, and the first period remained scoreless until the last minute, when Lampe struck with the first goal of the game.
Harvard equalized early in the second, when junior forward Michael Biega slid in the rebound off a shot by freshman Louis Leblanc.
But the Crimson’s luck ended there, as Quinnipiac tallied two more goals in the next six minutes.
Lampe completed his hat trick midway through the third, and an empty net goal completed the Bobcats’ scoring spree.
Quinnipiac outshot Harvard, 33-28, but capitalized on the power play, scoring in two out of eight chances. The Crimson went zero for four.
Harvard felt that it was outplayed, but not outmatched, by the Bobcats.
“On paper, we’re probably better than them,” sophomore forward Alex Killorn said. “We just didn’t play the hockey we wanted to play.”
Quinnipiac has played impressive hockey this season, particularly on the offensive side. The team has scored at least three times in every game and averages 4.2 goals per game.
“They’re having a great season,” Killorn said. “They have a lot of skilled players and they’re pretty good offensively.”
“[Quinnipiac is] a hard-working team,” Leblanc added. “They scored five goals on us…they can produce some offense.”
But the Crimson felt the loss was more a product of its shortcomings than the Bobcats’ talent. Physicality and hustle were issues for Harvard, as were penalties.
“We like to have a hard forecheck, and we weren’t really hitting guys,” Killorn said. “Our shifts were too long…We made too many mistakes.”
“It was one of those games where we were taking a lot of penalties,” Leblanc added. “There was maybe a lack of discipline, [and] we were trying to do too much out there.”
The Crimson power play was equally ineffective, as the team failed to convert a five-on-three power play in the first period.
“Special teams weren’t really working,” Leblanc said. “We have a lot of stuff to keep working on.”
Killorn had a penalty shot opportunity late in the third period, but it was stopped by Bobcats goalie Dan Clark. Clark made 27 saves in the game, denying Harvard shot after shot.
Lampe also posed a problem for the Crimson, notching four points in the game and upping his stats to nine goals and 14 points for the season. Lampe leads the ECAC in goals.
“He’s one of the guys we were told to look out for, and we let him go,” Killorn said.
The game was aired on NESN, the first of six Harvard games to be broadcast on cable. The increased publicity added meaning to the game for some.
“It adds an element for a lot of players,” Killorn said. “A lot of people’s family or friends that can’t come to the game in person will be able to watch it. It does affect the team.”
The team felt the loss, but did its best to forget about it quickly, as it travelled to Princeton for an Ivy League matchup less than 24 hours after the Quinnipiac game ended.
“The only way to [deal with the close scheduling] is to completely forget about what happened before,” Killorn said. “We want to take the mistakes in the previous game and learn from them but mostly to forget what happened. It’s a new day, it’s a new team—let’s just go play our hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a reversal of roles from its past few games, it was the Harvard men’s hockey team (1-3-1, 1-3-1 ECAC) that came from behind to skate to a 3-3 tie with No. 19 Princeton (3-2-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) on Saturday afternoon at Baker Rink.
The Crimson found itself down 3-1 with less than four minutes left to play in the second before coming back to rally to a tie.
“In terms of how important it is to be able to come back, if you look at past years, championship teams come back from deficits,” senior forward Doug Rogers said. “This is going to be very important going ahead in the season. Being able to score goals in a timely manner will be pretty vital for us.”
After relinquishing early leads against both Colgate and Cornell last weekend, the Crimson found itself in the unfamiliar position of being on the offensive during the contest’s closing minutes. Harvard managed to claw its way back against the Tigers with a tie when junior forward Michael Biega found the back of the net with just 57 seconds left in regulation.
“While we were not completely happy with the result, we did climb back from a 3-1 deficit, so that was a positive step forward,” Rogers said. “It proved to everyone that we have the ability to come back in games.”
The tying tally came after Harvard weathered an onslaught of attempts at goal from the Tigers, as the Crimson was outshot, 14-8, in the final frame. With Richter sent to the bench in the final minutes, the Crimson capitalized on its man advantage when freshman forward Louis LeBlanc passed the puck to an open Michael Biega, who was sitting directly in front of Princeton goaltender Zane Kalemba.
“That was a great play by that line,” captain Alex Biega said.  “That line [of LeBlanc, Killorn, and Michael Biega] has been contributing offensively significantly throughout the past five games. It was a great setup by LeBlanc, and [Michael Biega] made a great play to put it in the net.”
In contrast to the third period, Harvard controlled much of the offensive play in the opening two frames, outshooting its Tigers counterparts by a margin of 12 shots. In spite of this advantage, it was Princeton who found the back of the net first after a scoreless first period.
The Tigers scored twice in a seven-second span, first finding the net off a power play and again after they won the resulting faceoff.
But the Crimson responded less than two minutes later when Rogers blasted the puck over Kalemba’s left shoulder to make it 2-1.
Princeton scored another off a power play at 16:09 in the second to make it two-for-four on the power play. In contrast to the Tigers’ power play success, Harvard went zero for five with the man advantage.
“In our league especially, there are a lot of penalties taken, and special teams can make or break a team,” Rogers said.  “I think our power play and penalty kill have to be better in games going forward.”
Alex Biega tallied his first goal of the year off an assist from Rogers to round out the scoring of the second frame and cut Princeton’s lead back down to one goal.
“The [goal] at the end of the second period was a big goal for us to gain momentum going into the third,” Rogers said.
Though the Crimson carried that offensive momentum into the final period of play, it did not come to fruition until Michael Biega’s tally in the final minute, tying up the game at three goals apiece and snapping Harvard’s three-game losing streak.
After five consecutive games on the road to open up the season, Harvard will finally be able to take advantage of the atmosphere of Bright Hockey Center, as the team will be playing at home for its next seven games.
Next weekend, the Crimson looks to improve on its league record as it takes on conference rivals St. Lawrence and Clarkson.
“It’s pretty evident that it’s difficult to win on the road,” Alex Biega said.  “We’ve had a difficult schedule right out of the gate here with five away games...It’s evident that we have to work on some things.”
“We’re definitely looking forward to playing at home for a few weeks now,” Rogers added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team rallied in the last period in its game against Princeton last Saturday night but ultimately came up short, falling to the Tigers, 2-1.
The Crimson outshot the Tigers in overtime, 4-1, but came up empty handed when sophomore Heather Landry stole the puck from Harvard and raced towards the net on a breakaway—scoring the game-winning goal with only 31 seconds to play in overtime.
“We were throwing the puck around a little,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “We had a lot of energy, but we just couldn’t quite channel it to where it needed to go, and that definitely showed up on the shots and scoreboard.”
Landry’s tally overshadowed a breakout performance by Crimson freshman Josephine Pucci, who scored her first career goal with 1:26 left in the third period to put Harvard back in the game. Open at the point, she slammed the puck into the back of the net to tie the game, 1-1, and shifted the momentum in favor of the Crimson.
“Shortly right after, we went into overtime, and I’m pretty sure we outshot them in overtime, but I felt like we had control,” Pucci said. “Unfortunately it didn’t work out.”
Princeton opened the scoring with a powerplay goal just 3:56 into the first period.
Junior Laura Martindale fed the puck to sophomore Danielle DiCesare, who launched a shot at senior goaltender Christina Kessler. The puck bounced off Kessler’s pads and right onto the stick of a charging Landry, who slammed a shot into the empty side of the net to give the Tigers a 1-0 lead.
In the second period, Princeton made 16 attempts on net, but all were deflected by Kessler. The Crimson goalie kept her team in the game and set a new career mark with 37 saves on the night.
“She did a very good job,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We weren’t ready to play at the beginning of the game, so she had to do a lot to keep us in the game, and she did that. It’s unfortunate what happened at the end of the game, but she kept us in the game until the second period.”
“Kessler’s there when we need her,” Farni added.  “She’s that kind of goalie. When you need her to make big saves for you, she makes them. She made some pretty unbelievable saves on our penalty kill.”
Still, Farni wasn’t happy with the load that the team placed on Kessler. Harvard tallied 26 shots on goal but was soundly outshot by Princeton, which sent 39 pucks towards the Crimson net.
“It’s unfortunate that we have to put her in that position,” Farni said. “That’s not really a ‘team first’ kind of play to put her in the position to keep us in the game. But she did a great job.”
Near the end of the third period, the rest of the Crimson caught up with Kessler’s effort, when Pucci’s goal temporarily gave Harvard the excitement it had been looking for.
“It was an awesome feeling that the game was tied up, and we got to go into overtime, but I wish we could’ve won it in the end,” Pucci said, “It was still really exciting, especially since it was the first game [I scored].”
Princeton goalie Rachel Weber kept Harvard silent the rest of the game with four saves in the extra period.
While the Crimson was coming off a 3-0 shutout over St. Lawrence last weekend, the Tigers kept Harvard’s sticks unusually quiet with strong defense.
With a strong defense and Kessler in the net, the Crimson will continue to compete against its opponents but will need to make adjustments all over the ice.
“We want to improve on everything,” Stone said, “we want to be ready, we don’t want to be selfish, we don’t want to change lines inappropriately. That’s what happened at the end. It gave [Princeton] an opportunity that they never should’ve had.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the start of team practices, the Harvard women’s hockey team has consistently focused on bouncing back. It was no wonder then, that after suffering a 2-1 loss to Princeton Saturday night, the Crimson attacked rival Quinnipiac on Sunday with a vengeance.
While the Bobcats took the first point 1:47 into the game, Harvard was loathe to suffer another loss. Scoring the next six goals, the Crimson dominated its conference rival, 7-2, at the final buzzer.
“We responded with a sense of urgency today,” Harvard head coach Katey Stone said. “We wanted to respond from yesterday.”
The pivotal moment that best epitomized the Crimson’s desire to attack came in the second period, when Harvard “responded” three times in a span of two minutes.
“We’ve got some weapons, and we’ve just got to get kids believing in themselves and let the puck do the work,” Stone said. “That’s what happened.”
Crimson junior Katharine Chute started the trifecta a little over nine minutes into the second half off a pass from senior Anna McDonald to give Harvard a 4-1 lead. Only 47 seconds later, freshman Kaitlin Spurling took a tally of her own.
Freshman Jillian Dempsey scored the last Crimson goal of the period, and her second of the game, with 11:29 into the third. Dempsey’s first goal, second on the season, came four minutes into the match.
“It felt amazing,” Dempsey said of her two goals. “[Kate] Buesser set me up beautifully on one of those goals, and you know Leanna [Coskren] was just putting the puck in the net. It was all them.”
After Dempsey scored the first Harvard goal, senior Randi Griffin followed it up with one of her own at 11:11 into play, putting the Crimson up, 2-1. Coskren, a junior, then placed a pass from Dempsey behind Bobcats goalkeeper Victoria Vigilanti.
“[After Saturday night], we realized what we did wrong, and we had to correct it,” Harvard co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “Today we figured it out that when they score, we need to answer right back.”
After Chute, Spurling and Dempsey’s goals in the second period, Quinnipiac freshman Breann Julius took the initiative to stop a complete Harvard domination.
With Crimson sophomore Alisa Baumgartner in the box, Julius took advantage of a power play to make the score 6-2.
“I was disappointed about the power play goal that they scored because we are trying to be one of the best teams on the penalty kill,” Stone said. “But again, it’s a work in progress, and I think the good thing is that we have a lot of people killing penalties and we are going to get better at it.”
The third period began with continuous back-and-forth play as the Crimson defense stopped seven Bobcat attempts. With Harvard racking up two of its five penalties for the game, it was not until the final seven minutes that Buesser scored the last goal of the contest, giving the Crimson a definitive five-goal lead going into the final minutes.
Throughout the contest, Harvard outshot the Bobcats, 28-18, scoring one on a power play and one off of a faceoff. The Crimson won 42 faceoffs, compared to Quinnipiac’s 16, giving Harvard more time with the puck.
“We are getting better, that’s the key,” Stone said. “We just need to make sure we are ready to play whenever games come around.”
As the team prepares to take on No. 4 New Hampshire on Wednesday, Stone emphasized the Harvard’s need for simple play and confidence.
“We know what we need to do, we just need to go out there and do it,” Farni agreed. “We know we are fast enough to beat anyone. We know we can keep up with any team. We just need to have confidence and capitalize on our chances.”
For now, the team can revel in its ability to score seven goals, the most for the program since last year’s Beanpot, when Harvard scored eight against Boston University.
“We were raring to go,” Dempsey said. “We just came out flying. [We are] looking forward to Wednesday, and hopefully we can do the same thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to UHS, when the average Harvard student gets sick, he or she should remain bed-ridden until healthy. Apparently, Claire Richardson would rather be qualifying for nationals.
The third-year standout will join fellow junior Dan Chenoweth and sophomore Kailyn Kuzmuk as the Crimson’s three representatives at NCAA Nationals after each runner posted a strong individual performance during NCAA Regionals on Saturday. Chenoweth and Kuzmuk led the way for the Harvard cross-country team during a muddy romp through rain-soaked Franklin Park in Boston, placing third and sixth in their respective races, as the teams finished 10th and fifth. Richardson’s eighth-place finish on the women’s side earned her the final Crimson ticket to Terre Haute, Ind. next week.
“People did really well and had really strong performances on a tough day,” Richardson said. “Some others had tough races, but everyone committed to the course and did their best.”
While Harvard coach Jason Saretsky praised the tremendous effort of the three qualifying runners, he credited Richardson especially for fighting through her illness.
“Claire ran a really fantastic race,” he said. “She put herself in great, great position early to establish herself and did a great job of holding it together despite not being 100%.”
Yet as Richardson expressed excitement to return to nationals for the second straight year, she also noted that the day belonged to first-time qualifier Kuzmuk.
“Kailyn [Kuzmuk] has been training really hard and is in great shape,” Richardson said. “She’s so determined and clearly loves the sport…her performance really showed all of those qualities.”
Kuzmuk posted a 22:25 on the 6k course—with Richardson just three seconds behind—but both competitors showed regret that a fifth-place team finish left the squad short of a berth to nationals, an honor granted only to the top two teams.
Despite strong efforts from rookie Sammy Silva and junior co-captain Jamie Olson, who finished 11th and 30th, respectively, Syracuse and Providence held a lock on the qualifying spots.
“We were hoping to qualify everyone, but [some other teams] had great days,” Kuzmuk said. “We were still pretty excited. Everyone trying to qualify as a team was a good motivating factor, so everyone was running hard.”
This hard running was particularly crucial given the conditions of the course. While Harvard is familiar with the Franklin Park terrain, runners claimed that powering through the mudbath was a unique experience.
“It was insane,” junior women’s captain Jamie Olson said. “It was kind of fun, because you couldn’t get any traction on the ground, but then you realized that no one else could get any traction either.”
The men found circumstances equally dismal on the 10k course but drew on a number of young performers once again to crack the top 10 of the 36-team field.
Chenoweth remained the Crimson’s best performer, crossing the line in 31:03—a 5:00 mile pace. The junior’s effort left him only 27 seconds behind overall winner Ryan Sheriden and easily qualified Chenoweth for the next level of competition.
“This [race] sets him up really well,” Saretsky said. “Dan established that he can run with the top 20 or so guys in the nation, which is what he was shooting for. It was a really exciting race for him.”
“I’m really amped for [nationals],” Chenoweth agreed. “Hopefully I’ll be able to go out there and have a good race.”
Following behind Chenoweth were freshman Jeremy Glimour, junior Ryan Neely, and sophomores Michael Hoffman and Ben Enowitz. With no seniors among the top seven runners, the Crimson has laid the foundation for future success.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, seniors Lily Durwood, Alissa Flesher, Katherine Kocurek, and co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn of the Harvard women’s volleyball team played their last games for the Crimson.
In its final two games of the season, Harvard experienced both the joy of victory and the bitterness of defeat. The Crimson (12-13, 8-6 Ivy) defeated previously unbeaten Penn (20-5, 11-1 Ivy) on Friday, but lost to Princeton (11-13, 9-4 Ivy) on Saturday. The Crimson finished the season sharing third place with Princeton in the Ivy League standings.
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 1
In its final match of the 2009-10 campaign, Harvard faced Princeton, a team it had previously defeated. But on Saturday, the Crimson was unable to duplicate its earlier success and fell to the Tigers at Princeton’s Dillon Gymnasium with scores of 25-27, 26-24, 25-22, and 25-23.
Ono Horn notched a double-double in the match with 13 kills and 10 digs, while Durwood ended her record-setting career with 56 assists—the collegiate best for a four-set match—in addition to 15 digs.
“[Princeton] has a really good offense,” Ono Horn said, “but I think that we came back and countered with an equally good offense thanks to Lily.”
Sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll led the team with 16 kills and a .519 clip. Junior Mikaelle Comrie also contributed with 15 kills.
Harvard barely out-defended Princeton, posting 88 digs to the Tigers’ 87, and the Crimson also had the advantage in blocks, 6-4. Sophomore Christine Wu led the defense with 27 digs. Kocurek and junior co-captain Miyoko Pettit pitched in defensively as well with 10 digs each.
Princeton had the edge on Harvard offensively, recording 74 kills to the Crimson’s 62.
HARVARD 3, PENN 2
Friday night, the Crimson took on Penn, the only undefeated team in the Ivy League. In the teams’ previous matchup, the Quakers pummeled Harvard, winning the match 3-1. But this time, the Crimson matched the No. 1 team and more, defeating Penn with scores of 25-22, 12-25, 27-25, 25-16, 15-10. The victory ended Harvard’s nine-match losing streak versus Penn.
“We all felt like we had nothing to lose and everything to gain,” Ingersoll said, “just by having fun and playing our best. It was nice to mess up their undefeated season.”
After winning the first set, 25-22, the Quakers utilized a 7-0 and 6-0 run during the second set to win it, 25-12.
When the third set went into overtime, freshman Taylor Docter’s play helped the Crimson win it. Ono Horn served with the score tied at 25, and Docter made a block that caused an attack error by Penn. Then, with Harvard up by one, an assist by Durwood led to a kill by Docter—the eighth of her thirteen kills for the night.
“Taylor [Docter] was on it,” Ono Horn said. “Her blocks, her kills, she made several key plays at the end of ever game that helped us win.”
Two other Crimson players notched double-digit kills: Comrie and sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer, who recorded 12 and 10, respectively. Durwood continued to create scoring opportunities for her teammates with 47 assists. Ingersoll contributed seven kills and five blocks in the victory.
Three Harvard players also recorded double-digit digs. Wu led the squad with 24, while Ono Horn and Kocurek added 17 and 24, respectively.
Penn committed 10 service errors in the match, and the Crimson exhibited strong net play, out-blocking the Quakers 12-6. Harvard also held sizeable advantages in both kills, 82-50 and digs, 98-75. The Crimson sealed the victory in the fifth set by avoiding any attack errors.
The departing seniors looked back on the weekend with a bittersweet sense of finality.
“Ending a season is always sad,” Ono Horn said. “[And] this season, we placed the best of any team that I’ve ever been a part of. The fact that volleyball is over hasn’t even really hit me [yet].”
“[The seniors’] energy is so great,” Ingersoll added. “They really did carry the rest of the team along. I’m really sad to see them go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team kicked off its season this past weekend with mixed results.
The Crimson fell to a formidable non-conference foe in Texas A&M on Friday at Harvard’s home Blodgett Pool with a score of 131.5-102.5.
But the men were able to rally in Ithaca, N.Y. on Saturday and claim a tri-meet victory over two Ivy League opponents, Cornell and Dartmouth.
“[Friday] was a bit more of a struggle, but we fought through it,” senior co-captain Tommy Gray said.  “It was a really good prep for the meet against Cornell, [which] really got the ball rolling.”
With an ultimate goal of remaining undefeated in Ivy matchups this season, the Crimson swimmers and divers are showing impeccable form in their starts.
HARVARD AT CORNELL, VS. DARTMOUTH
Harvard began its first Ivy League meet with a bang, as a team of underclassmen captured the opening 200-meter medley relay event.  Sophomores Rob Newell, Niall Janney, and Nicholas DuCille and freshman Owen Wurzbacher combined for a 1:33.67 finish, six seconds faster than their seed time.
The Crimson followed this with a strong 1-2-3-4 finish from its distance swimmers in the 1000-yard freestyle.
Senior Mason Brunnick led the pack and touched the wall in a decisive 9:28.86, over thirty seconds faster than the closest Cornell or Dartmouth swimmer.
Senior co-captain Alex Meyer and junior Blake Lewkowitz followed Brunnick, finishing almost simultaneously with times of 9:46.63 and 9:46.78, respectively. Junior Jamie Mannion pulled in a solid fourth place.
The victories kept coming for Harvard, as Meyer claimed the 500-yard freestyle in 4:36.51, and junior Douwe Yntema won the 200-yard freestyle against stiff competition with a time of 1:42.49.
Members of the opening 200-meter medley team also claimed individual wins for the Crimson.  Newell placed first in the 100-yard backstroke with a 51.50 time and led Harvard’s 1-2-3 finish in the 200 backstroke, followed by freshman Greg Pelton and sophomore David Lynch.
DuCille brought home the gold in the 50-yard freestyle and swam the first leg of the winning 400-yard freestyle relay team.
Freshman Brendan McIntee, sophomore Eric Taylor, and junior Will Heyburn combined with Newell for first in the relay and a time of 3:07.33.
Junior diver Zac Ranta claimed the 3-meter dive with a score of 317.70 to finish the meet, bringing the Crimson’s total event victories up to nine.
“[Saturday] definitely set a good tone because we put up some good times and we raced hard,” Brunnick said.  “We showed the Ivy League that we’re going to be pretty strong this year and that we’re looking forward to winning the Ivy League title.”
TEXAS A&M 131.5, HARVARD 102.5
The Crimson began its season on Friday against perennial swim powerhouse, Texas A&M.
Despite a loss, Harvard claimed three events on the day and showed its depth in multiple events.
But  the swimmers and divers were not all pleased with their accomplishments.
“We were a bit tense and a bit nervous,” Meyer said.  “There were a lot of good races and some lackluster performances.”
The Crimson had to wait until the tenth event of the day for a first-place finish, when Brunnick claimed the 500-yard freestyle in a time of 4:48.23.
Harvard then took a 1-2-3 finish in the 200-yard backstroke. Wurzbacher touched the wall first in 2:07.66 and was followed by juniors Justin Davidson and Evan Schindewolf in second and third, respectively. The Crimson used a completely different lineup in the event than it sent out on Saturday but still swept the top-three spots.
Harvard finished strong, winning the 400-yard freestyle relay to end the day’s competition.  DuCille, Taylor, McIntee, and sophomore Matthew McLean claimed the race for the Crimson with a time of 3:07.59.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Binghamton Open yesterday, the Crimson knew what it was getting from its veterans, but the rookies had a few surprises in store for the field as well.
The Harvard wrestling team brought a full squad to Binghamton, N.Y. for its season-opening competition and once again made a strong statement to begin the year.
Co-captain J.P. O’Connor took home a championship, while fellow co-captain Louis Caputo and returning sophomore stalwart Walter Peppelman each placed third.
But in a year that features one of Harvard’s strongest recruiting classes in recent memory, a number of freshmen showed that they could make an impact on the mat from day one.
“I was excited to get guys on the mat, especially some of the freshmen who have been looking good in the training room,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “Today was a big step…Three or four freshmen proved that they can really compete at a high level.”
Among these rookies were Tony Buxton, Steven Keith, and Adam Hogue—all of whom placed in the top six. Buxton cruised to the semifinals in the 141-pound weight class before falling in a tight bout against Binghamton’s Anwar Goeres, 6-4. A medical forfeit gave the freshman third place.
Keith and Hogue stumbled early in their first collegiate tournament but quickly regained their footing. After both were pinned in their first bouts, Hogue reeled off six-straight wins to finish sixth at 165 lbs., while Keith (125) proceeded to go undefeated in the wrestleback, placing fifth. With a dominant 12-2 showing in his final bout, Keith showed how much progress the freshmen made in just one afternoon.
“We had a couple guys get pinned when they were [leading a bout],” O’Connor said. “They made rookie mistakes, but improved dramatically throughout the tournament.”
Two other wrestlers notched their first career wins, with junior Fermin Mendez (125) and first-year David Lalo (174) besting opponents in the early rounds.
While O’Connor praised all of these strong efforts of Harvard’s young grapplers on the mat, he was quick to point out that the inexperienced contingent also contributes to the overall dynamic.
“These guys are great not only as wrestlers, but as people,” O’Connor said. “They couldn’t have done a better job today. They battled and showed that they’re going to put Harvard in the top 20 in the country.”
If the Crimson does climb this high in the rankings, it will not just depend on a strong rookie class but will also draw on its seasoned veterans.
O’Connor (157) and Caputo (184) breezed through their brackets with characteristic ease, reminding the field of their All-American status. But both faced challenges before they were done, as O’Connor pulled out a tough 3-1 victory in the finals, while Caputo fell 4-3 in the semifinals.
“I feel like I wrestled well in my first four matches,” O’Connor said of his run through the tournament. “But in the final, I wrestled a little conservatively, which is something I’ve been trying to work on for the past two years.”
Nonetheless, O’Connor emerged unscathed, a fate that Caputo could not match. The co-captain—wrestling unattached as he takes the semester off from Harvard—mounted a furious comeback after falling behind 3-0 to Cornell’s Steve Bosak but dropped the bout due to riding time. But O’Connor was confident Caputo would bounce back.
“I’m sure he’s thinking about [the loss], but he will make every change he needs to make come March,” O’Connor said. “[Caputo] wrestled really tough in the toughest weight class of the tournament, and he wrestled pretty damn well, so he’ll be back to where he needs to be soon enough.”
Another wrestler on the brink of success was Peppelman, whose third-place effort demonstrated tremendous improvement over last season. Although the sophomore fell to eventual champion Donnie Vinson, 2-0, in the semifinals, his strong showing earned praise from Weiss.
“Peppelman was awesome today,” the coach said. “[Vinson] is ranked 11th in the country, and one year ago today, he beat [Peppelman] 12-2. Walter made up some ground.”
If the Crimson’s strong rookie class shows as much improvement as Peppelman over the past year, Harvard will be in place to contend on a national stage.
“These tournaments are huge for us to practice,” Weiss said. “[Today] was so valuable for us, and we are all pleased with how this young group started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning the Ivy League title—and its accompanying NCAA tournament berth—outright on Sunday with a 1-0 victory over Penn, the Harvard men’s soccer team learned last night that it has earned the 10th seed in the tournament.
The Crimson receives a first-round bye, and will host a second-round game at Ohiri Field at 1:30 pm on Sunday. Harvard will face the winner of Thursday’s Connecticut-Monmouth matchup.
The Crimson has never played Monmouth, which earned the automatic bid from the Northeast Conference after finishing the season 18-1-1 and winning the league tournament.
Connecticut enters the postseason 11-4-3 with an at-large bid from the Big East. The Huskies handed Harvard its worst loss of the season on Oct. 14, beating the Crimson, 4-0, in Storrs, Conn.
Harvard’s season resume includes wins over tournament teams Stony Brook, Boston College, Brown and Dartmouth. The Crimson has qualified for the postseason in each of the last four seasons, and holds an all-time 19-15 record in NCAA play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Richard Smith was right. As he was preparing for the final game of the men’s soccer regular season, something popped into his head.
“I was actually thinking before this game that I’d [score] a goal,” he said.
It was certainly a bold prediction by someone who hadn’t registered a point during his entire rookie season, but the defenseman made good on his call.
Smith’s goal in the 68th minute against Penn on Sunday was all the Crimson needed, as it went on to win, 1-0, to clinch sole possession of the Ivy League title.
“It felt absolutely fantastic,” an ebullient Smith said after the game.
Sunday was Senior Day at Ohiri Field, the final home game for the quintet of Desmond Mitchell, Adam Rousmaniere, Kwaku Nyamekye, and co-captains Andre Akpan and Brian Grimm. For much of the season, the focus had been on that group, which has provided over half the points for the Crimson this season. They were collectively honored before the game after having led Harvard to 50 wins, three NCAA tournament appearances, and a 2006 Ivy League title over their careers. But while the focus was, as always, on the seniors before the match, it was a freshman who stole the spotlight.
“Richard is a constant threat in the box, and finally, it actually paid dividends,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “We could have scored three, and he was central to all of them. He’s a constant danger in the attacking half.”
Though it wasn’t flashy, Smith’s goal—the first of his collegiate career—is something he’ll never forget.
“It wasn’t the prettiest goal,” he said. “It was a cross from the left wing, and it basically bounced high in front of me. I couldn’t get my foot under it, so I drew my body towards it, and [basically] kneed it in.”
In the season of the seniors, the goal made the rookie stand out—something to which Smith is already accustomed. Compared to other Harvard freshmen, at 6’6, he’s taller; at 20 years of age, he’s older; and as an Englishman, he’s more foreign. But on Sunday, Smith stood out in another way as well. Unlike most of the 1,600 other members of his class, he was an athletic hero.
For Smith, who is from Durham, England, it had been an up-and-down season. He had been banned from playing the first six games of his rookie season because the NCAA deemed him “partially professional” due to time spent playing on an English club. After the frustration of having to sit out the start of his season, Smith saw playing time in each of the remaining 11 games, starting eight.
“I’ve learned an awful lot, a lot more about teamwork and camaraderie,” Smith said of his season. “Especially in this environment where you’re away in college, you value your teammates a lot more, because they’re not just your teammates but also your friends. I think that’s probably one of the most fundamental reasons for our success, the fact that we’re teammates both on and off the field.”
In return, his teammates couldn’t speak more highly of him.
“Once he came back after the six games, he’s really helped us,” fellow freshman Brian Rogers said. “He’s really calm on the ball, has a great soccer IQ, he’s a physical presence—he’s huge—and his partnership with [sophomore defender Baba] Omosegbon has been one of our biggest strengths.”
In England, Smith had played soccer at an extremely competitive level for most of his life. He was Framwellgate team captain from 2000-05 and helped lead his Sunderland youth team to a Premier Youth League Championship in 2006-07. Smith was also team captain for a Durham Gilesgate Sixth Form Centre that won a County League Cup from 2007-08, and a member of Durham City AFC, which won the Chairman’s Cup championships in 2008-09—all before arriving in Cambridge.
Despite this impressive resume, there was no guarantee of such a smooth transition for Smith. But the rookie has thoroughly enjoyed the new challenge of playing college soccer in the US.
“The standards are actually really [high] here,” he said. “The style is a little bit different, but soccer’s a universal sport, so the transition wasn’t too hard for me.”
Being two years older than most members of the freshman class might have made others in his shoes feel uncomfortable, but Smith sees his age as a benefit.
“I feel it probably is a little advantage,” he said. “I feel I’m probably a little more mature...I spent two years out of education, and I realized how important education is to me this year, so I probably take things a little more seriously than others.”
“But I still like to have fun,” he added with a laugh.
As Harvard looks towards this year’s tournament and beyond, it’s the freshmen who will be forced to play an even bigger role.
“I think it’s going to be obviously difficult after this senior class graduates, but I think so far this year [the freshman class has] proved that guys can step up,” Rogers said. “And there are guys that haven’t even gotten to play as much this year that, given the opportunity next year, are going to step up and have great seasons.”
One of those to step up next season could very well be Smith, but for now, the defenseman is enjoying the Ivy title and looking forward to the NCAA tournament.
“I’m pretty confident,” he said. “We’re ranked top 10 in the country, this win gives us extra confidence...I’m sure we can go quite far in the tournament.”
And Smith feeling confident is certainly a good thing. He’s already been right once before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sailing battled its way through the Atlantic Coast Championships this weekend, coming out with bittersweet results and determination to improve from their mistakes when they hoist their sails again in the spring. The co-ed team took eighth place out of 18, while the women took 14th.
Harvard had high hopes coming into the race after a successful fall season. The two squads secured their spots at the ACCs two weeks ago at the Erwin Schell Trophy at MIT, where each Harvard team took fourth place. The top seven continued on to the championship regatta, which pitted the country’s best 18 teams against each other.
While the team was disappointed about the women’s results, both the co-ed results and individual performances on the water pointed in a positive direction for the spring season.
“We need to be more consistent in the spring, learn from mistakes more quickly, and get back out there in the next race so the regatta goes on,” junior skipper Teddy Himler said.
WOMEN’S ATLANTIC COAST CHAMPIONSHIPS
The women’s division of ACCs took place at Brown University this weekend, where Harvard placed 14th out of 18 teams over eight races. In the A division, sophomores skipper Emily Lambert and crew Alexandra Jumper took 11th place, posting a second-place finish in their fifth race and earning 83 points overall.
Captain and skipper Liz Powers and sophomore crew Marie Appel placed 14th in the B division with 93 points. Harvard’s total score of 176 was uncompetitive, as the top three schools posted scores below 120. Boston College won with 107 points.
The sailors faced brutal weather during their races. While Saturday’s downpour was bad, the light wind on both days proved worse.
“Both days it was light wind, which was unfortunate for us, because we had practiced 420s in heavier wind,” Lambert said.
But the team expected more from itself despite the poor weather conditions.
Humbled but motivated by its performance, the team still holds to its ultimate goal of qualifying for nationals.
“It was an overall disappointing weekend for the women’s team that highlighted how much work we have to do in the spring to prepare for nationals,” Lambert said.
CO-ED ATLANTIC COAST CHAMPIONSHIPS
Harvard hosted the co-ed division of the ACCs this weekend, where the Crimson took eighth place over 10 races. Junior captain and skipper Alan Palmer and classmate crew Grace Charles dominated the A division, placing fifth overall and posting both a first- and second-place finish.
The pair’s strong performance kept them in the upper half of the competition in all but two races, and they accumulated just 71 points.
In the B division, Himler and sophomore crew Annie DeAngelo finished 11th. Their 97 points gave the Harvard contingent a total of 168 points, a far cry from top finisher Boston College’s 99 points but still a solid result for a young team.
The Crimson also fell short of rival Yale, who placed fourth.
“We always want to beat Yale, of course,” Himler said. “They bested us this time, but we’ll have our vengeance.”
The co-ed races were hampered by a cold and rainy nor’easter on Saturday and no wind on Sunday—which meant no races that day. With the cancellation of Sunday’s races, the team lost a valuable opportunity to move up in the standings after a night of recuperation and evaluation of Saturday’s races.
“We were pumped to sail the second day, but the wind didn’t cooperate,” Himler said, “We would’ve moved up in the standings, and it’s unfortunate that it didn’t work out—but that’s sailing. We’re completely dependent on the weather.”
Given the weather and results, the co-ed team came away from the championships motivated by its performance.
Himler said that the team, especially Palmer, “did a great job, facing adversity with courage and proving what they had learned over the past couple of months.”
Both the co-ed and the women’s teams felt the ACCs highlighted the importance of training in the coming months to prepare for the spring season. The team looks to focus on consistency in racing as well as in training, which includes grueling daily four-hour practices and drills.
“Putting in genuine effort throughout the limited hours we have really pays off in the end,” Himler said. “[Team] members who have shown that will reap the benefits.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One perk about living in overflow housing is that when you step out the door, hungry and fatigued, you have a variety of dining halls to choose from—assuming that they do not have community restrictions that day.
The downside is that thanks to the aforementioned fatigue, and sometimes sheer laziness, you usually just call the closest dining hall your new adopted home. So that’s me every morning, trekking to the House that’s only a 50-second dawdle away.
I woke up early yesterday morning to avoid flunking my Chinese exam, and I needed to go to the nearest place to get some cereal and study in peace: Leverett House.
As I slowly entered that sketch alley facing the river that leads to the Leverett dining hall, a girl clad in green brushed quickly past me with her headphones on, ready to speed down the Charles and back like a leprechaun on fire. This happens almost every morning.
Some mornings, people come running out (sometimes already sweaty), and other mornings, hoards of varsity athletes in their sweatsuits head to the dining hall, either from a hellish practice or a long run.
Funny thing is, most of them live there.
A quick perusal of GoCrimson (for the record, I do not stalk these athletes) made me realize a lot familiar names live in Lev, like men’s basketball captain Jeremy Lin, who was featured on ESPN’s Top Videos for that awesome game-winning shot he made on Sunday afternoon.
Another notable mention is senior Cheng Ho of football, a true warrior that managed to break through the toughest defensive lines in the Ivy League before a devastating injury cut his senior season short. Junior Emma Markley, leading scorer and rebounder for the Crimson women’s basketball team last year, also calls Leverett home.
Many mornings, I have seen Lin with some of his very tall friends munching on breakfast food to help them jumpstart their day. Last weekend, I found myself among a hoard of women’s hockey players as I was trying to make a sandwich by the salad bar. And last night I was seated next to a round table populated by the men’s hockey team.
Sometimes I wonder if the house system is still somewhat flawed for placing so much athletic prowess in one house.
It’s obvious that other houses have their very notable athletes. Currier has Andre Akpan, co-captain of the men’s soccer team which opens the NCAA playoffs on Sunday after clinching its 13th Ivy League title.
But Leverett is different. Not only is it the place of residence for a multitude of DHA sweatshirts, it is also home to an intense intramural program and YouTube broadcasting service.
Lev goes crazy over its intramurals, and always has a strong showing at its competitions. The intramural program is so popular that Lev films most of the IM action during the week and produces it in volumes that are published on everyone’s favorite video-sharing website.
The result? LevSPN is the go-to place to catch up on intramural action. I went on it last night to check it out, and the first video included many familiar faces getting schooled by Lev athletes in volleyball and flag football.
The number of views for the LevSPN channel is pretty impressive—each video has a couple hundred hits, probably the result of the fancy banner over the head of the very nice, card-swiping lady.
The banner efficiently advertises the website, and includes the champions for the past campaign in flag football and volleyball. It also mentions that Lev took third place in last year’s Straus Cup competition—a surprising result for the amount of attention the house devotes to its intramural program. Of course, the banner follows it up with a determined “Yes!” in response to the question of Lev being the ultimate champion this year.
Granted, I live in a prime location for runners—and I’ve been meaning to shed off some extra weight gained thanks to a midterm season that ends at the start of reading period—but the last thing I want on my mind is to think about exercising when I have to memorize a bunch of characters in the morning.
But that’s impossible when you step into Leverett, a place where laziness is looked down upon—unless you want to become one of those kids getting pummeled by a volleyball on LevSPN.

According to the Yale Daily News, Yale's admissions office received 5% fewer application for early admission, down to 5,265 from 5,556 last year.
There is no explanation for the sudden drop in popularity of our favorite New Haven rival. "I think speculating about about small fluctuations in year to year counts is pointless," Jeff Brenzel, Yale dean of undergraduate admissions, said in an emailed statement to the YDN. He added that the early admission rate will likely reflect last year's figure of 13.4%.
Well, Yale sure won't be beating our early acceptance rate. We've already achieved the goal of ultimate exclusivity with zero percent.

FlyBy would like to share some colorful images from the Kirkland Drama Society's great performance of "The Tempest" this weekend.

Were you awake for the Leonid meteor shower this morning?  Well, we were!  At around 3 a.m., FlyBy dispatched a correspondent to witness what we'd heard would be "one of the biggest meteor shower events of our lifetimes."  Find out what we saw, after the jump.
Upon arriving, we decided to join a group camped out in the middle of the Quad lawn.  Jeremy S. Cushman '12, a friendly physics concentrator, became our unofficial astronomy expert.  After 20 minutes passed with zero meteor sightings, we started to worry that we were looking for the wrong thing.  But Cushman (who had seen two by this point) reassured us.  "You'll know," he said. "You'll know you've seen a meteor when you've seen a meteor."
Meanwhile, other groups began to appear on the lawn.  By 3:30 a.m., about 50 people had showed up--including three guys who had taken the shuttle from Winthrop.  In response the Quadlings' extremely vocal disbelief, one of them said, "It's not that far, guys."  (Actually...yes, it is. Especially for an early morning meteor shower.)
One nearby group was growing increasingly bitter about how difficult it was to see the meteors.  "This is so disappointing," one guy said.  "Yeah," another agreed. "The Facebook event had a sick picture."
We eventually did see one meteor, but it was extremely faint and short-lived.  We're told that this is the way most meteors appear, especially when there's so much light pollution.  So was it worth it?  Honestly, we're too tired to tell.  Now we just want to sleep.

An e-mail chain on "Pf-OPEN" last night revealed some interesting statistics. It turns out that that the Pforzheimer House’s email list-serv has:
666 non-digested members
245 digested members
911 total members
Somebody call nine-one-one? We may have a devil on our hands.
These statistics were discovered by Yün-ke Chin-Lee ’10, who subsequently sent them out over the Pf-OPEN with the subject title “Somewhat disturbing Pfopen subscriber stats.”
Maybe that’s the reason behind Pfoho’s house spirit – it’s possessed?
According to another Pfoho resident, David I. Fulton-Howard ’10, these statistics could be found by clicking the web address at the bottom of every email sent out over the list.
“I think it’s coincidence,” said Fulton-Howard, who is also a Crimson IT editor. “I don’t think there’s been any devilish activity in Pfoho.”
It was also cited in the email chain that Pf-OPEN is the first active house list and currently the second largest list on the Harvard Computer Society servers.
“Because it’s an open list, people can just sign up and many old alumni decide to stay on using their Gmails,” Fulton-Howard said.
