After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“One, two, three, four, five. / I am the greatest rapper alive.” The triumphant Kendrick Lamar thus announces his return after the massive critical successes of his 2015 album “To Pimp a Butterfly” and 2016 demo compilation “untitled unmastered.” Lamar may have released “The Heart Part 4” simply to tease his next watershed album, arriving on April 14, just as 2012’s “The Heart Part 3” teased “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” but “Part 4” has plenty of artistic merit of its own. A clear evolution beyond the other installments of the “Heart” series, the new single is frank, spontaneous, and experimental. Its constantly changing beats reflect the diversity and scope of a confident lyrical master’s thoughts.
The track begins with a rich musical palette recalling the complex, funk-inspired sounds of “To Pimp a Butterfly,” with warm synthesizer chords, strong drum beats, and soothing vocals from Khalid. Lamar furthers the funk connection by referring to James Brown in the hook, in which he asserts, “Don’t tell a lie on me, / I won’t tell the truth ‘bout you.” Here, Lamar announces his intention to use the track to target and diss other rappers—some have suggested Big Sean or Drake—while declaring himself as one of the rap greats. The opening lines of the first verse describe Lamar as a “hip-hop rhyme savior.” The second verse magnifies these feelings of superiority, as the beat slows, and even imitates a heartbeat as his lines grow more personal and intense. Lamar takes on a more aggressive tone and makes jabs at subdued rappers who get “nervous” just because “the music is loud.”
While Lamar engages in much of the same braggadocio as his contemporaries here, he doesn’t lose his technical prowess or his more cerebral sensibilities. He masters a lyrical flow, making even the infantile “One, two, three, four, five” rhyme sound smooth and authoritative. The lyrics are filled with wordplay and double meanings, a notable example being his use of the homonyms “picture” and “pitcher” to state that “the richer the poorer, the bigger the picture / the more blood pours.” He even plays with sound effects to make “The Heart Part 4” seem genuinely from the heart. He seems to rewrite his own lyrics near the end of track, with sounds of crumpling paper and expletives in the background bringing his listeners into his head as he illustrates his writing process.
Lamar finally segues into some deeper insights, highlighting falseness he sees in society by asserting that “N****s is fake rich, bitches is fake bad / Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab.” He proceeds to an admittedly stale swipe at the Trump administration, rapping that “Donald Trump is a chump” and that “Russia need a replay button, y’all up to somethin’.” Yet he finds clever wordplay here as well, saying that “electorial votes look like memorial votes / but America’s truth ain’t ignorin’ the votes.”
By the track’s end, when the instrumentals have gone from its original funk chords to an ominous, simple bass pattern with eerie synthesizer echoes, it is clear that “The Heart Part 4” has put Lamar’s lyricism and insights on full display, proving a worthy return for the beloved rapper. The single not only teases Lamar’s new album but showcases all his strengths as an artist. If his album is of this high of a caliber, he might deserve the title of “greatest rapper alive,” after all.

Lisandro Alonso is an Argentine filmmaker who first gained international recognition in 2001 with his debut film “La Libertad,” and whose last work, “Jauja,” won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2014 Cannes film festival.  He is currently a research fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. The Crimson sat down with Alonso to discuss his thought-provoking body of work.
The Harvard Crimson: Most of your films, maybe with the exception of “Fantasma,” focus on landscape. What does landscape mean in your work?
Lisandro Alonso: Well, I’m a guy from the city, but I used to go [to the countryside] since I was a child. So I think it’s always good for me to get away and to try to put cameras and microphones where I never have been. So I like to go outside and spend some time in nature and see how people live far away from my place.
THC: “Fantasma” seems like a unique work in your filmography because it’s a sequel of sorts, following the principal actor for “Los Muertos” as he attends the premiere of that very film.  How did that project come about?
LA: Actually, after I finished shooting “Los Muertos,” which is my second film, I just invited the main character of “La Libertad” and Argentino Vargas from “Los Muertos” [to the premiere], and the moment that they met I thought it was a good thing to make a film about it. They were in the city, far away from their places, and I see the reaction on his faces about people and the screening. ... In the films we shot I’ve been traveling to their places, so I thought it was a good idea to just invite them to come to my place, which is the cinematheque, where I learned a lot about cinema. So that was the beginning of the idea.
THC: Most of your films blur the line between documentary and fiction, but “Jauja” is not only a fiction, but also a period piece. What got you interested in it?
LA: Well after finishing my fourth film, called “Liverpool,” I just decided I was kind of repeating myself in the methods, in the tools, in the way I was shooting films. So I just stopped and went back to work at the farm with my family, and I started to have new questions about cinema, about rhythm, about people who I really want to work with. So I started to use, as you said, different times in the movies. This is why it’s a period movie. They talk in different languages. They are professional actors. They are kind of like more feminine characters. I think even if you can recognize signs from my previous films, you can also see that I am also moving a little bit away from my previous work.
THC: Thinking about the mysterious object that was dropped in the water at the end of “Jauja,” you seem to like to end your films with literal “signs.”  The toy from “Los Muertos” and the keychain in “Liverpool” also come to mind. Is there a reason you gravitate towards these mysterious objects?
LA: Yeah, I think you are right. I think I use that kind of objects, or toys, or little things just in order to have some kind of, I don’t know how to even say it. … It’s like a secret between me and the audience, because most of the time, characters don’t even know what that object means, you know? As you can see in “Liverpool,” that little girl probably doesn’t even know how to read, but we as an audience can recognize that Liverpool is a city or a place that maybe they can find again or not, but there’s a lot of meaning in that word. For example, the little toys from “Los Muertos.” For me it’s like going back in time to when the protagonist was a kid. He’s back in the same place again. Also it reminds me of the first scene when there is a killing. So I think we can think through the character, with the character, what is the meaning of those things.
THC: Your films are certainly unique, and sometimes it’s difficult to discern where your style comes from. Do you have any cinematic influences? Directors whose work you particularly enjoy?
LA: Yes, I mean, I have a lot of film influences and filmmakers that I really like, but it happens to me that since I’m changing my mind, different people are just arriving to my mind, but for sure we can mention films from Iran, Abbas Kiarostami, Italian Neorealism, Werner Herzog—there are so many.
THC: Since you’re mentioning all these world cinema directors, your work appears to have grown increasingly global with “Liverpool” and “Jauja,” which stars Viggo Mortenson. What do you think about this trajectory?
LA: Well, I think I started in a very independent way, and every time I start shooting again the film is getting bigger in terms of its structure and people, and every time I start shooting I should open them up and see where is the new place, where I want to shoot the movie. For example, now I’m planning to make a film between South Dakota and the Amazon in Brazil. So I’m getting out more and farther every time.
THC: That’s very interesting, can you tell us a little bit more about the new project?
LA: Well actually, I’m developing an idea and a script here. I’m a fellow at Radcliffe, and I’m trying to do [some research on] what it means to be like a native, like an Indian, in the whole continent. So I will try to make some connections between past time and present time nowadays in the Indian reservation, and I will try to compare how people live here in the U.S. and how people are still living in the jungle as they were, I don’t know, 400 years ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This spring, the Open Campus Initiative was formed to explore the limits of free speech on Harvard's campus by inviting controversial speakers across the ideological spectrum, starting with Jordan B. Peterson. In response to Peterson’s statements on gender nonconformity and reports of harassment from his previous lectures, many students took issue with his invitation, echoing the backlash to Harvard Financial Analyst Club's invitation of Martin Shkreli this February. Although we have qualms with the mission statement of OCI and disagree with Peterson’s statements, we nonetheless recognize OCI’s potential value and the difference in the two groups’ purposes and processes.
As we have previously argued, since HFAC never provided any justification for Shkreli’s invitation, it seems that they invited him simply for the sake of publicity. Under the guise of “valuing free speech principles,” HFAC gave Shkreli a platform to praise himself, all while censoring questions regarding his controversial legal and financial decisions and impeding the press from reporting on the event. Rather than informing the campus discussion, HFAC used the controversy to indulge in Shkreli’s oversized persona. The difference in intellectual weight between Shkreli and Peterson aside, OCI displayed much more respect for campus discourse. Not only did OCI moderate the discussion well—with the event moderator continually pressing Peterson and rejecting simple talking point answers—but they also allowed attendees to ask questions directly, as protesters silent through the talk ultimately did.
OCI’s understanding of First Amendment principles therefore comes off as much more genuine. Freedom of speech is valuable because it allows individuals from across the ideological spectrum to engage with one another. The resultant clash strengthens and advances our best ideas, and prevents our campus from becoming an echo chamber. If OCI continues to properly moderate controversial speakers, substantially engaging with and scrutinizing them, they will have enriched campus discourse and helped move towards the ideal of free speech that informs their mission.
Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that the benefits of broadened discourse come with an uneven distribution of cost. Peterson’s comments regarding gender nonconformity, seen as inconsequential or valid among some students, are direct attacks on the identities of others. Regardless of one's personal view about the necessity of engaging with uncomfortable ideas, everyone should recognize the potential emotional burden that students bear in countering these proposals.
This is not to say that students should be insulated from concepts with which they disagree or even that such debate is unimportant. The better informed that students are, the better they will be able to engage with contrary viewpoints once they exit Harvard. Refusing to debate speakers who we find uncomfortable is unproductive, and including them in a conversation does not necessarily validate their views. As OCI has shown, it is possible to frame such speech so that we may confront it, placing it on an operating table rather than an oratory lectern.
Nonetheless, the backlash to Peterson’s comments highlights the need for support in these debates. Free speech is too often championed for more privileged members of discourse, making unqualified support of it tone-deaf to those who potentially have a part of their identity at stake. Those who have the privilege to do so should help shoulder that burden and debate against ideas which are more targeted at marginalized individuals.
To reach the truth, we must consider all ideas—not just ones that we are comfortable with. Organizations that invite controversy in the name of free speech should use that controversy to further campus discourse rather than to simply garner publicity. We commend OCI for leaving a positive first impression, but it is crucial to continue to hold that speech accountable through proper moderation and engagement, lest we celebrate regressive speech where we should instead challenge it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Wherever you are from...you are home.”
The sign is meant to present Harvard as a welcoming place: a home to students from all different identities. The inspiring message pulls on the heartstrings of students passing through Harvard Yard as they walk to class. You almost believe it. You almost believe that a school which promotes such a message would never allow anything to make a student here feel otherwise.
The creation of the Open Campus Initiative has shown us where Harvard students’ values lie. It recently formed with the intention of bringing controversial speakers to Harvard as a way to promote free speech. By inviting these speakers, students are meant to engage in dialogue with people who have opposing viewpoints as a way to understand their opinions and bridge the partisan gaps between polarized groups in order to foster greater community. However, by allowing odious speakers on campus, Harvard is not promoting freedom of speech; it’s promoting hate speech.
Though OCI may claim not to agree with all the views presented by the speakers who are invited, they are still giving them a platform to speak. They are validating opinions which are extremely harmful to students that are being targeted on the basis of their existence and identity.
We saw these twisted, hateful views welcome earlier this week with an event featuring a transphobic and misogynistic speaker: Jordan Peterson. Peterson presents the kind of alienating opinion that OCI seems to value more than students' own identities. During the event, he rejected the delineation between biological sex and gender, refused to refer to people by their preferred gender pronouns, and rebuffed the existence of Women and Gender Studies as a field of academic study.
We must make it clear that this back and forth is not an even fight. Equating a single individual’s opinion to the same level of importance as an individual’s identity is unacceptable. We cannot afford to “test” the limits of free speech. A very clear line already exists; you are welcome to your own opinion so long as your opinion does not threaten another person’s existence. The line has been crossed here.
Our intent is not to simply deafen ourselves to the perspectives of others that contradict our own; on the contrary—we welcome ideas that are constructive, productive, and foster meaningful conversation about objective issues to broaden our horizons. Yet, when these platforms are instead manipulated and abused to further proselytize a disregard for another’s identity, we cannot sit idle and allow such hateful rhetoric to stew.
Through the creation of the Open Campus Initiative, it seems like we are moving backwards rather than moving forward. It enforces the notion that Harvard isn’t a home for everyone when a large portion of our student body cannot feel safe here.
Allowing such speakers on campus gives a message that the well-being of marginalized students is of little importance. Some of our colleagues on the Editorial Board seem to believe it is acceptable for such a burden to be placed on students by expecting them to attend these events in order to push back against those triggering opinions. Students who are members of the communities that have or will come under attack by controversial speakers already face enough discrimination on a daily basis.
Having to constantly defend one’s own identity and stand up for what’s right is absolutely draining. Having to constantly justify your own existence is exhausting. Is it asking too much to allow students to exist without constantly worrying about which speaker will be the next one to publicly invalidate their existence? Is it too much to ask that Harvard not be complicit in this charade?
We can’t expect marginalized students to stay quiet. We can’t allow these speakers on campus under the assumption that students who feel threatened should carry this weight tight-lipped. We have a powerful community of students who are willing to push back because they know where their values lie. Remaining complacent is not an option.
As an academic institution, Harvard is meant to place extreme value on a student’s pursuit of knowledge and education. By promoting hate speech, the Open Campus Initiative is being hypocritical in helping to foster students’ educational enrichment. Such an act deters a student’s ability to focus on academics when they have to spend their valuable time trying to convince someone, who hasn’t felt their struggles, that they are deserving of basic human rights.
There is nothing to be grateful for with this initiative. There is nothing to commend or be proud of. The potential for hate speech to flourish on campus through the Open Campus Initiative has an enormous negative effect on students personally affected by issues addressed by those speakers. The alleged possible benefits from having these speakers on campus would not come near outweighing the physical and emotional toll placed on students who feel the need to stand up for their own identities. For the sake of its students, Harvard should not allow such negative and harmful views to be legitimized and substantiated on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last summer, I got into the habit of running along the Charles at night without my contacts on. One piece I began writing would have described the unique freedom of rushing forward with only my feet and the periodic, depthless glare of headlights to guide me. It would have drawn the parallel between running without contact lenses and the need to occasionally relax our myopic focuses and trust ourselves, trust the ground beneath our feet, trust the night.
In recent weeks, however, I have been reminded yet again that there is a tremendous inconsistency in the world—or maybe just a horrifying consistency—that at one point I ran alone, at night, essentially blind, not only without dire consequence but with a sense of exhilaration, while for others even the ground is a constant source of existential terror.
There are many necessary, ongoing discussions about whether Harvard is a safe space for all of its students. (The term “safe space” is politically loaded, but I mean literally safe.) But we do generally walk Harvard’s paths and streets absent deep fear—of passerby, of cars on the street, of what is overhead or underfoot. There have been incidents but, thank goodness, no circumstance historical or present gives us reason to be constantly on alert. Most of us don’t think about this much; it’s taken for granted. Confronted with the photograph of a blood-smeared church floor in Egypt, a written testimony from a sarin attack victim, or maps of plague eating through nations like cartographic leprosy, you might spend a few moments imagining what it would be like to walk from class wondering whether the next footfall will detonate something, or look at exactly how much nourishment is left on the dishware you pitch so casually into the trash.
Practically, such self-flagellating pivots cannot be applied to everything. I wouldn’t enjoy the food I ate because people are starving; I wouldn’t enjoy the clothes I wore because someone is unclothed. I’ve heard the “There are starving children in Africa!” line, intended to shame people out of food waste, become something of a joke.
Paul Bloom has written an entire book warning against the dangers of empathy, the exercise of experiencing the world as others do and feeling their pain. Empathy is overwhelming. It narrows our vision to the ones we empathize with. Empathy for one group comes at the cost of empathy for others. (Engaging in military action to help the sarin victims, for example, disregards even more numerous and beleaguered future war victims.) Too much empathy reduces our ability to achieve the higher goal the emotion aimed at in the first place, which is to do or allow the most possible good in the world. In lieu of empathy, Bloom says, we should have compassion, which in Bloom’s book is “a mixture of caring and detached cost-benefit analysis,” and leads to things like effective altruism—a marriage of concern for others’ suffering and a rational approach to alleviating it.
When I express frustration that there are so many things I have made no gestures to fix, I often hear or tell myself a version of this argument. It is no use sitting around all day festering in the pain of countless atrocities and injustices I cannot directly amend. There is no way each of us can individually fix every problem, and many students at Harvard are doing the best they can with available resources so that they will, one day, be able to effect meaningful, large-scale change. Bloom and others in the anti-empathy camp, including the ever-controversial moral philosopher Peter Singer, are proponents of “effective altruism,” which itself is a huge subject of debate.
But I’m not even sure that I’ve engaged properly with the “caring” part of compassion, let alone subsequent altruistic action. Between classes, assignments, sleeping, eating, and taking care of my body, I’m lucky to get through a handful of stories about the world beyond Harvard per day. I find myself disturbed, when I reengage with the external world in time to feel adequately appalled, by how little I need or have time to take the first step of caring during the daily rush. Maybe too much empathy is counterproductive, but on days when I am confronted with the testimony of a sarin victim or the photograph of a blood-spattered church in Egypt, I feel that I have been unforgivably asleep during the interim, and will almost immediately fall back into Harvard’s insular lull again until the next rupture.
What is our obligation to not even set out to fix the wrongs of the world, but to actively seek knowledge of them in the first place? It’s not even a question of whether I’m doing enough—first, am I thinking enough? Am I making myself uncomfortable enough with the things I choose to learn about the world? The answer implicit for me in the rhetorical questions is “no,” at least for now. But at this point, I really just want to keep myself accountable for asking the questions. To require that I consistently ask them at least of myself, that I keep my eyes open and my vista higher and wider than my own two feet, does not seem too much to ask. Beyond the safe bounds of metaphor and my runs on the Charles, barreling myopically through the dark rarely leads to good consequences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Samantha Power, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, has been jointly appointed to faculty positions at Harvard Law School and the Kennedy School of Government, the University announced in a press release Thursday.
Power, who served as the United States’ 28th ambassador to the UN from 2013 to 2017, previously worked at the Kennedy School as the founding executive director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy in 1998.
At the Kennedy School, Power will serve as the Anna Lindh Professor of the Practice of Global Leadership and Public Policy. At the Law School, she will serve as a Professor of Practice. Her appointment begins immediately.
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said Power’s experience in foreign diplomacy will inform her scholarship.
“As she joins the faculty of her alma mater and the faculty of the Kennedy School, her experiences, perceptions, and commitments will offer invaluable illumination of laws, policies, politics, ideals, and realities essential to the pursuit of justice, human rights, and international relations,” Minow said.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf spoke similarly about Power’s time on the world stage.
“Power’s record of public service speaks volumes about her knowledge of and commitment to diplomacy, human rights, international justice, and the rule of law,” Elmendorf said.
Power, who received her J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1999 and won a Pulitzer Prize for her writing on the American response to genocide in the 20th century, said in the press release that she is excited to return to Harvard.
“I believe it is essential that we do all we can to ensure that graduates have the skills they need to succeed in messy geopolitical and multilateral environments,” Power said. “Given the daunting challenges we confront – whether from terrorism, rising nationalism, climate change, or mass atrocities – it is essential that we in academia draw lessons from experience, devise practical approaches, and prepare the next generation to improve their communities, their countries, and the world.”

The Freshman Dean’s Office will revive a previous position called the “Director of Community and Diversity” in response to recommendations from a 2015 report written by the College’s diversity and inclusion working group.
The reinstated director will be responsible for developing programming for first year students, as well as for ensuring that the online sites for the Community and Diversity programs clearly articulate the relevant initiatives offered by the FDO. The director is further tasked with ensuring that the makeup of FDO employees accurately reflects the diversity of each year’s class of freshmen.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the revival of the position in an interview Tuesday.
“That is to continue our focus on belonging and inclusion,” Khurana said of the move. “And there will be a lot of—once the individual is in place—a lot of focus on systemic processes and approaches to belonging and inclusion, especially in the first year.”
The FDO has not yet hired anyone to fill the position. In a press release, FDO employees wrote that “the director position will be assessed in the summer of 2017.”
The FDO first decided to revive the position last summer, and FDO employee Jasmine M. Waddell stepped up to supervise the person initially chosen to serve in the role, whom Waddell declined to name. But after the first director left the College for “personal reasons” last semester, Waddell took her place and has acted as director ever since.
Waddell also serves as the Resident Dean of Freshmen for Elm Yard and as an Assistant Dean of Harvard College.
“You know, it’s been a very full plate, but I also think this work is really important,” Waddell said of her three positions. “All of us in the Freshman Dean’s Office have different roles, and these are some of the roles that I have.”
She added that she has enjoyed her time as director.
“It’s been really fun,” Waddell added. “It has been a programming position—so we have done a couple of really fun programs.”
In particular, she cited a recent FDO initiative in which a group of roughly 40 freshmen examined transcripts at Oberon Theatre that discussed the experience of transgender women, and a February coffee house celebration of Black History Month hosted by the FDO.
In their lengthy November 2015 report, the College’s Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion also recommended other reforms regarding diversity at the school, including the creation of a University-wide task force that would consider similar issues.
University President Drew G. Faust accepted the working group’s recommendation in an email heralding the report and announced last September that the committee—dubbed the “Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging”—was set to begin its work.
The committee most recently announced on April 6 that Harvard will change the final line of “Fair Harvard,” the University’s 181-year-old alma mater, which has read “Till the stock of the Puritans die” since its composition in 1836.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten Harvard Law School student affinity groups have endorsed Professor David B. Wilkins ’77 to be the next Dean of the Law School in a letter published in The Harvard Law Record Wednesday.
The letter, which calls upon University President Drew G. Faust to choose Wilkins as the new dean, comes months after current Law School Dean Martha L. Minow announced in January her plans to step down at the end of this academic year. There is currently no public list of candidates for the position.
In the letter, the students groups argue that Wilkins is best positioned to lead the Law School and outline a number of criteria for the next dean of the school, including “The Dean must be a leader committed to innovation in education,” “The Dean must inspire and understand the Student Body,” and “The Dean must be committed to student inclusion and belonging.”
In particular, the letter praises Wilkins’s background studying the legal profession and his commitment to engaging students.
“We, as a University, as a Law School, and as a distinctly privileged group of individuals, cannot afford to squander the opportunity to appoint Professor David Wilkins as Dean of Harvard Law School,” the letter reads.
Upon launching the formal search for a new dean shortly after Minow’s announcement, Faust appointed a Faculty Advisory Committee to collect and provide input on the decision-making process, and Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 will select the school’s next leader.
Natalie D. Vernon, who co-wrote the letter and is the president of the Women’s Law Association, said drafters of the letter started by determining the qualities of an individual who would be best suited to the deanship.
“We started with a big picture conversation about the qualities we think a dean should possess,” Vernon said. “We took a look around and we had some conversations about who would best meet these qualities, and Professor Wilkins is above and beyond the best candidate for the job.”
Kristin A. Turner, who also co-wrote the letter and is the president of the Black Law Students’ Association, said the students who drafted the letter decided to endorse a specific candidate to offer a concrete option.
“We toyed around with the idea of writing a letter that was general, but then we decided to take it upon ourselves and actually discuss amongst ourselves and survey the climate of the campus and see who within our own represented and embodied the ideals and what we envisioned and what we hoped to see out of the institution,” Vernon said.
Wilkins, who attended Harvard Law School, currently serves as the Lester Kissel Professor of Law, the Vice Dean for Global Initiatives on the Legal Profession, and the Faculty Director of the Center on the Legal Profession and the Center for Lawyers and the Professional Services Industry at Harvard Law School.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an email statement that Faust appreciates students’ active involvement in the process.
“President Faust is grateful to have the students’ letter as well as the many other thoughtful communications on the dean search that she has received from across the Law School community,” Jackson wrote.
The affinity groups’ endorsement follows months of student efforts to increase their input in the dean search. Previously, the Law School held panels for students to speak with members of the Faculty Advisory Committee, and Faust has provided an email address to which students can send feedback and perspective on the search. Still, some students have asked to take on a more involved role in the search.

The inflatable obstacle course has been reserved, food for the block parties has been ordered, and student opening acts are rehearsing. But with seven days until Yardfest—the College’s annual outdoor concert—the College Events Board is still silent on the artist headlining the event.
Although the final date has been set since early March, contract negotiations have delayed the announcement of the artist headlining the concert, according to CEB co-chair Caleb Spiegel Ostrom ’18.
“We look forward to announcing the artist very soon. Unfortunately, our contract negotiations have prevented us from announcing the name earlier,” Spiegel Ostrom wrote in an emailed statement.
It is unclear whether the CEB has finalized contract negotiations, and members of the Board declined  to comment on the status of the artist selection.
Yardfest is hosted by the CEB, a student-led programming board sponsored by the Office of Student Life. Alexander R. Miller, assistant dean of student life, confirmed that the free concert is still scheduled for April 21.
“The Office of Student Life and the College Events Board are excited for Yardfest next Friday,” Miller wrote in an emailed statement on Thursday.
The conspicuous absence of the main event at the annual spring concert has started to worry some students.
Matthew H. Fraschilla ’17 said that he noticed last year’s artist was announced late, too, and he thinks people are starting to become concerned.
“People are wondering if something happened to the original artist. Were we never able to find someone big, and they’re trying to work on it?” Fraschilla said. “A lot of people expect the worst when you don’t give information like that.”
In addition to the afternoon performances in Tercentenary Theatre, Yardfest is popular with students for the parties hosted before the event even starts. For the first time last year, the College sponsored pre-Yardfest neighborhood block parties in collaboration with the OSL and each of the House Committees.
Planning for this year’s neighborhood socials is well underway despite the lack of an artist announcement.
Gemma Collins ’18, co-chair of Eliot House’s Committee, said they are busy preparing the “River West Fest” with the Kirkland and Winthrop House Committees.
“We have already ordered the food and supplies for the event and ordered an inflatable obstacle course,” Collins said. “Regardless of who the Yardfest artist is, River West Fest is sure to be a blast.”
This year, student band Hello Cleveland will open Yardfest with Kyle Ray. With or without a publicly announced headliner, the group is excited to perform.
“The main act isn't that important to us in terms of preparation,” said W. Gant Player ’19, a member of Hello Cleveland. “We're more bummed as students that we don't know who is playing yet and after our set I think all of us plan on going out in the crowd and having fun.”
This is the second year that the Yardfest artist will be announced close to the event. In 2016, CEB was “still in the phase of contract negotiations” less than three weeks before the event was scheduled. Electronic dance artist Steve Aoki was eventually announced 11 days before the concert.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Latin School, a prestigious public high school, requested to stay out of a lawsuit accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian Americans in its admissions processes after the plaintiff of that lawsuit delivered them a subpoena earlier this year.
BLS, founded one year before Harvard College, is the oldest public school in the United States and is consistently one of the largest feeder schools for Harvard’s students. 26 BLS students matriculated to the College Class of 2020.
Filed by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, the subpoena requests the deposition of a representative from BLS to speak on the “racial composition of applicants, admitted persons, and enrollees to Harvard.” It also asks that someone from BLS discuss alleged discrimination against Asian-American applicants at BLS in admission to any college, Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policy, and any communications with Harvard concerning the suit or SFFA.
SFFA, in the subpoena, has additionally requested that BLS produce all documents relating to communications over a six-year period between BLS and various other parties regarding race-conscious admissions at Harvard, alleged discrimination against Asian-American students, and other matters of the case.
In response, BLS has filed a motion to quash the subpoena, claiming that the school has had no involvement in the case and that SFFA cannot use the subpoena as a “fishing expedition."
BLS stated in the motion, dated April 6, that they found no students or BLS staff were involved in discrimination or other “improper acts.”
The motion further argues that the information requested in the subpoena is more conveniently accessible through Harvard and public sources and that SFFA has not demonstrated the relevance of the requested information to the case.
“The subpoena poses an undue burden on the non-party witness,” BLS wrote in the motion, “and invokes serious privacy concerns under state and federal law.”
BLS believes that the subpoena may create a “chilling effect,” as the requested information is reported to be private and personal to students and their families. Per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the confidentiality of students’ education records are protected, and written approval is typically required to release such records.
The lawsuit, which was filed in Nov. 2014, is currently in the discovery period, as both sides continue to gather evidence for their case. On Apr. 12, legal counsel representing SFFA wrote a letter to the court requesting a conference in early May to resolve the motion to quash and other pending issues in order to meet the June 20 deadline for discovery.
This was the first motion to quash filed in the lawsuit. Representatives from SFFA and Boston Public Schools declined to comment on the motion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In front of a high-profile audience at the Harvard Art Museums, Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns previewed parts of an upcoming film series about the Vietnam War Thursday night.
Hundreds, including University President Drew G. Faust and former United Nations Secretary-General and soon-to-be Kennedy School fellow Ban-Ki Moon, gathered to watch about an hour of Burns’s series, which in total includes 10 episodes and about 18 hours of footage. It follows the Vietnam War from start to finish, and includes footage and photos of the war, as well as interviews with veterans.
The series will be released September on PBS and will feature a score arrange by Yo-Yo Ma ’76.
Anthony Saich, who directs the Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, praised Burns’s past work and said he is excited to see the full series. He added that the preview Thursday also shed light on a current tumultuous political climate in the United States.
“I’ve learned most of my history through Ken’s movies,” Saich said. “If anything, the film demonstrates that the current polarization and hand-wringing… is not exclusive to the political debates of today.”
The documentary series is centered on American politics in the 1960s, especially the election of Richard Nixon and anti-war demonstrations outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
The largely unpopular war reverberated through Harvard in the 1960s, when a group of students took over University Hall in an act of protest in 1969.
Several Harvard faculty also signed a statement condemning the war and bombings in North Vietnam in 1965. Also that year, roughly 200 undergraduates traveled to Washington, D.C. to participate in the  March on Washington for Peace in Vietnam. An estimated 250,000 demonstrators marched in total.
After the screening, Burns and Lynn Novick, who directed the series with Burns, answered questions from the audience alongside Thomas J. Vallely, former director of the Vietnam Program at the Ash Center.

An outbreak of E. coli, a bacteria causing foodborne illness, has shuttered Chicken & Rice Guys locations across the Boston area, including the chain’s food truck commonly parked in the Science Center Plaza.
By Thursday night, the outbreak—one of the larger E. coli outbreaks in Mass.—had affected 15 people, with 10 people already hospitalized, according to the Boston Globe. In a statement sent early Thursday afternoon, Steven Collicelli, a marketing manager for the chain, wrote in an email that the cases have been linked to products from the food trucks and the Allston restaurant location between March 27 and April 6.
"So far we have heard of no cases related to our Harvard truck," Collicelli wrote.
After health inspectors confirmed seven initial cases on Tuesday, Chicken & Rice Guys closed their stores and food trucks, including the truck often outside the Science Center. The Chicken & Rice Guys locations passed a “thorough review” from health officials, according to Collicelli, and the officials are now investigating on food suppliers and personnel.
“All CNR operations will be temporarily suspended by the Health Department until at least Monday while we continue to test, work with investigators, and clean,” wrote Collicelli. Starting Wednesday, the company began testing its nearly 100 employees for E. coli. On Thursday, they hired independent food safety experts and another cleaning service to aid cleaning and inspecting.
According to the National Institutes of Health, E. coli can cause infection or irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, dehydration, fever, and, in some cases, paralysis.
As one of the primary food trucks in the Science Center Plaza, Chicken & Rice Guys is a popular option for some students.
Hannah Shen ’19, an inactive Crimson business editor, was “really surprised” to hear about the outbreak.
“I love that place,” Shen said. “Usually when I see it I’ll definitely get something from it, but I’m happy that I didn’t get it last week.”
Jason C. Shen ’17 said he ate at Chicken & Rice Guys biweekly last semester. He said he last ate at the truck either last week or the week prior.
“I actually didn’t know that they had this outbreak,” Shen said. “I guess that is kind of concerning, but I don’t know, I feel fine so far, so fingers crossed I guess.”
Jason Shen also said that the outbreak would not deter him from eating at Chicken & Rice Guys, should the food truck come back.
“I’m sure they’ll handle it the best that they can, and I trust them to resolve the issue,” he said. “I don’t think I’d have any problems with going back.”
Hannah Shen felt similarly, saying she hopes the problem is resolved and that people will feel safe eating there again.
“I honestly will still eat there because I think it’s a one-time thing, they’ve been serving for a long time, and there’s not really a replacement in the Square for it,” she said.
This is not the first time E. coli has affected the food scene around Harvard. In 2006, Harvard University Dining Services removed all spinach products from dining halls for a month after a nationwide E. coli outbreak in spinach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College will not fully recognize new student groups for at least one year after their founding, and the new groups will have to meet with administrators relevant to the club’s focus during the application process, according to a new plan from the Office of Student Life and the Undergraduate Council.
Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller detailed the new plan at the Undergraduate Council’s Rules Committee meeting Thursday night.
“If the group is approved, then they are then expected to remain in some kind of intermediate status for a year, so they are asked to build signature programs, build a membership, have some presence on campus,” Miller said.
Under the new plan, the campus “experts" will provide recommendations on whether to approve new student groups to the OSL, which will then deliver the recommendations to the UC.
After the first year trial period, UC representatives will vote to determine if student groups are accepted for full recognition, need more time for growth, or are rejected, Miller said. While the OSL currently has rubrics for judging student groups, the Rules Committee is considering revamping those rubrics to adapt to the new system.
The College’s Office of Student Life announced earlier this semester that it would not be accepting applications for new clubs, citing a proliferation of undergraduate student groups at Harvard. In March, the UC voted to amend its constitution and bylaws to take part in a new club approval process.
The UC Rules Committee is currently tasked with developing a plan for the UC’s club oversight process. Miller said at Thursday’s meeting that the committee must submit such a proposal in one week.
“I think it’s largely up to us to decide what we want to tack on to what the OSL’s already been doing, what if anything we would want to add to this rubric, which I think looking through it right now is pretty reasonable,” Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said.
Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 said he hopes the UC can work with the OSL to reduce redundant student groups at the College. Harvard is currently home to 442 recognized student organizations.
“We really need to be more cognizant of the density of organizations and how we’re contributing to that and I think that’s something that we, as students, are especially equipped to do,” he said.
Bonsall said he agreed, and that too many student groups will also be too expensive for the UC.
“Although the ambition of Harvard students may be unlimited, our money is not. So I think that you’re exactly right,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 14, 2017 at 1:09 p.m.
In the excitement leading up to next Wednesday’s Beanpot Championship against Boston College, set to be played in Fenway Park, breezing through the remainder of the week might very well be a temptation for the Harvard baseball team. That is, of course, if there wasn’t Yale to deal with first.
The Crimson (12-15, 1-7 Ivy League) will square off against the Bulldogs (16-13, 7-1 Ivy) at O’Donnell Field in a pair of doubleheaders this weekend in a series that will begin Saturday and last well into the following day. The games will provide Harvard with an opportunity to not only knock off its rivals from New Haven, but to bounce back from a losing streak the team recently extended to four.
The Crimson will enter the weekend ranked sixth in the Ivy League, with just one conference win under its belt. Yale, however, is currently occupying the top spot in the Red Rolfe Division. The Bulldogs have won seven of their last eight games in the Ancient Eight. Harvard will look to leave records in the rearview and simply play ball.
“Yale’s record does not intimidate us, and I think we know that there is little to lose and we will play loosely,” said senior pitcher and first baseman Matt Hink. “It is still the game of baseball no matter who the opponent is.”
The last time the two teams met, it was the Crimson that came away with the victory. In back-to-back doubleheaders similar to ones set for this weekend, Harvard defeated the Bulldogs three games to one.
“We treat it just like any other game,” sophomore outfielder Devan Peterson said. “Coming off last year, where we beat them three out of four, I think we’re confident. I feel like we’re ready to go.”
The Crimson will rely on the offensive power of sophomore outfielder Patrick Robinson, who is currently leading the team with a .390 batting average and 32 hits on the season. The Melbourne, Fla. native is coming off a strong performance Tuesday night against Boston College. Robinson had a home run against the Eagles and drove in two additional runs as well. With an impressive on-base percentage of .468, he is sure to play a key role in Harvard’s game plan.
“I think we have a positive outlook going into this weekend,” Peterson said. “BC was a tough loss for us, but we definitely had some positive takeaways. The hitters got to face solid pitching and the pitchers got to work against a quality lineup. Offensively, we realized that we need to minimize our strikeouts and hit better with runners in scoring position.”
In the opposing dugout, Yale will lean on the bat of sophomore Benny Wanger. The Newtown, Mass. native was named Ivy League Player of the Week on Tuesday, after hitting a game-winning RBI in three of the Bulldogs’ conference wins.
“Defensively, we need to minimize the mistakes that lead to big innings, which has been a problem for us,” Peterson said. “We’re mostly just working to maintain focused aggression on both sides of the ball, whether that’s being more aggressive swinging at balls that are in our zone or diving for balls in the outfield. We just need to expect to make more plays and hopefully come out with some more W’s.”
While this weekend’s series will not be played in one of baseball’s most historic stadiums, as next Wednesday’s battle with Boston College will, the stakes will nonetheless be high. With the season quickly winding down, a win for the Crimson could provide crucial momentum for the team’s final stretch.
“In the Ivy League, where every team is so closely matched and the season is so condensed, we realize that every game matters a lot,” Peterson said. “The winning teams are those that stay focused and never take a pitch off.”
Facing a tough opponent in top-ranked Yale, Harvard will need a complete team effort in order to come away with a series victory.
“It’s a matter of putting all of our pieces together at one time,” Hink said. “We have yet to play while running on all cylinders this year and if we can hit it, pitch it, and field it well all at the same time, then we are tough to beat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday night, playing at home in Blodgett Pool, the No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team (13-10, 3-2 CWPA) fought its way to a crucial 8-7 win over Ivy League rival Brown (18-6, 2-3 CWPA).
“They’re always one-goal games,” coach Ted Minnis said. “We told the team before the game it was going to be a one-goal game, and it was a one-goal game. I thought we were really resilient to keep hammering away. ”
Though the Crimson defeated the Bears in the teams’ most recent matchup last spring, Harvard is only 3-6 against Brown over the last five years.
Nonetheless, the Crimson entered Wednesday night’s game with positive momentum after a strong weekend, going 2-1 in a trio of conference games, falling only to No. 7 Michigan. Last weekend, Freshman attacker Sofia Carrera-Justiz totaled seven goals and four assists to lead the Crimson attack. Also anchoring the Harvard offense, sophomore attacker Kristen Hong has scored at least once in each of the last nine contests.
Just 79 seconds into Wednesday’s game, Brown sophomore Carmen Rosas found the net, giving the Bears an early lead. With 3:39 left in the first quarter, co-captain attacker Zoe Osborne responded to Brown’s goal, tying the score at 1-1.
In the second frame, a pair of goals assisted by co-captain attacker Michelle Martinelli, the first scored by Carrera-Justiz and the second by Hong, gave the Crimson a two-goal lead. However, the Bears rebounded with two goals in the final three minutes of the half, to tie the score again at 3-3 going into the intermission.
Strong defensive play from both teams kept the game tied for most of the third quarter. Finally, with 2:16 left on the clock, Martinelli broke the stalemate with a powerful shot from straight on, but Rosas responded quickly for Brown, tying the game again with 33 seconds left in the third. However, determined to end the period with a lead, freshman defender Mathilde Ribordy found the back of the net with 13 seconds left in the third quarter.
In the final stanza, picking up just where she left off, Ribordy tallied another goal a mere 20 seconds into the last period, giving Harvard a 6-4 lead. Not letting the Crimson get comfortable with the two-point advantage, the Bears scored, making it once again a one-point game.
Harvard and Brown continued to play a very evenly matched game. Sophomore defender Haley Bowe and freshman defender Lana Gorlinski tallied a late goal each for the Crimson. With 56 seconds left in the game, the Bears scored one more, closing the margin to 8-7. However, the Harvard defense stayed strong, preventing Brown from scoring an equalizing goal in the final minute of play.
Junior goalie Cleo Harrington was crucial to the win, totaling 10 stops in the net to mark her fifth game this season with a double-digit save total.
“We definitely had to grind for the win against Brown,” Hong said. “Coming into a rivalry game, you always know it’s going to be tough, despite whether or not you’ve been losing and winning against different teams. I’m just really glad that we were able to stick with our game and fight through.”
Wednesday’s win was a big one for Harvard. Both the Crimson and the Bears entered the evening with 2-2 records in conference play. This victory secures Harvard a third- to fifth-place seed going into the conference championship.
“I think we played really well defensively,” Minnis said. “We dictated the tempo and played our pace which was good. Now we’re really focused on getting our wins and getting the highest seed for our conference championships.”
The Crimson will play its final regular season games this weekend with a trio of CWPA matchups at Brown. On Friday, Harvard will take on No. 18 Hartwick before facing No. 14 Indiana and St. Francis on Saturday.

So you’re proud of being fluent in our school’s jargon and sounding like a proper upperclassman. Reality check: although you might as well get a language citation in Harvard, the skill of juggling terms like “proctor” or “SOCH” will not earn you points in real life.
Sadly, outside of our little bubble these terms have little relevance, so your use of college-specific lingo is going to result in either confusion or rolled eyes (they get that you go to Harvard). So start transitioning to real-world language to accommodate people who still say “finals clubs” and ask about your "major". Or double down on these obscure terms if you want to be that pretentious a**hole whose every fifth word is "Harvard".
Concentration and secondary
Although these terms are beloved trademarks of our school, people in the real world use words like “major”, “minor” and “course of study” to describe their academic specialization. But if you want to confuse or humblebrag, by all means tell them about your History of Eastern Slavic Literature secondary (you are sooo interesting).
Harvard Time
An important thing to remember—the real world does not operate on Harvard time. Seriously, your supervisor is not going to accept it as an excuse when you’re smug about being 7 minutes late.
Punch
Hate to break it to you, but nobody cares that you were punched by both the Porcellian and the Owl. You’re lucky if anybody has even heard of these frat surrogates (pray they actually saw the “Social Network”).
HUDS
The timeless joke of “anything is better than HUDS food” is not going to make anyone chuckle (actually, that is true even at Harvard). So, please leave dining hall jokes to us.
TF/preceptor
Don’t disappoint the general public by revealing that we are not actually taught by Harvard’s world-renowned faculty. Although these professors are usually listed as course instructors, TFs are the actual teachers. Still, maybe it’s a good thing Mankiw only graced us with his presence like two times this semester?
Expos
Even upperclassmen forget about the torture that is Expository Writing immediately after freshman year. Don’t count on anyone outside of Harvard even remotely understanding the term.
Q Guide
Unfortunately, you can’t angrily decide to give your superiors a bad Q score every time they annoy you.
These obscure terms (plus many more) are a dead giveaway of your Harvard-ness. Seriously, your “I go to a school near Boston” won’t fool anyone unless you ditch the lingo.
