After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the ability to keep 15 salaried players on their roster, the Phoenix Suns have reportedly filled the end of their bench with former Harvard men's basketball forward Kyle Casey ’13-’14. The Suns, who had just 13 players with guaranteed salaries on their roster, signed Casey and shooting guard Terrico White to training-camp contracts on Friday, according to the reports.
Casey averaged just over 11 points a game as a junior before taking on a reduced role in his final season in Cambridge, averaging just under 10 points a game. He shot better than 50 percent in his first three seasons at Harvard and was a four-time All-Ivy League teamer. The 2009-2010 Ivy League Rookie of the Year ranks among the top-15 in Harvard history in points, rebounds, and blocks.
After college, Casey was invited to workouts with various NBA teams—including the hometown Boston Celtics—but eventually went undrafted. After a summer league stint with the Brooklyn Nets, Casey played the 2014-2015 season overseas for Helios in Slovenia.
In camp, Casey will likely compete with Sonny Weems for playing time on the wing behind presumed starter P.J. Tucker and top reserve T.J. Warren. If he doesn’t make the team, he will likely suit up for Phoenix’s D-League affiliate, the Bakersfield Jam, this coming season.
