Three percent sounds like a small number, but it is not quite that tiny when discussing economic growth. Considering we had a gross domestic product of 18.46 trillion dollars at the end of 2016, even the smallest percentage fluctuation is significant. Currently, the U.S. economy’s growth rate is wavering around 2 percent.
President Trump claimed throughout his campaign that he could help our economy hit that 3 percent. He has even gone as far to say that we can hit 4, 5, or even 6 percent growth. Yes, between 1948 and 2005, our annual economic growth rate had hit 3 percent two-thirds of the time. But since 2005, it has not risen above 2.7 percent. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office and other forecasters are predicting an average economic growth rate over the next decade that won’t even hit 2 percent.
Why does Trump want a higher economic growth rate? Well, the White House claims that if we do not reach 3 percent productivity, the “budget will never balance.” Trump has used the assumption that the United States can reach 3 percent annual economic growth in his crafting of the administration’s 62-page budget proposal. Before anyone can realistically predict the suitability or effectiveness of Trump’s budget proposal, however, we first should be fairly confident in our economic growth rate increasing to 3 percent. That’s highly unlikely to happen.
Let’s look at what is driving declining growth rates. We can point towards the size of the active labor force and its productivity. The size of the participating U.S. labor force is slowly shrinking. This is in part due to the aging baby boomer generation retiring. The labor force participation rate has also been decreasing for both working-age males and females, and had started declining before the Great Recession.
Another factor is immigration.  According to the Pew Research Center, if we cannot get 18 million more people to immigrate to America in the future, the size of our working-age population will continue to diminish. Trump’s push to implement travel bans isn’t helping his own goal of increasing the economic growth rate. Furthermore, in January of this year Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the economy is “near maximum employment.”
So we know that the outlook on the size of the workforce isn’t positive. How about the chances of innovative or technological potential to support a boom in economic growth? According to Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University, these odds are not good either, saying that we’ve already reached the end of a long technology cycle and that the “low-hanging fruit of innovation-driven gains has been picked.”
He believes that robots, artificial intelligence, big data, autonomous cars, and other innovative ideas have already “been oversold” into the current economy, making a negligible difference in productivity. So if we want another boost to our economy, we might have to find new avenues of innovation. We can’t predict if or when we’ll discover new technology, so we shouldn’t base our hopes for large economic growth on innovation.
A big obstacle to Trump’s 3 percent goal may be Trump himself. In addition to his immigration proposals, Trump has proposed other policies that are obstacles to economic growth. In addition to the size of the active labor force and the potential of innovation and technology, another booster of economic growth and productivity is increased human capital. Some of Trump’s proposed policies cut back on programs or measures that work on increasing human capital.
Trump wants to cut training programs and federal student loan subsidies that could boost workers’ contribution to economic productivity. He also wants to cut government spending on research and other educational programs that would theoretically teach relevant skills and knowledge to individuals who’d enter the workforce and increase human capital. Of course, it’s important to see if the programs Trump wants to cut are actually doing an effective job in increasing human capital. We should be discussing not only program funding but also the effectiveness of the methods and procedures the programs use to increase human capital.
We cannot say for sure whether or not our economy will hit or sustain a growth rate of 3 percent. After all, most economists expected neither the 1973 downturn nor the 1995 upturn. We cannot predict whether a miracle event or forgotten factor may come along and boost our growth. However, it seems unlikely that we will hit that golden 3 percent in the near future.

This weekend, I went to Chinatown to buy peanut butter.
I’m still not entirely sure how it happened. It is a well-known fact among American travelers in Buenos Aires that while meat, gelato, dulce de leche, and other staples are more plentiful than the dog droppings on the sidewalk (and infinitely more appealing), peanut butter is nowhere to be found.
With a stubbornly gringo craving, I set out Sunday afternoon to find the elusive pasta de maní. I walked a pathetic number of blocks to the closest dietética, or health food store. But Vitalcer, Google Maps’ choice gastronomical link to the Western World of Nutty Spreads, was closed. Unfazed, and somehow hungrier, I ventured into the Coto five blocks farther down Avenida Cabildo. (Coto is basically the CVS of Buenos Aires, with more security guards and a better produce selection—hence the hope for peanut butter.)
I approached the nearest clerk. “¿Tenés pasta de maní?” He looked at me as if I had sparklers shooting out of my head. A snort later, I was walking out of Coto with empty hands and a grumbling stomach. When I asked my host mom why no store had peanut butter, she blinked and answered flatly, “Nadie lo compra.” No one buys it.
Hence my Sunday afternoon journey to Chinatown, el Barrio Chino, where, apparently, Chinese Argentines and hungry gringos do, in fact, buy peanut butter.
Chinatown is a misnomer for what awaited me eight blocks from the Juramento Subte station. Perhaps something like “Americanized, Spanish-speaking, Asian-themed Mélange” would be more appropriate, though I doubt it would fit on the red and green arch that seems to front every Chinatown.
Argentines milled along the street, rattling in rapid castellano under glittering Mandarin signs. The air was heavy with noise and fried food. Po from Kung Fu Panda was painted on a tree by the street. Spider-Man and Iron Man plushies hung in Asia Oriental gift shops. While I was admiring the Spanish-labeled sushi, Casa China played two consecutive Ke$ha songs. Jedi Master Yoda, doodled on a café chalkboard with squinty eyes and red-circled cheeks, advertised coffee in backwards Spanish rhymes—¡Si un buen día tener quieres, un buen café beber debes! My head was spinning when I finally walked out of Tina & Company with a jar of pasta de maní.
As I munched celery and peanut butter in a park nearby, I felt embarrassed by what I had seen. Kung Fu Panda, the Avengers, Ke$ha, Star Wars—all these American icons were loudly leaking from the United States to commercialize and contaminate an otherwise authentic cultural experience. Where were the stuffed Argentine heroes? The doodles from Chinese sci-fi films? The tango playing over speakers, the Oriental and South American stories on display? America—the peanut butter-craving expatriate concluded—was a modern imperialist, the world’s cultural bully.
But reflecting on a full stomach, I’m not so sure that’s the case.
In the words of U2 singer and humanitarian activist Bono, “America is an idea—and that idea is bound up in justice and equality for all.” We don’t call it imperialism when other nations imitate this idea politically, even when such imitation replaces indigenous, “authentic” ideas with distinctly Western ones. On the contrary, we celebrate Argentina’s transition from military regime to republic. These governments aren’t “Americanized” or even “Westernized”; they’re simply “just” and “free.” Why, then, do we feel compelled to condemn the spread of American pop culture as a form of imperialism?
Maybe Barrio Chino thinks of America the way Bono does. Maybe it’s not the “American-ness” of Ke$ha, Kung Fu Panda, the Avengers, or Star Wars that makes these icons so appealing. Maybe it’s the ideas behind them.
These stories and songs give us ideals, an almost modern world of forms where we always wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy, fight injustice, battle aliens, rescue the princess, and save the galaxy. These stories are universalized because they are universal. Their transmission of hope, courage, adventure, fraternity, and fun transcends any one culture or nation. They appeal to us all—not as Americans, Argentines, or Chinese—but simply as human beings.
Maybe the real takeaway from Barrio Chino is that America’s ideas are bigger than America itself. Maybe the vendors and fans of these commercialized icons aren’t victims of cultural imperialism, but active participants in the transcendent ideals that those icons represent. Maybe we should stop feeling ashamed of American culture’s tendency to universalize, and start feeling excited at its power to unify.
And besides, I doubt a day will come when U.S. culture reaches every corner of the world. Argentina may like America’s superheroes, sci-fi, and universal human stories, but Buenos Aires still doesn’t like America’s peanut butter. I had to go to Barrio Chino for that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Considine Family Foundation has endowed a Harvard Law School professorship in honor of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia, the school announced Friday.
Scalia, who died last February, graduated magna cum laude from the Law School in 1960 and served as an editor of the Law Review. As an associate justice of the Supreme Court, he was known for his strict interpretations of the Constitution. His family pledged to donate a collection of his papers in March, and those papers will become a part of the Law School library’s collection.
Former Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow said in a press release that a professorship in honor of Scalia is fitting because of his commitment to legal education.
“Justice Scalia had a singular impact on statutory analysis and legal thought. He also had a great love of learning, so it is especially meaningful that he will be honored with a professorship that will provide enduring support for teaching and scholarship at the Law School and beyond,” Minow said.
Terry M. Considine ’69, who started the Considine Family foundation with his wife Betsy C. Considine, wrote in an email that Minow felt strongly that Scalia’s Supreme Court service and legal scholarship merited recognition and asked their family’s foundation to contribute in his honor. He commended Scalia’s textualist approach to the Constitution and pragmatic relationship with fellow justices.
“A value embodied by Justice Scalia was to respect and even enjoy those with whom you disagree,” Considine said. “It is often said that his close friends on the Court included Justices Ginsburg and Kagan, notwithstanding frequent differences of opinion on issues before the Court.”
The individual to hold this position has yet to be selected, but will be chosen based on the recommendation of Dean of the Law School John F. Manning, who started in that role on July 1.
