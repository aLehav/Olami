After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Two photos in “Sabotage”—one with former President Bill Clinton and the other with Barack Obama—are the only suggestions that Arnold Schwarzenegger ever held political office after his acting career, but the film cleverly uses them to highlight the impressive DEA career of Schwarzenegger’s character, John “Breacher” Wharton. With “Sabotage,” Schwarzenegger demonstrates a post-Governator return to form as an action badass—rarely does he appear in a scene sans bulletproof vest and combat shotgun. Wharton serves as the leader of a special operations task force in charge of taking down a drug cartel safe house, and most of the film follows the operation’s aftermath as the team struggles to uncover the killer pursuing them—a whodunit along the lines of Agatha Christie’s novel “And Then There Were None.” Directed and co-written by David Ayer, the film stumbles throughout due to the predictable nature of its plot and lack of substantial character development. 
 
Almost like a horror film, “Sabotage” never attempts to develop the peripheral members of Wharton’s team, resigning itself to compensating with various gruesome murder scenes instead. In fact, each member of the team fits into the same misogynistic, raucous soldier archetype—even Lizzy Murray (Mireille Enos), the lone female squad member, who joins in the . However, Enos delivers a standout performance as the neurotic junkie soldier holding her own with the men, a far cry from her housewife role in 2013’s “World War Z.” Poor writing undercuts Olivia Williams’ effectiveness as Investigator Caroline Brentwood, the police officer in charge of investigating the murders of Wharton’s team. Her lack of chemistry with Schwarzenegger is immediately apparent, and the two deeply emotional scenes that they share—one melancholy, one romantic—come off as comically stilted and unconvincing. Brentwood’s fling with Wharton is shoehorned into the plot as an afterthought, as if the writers abruptly realized two acts into the film that their leading man lacked a love interest.
 
Despite Ayer’s most recent directorial and writing success with 2012’s “End of Watch,” which delivered a compelling, character-driven narrative, “Sabotage” seems motivated purely by plot, attempting to showcase Schwarzenegger shooting villains as much as possible. Although not particularly innovative, the action scenes convey a deliberate sense of urgency, from the breach and clear of the cartel house at the film’s opening to the innovative car chase near the film’s end. Additionally, gore and blood are expertly used for dramatic effect in various death scenes, which include a train decapitation as well as a disemboweling. The added element of surprise from random sniper headshots also helps to keep the audience on their feet.
 
“Sabotage” has moments of humor as well, although some are unintentional. One of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s best lines to date takes place during a heated exchange with a police officer, when he shouts, “Fuck you and your 48% body fat!” before storming out of the room. Jackson (Harold Perrineau), Investigator Brentwood’s partner, also serves as a moderately successful source of comic relief between tense action scenes with his playful banter. On the other hand, the film’s likely product placement deal with Pabst Blue Ribbon makes certain scenes unintentionally comical—whether at a strip club or a wake, the drink of choice for these toughened, goatee-sporting DEA soldiers also happens to be the preferred drink of scrawny hipsters everywhere.
 
The film’s third act diverges from its predictable narrative filled with action clichés through a subplot that attempts to lend additional emotional depth and shades of moral ambiguity to Schwarzenegger’s character. Unfortunately, Schwarzenegger fails to fully capture this added complexity, and a plot innovation this late in the film doesn’t salvage its earlier poor writing. Although Ayer puts forth an entertaining and pulse-racing action vehicle for Schwarzenegger’s revived action career, it ultimately fails to meet the high standards of originality and characterization set by his previous work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


Manuel I. “Fox” Morone ’14 is showing me to the music practice room in the Mather House basement where he practices his stand-up comedy. It’s through a maze of passages off from the dining hall, and while we walk, Morone—an inactive Crimson news editor—tells me about an awkward moment at Café Algiers. He was on a date, he’d sat behind a pillar in the room’s strange architecture, and while his date was away from the table, he’d run into a girl he’d earlier told he was interested. It’s a funny story, and I’m asking him what happened next when he and I reach the practice room. 
I wake up to an email from Fox the next morning. It’s a two-paragraph analysis of the Café Algiers anecdote as an example of the story-based humor that makes up his stand-up sets. “I kind of guided you through the space so you knew what I was seeing,” he writes. “If I don't do it so that you feel genuinely acquainted with my thought process, there won’t be laughs. ‘It’s funny because it's true,’ but mainly because I've made it true after bringing you into my world.”
“I'm gonna be honest, though,” he adds. “I feel like sort of a dick deconstructing all this, like ‘This is my art.’”
Morone uses the term with irony, but his and other Harvard comedians’ discussions of stand-up reveal the complexity of the craft. Their comedy involves a writing process where character and psychological direction are key, but it’s fine-tuned only through performance. It is as Morone describes it—“‘art’ or whatever.”
THIRD THOUGHT
In the hallway of Morone’s Mather suite, there’s a black-and-white photo of him smiling sweetly at the camera. On it, one of his four roommates has written in colored Sharpie the Nietzsche quote “Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes” and attributed it to Peter Gabriel.
I sit with Morone and Anthony H. Zonfrelli ’14—on whose door the resident tutor-designed nameplate has also been changed to read the former Genesis singer’s name—in Zonfrelli’s room. They’ve been roommates since freshman year, when they both became interested in stand-up. Morone’s performed for his entire undergraduate career, while Zonfrelli started only during his senior fall. “Everything I wrote on my own I felt sucked,” Zonfrelli says. “It wasn’t until I started finding a style that worked for me that I started feeling more comfortable.”
They’ve both worked to develop their styles—the types of jokes they tell, such as one-liners or longer stories, and the tone or character of their delivery. Their styles are very different, they tell me. “I’m like, the really cool kind,” Fox says.
“I’m like, the really good-looking kind,” Zonfrelli replies.
The long stories Morone writes involve finding the irony or illogic in everyday situations. “If I see [a situation] like that, I’ll be like, ‘this is definitely funny, but why is it that?’” he says. “The number one thing, it’s to be able to see something in a situation and then be able to make your thought totally clear to the audience.” This effect, he explains, is produced through a kind of psychological duplication—he uses pacing, side stories, and demeanor to teach the audience his thought processes, so that they anticipate and understand his commentary. “That’s the hard part with these stories. It’s not just about the jokes,” he says. “It’s about, ‘I need to think the way you’re thinking,’ and that’s hard.”
Zonfrelli’s sets comprise standalone one-liners, verbal jokes with literalisms and double meanings or situational setups with surprise endings. (“Paraprosdokian. My jokes are paraprosdokians. That’s the word,” he texts me later, with a Wikipedia link to the rhetorical term derived from the Greek “against expectation.”) His inspiration is Anthony Jeselnik, who in an interview articulated the idea of “third thought”—that in one-liners, the setup should end with neither the logical conclusion nor the clearest twist, but the next, completely unexpected one.
His stand-up character, like Jeselnik’s, is dark—even disturbed—so the effect is “creating a distance” from the audience, Zonfrelli says. “After the end of each joke, I have to somehow pull them back and be like, ‘No, trust me!’ and then shatter it.”
The pursuit of a definitive style is restrictive to some comics. Andy Kindler, a professional comedian who performs regularly on “The Late Show with David Letterman,” thinks of comedy as deciding what parts of one’s personality to present to the audience. In 28 years of performing solo, he’s shifted his subject matter in tandem with changes in his life. He’s currently lauded for his critiques of other comics and the entertainment industry, which he began when he turned to comedy full-time and “that became [his] reality.” He also adjusts his approach according to how audiences react to various aspects of his personality. “I never really picked a style. I just tried to be funny,” he says.
The delivery of a comic’s set is meant to create a certain illusion—that this is the first time the comic is telling these jokes, though he or she has reused and rehearsed them dozens of times. “It is very much a performance art that people don’t really think about,” Morone says. “It’s really like a mental manipulation. The whole thing is founded on lying to your audience, making your audience think that you’re doing these things for real.”
This is where watching comedy comes in, Zonfrelli and Morone say: it helps them internalize the stage presence and intonation of established comics. Further, it is useful in developing a style to study comics who work similarly; Zonfrelli listens to Jeselnik on Spotify before performing. “I’ll listen to his timing, I’ll listen to his pacing, I’ll listen to just the inflection he has as he delivers punches. Then it just gets me thinking about [performance] in terms of a comic instead of a guy who’s going to go up and talk to people,” he says.
Zonfrelli and Morone agree that inspiration for a joke can come at any time, anywhere. “I like to think that people who like comedy notice the funny parts of life as they go around, and the comics are the ones that write it down,” Zonfrelli says. He and Morone—like several other campus comics I speak with—have a running list of joke ideas compiled in the “notes” function of their smartphones. They conversely find it difficult to sit and come up with jokes on command. “I have several Word documents of the least funny shit,” Zonfrelli confesses.
Kindler says the same is still true for him. “For me and for most people I know, it’s impossible to sit in a room and produce humor,” he says.
“I guarantee—I feel like the guy on TV saying ‘No money down!’” he continues. “I guarantee that any comic will be 50 percent better almost immediately if they do one thing that I do that most comedians don’t do, which is: every time something funny happens in your mind, and you think it’s funny in that moment, write it down.”
LAUGHTER AND ERROR
The Adams Upper Common Room is full. It’s March 25, and the audience has assembled this evening for the first stand-up comedy night organized by Harvard Speaks, an organization that promotes public speaking by undergraduates. The first comedian, Dan J. Fitzpatrick ’15, checks the microphone stand—the mic is missing.
He launches into his set without it. “I think we should basically treat the zipper like a form of male cleavage. You just adjust the gap to the appropriateness of the situation,” he proposes. “‘I really want to show Kate that I care.’ How do you get out of that friendzone? You unzip your chinos all the way down.”
He and Carina M. Livoti ’14, who also performed at Harvard Speaks, sit with me after the show. The writing process, they tell me, is only where their material starts—it’s impossible to improve it without performing for audiences. Their jokes exist in a state of endless evolution, changing with the crowd’s reception. “We’ve both been doing the same jokes for several years, but they’re far from what they started out as,” Fitzpatrick says. “You’re always cutting bad punchlines or adding new things.”
Improvisation on stage can lead to entirely new jokes. Kevin E. O’Donnell ’16 is unable to practice stand-up off stage, he says—but in a kind of reverse stage fright, he is uninhibited on stage, and his set works. In a recent performance, he improvised a transitional line that he says got him one of his set’s biggest laughs. 
“I said, ‘Well, now’s the time in my stand-up set that I do interpretative dance. It’s an avant-garde interpretative dance that consists of me reading other jokes,’” he says. “I got comments on that line.”
“I was like, ‘Maybe that means my jokes are shitty,’” he adds.
Performing frequently is not the only factor important to improving as a comic—seasoned professional Kindler emphasizes performing for different audiences as well as performing often (nightly, he recommends). “When comics start and they stay in a small town for too long or only have stage time in a city that has one club, it’s hard to develop,” he says.
The Boston area provides that diversity—student comics have performed in local clubs including The Comedy Studio and ImprovBoston, community events like Harvard’s annual Arts First festival, and student-organized shows. Within the college, though, the lower pressure and array of comedy organizations is creatively liberating. “That’s the beauty of college,” Livoti tells me. “[There are] stand-up organizations where we can organize our own shows and people will actually show up, so you can try out lots of different things. I did something in a ghost costume once.”
  
WHO SUCKS
Two hours after the Harvard Speaks event, the Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society meets in Quincy’s Spindell Room. The club’s abbreviation is intentional—“HCSUCS” as in “HC Sucks”—and there are members who support a change to the Harvard University Stand-Up Comic Society. (“Put this in the article: I want them to call it HUSUCS,” O’Donnell tells me. “‘HUSUCS? We suck.’ We could have a motto.”)
The meetings give members the chance to present three minutes of comedy and receive critiques from the group. This evening, Devon M. Guinn ’17 gets up to tell an anecdote about overhearing someone in line outside a party that she “would rather take a butt swab” than continue waiting. “I’m not weird about it, but I have a pretty healthy fear of things getting stuck in my butt,” Guinn says.
“I liked it, but you say stuff a little too quick. You could benefit from pausing at points,” Morone tells him when he finishes.
“Last time you told me not to be so scripted, so I tried to be less scripted,” Guinn says.
“Yeah, well, you still sucked,” Morone deadpans.
There’s laughter, and the other members give Guinn advice about which lines to turn into punches, or elaborated upon and made into new jokes. They applaud when he sits.
This is what HCSUCS provides for campus comics––the opportunity to test their material in between writing it in their iPhones’ Notes and performing it for an audience. “When you’re onstage, a joke either succeeds or it fails,” HCSUCS member Julia N. Becerra ’16 says. “In the meeting, it’s whether people laugh or not, and then they’ll give you feedback.”
The group’s membership has grown in recent years, from six comics in 2010 to about 25 presently, HCSUCS co-president Fitzpatrick estimates. Becerra joined this year. She appreciates the generosity of the other members’ critiques—as well as analyzing her comedy, they contribute new jokes to her set. “Everyone works together to make [each] person’s set better. That’s the idea,” Becerra says. “There’s no coveting of, ‘Oh, I made that joke, you can’t have it!’” 
The Harvard comedy community is more than a helpful feedback mechanism for Becerra—it’s why she decided to pursue stand-up. In high school, she had no exposure to comedy as an artistic discipline or the focus of an organization, she says. Working with comedy aficionados in college introduced her to the craft and to a community that would help her improve. “It’s really not what I expected because everyone’s so knowledgeable about something that you’re never taught in an official way,” Becerra says. “I realized that you could really look at it as an art and work on your craft. It’s very cool.”

“I would like to share the story of two best friends studying architecture at Tehran University in the 1980s. They enjoyed their life, they were active as Social Democrats in the [Iranian] revolution…. In the first month of the revolution, the Iran-Iraq War started, and both were sent to the front to fight for their country. Within six months, both of the friends were injured in battle; and each of the men lost a limb. When I was 18, I married one of them.” Minoo Emami, an Iranian visiting artist, narrated this story at the beginning of a discussion of her work Thursday at Arts @ 29 Garden, explaining how her personal experience of the Iran-Iraq War has inspired her art. War was a universal experience for Iranians who lived through it, Emami said: “Friends, neighbors, relatives; everyone I knew had somehow been impacted. I never expected that my husband [would be] a casualty of war. Many people in my country experienced this violence and it continues to be part of our lives.”
Emami’s paintings, part of a series called “The Monuments,” are arresting, each depicting a prosthetic limb in stark relief against a pitch-black background. Explaining her choice to focus on the artificial leg, Emami said, “For the last 15 years, I have been working on a series of paintings focusing on the physical, emotional, and mental damage [war] causes. The damage is symbolized by an artificial leg.” Each painting is differentiated by some element of what the amputee has lost to the war beyond the amputated leg. A haunting woman’s face within the leg represents a woman who has lost her beauty and will now never be married. A swirling hemorrhage from the prosthesis in another painting is indicative of a woman’s miscarriage due to a landmine. Another leg, with a slender, disembodied wrist wrapped around it, conveys that the soldier whose limb was lost will now never experience his lover’s touch. Landmines saw extensive use in the Iran-Iraq War, to the extent that Iran’s government had to build a central prosthesis factory in Tehran. In her talk, Emami emphasized how strongly artificial limbs remind her of the war’s impact on her country: “It isn’t just about my husband. It can be anyone.”
Yet, when she first conceived of the series, it was intensely personal for Emami. “I thought I might never show these paintings to anyone in my life. They were so private to me,” Emami recalled. “It took almost three months for me to get ready to even look at [a prosthetic leg]. Because I have it in my home, in my bedroom, I have it everywhere, but I never looked at it, never. I didn’t have courage to look at it…. as a painter, when I draw something, I paint something, then I can say I have seen [that].” Indeed, in each piece hanging at 29 Garden, there is something more to be seen than simply an artificial limb—there is a narrative. 
Emami also presented a series of photographed artworks that could not travel with her from Iran by projecting them onto a wall. “These are from corners in my home,” Emami explained as an image of the prosthesis resting on an armchair flickered on. With the next one, she grew quieter. “This is my wedding dress,” said Emami of the next image, which depicted a white gown entwined sensuously with the prosthetic limb. As she went through the final few pictures, Emami recalled the initially negative public reaction to her pieces and her ultimate response. “People were always asking me, ‘Why do you paint these things? This time [of war] is over!’ Yet after time passed and I made connections with people who urged me to show my paintings, I began to show them to others,” Emami said. “The prostheses that I paint are meant as symbols of the absolute horror of war. I never painted a full body. I realized it actually recently; when I look back on my work, it was so strange; I never painted a full person.” 
She instead dedicated herself to the work of artistically immortalizing the cost of war, and has two new projects on the horizon. The first is to create art objects out of donated, second-hand prostheses of all types—from children, women, and soldiers. Additionally, Emami intends to travel to regions of Iran and Iraq, teaching art at regional universities and offering her artistry to children and women with artificial limbs in rural places. She invited the audience members to write a note to victims of war inside a tracing of their hands to bring to these people as part of her project “A Letter in My Hand.” Regarding her dream to bring dignity and compassion to amputees in rural areas, Emami said, “For women, I will decorate their artificial legs with their very favorite jewelries and flowers. I want to honor each woman and give her a feeling of pride. If I can paint something beautiful, shiny, colorful, it will be as though I am a dear friend bringing the women jewelry. Truly, I want them to feel good about themselves, not damaged.” Minoo Emami, who has dedicated herself to bearing artistic witness to the suffering of people in wartime, brought to Harvard her courageous desire to bring healing in whatever way she can.

It’s difficult to compare The Black Keys’s new single, “Fever,” to any of their previous discography, as the track’s infectious dance beat and synths mark a deliberate departure from the distinctive blues rock and garage vibe that characterized their first seven studio albums. With “Fever,” Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney move beyond the guitar-laden days of “Thickfreakness” (2003) and “Magic Potion” (2006), experimenting with an indie-dance rock sound suggestive of Passion Pit while retaining Auerbach’s classic soulful vocals. Part of this shift can be attributed to Danger Mouse, who co-produced the band’s 2011 release “El Camino” and returns as a producer on their upcoming album, “Turn Blue.” The pulsing bass beat and funky synth melody that dominate “Fever” are stylistically reminiscent of Electric Guest, an indie rock band for whom Danger Mouse also produced.
 
On “Fever,” The Black Keys present a more modernized sound but have regressed lyrically and emotionally. When Auerbach croons in the stale chorus, “Fever ’cause I’m breakin’ / Fever got me achin’,” his typically emotive delivery is significantly undercut by the dance beat. Given the emotional and lyrical depth of similarly upbeat previous tracks such as “Dead and Gone” and “Nova Baby,” this new single comes off as a rather unmemorable experiment with indietronica. On the other hand, lines such as “You know not to leave her” suggest something deeper at play behind the scenes—Auerbach recently finalized divorce proceedings in fall 2013 after a messy estrangement from his then-wife Stephanie Gonis.
 
“Fever” is the band’s first new release since it won three Grammy Awards for “El Camino,” and its drastic shift in sound fails to capture the same emotional and musical complexity of their previous works. Until the release of “Turn Blue,” it’s up in the air whether The Black Keys will be able to replicate their previous success or leave fans yearning for the days of “The Big Come Up.”
 
“Turn Blue” is out on May 12 via Nonesuch in the United States.

Is Mac DeMarco stripping himself bare, or are we just getting better at deciphering his lyrics? The eccentric indie rocker who has always reveled in subtlety opens his latest, “Salad Days,” with the surprisingly direct observation, “As I’m getting older, chip upon my shoulder, / Rolling through life to roll over and die.” It’s a theme that is carried throughout the album’s 35 ephemeral minutes, and DeMarco sounds as vulnerable and resigned as ever through his psychedelic gauze.
 
Harmonically, “Salad Days” sits comfortably within the straightforward guidelines of indie rock, only occasionally tapping into the amorphous freedom of what DeMarco has himself dubbed “jizz jazz.” The time-stopping “Chamber of Reflection” pits a groovy baseline against slithering vocals, introducing the minor key to the album for the first and last time. In a way, the simple and musing DeMarco that appears on “Salad Days” is a far cry from the cigarette-smoking drag queen that starred in the video for 2012’s “My Kind of Woman,” but it is only the instrumentals that point the two down separate paths—thematically, DeMarco retains many of the same ideas that he explored on his previous studio album, “2.”
 
Most of the tracks on “Salad Days” explore the perennial feelings of longing and restlessness, but DeMarco puts so much distance between the heavy-hearted lyrics and the carefree instrumentation that the resulting juxtaposition comes off as quaint at worst. On their own, neither side feels particularly unique—the laid-back groove that opens “Goodbye Weekend” could easily be the stage for a sickly sweet delivery from Zooey Deschanel, its thematic material a carbon copy of Smash Mouth’s “Stoned.” But DeMarco effortlessly turns the pedestrian chorus (“If you don’t agree with the things that go on within my life, / Well, honey, that’s fine, just know that you’re wasting your time”) into a soaring surf guitar solo, and the track instantly becomes triumphant rather than trite, meticulous rather than mindless.
 
In the context of the rest of the album, however, the surefooted “Goodbye Weekend” is tinged with uncertainty. “Salad Days” features a confused DeMarco who splits his time between offering conciliatory advice to nameless acquaintances and delving into his own tangled mess of emotions. The former version of DeMarco stars in “Brother,” murmuring, “Take it slowly, brother, / Let it go, now, brother.” Three tracks later, on “Let My Baby Stay,” he plays the opposite role as he laments, “As far as I can tell, she’s happy… / So please don’t take my love away.” In stark contrast to this year’s other indie rock superstars (such as Sun Kil Moon, who sounded short on time throughout the entirety of “Benji”), DeMarco uses the gas pedal sparingly on “Salad Days,” allowing the tracks to breathe and transition subtly as he assumes different characters.
 
Breaking away from the mundane is the album’s major antagonist, and DeMarco’s heroic efforts make him an excellent protagonist. The largely uneventful “Brother” is transformed in its final minute into an effects-laden symphony that evokes Tame Impala more than it does any of DeMarco’s previous work. The acoustically driven “Let My Baby Stay” goes from tepid to intriguing when DeMarco abandons his simplistic laments for wordless wailing—the primal vocalizations don’t present the most welcome digression, but they at least save the track from complete anonymity.
 
Sometimes, entire tracks serve as divergences from the album’s sound palette, which revolves heavily around metronomic drum beats and DeMarco’s fabled $30 guitar. The simple and repetitive progression of the album’s first single, “Passing Out Pieces,” is remedied in part by a similarly repetitive but entrancing wash of what may be best described as electric harpsichord. But ultimately, these moments of brilliance are too few and far between to save “Salad Days” from sounding static.
 
In a way, DeMarco has found his comfort zone. The 11 tracks on “Salad Days” serve as mile markers on a circular track, marking musical growth and exploration but ultimately lacking the dynamicism to capture the listener’s attention for any significant period of time. “Salad Days” concludes with the looping instrumental “Jonny’s Odyssey,” whose fuzzy baselines and twangy, untuned guitars combine to produce what is possibly the most charming track on the album. The last thing we hear on the album is DeMarco saying, “Hi guys, this is Mac. Thank you for joining me, see you again soon. Buh-bye.” In the end, it feels a little silly to call “Salad Days” a tedious album, given the casual nature of everything that seems to emerge from DeMarco’s head. To the 23-year-old songwriter, “Salad Days” is the mile marker, and the trip has only just begun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
This past fall, we the Harvard student body received a community advisory alert from the Harvard University Police Department about a sexual assault near campus. The alert contained a list of safety tips, including “wear sneakers or shoes that allow for added mobility” and “walk with confidence.” In this email, Harvard demonstrated the following strategy for preventing sexual assault: Encourage potential victims to run faster. But when attacked by a fellow student in a dorm room, House, or final club, where are students supposed to run?
 
Community advisories like the one Harvard sent out this fall are worse than impractical. They are part of a larger trend of Harvard’s victim-blaming attitudes that hinder survivors’ pursuit of justice by instructing them “not to get raped.” Imagine that you have survived a rape. If you were to have your lived experience and trauma invalidated by a doctor, or an administrator tell you that your rape wasn’t violent enough for the Administrative Board to consider your case or that men in your culture are naturally gropey, how could you believe that your university is there to protect you? And after having received such messages, how could you ever turn to your university for help again?
 
By now, this story is a familiar one. Starting at Yale in 2010, students at many of Harvard’s peer institutions—Swarthmore, Amherst, Emerson, University of North Carolina, and Dartmouth, to name a few—have come forward to expose their experiences of sexual assault and university indifference. Survivors and activists are using Title IX, a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination at universities, to advocate for better responses to campus sexual violence. Title IX recognizes that sexual assault violates a survivor’s right to a safe education and obligates universities to restore survivors’ safety and security, providing guidelines for sexual assault policies to aid universities in achieving that goal. Student activism around Title IX has been gaining traction at the national level: In January, President Obama issued a renewed call to action to end campus sexual violence. He also created the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.
 
Unfortunately, Harvard has joined many other colleges in becoming increasingly legalistic in its response to student advocacy and outcry in an attempt to save face rather than prioritize survivors’ needs. Yes, Harvard has appointed two new Title IX coordinators and announced a working-group to review Harvard's policies and develop recommendations. But the University has all but shut out student and survivor participation and input when it comes to reviewing policy that is nominally being designed for our protection.
 
Because students and survivors are the ones who feel the impact of the systemic failures of the Harvard’s policy and programming around sexual violence, they have a crucial contribution to make in identifying the most important changes. Harvard should institute new policies that consistently support survivors and adhere to Title IX guidelines.
 
First, Harvard ought to standardize the informal process through which survivors can seek academic, residential, and extracurricular accommodations such as coursework extensions, housing changes, and no-contact orders. All administrators and students should be thoroughly trained about this process so that survivors enter conversations with administrators aware of what accommodations should be available to them. This will allow survivors to advocate for themselves in Harvard’s system. When the implementation of accommodations to protect the survivor requires disrupting existing residential, academic, or extracurricular situations, Harvard should place the brunt of the disruption on perpetrators, not survivors, as the Department of Education instructs. Now, with a policy that effectively means that, as a Crimson article from March 7, 2013, puts it, “victims of sexual assault must adjust their own schedules or change their housing if the perpetrator is allowed to remain on campus,” Harvard places an additional psychological and emotional burden on survivors, as the anonymous survivor’s story published yesterday in The Crimson evidences.
 
Second, the Ad Board must adhere to Title IX standards in order to provide an expedient decision-making process for survivors. Title IX’s 60-day timeline ensures that universities address student claims in a timely manner, instead of standing by until survivors or assailants graduate or until survivors give up after months of waiting.
 
Finally, university employees, including faculty, residential staff, and administrators, must undergo thorough training about Title IX. In many cases, survivors’ understanding of their rights under Title IX varies depending on the person to whom they happened to contact at the time of seeking support. If university employees are not trained thoroughly, they may provide inaccurate or inconsistent information to survivors about their rights and possible remedies. This training must extend beyond simple legal education. Currently, survivors of color and LGBTQ survivors are often further alienated by victim-blaming, racist, or homophobic remarks. Training for all administration and faculty to respect survivors’ diverse needs and experiences is essential.
 
Although rare, it is possible to spend four years on this campus without personal experience of the issue of sexual assault as a survivor, ally, or friend. This April, Sexual Assault Awareness Month will sharpen our attention on the issue as a student body. But each and every day of the year, not one of us can remain indifferent when the institution to which we belong–the school that we have so many other reasons to love—marginalizes the students most in need of its support. We can achieve a safer and more just Harvard. To realize this vision, Harvard must create an open, inclusive forum for change that stretches far beyond the month of April, one that welcomes the voices of those most affected by the policies and practices under review. Harvard must make supporting survivors mean more than a laundry list of legal compliance requirements to check off. And most of all, Harvard must treat its survivors not as liabilities, but as students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
My first Relay for Life was in high school. I participated because of an all too common motivation amongst relayers—I’d lost friends and family to cancer. Strikingly, however, most of the people I lost to cancer were young.
Death is always a tragedy, but there is a special horror reserved for watching a bright young person, who should have all the reason to believe in his future, succumb to insidious cells proliferating in his body. Young adult cancer was both the reason I chose to walk at my first relay and the reason I deepened my involvement by helping to organize the relay at my undergraduate institution. 
And so there was strange irony in the night I found myself in an emergency room this past fall. I had had unexplained high and persistent fevers, and my doctor recommended I go to the hospital. An initial scan of my abdomen revealed a nearly five-centimeter mass on my left kidney.
Subsequent biopsies and scans confirmed that the mass was renal cell carcinoma. I learned in the days that followed that RCC is particularly resilient in that typically does not respond to chemotherapy or radiation. My primary treatment option was surgery. The implication was that if the disease metastasized beyond my kidney, my chance of a cure would plummet. It was with this disturbing knowledge in mind that I had a radical nephrectomy, removing my entire left kidney along with 32 lymph nodes.
One of the cruelties of young adult cancer is that it is perfectly choreographed to knock the victim down during what should be the prime of his or her life. I was due to start my third year of graduate school the week of my diagnosis, a year that would have seen the start of my career as a teaching fellow, and would have allowed me to continue to pursue a burgeoning line of research. With my diagnosis I was initiated into the strange club of young adult cancer patients and survivors, whose sobering stories had motivated me to relay for so many years. 
I now spoke their language. We understood the myriad everyday horrors that accompany the gauntlet that is the cancer experience. More so than the diagnosis itself, for example, I remember lying in my hospital bed, dreading having to deliver to my mom and dad what is among the most devastating news a parent could receive.
There was also the everyday horror of waiting. Cancer patients understand that so much of the disease involves idleness—waiting for the next appointment or scan or treatment or test. This is followed by the horror of waiting for the results of these tests, which often indicate whether those insidious cells will come to tyrannize your body. I witnessed the horror of watching my parents lose their parental innocence—their belief that, with enough love, they could always guarantee their child’s well being.
I was lucky. The pathology report following my operation indicated that the cancer was contained in my kidney. I recovered from my operation remarkably well. Thinking about my experience retrospectively, it is clear there were silver linings. T.S. Elliot has a line: “We had the experience but missed the meaning.” 
One of the great silver linings of cancer is that it has reminded me to never “miss the meaning”—to relish in the ordinary. During my treatment, I witnessed the very best of the human spirit in the kindness of my doctors and nurses, my family, friends and colleagues, and administrators at the university. My family has always been close, but we now share a palpable sense that we are “each other’s keepers.” Cancer has affirmed for me that loving people well is the best legacy I can leave. But these silver linings should never legitimize the suffering and the everyday horrors of the disease. 
My own experiences will motivate me as I relay this year—my first year as a cancer survivor. Please join me and other cancer patients, survivors, caregivers, and allies as we fight back against a disease that has already taken too much.

Sarah C. Cotterill is a third year graduate student in the Department of Psychology and a member of Harvard Relay for Life.  This year's Relay for Life will be held on April 5 at the Gordon Track. For more details, please visit http://www.relayforlife.org/harvarduniversity.

While 3.1 percent of the regular decision application pool received an offer of admission from Harvard College last Friday, half of all the admissions offers the College made this year were made three months ago through the early action program. In fact, year’s early action acceptance rate of 21 percent was a record high since the early option was reinstated in 2011. Because an upward trend in early action acceptances entails a downward trend in regular decision acceptances, it is important to acknowledge that early action is playing an increasingly important role in determining the incoming class.
 Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 has observed that “the demographic information received so far from the early admits to the Class of 2018 indicated less of a disparity than has existed in years prior.” But early action still remains skewed toward a higher income bracket. This skew in the early acceptances necessitates Harvard put an even greater emphasis on outreach efforts to attract people from all different socioeconomic backgrounds to the early action pool.  
When Harvard did away with early action in 2007, we supported the rationale: Early action advantages well-prepared students who tend to be of a higher socioeconomic background and possess more resources. After four years, however, Harvard, along with Princeton and the University of Virginia, decided to restore the early action program. Early action’s reinstatement had much to do with the fact that, according to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, “many talented students, including some of the best-prepared low-income and underrepresented minority students, were choosing programs with an early-action option, and therefore were missing out on the opportunity to consider Harvard.” While it is evident that some students of lower socioeconomic backgrounds do apply to Harvard through the early action program, there are plenty of others who will not. 
In order to further recruit students of diverse backgrounds, last October, Harvard launched the Harvard Connection, a digitally driven initiative. And while Fitzsimmons maintains that “it appears we were successful at least in the first phase in getting the message out to students from poorer economic backgrounds, and from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, and, for that matter, international students,” Harvard should continue to strive to improve outreach strategies and scope of students reached in order to prevent early action from disproportionately advantaging those with more resources.

One of the lesbians had smashed head first into the wall so hard she left a face-sized indent in the plaster. I still remember it: the crumpled outline of her cheek in the off-white drywall, her heavy, wrinkled body on the bed before it.
I don’t think I’d ever seen a lesbian couple before, at least not one that I recognized as such. My mother, a small town doctor, had taken me with her to see the old ladies on a home visit (presumably my youth had healing properties) and had whispered to me in her diversity-education voice, much to my prurient fascination, that these particular patients were “lesbians.” I didn’t know it then, but it was an experience that stayed with me. By the time I was starting to comb through movies and novels and music CDs looking for some—any—roadmap for the rainbow kind of life I was going to lead, I would mentally revisit the encounter, trying to see if there was any hidden significance in its quiet sadness, trying to see if I could relate.
French director Abdellatif Kechiche’s ponderous, intensely sensual, and supposedly scandalous film “Blue is the Warmest Color,” while imbued with its own quiet sadness, initially seems ages away from this mothball-lined interior. The film itself is as brimming with youth as an overfull water balloon. Its star couple, college-senior Emma and high school junior Adèle (played by Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos), flirt, slurp oysters, and have endless (okay, seven) minutes of Certifiably Hot Sex in a Beautiful and Doomed Relationship that plays out amid cherry trees so abundantly in flower it seems the boughs will break. It was pretty real.
  But that doesn’t mean I was happy about it. I put off watching the film for weeks, months even, terrified that I would like it, and equally terrified that I wouldn’t. Already I was wary of a film whose celebrated emotional intensity was the product of what sounds like psychological abuse. Mostly, I was scared that the Cannes-winning movie about lesbians would prove just as one-dimensional and delegitimizing as many other films.
  This is the problem of wanting—and failing—to see yourself at the movies, a tension that goes for all sorts of people who find the groups they are part of too often reduced to stereotypes on-screen. It’s a phenomenon that weighs down the way you relate to works, so much that they cease to be individual pieces of art but card tables sagging under the weight of your collective desire to be recognized. On one hand, there’s an aching desire for representation, a kind of itch to consume media that pays homage to your existence. On the other hand, there’s the feeling that, inevitably, and however well-intentioned, the films are going to mess up: in big ways, like outright stereotypes and mockery; in enormous ways, such as abusing actresses; and in little ways, too—the limits of the types and lengths of stories that people even care to tell.
This anxiety, while not universal, can be fierce. There are so few representations of lesbians in the mainstream media that when they do come around, any little jibe can hurt. Erotica author Ella Boureau, in an interview on the Huffington Post, summarizes the drama surrounding the release of the film like this: “We [lesbians] actually have very few chances to have some sort of mainstream entry point, and so that’s why we care so much.” At the same time, this anxiety over representation can result in wars over legitimacy—over who gets to say whether a film is or is not authentic, is or is not “truly” lesbian. And ironically, the urge to find a “lesbian” voice in the debate can lead to the marginalization of those who don’t fit normative images, leaving them outside whatever ends up being the community standard of legitimacy.
That’s not to say “Blue” should escape critiques about representation. I find the fixation on young, normatively pretty female bodies—the tight camera angles and fixation on the protagonist’s rear—mildly unsettling; I find the allegations of director mistreatment of the actresses—all for the sake of evoking “genuine passion”—deeply unsettling. And while it’s reductive to dismiss the film because it comes from a man, that’s not because gender doesn’t matter, or because the film is above such critique. “Do I need to be a woman, and a lesbian, to talk about love between women?” Kechiche asks.  “We’re talking about love here – it's absolute, it's cosmic.”  
This, perhaps, is the film’s—and its critic’s—biggest flaw: the equation of “cosmic” with “neutral.” Inevitably, works like Kechiche’s will pack a different punch for different audiences—and for those who feel that their identities are at stake, this punch can be painful. It’ll take a lot more home visits and a lot more gay movies before films like “Blue is the Warmest Color” become truly cosmic—by becoming truly unexceptional.

Embattled Surgeon General nominee Vivek H. Murthy ’98, a physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, will address graduates of the Medical School and School of Dental Medicine at Class Day on May 29.
Murthy’s selection as Class Day speaker was reported by Harvard Magazine on March 28. According to the Medical School Dean of Students, the graduating class of both schools select the speaker by class-wide nominations followed by an online, class-wide vote. Students send the invitation.
Murthy has had a much more difficult time in the U.S. Senate, where his nomination as Surgeon General has been stalled by Congressional conservatives. The National Rifle Association, many Republicans, and as many as ten conservative Democrats oppose Murthy’s nomination because he has advocated that gun policy be treated as a health issue. Others have called the move a political stunt.
In the face of Congressional opposition, the White House said in late March that it was “recalibrating” its approach to the appointment process.
Murthy is the co-founder of Doctors for America, a 16,000-member organization of physicians and medical school students that aims to expand access to affordable health care. The group was originally called Doctors for Obama.
Murthy also founded the non-profit Visions Worldwide, Inc., which focuses on AIDS education, and TrialNetworks, a system to improve clinical trial efficiency to bring new drugs to market in a faster and safer manner.
Despite the political controversy surrounding Murthy’s appointment, students and faculty members at the Medical School said that they are excited the nominee will be speaking at the annual Class Day festivities.
 “Vivek Murthy combines compassion and intelligence, plus consistent hard work, to help...families through health crises via increasing their access to care,” Adam R. Frange, a teaching assistant in chemistry, wrote in an e-mail.
Medical School professor Gerald B. Pier said he first met Murthy during a Harvard Summer School program while Murthy was still in high school. The two kept in contact and conducted research together while Murthy attended the College and the Medical School.
Pier said that he believes Murthy “can bring some perspective to the graduating Medical School class about what can they expect to await them once they begin their training.”
Pier said that Murthy’s support from the Medical School and nomination as Class Day speaker show “that the community is behind him during this difficult political situation.”
Omar Abudayyeh, a second-year student at the Medical School, also expressed support for Murthy.
“I think he is a fantastic choice for Surgeon General. He cares about serious public health crises that are affecting the nation including, obesity, tobacco, mental health, and prevention, and is bold enough to recognize that gun violence is part of the greater issue of mental health,” Abudayyeh wrote in an e-mail.

Charles T. Munger, vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Corporation, joined Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in a conversation about law, poker, and his business partner Warren E. Buffett Monday in Wasserstein Hall.
 
Munger, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1948, discussed how he has always been drawn to the practice of law, though he is recognized for his career in finance.
 
He spoke of his friendship with late Law School Dean N. Roscoe Pound. He said that, after initially being rejected from the Law School, Pound, a family friend, admitted Munger after a brief phone conversation.
 
“I collect peculiar people like [Roscoe Pound],” he said.
 
While discussing his debut in the corporate world, Munger said playing poker while serving in the army helped him develop business strategies.
 
“The chief thing I learned from poker was that when you really have an edge you have to push hard because you don’t get edges that often,” he said.
 
Additionally, Munger encouraged the budding lawyers and entrepreneurs in the audience to reach out to individuals for whom they want to work.
 
“Find a place where you find a seamless web of deserved trust,” he said. “Figure out who you admire and why and go and tell them.”
 
The conversation later moved on to a discussion of business ethics.
 
“You have a duty to your moral self to get financially prosperous and to spend cautiously,” Munger said. “That is not something you do just because you want to get rich. You do it because you want to protect your moral self.”
 
Munger spoke about issues with the work ethic and conduct of corporate America, specifically addressing the greed of some company executives.
 
“What I don’t like is a man that owns a billion dollars worth in stocks in a company where he is in total control and has his colleagues award or awards himself another $40 million a year.”
 
Munger compared the duty of a business executive to “act as an exemplar” with that of a U.S. military officer to “act as an officer and a gentleman.” He said he sees his friend and business partner Buffett as a reflection of these values.
 
Munger commended Buffett’s good sense and morals. “He is a moral man and he never does anything the least bit stupid,” he said. 
 
In his final remarks to the crowd, Munger advised, “You have to be able to recognize your own errors and change your mind.”

Just days after student leaders from the black and Latino communities came together to host a town hall to discuss race relations at Harvard, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister and his incoming successor Rakesh Khurana announced the creation of a working group to consider student support and inclusion.
The working group will be composed of students, faculty, and staff members and will “examine how we can better support the needs of all our students, especially those who don't feel a full sense of inclusion at Harvard,” according to an email from the two administrators sent to undergraduates Monday. They added that a town hall in the fall semester could be a platform to address the issue.
The email—sent with the subject line “Community”—arrived in students’ inboxes following weeks of high-profile discussion about race relations at Harvard. The social media campaign and theater production “I, Too, Am Harvard” in February and March highlighted the experiences of black students at Harvard and made national headlines.
In early March, Latino students also held a town hall meeting and expressed frustration at their perceived lack of institutional support at the College. Student leaders from the black and Latino communities have since come together to further the conversation about institutional support for minority students at Harvard, co-hosting a town hall on March 27.
In recent weeks, students from across the College have called for administrators to respond to the conversation. “I, Too, Am Harvard” student leaders met with Pfister and Khurana on Friday, and according to a joint statement from the campaign and production team released Monday, the students, among other demands, asked Pfister and Khurana to circulate a letter “affirming the presence and value of students of color on Harvard’s campus” by Monday, the day the two administrators sent their email.
In the email, Pfister and Khurana—who is also a co-House master in Cabot House—referenced the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign and the Latino students’ town hall and wrote to students that “every one of you has a well-earned place at Harvard.” They added that the recent conversation has “highlighted similar experiences shared amongst you—feelings of not belonging and feelings of having to justify your place at Harvard.”
Pfister and Khurana further wrote in the email that change at Harvard requires the cooperation of both students and the College administration. Pfister and Khurana wrote that as administrators they can “issue statements and set policies,” but that student leadership is also necessary to “truly effect change.”
Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16, writer and director of “I, Too, Am Harvard,” said in an interview Monday evening that the campaign and production team would like to see a timeline for “tangible, structural changes” to support students of color on campus. She said the “I, Too, Am Harvard” team’s main concern with the working group is that it may be vague in its goals.
“We support the idea of a working group, but only under the condition that it would have deliverable outcomes and timelines, and that it would be formed for the specific purpose of researching and implementing specific, proposed ideas, rather than just to merely evaluate what we’re doing wrong, what we’re doing right, what we could be doing,” Matsuda-Lawrence said.
Leaders of the campaign brought two additional demands to administrators at their meeting Friday, according to Matsuda-Lawrence—the creation of a pre-orientation program on race and identity issues and a multicultural student center.
Matsuda-Lawrence added that she and the “I, Too, Am Harvard” team are “extremely excited” about Pfister and Khurana’s letter to students. University President Drew G. Faust has also reached out to the group, according to Matsuda-Lawrence.

Hanan Ashrawi, an executive committee member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, expressed her lack of faith in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian peace process during a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics Monday night.
During the address, entitled “Beyond a Last Chance: Challenges to Achieving Palestinian-Israeli Peace,” Ashrawi highlighted the obstacles faced by the current peace process brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and described the negotiations as “not truly bilateral” and “characterized by a power asymmetry.”
 
“Israel has hijacked the process itself,” Ashrawi said. “There is a sense of entitlement and exceptionalism, and nobody can hold Israel responsible for its violations.”
Ashrawi also questioned the suitability of the U.S. as an arbitrator in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and said that the United Nations would be a better mediator in resolving the conflict.
“We can’t choose the superpower of the world.... The best approach is to have the UN,” Ashrawi said. “But Israel doesn’t like the U.N. because of its resolutions, and the U.S. wouldn’t do anything to take us to the U.N.”
When asked if she would describe herself as a “pessimist” with regard to her stance on the future of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Ashrawi said she would rather call herself “a critical realist.”
“It takes changing the dynamics, the courage, to understand that it’s not just a question of getting the Palestinians to accept [terms imposed by the Israelis],” Ashrawi said. “It’s a sinking ship, and nobody should be onboard.”
Even though Ashrawi’s speech was met with a standing ovation, audience members had mixed reactions to her address.
“She was clearly biased in favor of the Palestinians,” Richard Koerner, a business consultant based in Boston, said. “I don’t think she said anything that was revealing or new.”
Other members of the audience disagreed.
 “She’s very brave and she is telling the situation as it is,” said Randa Khuri, who added that her family was evicted from Palestine. “If only more people will listen.”
 Hussein Kalout, a Brazilian research fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, said that we should continue to have more provocative discussions like Ashrawi’s, “especially undiplomatic ones, in order to hear from real sources about real problems of real human beings.”

The Undergraduate Council has formed a task force to involve students in the discussion on Harvard’s sexual assault policies in response to a first-person, anonymous op-ed published in The Crimson describing the author’s experience as the victim of an alleged sexual assault, UC leaders said Monday.
 
The group, which any UC representative can voluntarily join, will collaborate with the student activist organization Our Harvard Can Do Better, which advocates for changes to Harvard’s sexual assault policy. Emphasizing that the UC wishes to “complement” the work already being done by Our Harvard Can Do Better, UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said the task force will advocate for demands similar to those of the group.
 
Goffard and UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 created the UC task force to evaluate revisions to the current College policy, they said, prompted by the publication of the article “Dear Harvard: You Win” in The Crimson’s opinion section. The article details administrators’ response to the author’s experiences in the aftermath of the alleged assault. The author, who reports being discouraged from opening a case before the Administrative Board, criticizes the University’s policies in the piece, calling them “outdated and narrow in scope.”
 
Goffard said Monday that he was “taken aback” and “disturbed” by the scenario depicted in the piece. Goffard and Mayopoulos sent emails to various administrators urging them to read it on Monday.
 
Mayopoulos said that UC leaders are soliciting membership for the task force and that representatives have already expressed significant interest. According to Mayopoulos, the task force will meet regularly with student activist groups and work with administrators “to make sure the student voice is always heard” on the issue. Goffard and Mayopoulos said that they had already discussed the College’s sexual assault policy with administrators and student activists earlier this year.
 
According to Goffard, the UC task force will ask that the University clarify the current policy’s use of the language “mental incapacitation” that renders one unable to give consent; request that Harvard adopt a policy of “affirmative consent”; and advocate to ease the process of petitioning an Ad Board hearing in sexual assault cases. The first two points are among the six main demands outlined on the Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign’s website.
 
The UC task force’s formation follows several administrative efforts to evaluate the University’s compliance with Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on gender and sexual harassment in federally-funded education programs. In spring 2013, Harvard appointed Mia Karvonides to serve as its first-ever University-wide Title IX officer, and later that semester, she convened a University-wide working group to evaluate Harvard’s sexual assault policies.
 
And just this fall, the College appointed its first Title IX coordinators, roughly a year after 85 percent of undergraduate voters in the 2012 UC presidential election supported a reconsideration of the College’s sexual assault policies. That became the official stance of the UC.
 
In interviews Monday, UC leaders criticized what they characterized as a lack of student input on the evaluation of the University-wide policies.
 
Goffard said he was “a little upset” that students have not been more involved in the process, and Mayopoulos deemed it “a mistake” on the part of the University not to solicit more student input.
 
Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, an organizer for the Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign, applauded past and present efforts of the UC in an emailed statement.
 
“Given Harvard's shunning of student input on policy, despite the fact that this policy primarily affects us, we think that the formation of this UC working group is an important step as it provides some formal acknowledgement of the wide consensus among students that current policy needs to change and that student and survivor experience should inform these changes,” Fox-Penner wrote.
 
Goffard said he and Mayopoulos will discuss changes to the sexual assault policy in a previously scheduled meeting with Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister this Friday and plan to speak with representatives from Our Harvard Can Do Better later this week.

In its final tune-up before Ivy League play commences this weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team showcased its depth in singles and entered conference season on a high note with a 5-2 victory over St. Johns on Sunday.
The No. 30 Crimson (11-5) outlasted the Red Storm (10-6), overcoming a slow start to capture its seventh win in eight all-time matchups against St. Johns.
Harvard continued its up-and-down performance on the doubles courts of the Murr Center. After strong doubles play throughout a runner-up showing at the Mission Valley Spring Classic, the Crimson reverted to its previous inconsistent form.
“I think we’re inconsistent sometimes,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “The team probably won’t be able to achieve its potential until everybody comes and understands how to put in [the proverbial] 60 minutes of play. Not some, not most, but 60 minutes.”
Co-captain Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen, the 11th-ranked doubles tandem in the country, fell on court one, 8-5. Then freshman Brian Yeung and sophomore Nicky Hu, who lead the team with seven dual-match doubles wins, went down, 8-6, on the second court.
Harvard’s only victory came from freshman Sebastian Beltrame and junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder, and the pair had to overcome being down a break early before coming back for an 8-6 final margin.
“We have to give St. John’s credit for playing so well in doubles,” Steinroeder said. We came out a little flat, and they had a lot of energy.”
The Crimson headed into singles with a 1-0 deficit, but quickly turned it around. Nguyen, ranked 31st nationally, got things started with a 6-1, 6-1 triumph at first singles, and Yeung gave Harvard a lead with a 6-2, 6-1 win at No. 4.
“Denis was consistent and applied pressure at the right times in his match,” Fish noted. “That’s when he’s most dangerous. Brian Yeung had a really good outing. He just threw it out there and used his power game.”
Hu served up a 6-2, 6-4 beatdown on court six, pushing the Crimson lead to 3-1. Junior Shaun Chaudhuri then ended the drama and clinched the match with the team’s fourth straight-set victory on the third court, recording a 6-2, 6-4 win. Beltrame helped provide the only win in doubles, but was responsible for the only loss in singles, falling in a contested match, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6, to the Red Storm’s R.J. Del Nunzio.
After the match was clinched, Steinroeder took the team’s final victory, 7-6, 4-6, 1-0, to provide the winning margin.
With the non-conference campaign in the rearview mirror, the squad now sets off into what promises to be a tough Ancient Eight slate in hopes of winning its third straight crown.
Last year, Harvard went 6-1 in Ivy play en route to the title and a second round appearance in the NCAA championships. This year, it hopes to match and surpass last year’s feats, but it must overcome the loss of the graduated Andy Nguyen and the integration of new, inexperienced freshmen.
“[Beltrame] served for the match twice but couldn’t close it out,” Fish said. “It has nothing to do with being bad under pressure. He just put in 50 minutes and thought it would be enough, but he’ll learn…. At this level, you learn that what used to get you an A now gets you a C.”
But Fish believes in the team’s ability to push past its early-season jitters and enjoy a successful conference campaign.
“When things aren’t going well, you have a little more doubt,” Fish said. “And it’s the doubt, not a lack of ability, that brings you down. Mastery is about knowing you’ve done the work, and bring that attitude. Our team has been learning these lessons, and knows this is what it takes. That’s our challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From his perch upon a coffee table, Bill Cleary ’56 held a tall wooden trophy as he addressed the hundreds of Crimson alumni, players, and fans gathered in the lobby of the St. Paul Hotel.
“This isn’t just for the hockey team,” pronounced the balding coach as he bared his dentures through a youthful grin. “This is for every Harvard alumnus in the country—in the world.”
On that fateful April Fool’s Day 25 years ago, Cleary was speaking before the most exuberant audience in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.
After all, the Harvard men’s hockey team had sent the rest of the state into mourning only a couple of hours earlier.
The mood inside the lobby could not be more different than the one outside it. Until that night, the oldest athletics program in the country had yet to win a national championship in an NCAA team competition.
A slow-sliding backhand shot from junior forward Ed Krayer ’89-90 had ended the wait, lifting Harvard over the University of Minnesota for a 4-3 overtime win to capture the 1989 national championship. For the first time in the Association’s 83-year history, Cambridge could finally claim a champion as its own.
Twenty-five years later, Harvard has since added three more NCAA team titles to its name, but none in a major American professional sport. Not until the 2013 Yale Bulldogs did another Ivy League team win a men’s national hockey title. Indeed, the trophy in Cleary’s hands was unlike any other prize a Crimson coach had held before or has held since. And it was there for all to see in the lobby of the St. Paul Hotel thanks to a delicate balance of leadership, talent, and luck.
SETTING THE TONE
Lane MacDonald ’88-89 stood up to face his teammates. It was late September in Allston, and a feeling of anticipation was in the frigid air of the Bright Hockey Center as the Harvard icemen sat for their first official meeting of the 1988-1989 season.
An impressive collection of individuals sat before the left winger. There was sixth-year senior Allen Bourbeau ’88, who had taken the previous year off with MacDonald to play for the 1988 U.S. Olympic team. There were four future Olympians in the group: junior right wing C.J. Young ’90, sophomore forwards Peter Ciavaglia ’91 and Ted Donato ’91, and freshman goaltender Allain Roy ’92. All told, 15 NHL draft picks sat before MacDonald, a Hartford Whalers prospect himself.
MacDonald was the obvious choice to captain the team in his senior year. Although the former Milwaukee prep star was one of the quieter guys on the team, he knew how to communicate to his teammates through action. His speed and offensive prowess were matched only by his impeccable work ethic.
“When the best player is also the hardest worker, everyone else tends to fall in line,” says Scott Farden ’88, a senior defender on the team and the current chair of Friends of Harvard Hockey. “That’s how Lane led.”
MacDonald’s 37 goals—second only to Cleary on the program’s all-time list—and nomination for the Hobey Baker Award, hockey’s equivalent of the Heisman, in his junior season spoke for themselves. At this first team meeting, however, it was clear that the captain had something to say. And when MacDonald had something to say, you listened.
“Anything less than a national championship is unacceptable this year.”
The captain’s statement was both bold and realistic. Bold in the sense that “anything less than a national championship” was the norm for Harvard as an institution. Then-athletic Director Jack Reardon ’60 expected the hockey team to compete for Ivy League championships—not NCAA championships or even ECAC championships. But MacDonald’s ambitions were far from unrealistic, especially given the events 29 months earlier.
For eight players on the ’89 team, the memory of 1986 still burned. Late in the second period of the 1986 national championship game in Providence, R.I., the Crimson had held a 4-2 lead over Michigan State. Despite the absence of MVP senior forward Scott Fusco ’86, who had suffered a knee ligament strain in Harvard’s semifinal win over Denver the day before, the Crimson, who held a 5-4 lead with 17 minutes left, were less than a period from becoming the first Ivy League squad since Cornell in 1970 to win the title. Yet the favored Crimson would run out of steam down the stretch as the Spartans rallied to a 6-5 title win.
“We were so close, and we were playing so well,” MacDonald says. “We so easily could have won the national championship. But there’s such a fine line between losing and winning at that level.”
With MacDonald and Bourbeau back from their Olympic sabbatical, the Crimson offered more offensive firepower than ever before. While three of the last six Harvard teams had made the Frozen Four, two advancing to the championship game, the bar was set higher in 1989. From MacDonald’s perspective, the team had too much talent not to win it all.
“We had all of the pieces in place to win a national championship, so it had to be our objective,” MacDonald says. “Anything less than that we’d be selling ourselves short.”
But the captain also had a more personal reason to consider losing unacceptable: he knew what he was risking when he stepped on the ice.
The symptoms had started in high school. The numbness. The loss of vision. The struggle to turn on a shower or button a shirt. The migraines and concussions only got worse in 1988. Three weeks before the Opening Ceremonies, MacDonald seriously considered withdrawing from Team USA.
“I had enough issues that I was losing some parts of the enjoyment playing hockey,” says MacDonald, whose concussions would ultimately force him to forego a career in the hard-hitting NHL. “And honestly, there was some fear every time I played.”
MacDonald played through the fear and scored six goals in six games in Calgary, and Harvard neurologists gave him only a cautious go-ahead to play in the 1988-1989 season. His worst fears appeared to be confirmed when he experienced a concussive episode in Harvard’s opening game versus Yale, but that would end up being the worst of his symptoms that season.
Still, the nagging doubt remained throughout the year, and a focus of the Crimson’s season would be to protect the most important and most fragile piece of its championship puzzle.
MEETING EXPECTATIONS
Each game of Harvard’s season began the same way behind the bench. Cleary would offer assistant coach Ronn Tomassoni a cough drop. Tomassoni would offer Cleary a cough drop.
In 1989, the superstitious Cleary was ready to finish what he had started 34 years earlier. Before Cleary led the gold medal-winning 1960 U.S. Olympic hockey team in scoring, the Cambridge, Mass. native led Harvard to its first-ever Frozen Four in 1955 as a standout All-American forward.
“Billy Cleary is legendary,” says John “Jocko” Connolly, a long-time college hockey beat reporter for The Boston Herald. “He is so passionate about the game and such a competitor. He would just will his team to win.”
Cleary had turned down offers from the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens during his time at Harvard. After graduating, he started an insurance sales firm with his brother Bob ’58, who also owns Crimson hockey records and an Olympic gold. Coaching was only a part-time gig for Cleary when he became Harvard’s head coach in 1971, and it would remain that way through 1990, when he retired from coaching to succeed Reardon as Harvard’s athletic director. The multi-tasking, however, did little to diminish Cleary’s abilities behind the bench.
“He brought an energy and confidence that definitely reverberated throughout the team,” says Donato, who is the current coach of the Harvard men’s hockey team and regularly sees Cleary at home games.
He had little difficulty getting his squads to buy into his lightning-strike, offense-minded system. Cleary earned the elusive combination of love and respect from his players that any good coach strives to achieve. Away from the rink or during Monday morning skates, he was just one of the guys. His broad arsenal of practical jokes—from canine impersonations to swapping whipped butter for ice cream on an unsuspecting Sports Illustrated reporter—kept his charges in stitches.
But when it came time to work, Cleary conducted the team with military-like precision.
“He kept it light and fun, and it was almost like a Jekyll and Hyde thing,” Farden says. “He was fun-loving and loose and jovial off the ice, but when we got on his competitive spirit came in. We didn’t waste a second of any practice.”
The focus instilled by Cleary propelled Harvard to a perfect start and a No. 1 ranking through the first 15 games of the 1988-1989 season. The combination of MacDonald, Bourbeau, and Young quickly earned the nickname the “Line of Fire” as the stars bludgeoned defenses up and down the East Coast.
When the stars were on, the results rewrote the history books. On Dec. 12, Young scored three shorthanded goals within a span of 49 seconds in a 10-0 win over Dartmouth. A month later, the team cruised to a 5-1 win over then-No. 1 St. Lawrence on the road.
“The goalie from St. Lawrence, he didn’t know what was going on,” Connolly said. “Harvard had some great games that year.”
By the second half of the season, however, some pundits had relegated the Ivy Leaguers to pretender status. An upstart Vermont squad had surprised the Crimson in overtime in the semifinals of the ECAC Tournament, and Harvard’s two regular season losses had come to mediocre Yale and Colgate teams. The Crimson’s short and relatively weak schedule raised red flags for the NCAA seeding committee, which awarded 11-loss Maine the top seed in the Eastern bracket, bumping the Crimson to the second seed.
By the time Cleary’s boys faced off against top-seeded Michigan State in the first game of the Frozen Four, few outsiders saw Harvard as the team to beat. While a hat trick from Ciavaglia had lifted the Crimson to a quarterfinals sweep of defending champion Lake Superior State at Bright a week earlier, the Crimson had yet to match up against an elite western team on the road.
In an interview with a Twin Cities paper a day before the puck drop in St. Paul, Michigan State forward Bobby Reynolds best summed up the consensus view of Harvard’s championship chances: “Thank God we’re not playing Minnesota.”
The Spartans may have gotten the match-up they wanted in the national semifinal, but they didn’t get the result. The Crimson, buoyed by first period goals from Young and Ciavaglia and an early acrobatic stop from freshman goaltender Allain Roy on a wrap-around attempt from Reynolds, downed its 1986 tormentors, 6-3, in front of a State-partisan sellout crowd.
While a small Harvard contingent celebrated at the Civic Center, hundreds of other Crimson fans rejoiced in front of televisions across the country. Among those who had tuned into ESPN was a group of about 40 Harvard football players and other students on spring break at a Daytona Beach, Fl., sports bar. Inspired, the next morning, senior defensive tackle Jim Bell, senior quarterback Tom Yohe, and eight other friends woke up early to embark on the 30-hour drive to St. Paul for the championship game.
“I remember being fueled by a combination of Cool Ranch Doritos and NoDoz,” Bell says. “I remember leaving Daytona Beach and it was about 85 degrees. Crossing the border from Wisconsin to Minnesota, it started to snow and it was about 12 degrees, and we felt that we had made a terrible mistake.”
The players made some calls to contacts in the Harvard Athletics Department during gas station stops and obtained a row of seats in the nosebleeds. Despite being flagged down for a speeding ticket in Dubuque, Iowa, Bell and his friends arrived at the St. Paul Hotel just in time to wish their friend MacDonald and his team good luck during their pre-game meal.
“For them to make the trek, and to drive that far for us, and to be very vocal supporters before the game started [and] during the game, it meant a lot,” MacDonald says. “You just knew that people were pulling for you and you had the support of...the students, the alums, and it was just a very visible symbol of how many people were pulling for us to win.”
OVERTIME
“You guys should be salivarating out there.”
The Crimson locker room erupted in laughter. The icemen were about to play the most important minutes of their careers, but they couldn’t help but laugh at Donato’s butchering of the word “salivating.”
After 60 minutes, nothing separated the nation’s top two teams in a back-and-forth championship game. A sweeping, coast-to-coast strike from MacDonald and Donato’s third goal of the Frozen Four had given Harvard 2-1 and 3-2 leads during the contest, but Minnesota quickly found an answer each time. With just 3:26 left in regulation, Golden Gopher left wing Peter Hankinson had tied the game at three on the power play.
“That couldn’t have been a better-played hockey game,” Farden says. “There was so much talent, and it was pure, there was skill on display…. Both teams took turns dominating the game.”
As the Zambonis resurfaced the ice before hundreds of tense Minnesotans, Donato did his best to keep himself and his teammates loose by shouting out the ridiculous pump-up line. The malapropism cracked up freshman goaltender Chuckie Hughes, Donato’s old high school teammate.
“Everybody just lost it at that point,” Hughes says. “It was a nice mood-breaker to kind of get so [we’d] be a little less tight going out into the overtime.”
Hughes had saved 31 of the 34 shots that came his way in the first three periods. Heading into sudden death, he could not envision another puck getting by him.
“Chuckie was a very confident guy and very clutch,” Donato says. “There certainly were no moments where he didn’t feel like he was capable of being up to the task.”
The atmosphere was also light in the Minnesota locker room before overtime. The Golden Gophers resembled the Crimson in many respects. Like Harvard, they had returning Olympic talent in junior Dave Snuggerud, an offensive-minded coach in Doug Woog, and a Hobey Baker winner in senior goaltender Robb Stauber.
Minnesota also had another player in the locker room who, like Hughes, was brimming with confidence. Junior defenseman Randy Skarda felt that he was due.
“I remember telling Peter Hankinson that I was going to get the winner in overtime,” Skarda says. “I actually really had a good strong gut feeling that I was going to get one really good chance.”
Little did Hughes and Skarda know at the time that they were on a collision path. Early in overtime, Golden Gophers captain Lance Pitlick skated into the Harvard zone and flicked the puck to Skarda. Low in the right faceoff circle, Skarda saw an opening past freshman Harvard defenseman Brian McCormack and let a wrist shot fly toward Hughes’s near side.
After the game, Woog would succinctly summarize what happened next: “One half-inch, and you’re the champion.”
Skarda’s puck hit the outside of the left post, just above Hughes’s blocker. In the post-championship delirium, Hughes would brashly claim that he knew the shot was not going to get by him.
“I watched the video, and I got beat clean,” Hughes admits. “But I will take it to my grave that I do believe that any other line on that shot, it would’ve been off my blocker, in the corner.”
Skarda, meanwhile, has never lived down being the guy who hit the pipe. He still catches flack from the eight-year-olds he coaches on his daughter’s hockey team in Minnetonka, Minn.
“The girls…call me ‘Piper,’ and I’m sure they’re referring to the Harvard game,” Skarda says.
Moments after the hit post, it would be a Harvard player’s turn to make a career-defining play. Five minutes into the frame, Ciavaglia shoveled the puck to Krayer off a faceoff in the Gopher zone.
Krayer dropped a pass back to freshman defender Brian McCormack, who fired a low, hard shot onto the pads of Stauber. The senior Minnesota goaltender couldnot control the puck, which bounced out into the slot. Krayer pounced on the rebound, skated to his right, and shifted to his backhand.
“I definitely didn’t get full wood on it,” Krayer recalls. “I fanned on it slightly.”
Krayer had a tumultuous Harvard experience, taking the 1987-1988 and 1989-1990 school years off because of academic and personal frustrations. But in that moment, there was nothing but happiness as he watched his shot creep past the right leg of a stumbling Stauber.
“I remember the feeling when the puck crossed the line and the red line went on, and it was instant euphoria,” Krayer says. “I kind of went numb for a couple of seconds as the moment hit me. And once it did, and it occurred to me what that meant, I got buried by a bunch of teammates jumping on me. The rest was sort of just hysteria.”
From the bench, the moment seemed to unravel in slow motion.
“Seeing the puck going in, it’s a bit of one of those surreal moments,” says MacDonald, who would accept the Hobey Baker Award the next day. “You have to check yourself and see if that is really happening.”
“I feel like I’ve seen the highlight in my mind a million times, and I still get excited,” adds Donato, who took tournament Most Outstanding Player honors. “I still get emotional when I see the puck cross that goal line.”
STANDING TOGETHER
While the hundreds of people that gathered at the St. Paul Hotel later that night would remember Cleary’s postgame speech, his words prior to the championship game are not as well documented.
Farden will never forget what Cleary told the Crimson in the Civic Center locker room before the team faced Minnesota.
“I remember him saying something to the effect of, ‘If we win together tonight, we walk together forever,’” Farden says. “I think it was one of the more prophetic statements that anyone made.”
Cleary’s vision was there for all to see earlier this year at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The ’89 team had gathered for a reunion at the Harvard men’s hockey team’s Feb. 21 home game against Yale.
Between the first and second periods, the coach and his champions walked onto the ice together for the 25th anniversary recognition ceremony.
At the home bench, Donato seemed to hesitate at first, unsure whether to join his teammates on the ice or his players in the locker room, but his old friends waved him over. Among the men on the rink,not much had changed. Cleary was still laughing. At Cleary’s right hand was MacDonald, who still carried himself with an understated poise.
“It feels like we are on a bus ride to Cornell,” Farden says of team reunions. “Everyone falls back into their old roles. It feels like we are in college again.”
The team stood together, but in the pantheon of Crimson sports, they stood alone. The men’s basketball team would produce Harvard’s next major national athletic headlines in March but finished five wins away from an NCAA title.
Reardon said that the realistic expectations for Harvard athletics—where “anything less than a national championship” is rarely a disappointment—make the 1989 victory all the more special.
“Nobody likes to lose, and the question is, ‘What do you go for?’” Reardon says. “If we set our goals to go after national championships, we’re kidding ourselves, because we’re not set up for that.”
Institutional standards limited Harvard in 1989, and they limit Harvard in 2014. During the reunion, Hughes and his teammates reminisced on the way they won, proud of their accomplishments in Cambridge away from the rink.
“The thing we all pride ourselves on is the fact that we believe we represented what Harvard means both off the ice and on the ice,” Hughes says. “The  university took a chance on us, believed in us, and felt that we could thrive as students first and athletes second.”
Since St. Paul, Harvard men’s hockey has retreated from the national stage, last making the tournament in 2006 and last appearing in the Frozen Four in 1994. It may be another 25 years before another Harvard men’s team accepts a national trophy at center ice.
In the meantime, MacDonald hopes the 1989 squad can inspire current and future Harvard student-athletes.
“Winning that national championship sent the message that you can be both a student and an athlete, and you can do it at the highest level,” MacDonald says.

 Welcome back to Listen Up! Your trusted Flyby advisers—two uniquely unqualified, naïve, decidedly uninteresting sophomores—are back from spring break refreshed and ready to solve your latest problems.
*Note: Just as with every post, each of these questions is very, very real.
I ate something funny in the dhall the other day, and now have a large greenish rash developing on my face and a third arm growing out of my chest. I went to UHS, and they said to ask you guys what to do.
Oh, you must have had the BBQ Chicken soup. Yeah, never a good call. On the bright side we do have some advice for you: drop out of school and become a professional juggler. Or even better, don’t drop out of school and join one of those troupes that performs outside of Quincy Market. Work-Study requirement? Consider it fulfilled.
I have a really hot TF, and can't focus in section because I just fantasize about him. What do I do?We want you to perform an exercise right now wherever you’re reading this (unless you’re in section in which case we pat ourselves on the back for distracting you from your alleged distraction). Blankly stare ahead of you, tilt your head, and start drooling a little. Now picture how unflattering that would look if you saw someone else do this. This is what we imagine your hot TF sees when they look at you*. You look stupid.
Our advice for individuals who are in the same section as their crushes applies in a modified form in this situation. We’re not going to advocate for you to start participating in your class all of a sudden. That would attract too much attention, and frankly would be a lot of work for you. As we’ve advised before, only speak immediately after your crush has made a comment, echoing that statement positively. However, every time your TF asks a question always be second to answer the question. Why? So you can directly contradict the point that the first question-answerer made. TFs ABSOLUTELY LOVE when there’s a “diversity of opinion.” They gobble it up.
Also, utilize all office hours. You can go over the things you missed daydreaming in your actual section while also staring deeply into your TFs eyes as he explains to you that you’re currently failing the class and might need to take the class over. Don’t you just love how the word ‘fail’ rolls off their tongue? Yum.
*No one has actually stared at us longingly so this is mostly based on cartoons we’ve watched. Dev claims that a girl did longingly stare at him once but with no eyewitnesses, we can only conclude that this never actually happened.
 I had a very explicit sexual dream about a Tasty Burger last night. Is there something wrong with me?Yes.
What is the best way to dispose of a dead body in the Harvard area?Near the registrar’s office. It will probably go undiscovered for days.
You see the administrators of this great school decided first that undergraduates would have to live in the Radcliffe Quadrangle, away from the rest of the student body. Then they contemplated where they would place the Registrar’s Office. They looked and looked, and decided that instead of placing the office in the Quad where it would be accessible to at least 19 percent of the student body or in the Yard where it would be accessible to the rest of the student body, they would place it perfectly between the Yard and the Quad in order to make it inconvenient for everyone. There’s a big problem when the registrar’s office is closer to the Sheraton Commander and a restaurant called Nubar than it is to any students.
What if her booty does need explaining?Harvard offers many strong courses in foreign languages, from Swahili to Swedish. However, the poet Derulo assures us, the only situation when you will really need to understand a foreigner is when that person speaks to you in a suggestive manner. So don’t worry.My parents died in a car crash when I was 1 year old, and I have been living with my aunt and uncle ever since. I sleep in the closet under the stairs and endure bullying from my fat cousin everyday, and can't help feeling that I was meant for something more. I also have a weird cut on my forehead that hasn't healed for 11 years. Is there any hope for me?Never give up hope, young friend. First, we are so sorry to hear about your parents. However, aunts and uncles can be great guardians and sources of support. Second, if you sleep in a closet, might we suggest transferring houses? Judging from your sleeping situation, it sounds like you’re living in Winthrop. We know it’s close to the MAC, but come on, you deserve better. In regards to the cut, that seems like a medical problem and you should visit University Health Services before it gets infected.
Now in terms of your fat cousin. All we’re going to say is that the two of you should take a visit to the zoo, particularly the reptile section. You guys might find yourselves “bonding” there.
I literally do no homework...is this bad?See, here’s the problem. We really want to help you. We truly want to give you great advice. We signed up to take over Listen Up! not because we have nothing better to do with our lives but because we believe that we can provide a crucial resource currently missing from the student body. But we can’t help you if you waste our time with short, unsubstantive questions like this one.
What kind of classes do you take? For instance if you take a class where homework is only worth 20 percent of the grade then you’re fine, you’ll probably get an A. If you’re in a class where homework is worth 50 percent of the grade then you’re in real trouble, you’ll get the dreaded B+.
You. Need. To. Tell. Us. These. Things. You could be in one of those introductory math classes where you’re supposed to be pumping out problem sets like they’re nobody’s business. Or you could be in one of those new-age flipped classrooms things where we assume you just watch videos and don’t have any homework. No one knows but you.
Steven, how do I make hair more luscious?Suave Naturals Ocean breeze shampoo. Bring the waves to your scalp.
 
I don't think I'm going to get any summer job...how do I cope with going back home to my high school job for three whole months?Let’s dissect this question. “I’m not going to get any summer job...going back home to my high school job.” Uhh, so you have a job.
We’re just going to assume what you really meant is that you didn’t land that prestigious internship at a consulting firm or a nice high-paying finance summer job. Well first of all, we aren’t at the hiring end of any of those places, but we assume that an important part in the decision-making process is “can I understand what this person is asking or writing?” Surely, if you can’t properly convey your thoughts when a prompted to “Submit your question below,” you won’t be able to write a comprehendable cover letter and resume.
As for how you will cope? We think maybe you could take up baking, we hear it’s pretty relaxing.
Dear Dev and Steve (I wish your names rhymed. They look like they would...), how the fuck does one deal with super annoying Harvard Class of 2018ers back in our hometowns? As a current freshman, I refuse to believe I was ever this infuriatingly cocky.First of all, you probably were that cocky. You should just let them have their fun. Let them brag about how great they are and how awesome it’s going to be when they matriculate, and how they’ll have such a great freshman year and they’re going to meet new people and do super well in their classes. You can just secretly laugh because you know that life here is sometimes kind of meh, you’re drowning with homework (unless you “literally” don’t do any of it), and you don’t get to socialize as much as you’d like to.
As always, don’t forget to submit your questions! Come on, we know you’re troubled. Hopefully you can submit better questions than some of the ones in this post. That’s right, we even took the extra clicking out of the equation so you can’t use that as an excuse.

 It looks like the reign of the Undergraduate Council’s “Comedian-in-Chief,” in all its costume-donning, sword-wielding glory, was short-lived.
Or that’s what UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 want you to think. In an email sent out to undergraduates at just about midnight on April Fool’s Day, the duo announced their “resignation” and the incoming rule of their so-called successors—former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and former UC presidential candidate (and Mayopoulos’s roommate) Sam B. Clark ’15.
“Sam is enthused to be taking the UC back from us to end, in his words, ‘Sietse's unspeakable tyranny’ and ‘Gus's abhorrent and privileged cultural appropriation of 19th Century French culture,’” the supposedly disgraced UC leaders wrote.
Hammonds, apparently, “could not be reached for comment.”
We wonder how administrators in University Hall are reacting to this sudden changing of the guard. Perhaps UC President Hammonds, herself the former College dean, will have more luck in securing increased University funding for student groups than her predecessor.
