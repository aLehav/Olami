After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University, citing financial strains, recently announced its plans to permanently close both its Dental Service and Pharmacy at the end of the year. As a result, many patients have understandably expressed varying gradations of disappointment — they have been stripped of longtime clinical relationships founded upon good rapport and hard-earned trust in their dentists. One dentist at the Service expressed shock, distraught at their forced departure from patients, and concerned about finding new work in the midst of a global pandemic. The Pharmacy was a staple of convenience and assurance of care, which all Harvard affiliates will miss.
Indeed, the University attributed both of these closures to financial difficulties amid a changing healthcare landscape. But Harvard is not a small, family-run business — it is the most well-endowed university in the world. It has enough resources to keep these services going — even to invest in reforms that could bring new life and vitality to the struggling clinic and pharmacy. Does Harvard have no desire to preserve the clinic’s environment of patient trust and support? No regard for the convenience and security offered by a dependable, accessible pharmacy? No understanding of the fact that these closures will disproportionately affect low-income students, who are often otherwise uninsured and thus tend to rely on Harvard University Health Services the most? These services have real value, and using “financial difficulties” to justify closing them is mostly an indicator of shifting financial priorities which do not seem to include the health of students.
This isn’t an isolated case of abandonment. It’s embedded within a much larger trend of the University making choices to downsize and short-circuit its critical healthcare offerings. In 2015, HUHS closed Stillman Infirmary, which had offered short-term care to patients and often serviced intoxicated students who came to HUHS under the College’s amnesty policy. And in June 2019, HUHS stopped offering overnight Urgent Care to patients in-person.
What’s next? If Harvard’s Primary Care services fail to turn a profit in the coming months, will the University shut these down too? Likely not, given the greater demand for Primary Care and thus the attention and opposition that would follow such a closure. But this is illustrative of the problem itself: without pressure or obligation, the University sees no worthwhile incentive to maintain critical services in the face of material loss. The substantive community obligations that should actually guide these decisions — guaranteeing accessible care to students in need, maintaining valued patient-doctor relationships, and even keeping care providers and their families financially afloat amid troubling times — seem to hold little value when it comes to the University's cost-benefit calculations.
So sadly, inevitably, the Dental and Pharmacy Services will become distant, fondly-remembered pieces of Harvard history by next year. Much of the road ahead is still obscure. What will the University do to prioritize the health of its students and other affiliates? What will drive the University: profit or care? Revitalization or abandonment? How will the University's choices impact its students? Will these choices be crippling or uplifting? Ultimately, students’ care is in the University’s hands, if not their trust.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students, like so many others, aspire to lead lives that matter, to make a difference in the world around us. In fact, it's likely what got us here in the first place. And Harvard students themselves hope that they will one day be in positions where the decisions they make in the midst of a crisis will have far-reaching effects and could literally mean the difference between life and death.
Yet so many Harvard students seemed to take pride in checking out for the remainder of the spring semester after classes moved online. As the world devolved into chaos, some of us slept through Zoom classes and demanded that Harvard automatically pass everyone.
Six months later students are still arguing that because we are all struggling with varying levels of challenge, Harvard should relax its standards, cancel its grading, and do away with attendance expectations.
Of course, these are extraordinarily difficult and unprecedented circumstances. Students need as much flexibility as possible, and the College’s extension of the pass-fail deadline was an appropriate move. Let's also be clear. There are students who are facing severe hardship — with sick family members, housing insecurity, or essential-worker parents in harm’s way. There are students who are looking after younger siblings while working two jobs to pay rent. These aren't the students I'm referring to here.
But for the rest of us — students living in less-than-optimal circumstances in our childhood bedrooms, alone and missing our life at Harvard, but still safe and secure — we can’t on the one hand plan for a life where we will be called on to make tough decisions under pressure, and on the other hand call for the school to relax its standards, cancel its grading, turn a blind eye to attendance, and so on because things got a little tough. These approaches are mutually exclusive.
The coronavirus pandemic is our practice test for a life of important decisions. We haven’t been called upon to invent creative ways to safely reuse N95 masks or to figure out how to safely split a ventilator between two patients. We aren’t yet leading a team of scientists in a race for a treatment or vaccine. As many parts of society kick into high gear to protect us and our loved ones, we watch, and we care, but we aren’t yet in a position to have to act. This is a practice run: We do not have to be perfect, but we do have to show up. And in March when the coronavirus hit, some of us stopped showing up.
One of the only guarantees in the world is that there will always be tragedy and chaos and death. Our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents have faced wars and food rations, polio, the constant threat of nuclear conflict, the AIDS crisis, terrorist attacks; the list goes on. The coronavirus pandemic is our generation’s first major crisis.
The next crisis will be our responsibility. It’s practically a guarantee that we will need to step up at some point. We won’t be able to go back to our childhood bedrooms or dorm rooms and check out. It will be the real deal.
One day, we might be in a position that requires us to keep working as the world devolves into chaos. We might be infectious disease experts, emergency room doctors, or other healthcare workers. We might be running businesses deemed essential services. We might be serving as elected officials tasked with mitigating the economic effects of a crisis.
The good news is that practice runs are built into the fabric of our educational institution. We navigate difficult conversations in our classes and we compromise with colleagues in our extracurriculars. We’re extremely lucky to be able to practice leading ethically while participating in something larger than ourselves when the stakes are remarkably low. We’re doing schoolwork — it doesn’t really matter if we miss a paper deadline because we were doomscrolling on Twitter. But we have to try.
In the future, checking out won’t be an option. In fact, it might be one of the most detrimental decisions we could make for the people who are counting on us. We’ve seen what happens when our leaders take a day off. The responses to pandemics and other international crises aren’t graded pass-fail.
Harvard students can’t have it both ways. This is our first test, our first practice run. If we want to be leaders in the future, we can't check out and ask for special treatment now.

Following the Harvard Kennedy School of Government’s release of its annual diversity report, school affiliates said they were “disappointed” at the newest numbers, which show that the school’s faculty and student body remains overwhelmingly white and male.
Cassandra R. Duchan, the co-chair of the HKS Latinx Caucus, said she was “disappointed” with the results, and that the Kennedy School is not the “global institution” that it claims to be.
“We don't even have a population that reflects the world or even this country,” she said.
Diego A. Garcia-Blum, the school’s student body president, said in a written statement that the school’s students and faculty remain “largely unrepresentative of the world we live in.”
“How can we teach several classes on the issues facing indigenous peoples and yet only have one American Indian/Alaskan Native student to speak of their own experience in class?” he wrote. “How can we properly teach and discuss issues of social justice in our leadership classes when Black and Latinx students and faculty remain underrepresented?”
Kennedy School professor Khalil G. Muhammad — one of two tenured African American professors at the school— called the change in faculty diversity at the Kennedy School “glacial.”
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an emailed statement the school recognizes the “imperative” to continue to increase diversity.
“Over the past several years, the Kennedy School has moved forward with determination to advance diversity and belonging, including through vigorous recruiting of students, cluster hiring of faculty members, and adding new courses,” he wrote.
Muhammad also took issue with the form of the report, and said it fails to show how little the school’s diversity has improved over time.
“I think the report is a disappointment as I said when it was first released two years ago, because the structure of the report fails to benchmark — either in the opening text, or in the way that the data is reported in — any way to measure change over time,” Muhammad said. “It's frustrating and disappointing to see that the administration refuses to give readers of this report an easy way to see how things have changed over at least the past three years.”
In the past, Elmendorf has said it will “take time” for new recruitment approaches to be fully implemented.
But Muhammad said the school’s refusal to commit to a specific timeframe makes the school’s “intentionality” to address diversity questionable, and that publishing an annual report without a point of comparison is the “bare minimum.”
“No private sector CEO would ever get away with simply presenting a moment in time snapshot of the company,” Muhammad said. “And no private sector leader would not be held accountable for setting goals and a timetable for achieving success in an area that was identified as a problem.”
“It seems not to apply to their own commitment to full transparency in how to measure their own efforts at increasing the presence of nonwhite faculty at Harvard Kennedy School,” he added.
Duchan also questioned the Kennedy School’s commitment to increasing representation based on their reliance on students’ labor to increase the diversity of the student body.
This semester, for example, members of the Latinx Caucus have felt that the task of recruiting students of color to the school has fallen to them, she said.
“We're doing all of that ourselves,” she added.
Lauren M. Lombardo, a student at the Kennedy School, agreed that the “formal burden” of increasing diversity and inclusion at the school should fall to the administration — not students.
“Students, faculty, staff, and administrators each have an important role to play in increasing the diversity of HKS,” she wrote in an email. “However, much of the formal burden belongs to HKS and Harvard administrators, not to students with little formal authority, and especially not to students who are underrepresented at our institution.”
Garcia-Blum also wrote about the importance of financial aid reform — a cause the school’s previous student leaders have also championed — in diversifying the student body.
“The admissions team should survey admits of color who rejected their offers about their reasoning for doing so, share those results with student groups representing those identities, and work on removing those barriers,” he wrote. “I also believe that the school should implement a need-based financial aid system so that not just the wealthy and well-connected can afford to come here.”
Still, he said that improving faculty diversity should be the top priority for HKS.
“Most urgently, the school needs to cluster-hire tenured and tenure-track faculty of color, working on issues that affect those communities, on a yearly basis,” he wrote.

Harvard Government Ph.D. candidate Shiro Kuriwaki and Michael G. Isakov ’22 cautioned against “overconfidence” in polling data in a paper published Tuesday on their analysis of pollsters’ incorrect predictions 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary R. Clinton would win the previous election.
Kuriwaki and Isakov’s paper, published in the Harvard Data Science Review last week, identifies mistakes in 2016 polling and posits ways to correct these mistakes.
The paper explains that sampling biases were partly to blame for polling mistakes in the 2016 presidential election.
Shortly after the election, some analysts attributed errors in polling to the so-called “shy Trump” effect, in which voters would purportedly lie to pollsters as they were embarrassed to express support for Trump. Kuriwaki and Isakov, however, wrote that analysis of the 2016 polls reveals that mistakes were more likely due to a “sampling problem,” rather than the “shy Trump” effect.
“There was very little evidence of that, partly because there were similar errors for other Republican candidates,” Kuriwaki said in an interview. “So if people were just lying about Trump, you won't see that pattern.”
Kuriwaki and Isakov wrote that polls are most reliable when the sampling pool is representative of the general population, but noted that polls often fall victim to selection bias and disproportionately sample certain demographics.
Pollsters improperly corrected these biases in 2016, which caused the polls’ distorted results, according to the authors.
Poll aggregators also contributed to polling error in 2016, according to Kuriwaki and Isakov.
“When aggregators say there's a 93 percent chance of Hillary Clinton winning, some people think like, ‘Oh, she'll get 93 percent of the votes,’ which is not true,” Kuriwaki said. “But if you say the model tells you that Hillary Clinton will get 53 percent of the popular vote, which is one of the predictions, then people might have the right level of uncertainty.”
“2016 headlines made people more overconfident about the actual results,” he added.
They wrote their research describes a “cautionary tale” they urged pollsters to be responsible in the way they present results.
“It is the polls’ responsibility to not overhype the results and interpret them properly,” Kuriwaki said.
Kuriwaki and Isakov also developed models for 12 states in the 2020 election with the assumption that pollsters make the same mistakes as four years ago.
Some pollsters, however, have already updated their methods, such as by weighting the responses from certain demographics which tend to be underrepresented.
In median battleground states in the 2020 election, Kuriwaki and Isakov found that Trump could receive 0.8 percentage points more than polls conducted in late October predicted, though their model has double the margin of error compared to previous polls.
Another factor Kuriwaki and Isakov considered was voter turnout in median battleground states. Higher voter turnout in this year’s election could result in even less confidence in polling predictions because the polls’ sample pool would become less representative of the general electorate, according to the Kuriwaki’s and Isakov’s paper.
The researchers said that, while polling may not be perfect, it “keeps everyone honest.”
“I feel like having more information is always, always good,” Isakov said. “There's a lot of other countries where we do not really have polling and that has been problematic in various ways.”
“Polling makes the pulse of the country public,” Kuriwaki said. “It shares information that puts people on similar grounds.”

Researchers at Harvard, the Paris Observatory, and MIT, among other institutions, have found that Venus’s atmosphere may not contain phosphine gas, a possible indicator of life, contradicting the results of a study published last month.
The original study was published in the journal Nature Astronomy on Sept. 14. At the time, researchers — including scientists from Harvard and MIT — reported the presence of phosphine gas in Venus’s atmosphere. The study received national media attention for its conclusion that the phosphine gas could indicate the presence of life on Earth’s neighboring planet.
Following the study’s publication, however, multiple research teams reanalyzed the data and concluded that the phosphine levels on Venus are lower than originally reported.
Thérèse A. Encrenaz, an astrophysicist at the Paris Observatory who led one of the subsequent studies, said her research suggests levels of phosphine on Venus are, at most, four times lower than what the original study suggested.
Encrenaz said her findings cast doubt on the legitimacy of the original research.
“Honestly, among all the people I have met who are specialists of millimeter spectroscopy, none of them believe the observation,” Encrenaz said.
Clara Sousa-Silva, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was part of the original study and Encrenaz’s reanalysis efforts, as well as other ongoing studies, said the discrepancies were unsurprising.
Contrasting analyses of the same data are normal and expected, according to Sousa-Silva, especially given the complicated nature of the data.
“It's noisy, delicate, complex data. So it's very hard to see the signal unless you clean up the noise,” Sousa-Silva said.
John M. Carpenter, an observatory scientist at ALMA Observatory who helped collect data for the original paper, said he had been concerned about the legitimacy of the study’s claims about phosphine. Carpenter said he was not involved in the data analysis.
“That was just a concern, as I had not processed the data myself, so I couldn’t prove it one way or the other,” Carpenter said.
Encrenaz and Carpenter also questioned whether the detection of phosphine necessarily means there is life on Venus.
“It’s completely premature to talk about life,” Encrenaz said. “Even if it had been demonstrated that phosphine is present, you could not just jump and say that this is because of life.”
Sousa-Silva claimed, however, that scientists have yet to find another explanation for phosphine on Venus besides evidence of life.
“We have no known explanation for phosphine on Venus, other than by analogy with anaerobic life on Earth. We know a Venusian life form could happily make it the same way life on Earth happily makes it as long as it’s anaerobic,” Sousa-Silva said.
Sousa-Silva said the contradictory follow-up studies were part of the process of scientific discovery.
“I would like to at least encourage the scientific community but also the public in general to not think that conflicting analyses are controversial,” Sousa-Silva said. “That is literally what the scientific method would have you do. And hopefully these different analyses will eventually converge into agreement.”
Correction: November 2, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Clara Sousa-Silva, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said given the currently limited research on phosphine, the most likely conclusion is that phosphine is indicative of life on Venus. In fact, she said scientists have yet to find another explanation for phosphine on Venus besides evidence of life.

Guillermo J. Grenier, a sociology professor at Florida International University, presented his research on the Republican party’s popularity among Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade County, Fla. during a Friday webinar.
The event was hosted by Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies in collaboration with Harvard’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. The discussion was moderated by Alejandro de la Fuente, Harvard professor of African and African American Studies and of History.
The event focused on an analysis of a poll Grenier conducted, in which Cuban Americans in Miami-Dade County were called at random and asked about their opinion on a variety of different political subjects.
Based on his poll results, Grenier said he can project with a low margin of error that President Donald J. Trump will receive around 60 percent of the Cuban American vote in Miami-Dade County in the election.
Both Grenier and Steven R. Levitsky, DRCLAS director and Government professor, said Cuban Americans have, historically, strongly identified with the Republican Party. Levitsky explained that many Cuban Americans registered as Republicans during the Cold War due to the GOP’s firm stance against Fidel Castro’s communist regime.
“The sort of militantly anti-communist rhetoric, that sort of Cold War-like rhetoric, of the Trump administration — for most Americans, it just sounds silly,” Levitsky said. “But in a place where you get these renewed Cold War sentiments and very strong feelings about socialist dictatorships — people who are either descendants of Cuban exiles or actual Venezuelan exiles — that actually struck some chord.”
Levitsky said these historical ties between the Republican Party and Cuban Americans could have far-reaching implications for the election as a whole.
“That identification leads them to sort of buy more strongly into the ‘Trump built a strong economy’ narrative,” Levitsky said. “There’s certainly a world in which it helps tip Florida to Trump on Tuesday.
Grenier, Levitsky, and de la Fuente all said that, while the voting priorities of Cuban Americans may have historically centered on the United States’ policy toward Cuba, that is not what drives most voters today.
In an interview after the event, de la Fuente further highlighted Grenier’s identification of a shift in voting preferences.
“I think the most interesting finding here is that Cuban Americans vote on issues that are not primarily related to Cuba. We tend to think about that community as voting always on Cuba policies. And Cuba policies are a distant fifth place or sixth place in terms of their voting preferences,” de la Fuente said. “They're voting on economic issues. They're voting on immigration issues. They're voting on healthcare — which is pretty much how most Americans vote.”

Researchers at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital have found a new tracer molecule that could help detect and identify injuries in brain imaging tests, according to a Oct. 22 paper published in the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism.
In many cases of brain damage or neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, the brain’s neurons lose their protective coating — a process called demyelination — and their potassium channels become exposed. As a result, the neurons cannot conduct neural impulses efficiently.
The novel tracer molecule, called [18F]3F4AP, can help reveal and identify injury by binding to these exposed channels, according to the MGH researchers. The tracer is “radiolabeled” so it can be seen through a technique called positron emission tomography.
Lead author Nicolas J. Guehl, an investigator in MGH’s department of radiology and a radiology instructor at Harvard Medical School, said the tracer exhibited key properties which make it suitable for brain imaging when tested in primates.
“We found that [18F]3F4AP displays favorable properties for brain imaging including high brain penetration, high metabolic stability, high plasma availability, high reproducibility, high specificity, and fast kinetics,” Guehl said.
Co-senior author Pedro Brugarolas, an investigator in MGH's Gordon Center for Medical Imaging and an assistant radiology professor at HMS, said the basis for [18F]3F4AP is 4-aminopyridine, a therapeutic drug used to treat multiple sclerosis. 4-aminopyridine blocks potassium channels, restoring conduction in demyelinated neurons.
“We made a few fluorine-containing derivatives of the original drug and we tested those in vitro to see which one was more potent,” Brugarolas said. “We made three or four derivatives, and then we found that [18F]3F4AP was the most promising. We’re still pursuing some of the other derivatives, but this is the one that is farthest along.”
In their research, the team took PET scans of primates while they sampled their arterial blood. Unlike other tracers or MRI scans, [18F]3F4AP showed one of the four primates had sustained a brain injury at some previous point in time.
“We were not looking for that. It was a good surprise because it showed that the tracer is very sensitive to that type of injury,” Brugarolas said.
Tonny Veenith, a consultant in neurointensive care medicine at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, said [18F]3F4AP would provide “an amazing way to look at neuroinflammation.” Veenith said he believes [18F]3F4AP is unique in part due to its long half-life compared to common tracers.
“It would allow you to quantify new therapeutic options,” he said. “You could give the drug and sequentially image people and see if things are getting better or not.”
The United States Food and Drug Administration recently authorized an Investigational New Drug application for [18F]3F4AP. The tracer is now on track to receive approval for use in select clinical studies.
“We should be able to start doing human studies in a few weeks,” Brugarolas said.

A team of psychologists and primatologists affiliated with Harvard’s department of Human Evolutionary Biology published a study Oct. 23 suggesting that social selectivity among non-human animals increases with age.
The study, published in Science, used more than 20 years of data collected by the Kibale Chimpanzee Project in Uganda to analyze the social interactions of male chimpanzees between the ages of 15 and 58.
The authors found that older chimpanzees were more selective in their friendships than their youthful counterparts. Older chimpanzees were also more likely to have “mutual relationships” reciprocated by both parties than younger chimpanzees.
Anthropology professor Richard W. Wrangham said he and his co-authors relied on measures including grooming patterns, physical closeness, and time spent together to determine whether chimpanzees had a mutual relationship.
“In any species that grooms, it is being shown repeatedly that the act of grooming is a very good measure of affiliate relationships or friendships,” Wrangham said.
He also said the close evolutionary link between humans and chimpanzees makes the results directly relevant to human psychology. Wrangham founded the Kibale Chimpanzee Project in 1987 with the goal of learning more about human behavior and ecology through the study of chimps.
“We actually know more about chimpanzees because we can follow them about the place and get regular data — from day to day, from hour to hour — in a way you can’t do with humans,” Wrangham said. “It would be too intrusive.”
“It’s an extraordinary irony, difficult as chimpanzees are to observe, we can be more systematic in our observations of them than in our observations of humans,” he said.
Alexandra G. Rosati ’05 — a professor at the University of Michigan who co-authored the study — said its results could provide “a new model for thinking about what it means to successfully age.”
Likewise, Wrangham said the results could offer humans a baseline to understand the “normal and characteristic” features of aging, like a “contracting” social circle.
“If we understand the typical course of aging and its effects on social behavior, then we can advise people when something is going wrong,” he said.

As Harvard students brace for an unconventional Election Day, several undergraduate courses have announced altered schedules, including non-mandatory attendance on Tuesday, cancelled lectures, and postponed assignment deadlines.
In an email to students in Statistics 110: “Probability,” Statistics professor Joseph K. Blitzstein wrote that he would not mandate any participation on Election Day.
“I think that Election Day (next Tuesday) should be both a national holiday and a Harvard holiday. Unfortunately, it is neither,” Blitzstein wrote. “I don't think it makes sense to cancel class unilaterally, but I will exempt you from all participation/attendance expectations for the day, for both lecture and sections.”
Anthropology professor Ieva Jusionyte said she cancelled the lecture for Anthropology 1610: “Ethnographic Research Methods” on Tuesday in order to give students more time to vote.
“I’ve talked to students who have been waiting in long lines to cast a ballot early, others have not received their voting documents. So people are in very different situations and are very stressed,” Jusionyte said. “I wanted to have this open policy so they really focus on voting and helping others vote and being there for their family and the community.”
Jusionyte said she would also be providing resources and assignment flexibility following the election.
“There’s a lot of concern about the students’ well-being, and thinking about what kind of support faculty can provide — in terms of flexibility with course assignments or sharing resources that would be available for the students, or making themselves available for conversations both before the election, but also the following days,” Jusionyte said.
Other courses are also altering assignments and lectures immediately following the election. Education lecturer Katherine K. Merseth wrote in an email to Gen Ed 1076: “Equity and Excellence in K12 American Schools” students that the live lecture for Wednesday, Nov. 4, will be replaced with a mandatory pre-recorded lecture.
Similarly, David Freund, preceptor for Math 21b: “Linear Algebra and Differential Equations,” wrote to students that all sections on Nov. 4 would be cancelled and assignment deadlines would be postponed two days.
The changes to individual courses come after a student-organized petition calling on the University to designate Election Day as a school-wide holiday drew over 1,250 signatures this fall. University President Lawrence S. Bacow told The Crimson earlier this month that Harvard has “taken a number of steps” to ensure that affiliates are able to vote, but maintained that he felt “comfortable” with the University’s stance to not designate Election Day a holiday.
Kylie M. Simms ’23, a student in both Stat 110 and Math 21b, said she appreciates the changes Blitzstein made, but noted that students could still face burdens if they have been unable to vote early.
“If we don’t go on Tuesday, then we have to make it up later in the week, which is a burden alongside other classes,” she said of the Stat 110 changes. “But I do appreciate the effort in making it so we can focus on other things on Tuesday.”
Simms also said she would appreciate further support from the University for Election Day.
“I think there definitely should be a lot more institutional support for Election Day in general,” she said. “If we have to attend classes on Election Day rather than wait in lines to vote, that could inhibit our ability to fulfill our civic duty.”

Cambridge resident Angela B. Perrigo is all too familiar with cyber fraud.
For the past two years, Perrigo said she has periodically received robocalls reporting suspicious activity using her social security number and telling her it will be suspended unless she returns their call.
If she doesn’t recognize the number, Perrigo said she no longer picks up her phone. But she hasn’t always hung up — in 2013, Perrigo, 56, said she was lured by a man she met on the dating site Tagged into wiring thousands of dollars.
“I thought I met this guy…who claimed he was in the army. And we spoke for about three to six months, and then he asked me, could I send him money to get him home on leave,” she said.
“Stupid and lonely and wanting to find that special someone, yes, I wired this person probably about $2,000 in a matter of time,” she said. “Then I was like — I just started realizing — no, it’s a scam.”
Perrigo is far from the only Cambridge resident who has been targeted by cybercriminals.
Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, hundreds of Cambridge residents have had their personally identifiable information used to fraudulently claim unemployment benefits as part of a broader national scheme. The potentially compromised information includes social security numbers, bank account passwords, and credit card numbers.
Roughly 500 Cambridge residents have reported to the Cambridge Police Department since March that their personal information was used to file claims of unemployment benefits with the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
CPD saw a spike in reports of identity fraud during the month of October. From Oct. 19 to Oct. 29, roughly 150 residents reported they were the victim of identity theft, per the department’s daily crime logs. In many cases, people who had not been laid off said their employer told them someone had used their personal information to file for unemployment.
Cambridge residents — including Harvard employees — are among many people nationwide who have been targeted by the scam, which federal authorities believe foreign cybercriminals planned. United States Secret Service investigators suspect a “well-organized Nigerian fraud ring” set the operation in motion, according to reporting by The New York Times. The scheme has cost states hundreds of millions of dollars in payments intended to benefit Americans who are out of work and as a result has delayed the rate at which states distribute benefits to those in need.
Though CPD has not yet analyzed victims’ demographics, Warnick said the cyber scam can target anyone.
“This is something that can victimize anyone just due to the nature of high unemployment in the state and in large part because of COVID,” he said.
Spikes in unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic have provided an opportune moment for criminals who traffic in personal information to profit, according to cybersecurity experts.
States’ efforts to swiftly dispense benefits to out-of-work residents left them unprepared to catch fraudsters in the act, explained Jason I. Hong, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
“Unemployment benefits offer a new opportunity to do the same kind of attack. Having everything be digital (e.g. application for unemployment and bank wiring) also makes things easier,” Hong wrote in an email. “COVID claims [are] somewhat unique in terms of its scale and how quickly it had to be rolled out, making it harder for [government] agencies to put checks into place.”
Former National Security Agency official Terry L. Thompson said cybercriminals buy and sell stolen personal information — that can then be used to file for benefits or make purchases — on the dark web, a part of the internet that requires specific authorization and is often used for illicit transactions.
“Personally identifiable information being stolen — that goes on all the time. And it’s for sale on the dark web in these various marketplaces for not too much money,” said Thompson, now a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University. “Filing an unemployment claim by taking information that has been stolen through some other data breach along the way is pretty low-hanging fruit for these cyber criminals.”
“They’re not stupid,” he added. “They’re very sophisticated and they use a lot of interesting tools.”
Cybercriminals overseas have successfully extracted Americans’ data for the past 20 years, according to Thompson.
“There’s no shortage of people in countries that take the easy way out in terms of cybercrime,” he said. “And Americans — I hate to say this — but Americans are just — we’re such easy targets because we’re quite gullible.”
Even before this year’s economic downturn, cyber fraud was rising. Thompson cited a 2019 internet crime report published by the FBI’s Crime Complaint Center that revealed a steady increase in internet crime complaints over the past five years.
Overall, from 2015 to 2019, the FBI took nearly two million reports of online criminal activity that totaled $10.2 billion in losses for victims. In 2019, Massachusetts was one of ten states whose residents reported more than $75 million in losses due to cyber crime.
The fraudulent unemployment scheme is merely the latest in an onslaught of cyber fraud operations that have targeted Americans, including Cambridge residents.
Since she fell for the romance scam seven years ago, Perrigo has become more vigilant.
In 2014, she received a phone call claiming Perrigo was going to be arrested for allegedly stealing from Walmart unless she provided them her checking account information. This time, she didn’t take the bait.
A few years ago, Perrigo said she discovered that roughly $1,000 in Uber fees was fraudulently charged to her bank account. She said she contacted CPD and her bank, eventually recouping the money.
“It’s so easy for somebody to get your information,” she said. “You don’t know if they’re finding out where you’re living.”
Thompson, the cybersecurity expert, said individuals should practice “good cyber hygiene,” including frequently changing their passwords, installing software system updates on their devices, and ignoring suspicious messages.
In response to the recent spate of local fraud cases, CPD published a step-by-step guide encouraging victims to file a police report, change all of their passwords, and notify financial institutions — including credit card companies and banks — where they do business.
During the current economic downturn, Americans’ need for benefits and cybercriminals’ scams have dovetailed.
Due to spikes in illegitimate unemployment claims, the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance began requiring claimants to provide additional verification of identity this summer. As a result, recipients of benefits could expect delays.
“It is unfortunate that because of this criminal activity, people who really need our support may face delays in receiving the benefits they need,” Massachusetts Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Rosalin Acosta said in a press release announcing the change.
At times, those delays had severe consequences.
Carl J. Diggs, who lives in Cambridge, said the state took roughly five months to process his claim for unemployment benefits.
During that time, Diggs, 32, who contracts for DoorDash and Uber Eats and qualifies for pandemic unemployment assistance as a independent contractor under the CARES Act, said he struggled to earn a sufficient living through food deliveries. Even as social distancing measures kept people at home, Diggs said he was making fewer deliveries each week.
“I went from making almost like four or five hundred for a week, to not even, you know, barely 200 for the week,” he said.
Though he frequently contacted state agencies and elected officials’ offices for help, he still went months without receiving benefits. Diggs said he had to move in with family members because he could not afford his own housing. In August, the government deposited the benefits, with backpay, into his bank account.
“I’ve been reaching out to friends and family and, you know, every day just calling these people and trying to stay on it,” he said. “Until the day that they actually fixed it and it actually came back into place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Applicants to Harvard’s Class of 2025 have to reckon with an ongoing pandemic that has limited access to standardized testing, disrupted extracurriculars, and for many, severely altered their senior year of high school.
Less than two weeks after the College evicted most students from on-campus housing in March, the admissions department issued guidance to then-high school juniors that they would not be penalized for failing to submit Advanced Placement and SAT subject test scores.
In light of increased testing site closures across the country and test cancellations, Harvard’s admissions office updated its guidance in June and announced that they would not require Class of 2025 applicants to submit any standardized test scores to be considered for admission. Since then, every Ivy League institution has adopted test-optional policies for this year’s admissions cycle.
With the college application season in full swing during an ongoing pandemic, high school seniors applying to the Class of 2025 still said they feel uncertain and concerned about these revised policies for the next Harvard application cycle and their admissions prospects.
The pandemic has limited high school seniors opportunities’ to explore colleges and forced others to shift their priorities when deciding on their home for the next four years. Many missed the opportunity to tour college options in-person.
Former University of Virginia admissions officer and college consultant Parke Muth, said remote versions of exploring campus offer a very different experience to prospective students.
“During the spring and summer and fall, typically, the tour groups are packed with families and students coming on campus to get a feel for the school. Now, there are online, remote tours and information sessions,” Muth said. “That’s a big difference.”
For some applicants, however, gauging if they would fit at Harvard came only from pre-pandemic experiences. Ricky Andrade, a Key Biscayne, Fla. native and high school senior planning to apply early action to the College, said he was fortunate to have gotten a chance to see campus for himself before application season.
“I'm lucky that my sister went, because that means I went to Harvard and I had a sense of the community, which is something that I can't say — for not only other people who are going to apply to Harvard — but for myself with other schools,” Andrade said. “There's no replacement for being there in person.”
Others like Erica S. Choe, a high school senior from Fort Lee, N.J. who anticipates applying to Harvard during the regular decision round, said the pandemic forced her to reconsider where she wants to attend.
“Distance has never been a factor until the pandemic hit. Now, I'm more cognizant of it. So, due to that, I've taken some [University of California] schools off my list,” Choe said. “California was sort of a pro for me, but now geographical location has fallen down my list of priorities and factors for when I'm considering a school.”
At the same time, Choe said she believes the pandemic’s economic impact has made her weigh factors like cost of attendance and financial aid more heavily than she previously did.
“Financial accessibility and what they can give me in terms of financial aid has risen a lot, because my family took a really hard hit due to the pandemic in terms of our family business,” she said.
Despite colleges’ efforts at flexibility, some high school seniors say they are still stressed about their test scores and how to best showcase disrupted summer activities and extracurriculars in their applications.
With the College’s decision to become test-optional for this year’s application cycle, some applicants said they had to consider whether or not to submit their scores. Andrade said he plans to submit his test scores but felt conflicted about his choice.
“I was planning on retaking the ACT. At the end of the day, I decided that the score I had was good enough that I didn't need to take it again and so I was satisfied with it,” Andrade said. “But, I remember that I was really scared for a long time, thinking, ‘What if it's not good enough? What if I do need to take it again?’ It took months of talking it over with my counselor and my parents to decide.”
Choe said she was unhappy with the administration of Advanced Placement tests this past spring, given her lack of access to quality Wi-Fi.
“I ended up getting a score I wasn't really happy with and I don't think would have been representative of my score if we just took it in a normal setting,” Choe said.
Zak M. Harris, a former director of admission at Regis College who now works with consulting group InGenius Prep, said students and their families should not see testing as an “end-all, be-all.”
“When I was advocating for students, it never came down to, well, this kid has a 1540, and this kid has like a 1480,” Harris said of his time in admissions. “The decisions that are being made are about people, community, personality fit.”
Besides standardized testing, the pandemic has also hampered many prospective applicants’ summertime opportunities and extracurriculars.
Jessica J. Lee, a Leonia, N.J. resident who said she would apply to Harvard during the early action round, lamented the loss of her senior soccer season, which was cancelled two weeks ago. Lee also said that her summertime position at the Research Science Institute was not as fulfilling of an experience in a virtual format.
Kelvin Kuang, a prospective applicant from Washington, D.C., said the pandemic dramatically altered his summer plans and extracurricular participation.
“My parents found themselves without work, so I, and my siblings, decided to go out and try to find jobs,” Kuang said. “I've been working a job since the start of this pandemic.”
Kuang also said he lost a research position at an MIT summer program that was cancelled due to the pandemic.
Many applicants to the Class of 2025 and application consultants are speculating about the pandemic’s short-term implications on college admissions.
At least 340 students representing more than 20 percent of the Class of 2024 have deferred enrollment, a significant hike from the 90 to 130 students who do so in a typical year, according to the College’s website.
Andrade said he believes the number of students who deferred enrollment to the Class of 2025 may have a negative effect on his and other applicants’ prospects of admission.
“I had thought about it a lot, but it has been far from my mind — maybe intentionally — recently,” Andrade said. “Those chances are going to be lower, like it or not. There's not much you can do. You can’t make space out of nowhere.”
After Harvard announced in July that freshmen were the only full class invited to campus for the fall, Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 said the College was “aware” of the housing strain that might result from students who will be returning from leaves of absence in future semesters.
Bay Area-based admissions test expert Jay R. Rosner said he is also worried that many high schools’ adoption of emergency, no-harm grading standards may increase pressure on those applying in the next few years.
“We now have these grade impacts on the last year. That turns out to be a pretty major impact,” Rosner said. “For the most part, we're getting less information, and it then redounds to the students to try to be a little bit more creative, to generate other projects or endeavors that they can write about and show to colleges to give them more information.”
College admissions experts said they believe that the pandemic’s impact on the application process is still unknown but will likely spur change in the long-run. The pandemic, for instance, placed a spotlight on the role of standardized testing in higher education admissions.
Harris said he thinks an increased abandonment of standardized testing by colleges is a natural result of pre-pandemic efforts to drop testing requirements.
“There are many schools out there of a high caliber that have been test-optional for a very long time, and their students are having great success and going off to do incredible things in and outside of college,” Harris said. “So I think it'll be very interesting for me to see what testing looks like in two,three, five years and if it still has the stranglehold that it has now on this entire process.”
Still, despite changes to standardized testing, Rosner said he believes other aspects of the college application could return to normal with time.
“As the impact of COVID recedes, the nature of grades and extracurriculars will come back to their pre-COVID resonance,” Rosner said. “You'll have the deeper and broader information from grades. The admissions officers will have extracurricular activities to weigh and assess.”'
In the meantime, Muth said these greater uncertainties in testing and admissions overall can overly burden those who are navigating applications on their own.
“There are just so many moving parts and unknowns right now,” Muth said. “If you don't have someone who has the time to just talk you through some of that, whether it's a counselor, a mentor, a friend, whatever, it just feels to me harder and more stressful than ever.”

If you got… 
Mostly As: Social Butterfly 
You’re the type to schedule Among Us games and make PowerPoints for your friend’s birthday. On campus, you’d be running from coffee dates to class and then back to coffee dates. Online, you still haven’t given up on your social life despite the fact that only one person opened your messages in the group chat. But hey, we admire your grit and commitment to your friendships!
Mostly Bs: Ok, Zoomer
Perhaps your friends and acquaintances are scattered throughout the globe or have wildly incompatible schedules; regardless, you schedule individual Zoom calls to keep in touch, which is so caring, but it must get exhausting to explain the story of your hell week over and over again. You may be running on exclusively black iced coffee and a healthy dose of midterm-induced anxiety, but you’re living the life. Hopefully.
Mostly Cs: Visual Processor
In your eyes, sending memes conveys more feeling than daily texts or an elaborate love letter — it involves paying attention to what people like, and reminds them that you think about them even when you’re scrolling through Instagram. What higher love exists than sending someone a TikTok that will make them laugh, or a meme you know that they specifically will appreciate?
Mostly Ds: The Ghost on Among Us
You have vanished into the unknown, and your friends wonder whether they will ever see you again! You might not mean to ghost people, but maybe you are having the time of your life (or are at rock bottom. Either works).
