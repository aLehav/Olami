After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Eleganza 2008, student models crawled down the runway striking animalistic poses in what organizers described as the hottest, most notorious show on campus. A group of mostly black males with toned bodies followed. They battled it out for king of the land, clad in loincloths that left little to the imagination. For some wide-eyed prospective students, this was the first glimpse of Harvard’s student life, while other, more seasoned students were well prepared for the onslaught of provocative images Eleganza habitually provides.In past years, the student-run fashion show and facet of Harvard Black Community and Student Theater (BlackCAST) has received criticism for this problematic portrayal of black sexuality. Yet, organizers of Eleganza 2009 refuse to be hindered by what they claim to be simple misunderstandings. Instead, Eleganza has decided to tackle even more sensitive and poignant issues. This year, the show will branch out in an attempt to include a positive representation of varying sexual orientations alongside its previous goals of racial diversity and body acceptance. However, some members of the Harvard community worry that the controversial show might again mishandle such sensitive and complex issues in its primary ambition to entertain. A TENUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH BLACKCASTEver since its inception 15 years ago, Eleganza has implored students to “walk the runway, redefine beauty, and change a life.” The fashion show was originally founded by Harvard’s BlackCAST, a student organization which, according to its constitution, “aims to stimulate interest and support in black theater on the Harvard campus and the immediate community.” Though the Eleganza board is selected through the BlackCAST election process, their involvement with the group has become increasingly nebulous. “The past couple years the show has kind of been separate from BlackCAST,” says current BlackCAST president Camille I. Mason ’11. “I know past presidents considered letting Eleganza just become independent.”As the show skirts the line between fashion show and entertainment production in a manner some have deemed tasteless, it remains uncertain how successfully Eleganza promotes the integration of diverse traditions and cultures into the arts—a mission it allegedly shares with BlackCAST.There is some worry that Eleganza has placed too much focus on scantily clad models and provocative dancing and too little on being a celebration of the black community’s music and fashion. “Over time, there has been a misalignment between Eleganza and BlackCAST,” says Christian I.C. Strong ’09, former BlackCAST co-president. “Originally Eleganza was a means to put African Americans on stage and present them in a positive light. In past years, other board members and I have seen that there is discrepancy between that and what we see onstage. It’s not something that past board members thought really represented BlackCAST. ”But Mason deems the relationship between the two organizations unproblematic, though she acknowledges that in the past Eleganza used to be more about hip-hop and a celebration of black culture. Mason says that in addition to putting black models on stage Eleganza provides the opportunity for people in BlackCAST to become involved in different capacities, including the more technical side such as set building and lighting. “As far as I’m concerned it’s still aligned with BlackCAST’s mission,” Mason says. “Theatre and fashion might be two different worlds but there is a lot of overlap.LOINCLOTHS ON THE CATWALKDespite Mason’s disregard of the criticism leveled at Eleganza concerning its allegedly stereotypical depiction of black sexuality, members of the Harvard community continue to question the images the show presents. In past years, models have strutted down the Eleganza catwalk wearing little more than rose petals, provoking discussions regarding the objectification of women. But even as organizers attempt to cover the models up, some still question the legitimacy of a fashion show where clothes seem not to be the main attraction. “It’s clinging on to the last strand it can to be able to call it a fashion show,” says Nathan P. Whitfield ’10, a student in Black Students Association who had previously expressed qualms with Eleganza after last year’s show. “I don’t expect them to be couture, not at all. It’s a college fashion show; they are going to cater to their audience. But a loincloth isn’t fashion—it’s purely entertainment,” Whitfield says. In an open letter to the BSA and the Association of Black Harvard Women last year, Lowell House tutor Cameron Van Patterson expressed concern and prompted discussion amongst the black community regarding the show’s portrayal of black sexuality, stereotypes, and a departure from what Eleganza claimed to be—a fashion show. “I was disturbed and disappointed by a portion of the show that featured students, many of whom are African American men, acting in animalistic ways that reproduce essentialist stereotypes about black male sexuality,” wrote Patterson, referring to the scene he called “King of the Jungle.” “This aspect of the show left me wondering what was elegant or even alluring about this atavistic display of primitivism. Would such a performance be possible apart from the history and visual discourse of colonialism that gives it a certain currency?” Former scene director Nicholas J. Navarro ’10 did not expect nor intend to incite the negative responses that the scene provoked. Instead of a racially charged image of black male sexuality, he envisioned the segment to be a theatrical representation of the planet on a fashion runway. “It’s hard to prevent misinterpretations of what’s trying to be an empowering production because there are a lot of different ways in which people can interpret art,” Navarro says. “Eleganza is art in a dynamic form but it is ultimately up to the individual to interpret the production. You can’t create a bullet-proof plan to prevent people to misinterpret our ideas.”This year Navarro has stepped into the role of executive producer alongside Denetrias J. Charlemagne ’11 and Alexandra N. Alves ’11. He hopes to further build the diverse community he claims Eleganza creates. “At any school there is de facto segregation and exclusivity,” Navarro says. “It is important to promote a community of acceptance and diversity, and that’s what Eleganza does.”MODELING SEXUAL ORIENTATIONThis year, the organizers of Eleganza hope to expand their mission of promoting diversity in the arts by addressing the issue of homosexuality. The 2009 show is funded in part by a grant received from The Open Gate Foundation, managed by the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus. The criterion for the grant’s award is rather open-ended, stating simply that it must go towards supporting student, faculty, and employee groups that further a climate of open discussion on issues related to sexual orientation.According to Navarro, the show’s proposal laid out three ways it hopes to accomplish the grant’s requirement that it promote open debate about issues of sexuality. Throughout the theatrical narrative that accompanies three scenes—Dream, Nightmare, and Awake—the 2009 production team plans to incorporate allusions to the BGLT community. “Essentially by incorporating contradicting gender normatives and gender reversal roles, and possibly a drag character in the show, [Eleganza] would stimulate discussion,” Navarro says. Although Navarro insists that nothing is certain, scene director Kia J. McLeod ’10 says that in an “Alice in Wonderland”-inspired dream world the Queen of Hearts character will be in drag. The grant proposal also indicated that the set will feature elements of the gay and lesbian community such as a prominently displayed rainbow. “All of Eleganza’s audience will know we are supporting the BGLT initiative and the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus,” says Navarro, who also notes that producers hope to meet with members of BGLTSA before finalizing their choices. Despite these indications of the show’s support of sexual diversity, Eleganza will not include any overt references to gay and/or lesbian couples or outright displays of intimacy. “They aren’t going to be holding hands or kissing each other,” Navarro says. “But we want to show that it is okay for two men to be intimate with each other.”CELEBRATION OR CARICATURE?In a fashion show where a diverse audience is responsible for interpreting a rapid series of thought-provoking images, it’s a difficult task to generate the complex representation that an issue such as sexual identity seems to require. “It’s easy to take a stereotype and turn it into a commodified tool that is bite-sized and easy to digest rather than necessarily challenge the standard notions people have,” says Caroline Light, lecturer and director of studies in the Women, Gender and Sexuality department. “It’s a tough question: how do we incorporate everyone and not just treat everyone like little commodified pieces of diversity, particularly when it comes to representations of the gay and lesbian community?”Light, who has never seen the fashion show, believes that the image of a drag queen might be particularly problematic. She suggests that the use of more sexual ambiguous models might be a more effective way of inciting constructive conversation. “It’s a particular, commodified image of gayness,” she says. “There is something about drag queens in the popular imagination that runs the risk of becoming a sort of comedic thing to parody femininity and it’s not really about serious difference.” Timothy McCarthy ’93, a lecturer in the History and Literature department, echoes this sentiment and warns that organizers will have to handle the issue of sexuality in a sensitive manner. “Obviously, the inclusion of a few rainbow flags and a drag queen does not necessarily guarantee either sensitivity or representational equality,” McCarthy writes in an email. “But I am hopeful that the producers will think carefully about how to represent diversity so that this year’s Eleganza is a celebration rather than a caricature.”LIGHTEN UP, IT’S JUST FASHIONIn a show that straddles the line between pure entertainment and artistic expression, Eleganza organizers struggle to strike a balance between pleasing the crowd and appeasing the critics. “Eleganza walks a fine line between being a show that is very appealing to an artistic world and being very appealing to a mass general audience,” McLeod admits. “But as a director I want to tiptoe that line. I want to bring an artistic vision but also appeal to audiences.”This desire to be an entertaining spectacle spurs the tendency to include images that have been interpreted as troubling and offensive. “It’s hard because that’s what people find entertaining,” Mason says. Whitfield, who reiterated the concerns Van Patterson voiced in his letter, calls on organizers to think more extensively about the images they choose to represent. Whitfield also argues that the fact that Eleganza is a fashion show does not preclude it from in-depth scrutiny or exculpate organizers from responsibility. “People simply dismissed it as a fashion show,” Whitfield says. “But [organizers] are responsible for the images that [they] provide for someone. They need to be very aware of their control.”However Mason, who in her role as BlackCAST president also acts as an unofficial liason to Eleganza, dismisses concerns about its problematic portrayals as too weighty for a light-hearted fashion show. “A little bit of controversy isn’t bad. I wish I could just shake people and tell them to stop taking things so seriously.”                                                        —Staff writer Erika P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard often boasts of its remarkably diverse environment, with the number of student groups dedicated to promoting the history and traditions of a certain culture rising rapidly in recent years. However, according to the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, many students may find it difficult to appreciate this diversity given the sheer number of performances and events that groups sponsor. On February 28, the Harvard Foundation seeks to address this lack of cultural diffusion on campus with its 24th annual presentation of Cultural Rhythms, a production that brings together many of these groups in a display of their artistic and ethnic vibrancy.
The increasing variety of Cultural Rhythms has paralleled Harvard’s growing diversity. Yet through the quarter century of the event’s existence, certain groups, such as the Kuumba Singers and the Harvard Intertribal Indian dance troupe, have remained a constant presence.




This year, the Harvard Foundation honors celebrity guest comedian Dan Aykroyd, original cast member of “Saturday Night Live” and the co-creator of the Blues Brothers. “We admire Dan Aykroyd for his development of the House of Blues and his contribution to making sure that African American music and blues are things that people are made aware of,” says Jacqueline C. Hairston ’10, co-director of the afternoon show.
According to the Harvard Foundation, the choice of Aykroyd as celebrity guest helps to achieve the two major goals of Cultural Rhythms. “The show’s aim is showcasing diversity by putting Harvard performing groups on a big stage where students and those in the Boston area unable to attend smaller shows can see them,” says Hairston. However, the Harvard Foundation also hopes to provide entertainment to students and the general community with this production. “We’re going to keep this show consistently fun and funny,” says Jarell L. Lee ’10, student co-host of the evening show.
The Harvard Foundation also considered the importance of combining entertainment with diversity in its selection of student emcees. Hairston and her co-director, Nworah B. Ayogu ’10—who have both been involved in Cultural Rhythms for the last three years—say that the Foundation chose student hosts based on their charisma and involvement in promoting cultural pluralism at Harvard and in the local community. Lee, for example, is Executive Director of the Boston Black Student Network, an organization that facilitates dialogue and exchange between member groups at 45 colleges and universities in the area.
This year’s Cultural Rhythms will feature a wide range of genres and styles, says Lee, including Clint Miller’s blues and bluegrass songs, Corcairdhearg’s Irish dance, and the Harvard Breakers’ street dance. “We’ve practised for about a month and a half... Our five minute performance is actually three routines combined into one. The routines are pretty different; while it’s mainly hip-hop choreography, one is much slower, set to a piano and with more fluid motion. We have this more distinct movement in there because we want to vary it up,” says Erfan Soliman ’12, a member of the Breakers, who are participating in Cultural Rhythms for their second year.
The directors and the Harvard Foundation have worked hard to ensure that this year’s show contains several new elements: this Cultural Rhythms will be the first to feature music from Lithuania, as well as dance from Ukraine. “We’ve never had performers this prepared, creative, and this talented,” Ayogu says regarding the lineup.
This is also the first year that the Harvard Foundation has organized an after party, which will be open to all Harvard students in the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub. In addition, the organizers have arranged a food festival in the Science Center which will take place between the afternoon and evening shows. Many of the performing student groups will present ethnic food.
Cultural Rhythms will be both an impressive cultural exhibition and an all-around entertaining experience. “This year’s show is bigger and better than it’s ever been before,” Ayogu says.

Dear bagel scoopers, Brain Break crumb eaters, steamed broccoli mound-makers: This column is for you. If you’ve used the excuse, “I already had a huge lunch,” to get out of a meal; if you’ve made arbitrary food rules (no meat from now on, a glass of water before for every meal); if you eat uncontrollably during reading period, then this column is for you, too. Still don’t see yourself yet? Hold on. If you’ve heard the euphemism, “He’s weird about food” or “She’s disappeared,” or if you sensed a little something extra behind your friend’s I’m-too-fat joke, then this is for you, too.Disordered eating is a serious and rampant problem, far more common than full-fledged eating disorders and far less understood or diagnosed. It is an unhealthy relationship with food, often characterized by an obsession with nutrition, constant dieting and perpetual dissatisfaction with body image. You’ve seen or have been victim to its various incarnations—obsessively going to the gym, binging at the dessert table, constantly strategizing about caloric intake, absurd one-fruit-an-hour diets, screensavers that say, “Diet or die,” Facebook notes that cry out for help, a sudden and inexplicable switch to veganism, etc. While anorexia is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual as failure to maintain body weight within 85% of expected, disordered eating has no such quantitative criteria, falling into the catch-all category “EDNOS,” or Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified. A study conducted in 2008 by Self Magazine in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill estimates that one in 10 women between the ages of 25-45 suffer from eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia, while a total of three in four suffer from disordered eating. Other studies suggest, unsurprisingly, that the rates are even higher among college students. I’ll be honest. Disordered eating is not lethal. It is not recognized as an official psychiatric disorder. And it is highly correlated with perfectionism, the single trait that best characterizes Harvard students. But this doesn’t mean that suffering from this condition is inevitable or without consequence. It took me years to realize that even if something wasn’t fatal, it could still be a far cry from innocuous. The real cost of disordered eating isn’t the fact that it can progress into a full-fledged eating disorder but the immense mental space and psychic energy wasted on obsessing about food. We’re anal about enough things in life. Wouldn’t it be nice to have one less thing to be neurotic about?On a national level, there’s an unforgivable silence about this issue. This week is National Eating Disorder week and I’m afraid the topic still isn’t getting its due. On the National Eating Disorder Association’s website, there’s not a single mention of disordered eating in the way I’ve described it here. I called their press-inquiry helpline to ask why. Their well-meaning attendant replied, “Uhm. I have some statistics about eating disorders and a study about anorexia, if that’ll help you.” So if it’s such a widespread issue, why has it gone under the radar for so long? Disordered eating, without clearly established criteria, falls somewhere in the middle of a slippery slope from normal to abnormal. It’s a fuzzy line between caring about what you put into your body and being neurotic about food. As a result, it’s easier to retreat into silence than to press the issue. It also remains a private battle because the national reluctance to address this condition reflects the individual’s reluctance to talk about it. Trust me, I’ve been on both sides and I like writing about it probably as much as you like reading about it. In high school, under the pretense of being healthy, I learned everything there was to know about food. I knew, for example, that drinking cold water burns more calories than drinking room-temperature water. By senior year of high school, food had become as much a game of calculations as an enjoyable sensory experience. This is something that needs to be brought to light. I know this is far less fun than my usual ode to sandwiches, but it is the other side of the same fascination with food. Just like you can’t talk about the genius of Math 55-ers without mentioning Asperger’s occasionally, it would be irresponsible to fixate on sandwiches and not address the darker side of this obsession. Disordered eating is the white elephant in a room full of foodies. In college, separated from my manorexic boyfriend and my modelesque friends, I finally realized how unnecessary my neurotic pattern of behavior toward food was. I stepped back and realized the absurdity of equating liberation from unhealthy food habits with letting myself go. Once I started devoting my mind to more important things, food slowly returned to what it once had been: delicious. And I became happier and infinitely more relaxed. Now it’s your turn. You need to realize disordered eating is not an inevitable way of life. Stop letting it silently slip by because it’s not lethal. There are plenty of resources for you: ECHO offers a great peer to peer counseling service, the Bureau of Study Council has discussion groups and UHS has nutritionists. But none of that will help until you acknowledge that you want to change your attitude toward food. It’s not like flipping a light switch; it won’t be easy. But have the courage to get up, speak up and seek help. Believe me, your mind is much too special to be wasted on counting calories.                                   —Columnist Rebecca A. Cooper can be reached at cooper3@fas.harvard.edu.

Juana Molina’s music might be best classified as electro-folk-acoustic-world-ambient-avant-garde—which is to say that any attempt to categorize the Argentine singer’s style is nearly  impossible. A more effective approach to her performance at the Brattle Theatre yesterday would be to think of entering a parallel universe where randomness provides the only order to bird calls, electronic rhythms, and hauntingly dissonant harmonies. Don’t try to understand—the music resists interpretation and relies on enigma. Molina, whose lyrics are mostly in Spanish, subscribes to a philosophy of chance. She maintains that sometimes not understanding can be the most rewarding musical experience. “I don’t think lyrics really matter,” Molina says. “Sometimes I really like not understanding the lyrics of musicians, because that makes you able to go for a more abstract ride than if I’m telling you something specific.”“Music is a universal language...I grew up listening to music in English and not understanding one word,” says the singer. It would be difficult to emphasize lyrics when the musical space Molina creates is so heavily saturated with an array of eclectic sounds. The singer plays guitar and several keyboards, running the sounds through a pedal to loop one instrument over the next and layering synthesized percussive elements and vocal harmonies on top of everything. Though Molina is traditionally a solo act, this U.S. tour features the singer’s trio, which includes a bassist and drummer to develop the lower registers of Molina’s songs, balancing her breathy, ethereal voice. “My goal was to have more bottom end and a thicker bass,” Molina says.Molina’s history is as rich as her music; the daughter of the famed tango singer Horacio Molina, she spent several years in Paris after her family fled the Argentine military coup of 1976. Upon her return to South America, she began a career in television, starring in two popular Argentine series and releasing her first album, “Rara” (or “Strange”) before leaving for Los Angeles to exclusively pursue music. “The day I realized I was going to die without doing [music], I started working hard to be able to perform in front of people.”After a slow start and her subsequent move to L.A., Molina’s music began to garner international attention with her second album, fittingly titled “Segundo,” which was released in the U.S. in 2003. “Segundo” represented the singer’s foray into the world of electronica, and the response was overwhelmingly positive; Entertainment Weekly named it Best World Music Album of 2003. On Thursday, the artist performed songs mostly from her two latest albums, “Tres Cosas” and “Son,” released in the U.S. on UK-based label Domino records in 2004 and 2006, respectively. On “Son,” her most recent release, Molina takes inspiration from Argentina’s national bird, the hornero, integrating its playful and melodic calls as a motif in her compositions. But her interest in the acoustics of nature has more to do with the element of chance involved in sound production than with nature itself. “Actually, what I’m interested in is the behavior in the sounds of nature rather than the sounds themselves,” Molina says. “You can recognize what the sounds mean because they have a mode and way of singing, but you don’t know what they are going to do, because they have a completely random sequence of notes that are just there accompanying the song.”In many ways, Molina’s music draws on nature’s random order. “I improvise on structures that I already know,” the singer says of her performances. “I sometimes make loose notes on something, and then I play a stiff rhythm—one thing that goes rhythmically and one that is very loose. That way, they will never be at the same place at the end of a measure.” While we are still at Harvard after Juana Molina’s performance at the Brattle Theatre, listening to her music can, even if only for a short while, transport us to her vast musical playground.

As a composer, conductor, and classical music commentator, Rob Kapilow truly knows classical music—from its creation to its presentation to its reception by the general public. The National Public Radio veteran and former Yale music professor has dedicated his career to attuning the untrained ear to the pleasures of classical music. He recently sat down with The Harvard Crimson to discuss his efforts to make classical music accessible to all. His upcoming performance of the Dr. Seuss adaptation “Green Eggs and Hamadeus,” a children’s musical, takes place February 28 at the Tsai Auditorium.The Harvard Crimson: Many people complain that they feel distanced from classical music, yet music is a powerful communicator. What do you think is lost in translation? What can be done to strengthen the communication between the composer, performers, and audience members?Rob Kapilow: The fact that so much is lost in translation is at the heart of why I wrote the book “All You Have to do Is Listen: Music from the Inside Out.” My entire life’s work has been an attempt to be a translator between something that seems to be lost in translation but is actually much closer than you would believe. The whole idea of that book was to explain to the general public how music works. My inspiration for the book grew out of a show called “What Makes It Great,” in which I had 15 minutes per week to explain 15 seconds of music. The show was an attempt to talk about music in an extremely non-technical way and to change the way Americans listened.THC: You are bringing “Green Eggs and Hamadeus,” a musical that pairs Dr. Seuss’ timeless children’s book with Mozart’s delightful “Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.” What did you find compelling about Dr. Seuss’ book and about Mozart that inspired you to combine the two into a musical? RK: The idea of writing this opera for children grew out of the fact that all the barriers between classical music and the general public—however great they are for adults—are even greater for kids. I wanted to pick an opera libretto that every child would know. Every kid in America has said, “I am Sam. Sam I am.” I knew that millions of kids and families would flock into a concert hall, because they know every word by heart, but they’ve never heard them sung or set to Mozart’s music. It’s become the most performed piece of music written in the last 50 years.THC: So you are trying to attract an audience of people who would never have considered attending a classical music concert?RK: Yes. In order to get audience members to come who normally wouldn’t, I go on AM call-in radio shows and offer four free tickets to people who seem to hate classical music the most. In Omaha, Nebraska, the winner was a woman who complained that classical music had no plot. I thought that was truly insightful—there are just notes going by, just random sounds. My job is to get people to follow the plot of the music and to understand the language that the plot is being spoken in. THC: What is it about the stereotypical classical music concert experience that seems to discourage untrained listeners from participating?RK: There’s so much bad feeling around it, so many “coulds” and “shoulds” and “woulds,” and all of it is nonsense because it has nothing to do with the fundamentals of the music. An author once said, “Two hundred years ago we used to have great love for music but little respect; today we have great respect but no love.” I think there’s nothing worse than respect. Stravinsky used to say if given the choice between love and respect, he’d take love any day. There is this fake affectation of respect for music, but people aren’t really getting inside it. THC: Since “Green Eggs and Hamadeus” is targeted towards families, what kind of atmosphere would you like to create for parents and their children at performances?RK: What’s important to me about all of my events is that they are human experiences rather than one of those artificially stuffy things with all these rules. It’s also really important for kids to know that a concert hall is the most fun place they could possibly go to.There are few things in our culture that parents can bring their kids to that are enjoyable for both parties. I wanted “Green Eggs and Hamadeus” to be as interesting to the adults as it was for the kids. Dr. Seuss operates on multiple levels, and for me “Green Eggs and Ham” is a parable about prejudice, in which the child teaches the adult. It represents everything we’re sure we won’t like, so we try it....All you have to do is listen, but you have to listen.

While the technical discussion of psychology might not appeal to many, there is something universally attractive in learning about the unseen quirks of our minds. Just as Malcolm Gladwell’s “Blink” engaged readers by emphasizing how powerful our instantaneous decision-making skills are, a new pop-psychology book, “Mindfucking” by Colin McGinn, has emerged to expose worrying weaknesses of the human psyche. The author, a prolific figure in the analytical school of philosophy, was inspired partly by Harry Frankfurt’s 2005 treatise “On Bullshit,” which scrutinized our use of another pseudo-expletive. The eponymous phenomenon is one of mental manipulation, a “rhetorical abuse or sleight-of-hand” that involves “a fundamental restructuring of outlook, often with deep emotional resonance, and frequently coupled with resistance.” McGinn intends to draw attention “to a phenomenon on which it is advisable to have a clear grip”: in other words, he aims to prepare and protect us.Coming at the end of the book, however, the author’s stated purpose reads more like a rationalization than a graceful bow and exit. The idea behind the book is intriguing, but McGinn does not offer a thorough treatment of it. He devotes far too much time and energy to defining the concept without impressing its significance on his readers. In a world where even one dictionary citation seems like a rhetorical faux pas, three separate appeals to Wikipedia, HarperCollins American Slang, and the Oxford English Dictionary in the first chapter serve as early signals of McGinn’s need for filler. The way McGinn delves into the concept also seems a little imbalanced. For about 30 pages of the 80-page text, he concerns himself with the task of explaining just why the obscenity of the term is integral to its meaning—barely squeezing significance out of the parallels between the words “fucking” and “mindfucking.” A select few of these parallels provide insight into the phenomenon being discussed. McGinn remarks, for example, that among other things the two words share alternating connotations—an example of a “good mindfuck” being a thriller like “The Sixth Sense”—and that “just as we have to be careful who we have sex with...we have to be careful about the mindfucking that goes on around us.” Still, most of them come off as coy nudges in the side from an academic attempting to relate to the general public. By halfway through the book, when McGinn is still constructing sentences like “fucking has far greater emotional resonance than mere excreting” by way of comparison between mindfucking and bullshit, the reader’s ribs must be getting a little sore.Even when McGinn does turn to more substantive commentary later in his book, it seems to lack depth and direction. There is not much to learn from his facile remark that “Fascism and Soviet Communism...appealed to latent prejudices, resentments and anxieties to manipulate people’s minds” and thus managed to “approximate the mindfuck.” Likewise, anyone vaguely familiar with “Othello” does not need to be told that Iago “creates alarm and confusion in Othello, as well as searing jealousy, and these are the distinguishing marks of the mindfuck.” He claims that “the concept of mindfucking...has taxonomic power: it unifies disparate phenomena under a common heading, bringing out implicit similarities.” Having introduced a new word, McGinn seems satisfied in simply instructing on its use. It seems only natural that the topic of mindfucking, which involves “trust, deception, emotion, manipulation, false belief and vulnerability,” deserves some psychological analysis. McGinn could explain what motivates the act of mindfucking and what makes certain people particularly vulnerable to it. He could even look at instances of psychological trauma to explore the effects of such disturbing experiences. But he doesn’t. All informed discussion of just how one person can wreak such havoc on the psyche of another is noticeably absent from the book. The author speaks in psychological terms only as a layman; he notes that mindfucking involves “psychological domination” and that “all mindfucking is, at least in part, self-inflicted,” but such thoughts seem more descriptive than analytical.On the way to proving no point, though, McGinn does touch on some fascinating topics. For instance, those unfamiliar with the military’s psychological operations might be interested to know that mindfucking techniques are used systematically “to undermine the morale of the enemy or to win the support of an alien population.” Likewise, the introduction of philosophical skepticism about the external world, which can successfully convince students that all physical objects may very well not exist, is an intelligent touch in the chapter entitled “Some illustrations.” Nevertheless, the union of such disparate topics within the book feels a lot like a labeling game, and McGinn does not provide much detail about the ideas he seems to find so intriguing. We may have to reconsider McGinn’s last-minute assertion that the book itself is not a mindfuck. The author does try to instill fear in his readers, appeals to a wide variety of authorities and examples to establish trust, and may have an ulterior motive—as indicated by the $18.95 cover price—all of which are potential qualities of the classic mindfuck. He even admits at one point that “the mindfuck can never advertise itself as such, it must always disguise itself as well-meaning rational persuasion.” As a mindfuck in itself, “Mindfucking” would be quite a clever trick; however, there is not enough evidence to prove that the book is intended as one. It does not seem supportable to claim that the author aims to amuse and flatter his readers in this way, especially after patronizing them earlier with his lengthy discussion of obscenities. In any case, the quality of his argument isn’t strong enough to merit being called “mindfuck.” Sincerity, however, could not salvage the book. Despite its interesting particularities, the greatest weaknesses of “Mindfucking” lie in its lack of depth: McGinn is certainly not the first to tell his readers about the “phenomenon” of mental manipulation, and he doesn’t treat the subject with enough intellectual gravity to give a new twist on the topic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Ladies and gentlemen, there it is,” Howard Cosell informed the nation during the 1977 World Series. “The Bronx is burning.” His signature stilted, terse cadence and morbid turn of phrase succinctly vocalized a somber resignation that threatened to stifle the once vibrant borough. Ravaged by Robert Moses’ ambitious urban planning, the Bronx—newly equipped with a gleaming expressway—literally crumbled throughout the 70s and 80s, forcing thousands of residents to seek shelter in tenements and public housing. As desperate landlords set fire to their property, hoping to reap the benefits of insurance policies, blackened, windowless towers came to punctuate the skyline of an apocalyptically desolate landscape.Joon, the protagonist of Nami Mun’s debut novel “Miles from Nowhere,” embodies the melancholy pervasive in this landscape. However, the heated social and political factors that fuel the destruction of the Bronx are of marginal importance to Mun. Though her character lives underneath the rubble of this dying city, Mun’s semi-autobiographical tale highlights inner turmoil over external destruction. Joon and her parents leave Korea at the behest of her mother, who intends to forage a better life in the United States. But disaster seems to be the family’s travelling companion, and as her mother’s mental instability becomes crippling, Joon’s father leaves the family. Unable to convince her mother to speak six months after a hospital stint, Joon abruptly leaves home at the age of 13. The rest of her adolescent life is spent on the streets, in and out of shelters, motels, and abandoned apartment buildings, and the bulk of narration is devoted to the steady incineration of childlike innocence.As Joon experiences increasingly disturbing events the deeper she delves into street life, Mun details graphic descriptions of drug abuse, crime, self-mutilation, and abusive relationships in an eerily dispassionate tone. She moves through varying degrees of misfortune with a businesslike lack of emotion—a methamphetamine and bourbon-induced haze is described with the same clarity as a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Joon herself eventually acknowledges this discrepancy in storytelling; “Who knew where or when this was,” she wonders, as her junkie roommate tries to convince her to perform an abortion on herself using bleach and a tampon. Having rendered her own credibility as a narrator questionable, the story is further complicated by blunt, unprecedented chronological leaps that often reveal a character’s future demise within a short, humorous story. As this fatalistic narrative proceeds, Mun attempts to douse her inherently despondent story with hope. Joon’s stalling biography culminates in a spasmodically positive acceleration that uselessly heaps a sudden dose of optimism upon a solid foundation of despair. Mun’s entire narrative is a staccato rhythm of choppy vignettes that are potent in isolation but awkward as a whole. The even-handed treatment of tainted youth is juxtaposed with sappy, trite religious experiences that crop up randomly with little justification. God is “an old black man with sky-bright eyes who smiled at everyone as though he’d seen all of them as children once.” Dressed as a janitor on a bus, he says, “Come with me,” but Joon refuses. Joon’s transient lifestyle provides a colorful cast of characters that distinguish different portions of her life. Unfortunately, Mun’s characteristic lack of subtlety seeps into these portrayals as well, and the characters are painted in broad, vapid strokes. Though Joon painfully recalls being taunted with racial slurs as a child, she views her multiracial peers through an equally skewed lens—in which lisping Puerto Rican call girls offer advice on oral sex and superstitious Chinese women throw knives at enemies. When racial stereotypes aren’t heavily reinforced, Mun utilizes conspicuous hints to contextualize Joon’s acquaintances—a fellow runaway who endeavors to teach Joon life lessons is named Knowledge, while a former addict who is painfully honest about the difficulties of overcoming addiction is named Frank. Mun’s “Miles from Nowhere” successfully creates an historical snapshot of New York City, providing effective reference points for a specific time and place without revealing significant depth or context. Pop cultural tidbits are peppered throughout the novel—family portraits include men wearing velvet suits and jheri curls—but the work fails to address the root of the era’s ubiquitous despair. Joon is constantly surrounded by a group of young runaways, yet the impetus for this youth exodus is never explored. The noise of traffic drifting from city-sanctioned highways provides an urban soundtrack, and elevated train cars reveal burned buildings through their grease-stained windows, but these images are subordinated to mere setting. “Miles from Nowhere” is a book of abrupt stops and starts that, like the slumlords of the Bronx’ past, chooses to exacerbate raw wounds while self-consciously falling short of a remedy, choosing instead to wallow in unfulfilling, albeit compelling, misery.

From the lady in the psychiatric ward to the man in Shea Stadium, Doug Holder describes the curious essence of otherwise mundanely odd people. “As a kid, I always wondered about the man in the small booth in the middle of the Midtown Tunnel,” he writes in the prelude to the first poem of his newest book, “The Man in the Booth in the Midtown Tunnel.” In this collection, the poet’s gaze spans New York and the greater Boston area as he observes his characters with attentive and probing eyes. Holder recounts absurd moments in the miserably ordinary lives that constellate his world. He uses these stories as a sort of social critique of today’s humdrum realities, engaging a universal longing for something beyond the banal.But Holder’s material doesn’t spark much more interest than that. Title characters like “The Woman Who Sat on the Toilet for Two Years” fail to enthuse. What seems to be Holder’s heroic effort to show readers what lies beneath the grim faces he writes about is ultimately unsatisfying. To say that he even succeeds in rendering his insipid characters relatable is dubious. Is a woman “Training Her Pet” an interesting topic for a poem? Holder never convincingly answers the question.Holder’s real crime, however, lies in writing poems as bland as his subjects. In “Watching Her Read My Poem,” the narrator observes, “She did hover on my page / A bit more than the others… Then on to the street / And with perfect aim / Right into / the trash.” It does not seem so hard to follow suit. Here, as in many of his other poems, Holder’s choice of unusual material actually turns out to be a strength, but his imagery lacks clarity. He has reduced his poetry to little more than people watching, and in the wake of this realization, it’s natural to ask whether street-side voyeurism is enough to sustain. In his poem “An Old Harvard Man,” Holder risks telling the story of a man who urinates on the John Harvard statue. “And there you were / Dumbfounded. / Walking the ward / After angrily spraying / The statue of John Harvard / A crimson red. / The Japanese tourists / Snapping your picture / As if you were / Part of the attraction.” Regrettably, this topic not only lacks in originality, but it’s ambitions toward the grotesque never outstrip the juvenile. An Extention School alumnus, Holder should have been aware that there is nothing more to give to this poem than an initial flabbergasted smirk quickly followed by dismissal. In “Davis Square, Somerville: Colonial Woman at the Au Bon Pain,” Holder writes, “And Underneath / A bone-white bonnet / Lies the waves and crests / Of luxuriant / Beguiling / Purple Hair.” For once, Holder seems to have found an interesting figure, yet his poem fails to lift this unusual woman from the paper and into life. Though Holder pays a lot of attention to her physical appearance, he fails to describe her personality, which would be a much stronger focus. So much more can be said, yet his poems fall short.Luckily for Holder, his talent with words saves his subjects from remaining mundane disasters all the time. The fervor he infuses into each line rewards a close scrutiny of his work. Even in “The Woman Who Sat on the Toilet for Two Years,” Holder manages to write, “All your slick / Posturing. / The endless histrionics / Wind up / In a dance / Cheek to cheek / Above the bowl.” An ironic explication of characters like this one leads to captivating lines often filled with biting understatements. His accessible diction serves to capture well-observed and interesting moments in the ordinary.So Holder’s work does have redeeming qualities. Perhaps he desired his writing to be subtle and, like his subjects, oddly ordinary. In fact, his understated humor is often lacking in today’s culture. In the end of “Sig Klein’s Fat Man’s Shop,” he writes, “Comforting us / With the notion / That there is indeed / ‘A fit for any sized man,’ / Just look / What’s underneath.” Athough the topic of the store itself is boring, Holder leaves us with an inkling of wonder. With a little closer reading, Holder finally succeeds in shedding light on society in an interesting way. Through his poetry, he exposes the world as he sees it: depressing, absurd, yet worth living in.It is this world that Holder skillfully depicts in “The Man in the Booth in the Midtown Tunnel.” The collection of poems turns out to contain scores of subtle humor and well-written verse. Despite the poet’s often-unfortunate choice of uninspiring characters, Doug Holder is able to convey a certain charm in what is conventionally commonplace. His poems become endearing and insightful upon further reading. Like his characters, this book deserves a glance, maybe even two, but nothing more.

Robert Pollard is not your average prolific songwriter. Today, many artists are lauded for their fecundity if they’re in more than one band or release more than one album in a year. Pollard, though, makes the activity of people like Ryan Adams and Dan Bejar look part-time. Having released his last solo album on January 20th, Pollard, the former leader of 90s legends Guided By Voices, is back just a month later with “The Planets are Blasted,” the second album by his band Boston Spaceships.Pollard’s habit of writing and releasing songs in such a rapid manner could easily lead one to expect the quality of his output to suffer, as the value of each song is cheapened by the sheer volume that the man spits out. What is so shocking about “The Planets are Blasted,” then, is not just that the songs are almost universally good but that the album feels so essential and climactic. Pollard has proven that, even at 51-years-old, he is more than capable of producing an entirely relevant and enthralling album.“The Planets are Blasted” is very much a continuation of what Pollard has done before. The GBV formula of simple pop songs driven by powerful riffs is still very much intact. Where Boston Spaceships differs from that band is in the quality of the recording process. Where GBV became associated with the lo-fi movement of the mid-90s, Boston Spaceships records in much higher quality, helping to deliver direct pop-punk in a style more suited to Pollard’s mature songwriting talents.From the start, “The Planets are Blasted” fulfills this promise of direct rock music. Opener “Canned Food Demons” layers compelling riffs on top of each other, building up to a rousing chorus featuring a brilliantly restrained vocal performance from Pollard. He clearly knows how to use his voice to hook in the listener but never shows it off, deferring to the merits of the songs rather than indulging himself.Later songs like “Keep Me Down” and “UFO Love Letters” are similarly straight-ahead and thrilling. The dark melodies that hold these songs together are adorned with subtle details like whistling at the end of the latter and a scything solo in the former. “Keep Me Down” also contains some of the most direct lyrics on the record. Attacking a lover, its angry and hostile lines—“I repudiate thee, thou venomous heartbeat”—could come off as immature if the song wasn’t delivered with such style.Less straight-forward but just as impressive is “Dorothy’s a Planet.” In constant transformation starting from its acoustic intro, the song is almost unrecognizable by the end, but the build always makes sense and is never rushed or jarring. The psychedelic lyrics—“She’s a person fast at play / She’s a planet on display”—only help add to the impression of a songwriter completely in charge of his craft.Though Pollard is indisputably the leader of the group, Boston Spaceships has clearly become a very tight band. John Moen (The Decemberists) on drums and Chris Slusarenko (Guided by Voices) on bass help build the swirling melodies that sometimes lean towards shoegaze or even prog-rock, but they always revert back to straight ahead hooks and riffs. “Headache Revolution” is a particularly strong example of this. Beginning as a straight-ahead rocker, by the chorus the instruments are vying for supremacy as Pollard sings the track title over and over. Lyrically it offers little but musically it is stunning.Though the second half of the album struggles to match the superb quality of Side A, the final two tracks finish the album with a brilliant 1-2 punch. “Sight on Sight,” which at four minutes is by far the LP’s longest track, moves through at least five distinct segments, building to a punk-rock closing that tops any of the heavy rocking moments of the earlier tracks. The group saves the biggest surprise for the final track, though. “Heavy Crown” may musically be similar to the rest of the album, but the lyrics reveal Pollard truly opening up to his listeners in a way he rarely has done before. As he sings “I am a high roller / I wear a heavy crown,” we finally get a glimpse of the man himself. He may still be swigging Miller Lite and pumping out simple yet deceptively intelligent guitar rock, but he is also capable of letting us inside his head and even appearing slightly vulnerable.One can only hope, however, that the anxieties of “Heavy Crown” do not reveal a weakening in Pollard’s resolve to continue producing music of this quality. Somehow finding new ground to plough in a career that should long ago have run out of originality, “The Planets are Blasted” once again proves that Pollard is a prolific, but never profligate, talent.—Reviewer Chris R.

The cover of “Tight Knit” shows a silhouetted woodland scene superimposed over a stylized circular star map, reflecting a new direction for Vetiver’s music. The band has always had the quality of a hushed guitar-strumming circle in a forest clearing, but after three albums and five years, Vetiver’s “Tight Knit” makes a conscious effort to progress beyond the delicate, relaxed sing-alongs of their freak-folk origins for a more exuberant tone and perky production. Since Vetiver’s first appearance on the national stage in 2004­—when their song “Angel’s Share” kicked off the Devendra Banhart-curated compilation “Golden Apples of the Sun”­—they have released three albums built along the same formula: subdued acoustic guitar folk well-rooted in the imagery and atmosphere of the natural world. The instrumentation has been tweaked and new styles experimented with, but much of what has always made Vetiver a band worth listening to is the evocative and consistent tone of their music. With song titles such as “Down at El Rio” and “Arboretum” and a species of western Indian grass as their namesake, it is not surprising that the genre of their music is self-described as “Naturalismo.” With “Tight Knit” Vetiver is leaving the dark, comfortable environs of the forest and setting off into the new territory of the night sky. The result is a less consistently redolent and distinctive but more exciting and sociable collection of songs than we have heard from Vetiver before. Bandleader and songwriter Andy Cabic plays all of the instruments on many of the tracks, and without any of the clearly discernible collaborations of previous Vetiver records—Banhart, Joanna Newsom, Hope Sandoval—“Tight Knit” comes across very much as the work of a single voice. “Tight Knit” is Vetiver’s debut recording for Sub Pop, the luminary king of indie pop record labels and home to the Shins and Postal Service. This move from Cabic and Banhart’s own label Gnomonsong is evident in the production of the album, with a sound that is cleaner and more expansive than Vetiver’s previous recordings. The major label seems to serve Cabic well, and he takes advantage of this to expand the instrumentation and variety of his songs. The album starts off with the aptly titled “Rolling Sea,” a sensitive fingerpicked ballad, decorated with piano and steel guitar, that would fit in on any previous Vetiver record. This is followed by “Sister,” a gentle appeal to a sibling “too young to be treated badly, too bored to be told.” It is a radical departure for Vetiver, with a rhythm section lifted straight out of a fifties R&B crooner. Next is the winsome “Everyday,” which sounds positively twee. With its barred strumming, steel guitar and Cabic’s sunny “doo-doo-doos,” “Everyday” could be a lost Belle & Sebastian track. “Another Reason to Go” is infused with rigorous bass and a funky horn riff that would not be out of place in a James Brown swagger, and a drum machine even shows up in “On the Other Side.” Vetiver has always had a knack for merry rollicking romps—“Amour Fou” from their 2004 self-titled debut comes to mind—though in “Tight Knit” tracks like “Everyday” and “More of This” are infused with a more clearly articulated pop sensibility.Cabic illuminated his influences on last year’s “Thing of the Past,” in which he offered covers of seminal but relatively recondite folk artists, from Loudon Wainwright and Townes van Zandt to Derroll Adams and Bobby Charles—artists that have inspired the direction his own music has taken. Listening to “Tight Knit,” however, one wonders if the conceit behind “Thing of the Past” wasn’t entirely honest. While “Tight Knit” includes several songs—“Forest Edge” and “Down from Above”—that would fit anywhere in Vetiver’s canon, the new bearings manifest in “Tight Knit” seem to owe more to the rhythm and crunchy horns of sixties funk and the melodies and vocal style of nineties indie pop than to the Americana and “Naturalismo” of previous recordings. The problem is that no matter how attractive and enjoyable these songs are to listen to, they have lost part of the distinctive character that made Vetiver unique. With “Tight Knit,” Vetiver have proven that they can play in other circles as well, producing their warmest and most enjoyable album yet. But they have yet to put their own stamp on these styles, and time will tell if their future recordings demonstrate that they can bridge the stylistic gap between the vivid and organic Vetiver of old and their jauntier and more playful newer material.

“The Spirit of Apollo” sounded like the wet dream of music bloggers and Hype Machine addicts—take a sample of hip-hop and indie rock’s current royalty, sprinkle in some musical legends, add a solid production team, and put them all together on one album. Unfortunately, N.A.S.A., the DJ duo behind the album, fails to live up to the extraordinary potential of their project.Sam “Squeak E. Clean” Spiegel and Ze “DJ Zegon” Gonzales named their collaboration N.A.S.A.­—which stands for North America/South America—to reflect the combination of L.A.-based Spiegel’s specialty in hip-hop and the strong influence of Gonzales’s hometown of São Paolo. The pronounced base line of Brazilian funk is one of the few consistencies on this album, a project five years in the making that features close to 40 artists in often unlikely match-ups. “Gifted,” the lead single, is the clear standout—maybe it’s just nice to remember that Kanye can actually rap. A verse that outshines most of “808s and Heartbreak,” alongside the nasal voice of Santogold, cuts the sweetness of Lykke Li in a deceptively catchy hook: “So knock me out and shoot me down / With mics in hand, we’ll stand against the test of time.” They rhyme with a confidence that tames the complicated electronic melody.Santogold returns later on the track “Whatchadoin?” with close friend M.I.A., as well as rapper Spank Rock and Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner. Telephone dial tones, the chanting voice of M.I.A. and a tribal drum beat transform Zinner’s guitar into an infectious rhythm. Spank Rock’s frenetic rhymes provide the verses to round out a solidly danceable hit. The clear cohesion between the various guest acts and the production of N.A.S.A., which works so well on “Gifted” and “Watchadoin?,” is exactly what is lacking on the less successful tracks. The project at times gets caught up in its own concept—picking unexpected groups of artists out of sheer caprice without regard for their combined sound. As delightful as it is to imagine Karen O hanging out with Ol’ Dirty Bastard—may he rest in peace—her distinctive vocals on “Strange Enough” are sorely out of place next to a sampled ODB verse about his childhood. “Feelin’ clean, I was only 13 / With the heavy starch on my Bugle Boy jeans,” he raps in an homage to the misguided fashion of the early 90s, only to be interrupted by the strained rock vocals of Karen O’s chorus.“Spacious Thoughts” pairs Tom Waits with veteran emcee Kool Keith over a mellow drum beat and somber piano melody. The softspoken rhymes of Kool Keith do nothing to balance the larger-than-life Waits, whose emotional delivery gives his portion of song a decidedly more sinister tone, and the song remains fragmented.The problems in “The Spirit of Apollo,” however, are not found in the individual performances of the album’s many contributors. In fact, even the actual production work of Squeak E. Clean and DJ Zegon, the common denominators of the varied sounds, demonstrates good taste and technical skill. The duo shows off their mastery of audio samples in moderation before cutting loose on the three-minute instrumental “O Pata” near the end of the album. The team exudes confidence in a variety of genres, equally adept with the reggae stylings of Sizzla and Amanda Blank on the dance hall track “A Volta” as with the funk performance of George Clinton on “There’s a Party.”Despite its intriguing complexity, almost every song on the album suffers from the same shortcoming. With the exceptions of “Gifted,” “Whatchadoin?,” and “The Mayor”—in which The Cool Kids, Ghostface Killah, and Scarface spit over a DJ AM beat—the collaborations lack a raison d’être beyond the whims of N.A.S.A. The admittedly interesting combinations of performers reveal nothing but the mad skills of the producers. Their work on “The Spirit of Apollo” makes a great audio resumé for N.A.S.A., but it doesn’t make great listening.—Staff writer Charleton A. Lamb can be reached at clamb@fas.harvard.edu.

Having gained popularity through their absurd live shows—which usually involve severe inebriation, prevalent nudity, osculation between band members, and nearly every bodily fluid imaginable—it’s not surprising that the Black Lips might find it difficult to convey that same intensity on a studio album. On the band’s latest release, “200 Million Thousand,” they try desperately to be as defiant and rebellious as ever, but what emerges is a stale form of the eccentric garage punk they’ve produced in the past. However, when the band stops trying to force this sense of free-spiritedness and opts instead to write songs that actually show some form of inspiration, the appeal of their studio work can be found. The Atlanta-based Black Lips have adamantly defined their music as “flower punk,” implying a paradoxical combination of emotion and energy, but their fifth studio album is composed mostly of trite, standard punk-rock songs that seem only to scream the message that the band is still full of teenage angst. The song “Take My Heart” opens the album with a hackneyed blues guitar riff and the whiney, gruff singing of frontman Cole Alexander. “Big Black Baby Jesus Of Today” continues these blunt statements of rebellion while adding in some maracas to compensate for the slower pace. Full of standard guitar riffs, simple rock beats, and sapless whining, these songs lacks any real substance and raise the question of whether or not the Black Lips are really as label bending as they claim to be. “Short Fuse” emerges mid-album like a mirage through the barren rubble of mediocre punk-rock anthems. The upbeat, danceable song still sounds like a high school band performing at a talent show, but such earnestness comes across well. Even though it does little exciting instrumentally, the lighter song works to spark the sometimes apparent energy of the offbeat band, especially when the piano bridge enters the fray. This hint of inspiration is then corroborated with “Drugs,” which presents the dichotomy of an upbeat 50s pop tune with distorted guitar and crackling vocals. “Old Man” begins with a heavy reliance on a dreary guitar and keyboard dirge. The first half presents an anthemic quality that would have been fitting in such rock-parodies as Spinal Tap; yet halfway through the song, the chorus takes a cheery psychedelic turn. The album’s most unexpected success, “The Drop I Hold,” features Alexander sing-speaking over a lazy quasi-hip-hop guitar riff. The mix of the eerie synthesizer and subtle piano licks gives rise to a sense of pensiveness  not heard on other tracks. Though it slightly builds cohesion as it goes along, the album lacks much substance or integrity. “200 Million Thousand” is as contradictory as the “flower punk” mantra, featuring tediously rebellious punk-rock anthems with several truly genre-blending gems interspersed. When the Black Lips adhere to their own descriptions and are able to carefully mix the beauty with the ugly, the bright with the dreary, the album is as full of energy as their concert debauchery. But when they fall short of this claim of complexity, all that is left is wailing verses and juvenile instrumentation. Without the flower, you just have more run-of-the-mill punk.

Don’t worry, your computer isn’t infected with some weird screen-warping virus; that’s actually what it’s supposed to look like. In the latest video from his Auto-Tune drenched album “808s and Heartbreak,” Kanye plays the poor-little-rich-rapper card while simultaneously re-enacting his latest acid trip. The video opens with West in sunglasses and a color-block sweater—think Will Smith on “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”—against a dark background which unexpectedly starbursts into sensory-overload. Wildly colorful images are digitized and distorted, stuttering choppily from frame to pixilated frame. Weak-stomached watchers beware: you may find “Welcome to Nausea” to be a more accurate title. All the while, in a thinly-veiled attempt to connect with the masses, Kanye muses about how much it sucks to be bankin’—poor Kanye, rich in an economic recession. And what’s better than one gloomy Kanye? Lots of them!! The video feeds Kanye’s narcissism as it allows him to digitally multiply himself. He comes close to finally living out the fantasy of making out with himself in a music video.Gone are the days when Kanye would wax poetic about the nature of religion, war, and love, and the days we wanted to awkwardly fist-pump to his infectious rhythms. Kanye strains himself for a decent rhyme scheme; the best that the lethargic “Heartbreak” can conjure is, “Bad enough that I showed up late / I had to leave before they even cut the cake / Welcome to heartbreak.” The trippy visual concept is admittedly cool, except, well, it was also cool two years ago when the kitschy electronic-pop group Chairlift did the same thing in their video for “Evident Utensils.” Although Kanye has successfully sampled artists ranging from Ray Charles to Daft Punk in the past, it seems he’s found his limits; the sample only works well when your song is faster, better, stronger than those you copy. The digital splendor of the video is an ineffective attempt to prop up a song lacking both strong lyrics and a memorable beat.Kanye is the self-proclaimed voice of our generation, but he’ll find it hard to support that claim if he doesn’t leave the over-digitized, robotic monotone to people with no actual talent—Britney Spears, anyone?-Arhana Chattopadhyay

Ra Ra Riot wants to come in from the cold. “Can You Tell,” the new video from the Syracuse-based band, finds them camped out in the snow-covered yard of a suburban house. In a futile attempt to convince the unnamed occupant of the house to let them in, they bring flowers, bang on the door and deliver sweet indie pop into their ears.The band’s failure to get inside is certainly not for lack of trying. The offer of numerous varieties of flowers certainly doesn’t work. By the end of the video the ground is littered with the torn up remains of various bouquets. That’s very sad, but look on the bright side: now they can make potpourri! Just as ineffective is their banging on the door. This isn’t just any banging; at one point the drummer actually gets his sticks out and hits them against the door. Go ahead and insert a joke here about music breaking down doors.Having failed to get into the house, the band contents itself with a live performance of the song in the freezing yard. Sweet and melodic, “Can You Tell” offers a less angst-ridden version of the Arcade Fire’s orchestral pop. By playing it in the snowy environment of the video, the string-heavy group proves Yo-Yo Ma ’76 wrong by showing that a cello can in fact be played outside in the cold. Maybe they should be hired for the next Inauguration.While it is unlikely that Ra Ra Riot will be playing on Capitol Hill in 2012, if they keep making songs as good as this they should certainly graduate to mainstream acceptance. The whole getting into the house thing could very easily be a metaphor for their attempt to break through into the public consciousness. “Have I been too discrete?” frontman Wes Miles asks, and the answer has to be a resounding no. We get the message that you want someone to open the door. Hopefully one day someone will actually get around to it.                                                      —Chris R. Kingston

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one emblematic scene in Kim Tae-kyun’s film “Crossing,” the young protagonist Joon runs after the truck that is carrying away his dead mother. As he struggles and fails to catch up to the moving vehicle, he begins to pant. His shoes are in tatters; the afternoon sun hangs over a dusty North Korean landscape. This scene is one of many that exemplify the genuinely sad but wholly unoriginal feel that characterizes much of “Crossing.” The movie provides an emotional and vivid portrayal of the tragedies faced by one North Korean family, but its project would be more effective if the dramatic scenes and heavy symbolism were more subtle and more imaginative.“Crossing”—filmed in China, Korea, and Mongolia—tells the story of Yong-soo (Cha In-pyo), a former soccer player now living in poverty in a North Korean coal mining town with his pregnant wife and their young son. When Yong-soo’s wife—who is mysteriously left nameless—falls ill with tuberculosis, exacerbated by malnutrition, Yong-soo makes the difficult decision to attempt an illegal crossing into China to obtain the medicines his wife so desperately needs.In traditional tragic form, Joon is left alone to care for his ailing mother, but she soon dies while Yong-soo is in China. Joon departs to find his father, not knowing that Yong-soo has already been relocated to South Korea by a relief organization.Certain scenes of the movie elicit real emotion—horror, disgust, pity—but these are few and far between. One scene in which Joon excitedly goes to feed his pet dog the leftover bones from an exceptionally good meal, only to discover that his father has just served the dog for dinner particularly registers the family’s desperation in a way that is genuinely painful.But the movie as a whole would benefit from a paring down of its overly dramatic scenes. Its inherently emotional storyline—compounded by the fact that this is a dramatization, not a documentary—makes exaggeration not only unnecessary,  but also detrimental to the film’s power. A frantic escape scene featuring Yong-soo is filmed in slow motion, presumably to increase the tension and drama of the moment. It comes across as overdone and totally lacking in suspense. The film also employs its fair share of flashback-driven montages, a superfluous technique that does nothing to advance the story.Attempts at symbolism in the movie are also heavy-handed. The rain, for instance, is referenced by Joon on multiple occasions as a representation of life, hope, and happiness. One of the movie’s more cringe-inducing lines involves Joon’s discussion of what he hopes heaven will be like: “I hope it still rains there.” This is not the only mention of Christian themes by the characters, who seem to grow more religious as the film progresses. When Yong-soo discovers that his wife has died—a message inexplicably relayed to him by an unnamed woman he has hired to investigate the whereabouts of his family—he asks, “Does Jesus Christ live only in South Korea?” He goes on to question whether he is allowed to cry if he feels his “heart ripping apart inside.”The movie’s one unequivocal asset is its cinematography. Beautiful images of Joon roaming the barren desert beneath a multicolored sunset serve to redeem some of the movie’s lesser moments. When the boy is later caught trying to sneak across the Chinese border, he is sent to a youth labor camp that exists entirely in shades of brown—a choice that is striking and bleak, if not subtle.Unfortunately, nothing can fully redeem Kim’s lack of originality in crafting the film. A fictionalized film should provide room for artistic innovation, but there is little imagination in “Crossing.” And with a story as inherently stark as this one, every clichéd flourish only distances the audience from what could have been a beautiful and moving drama.

William Friedkin doesn’t know how he survived the making of “The French Connection,” his 1971 police-procedural classic.As the Oscar-winning director tells it, his appearance some 35 years later at the Harvard Film Archive’s two-week retrospective of his work can only be explained by miracle. “It was the Movie God again,” he said. Only some sort of cinematic deity could’ve saved him, he says, from the perils of one of the movie’s most famous scenes—a heart-stopping car chase in which protagonist Jimmy Doyle (played by that year’s Best Actor Gene Hackman) rockets through Brooklyn traffic tailing a criminal who has hijacked the West End’s elevated train. Lacking the funds to block off the street or film the chase on a closed set, Friedkin had simply sat in the passenger’s seat with his camera pointed forward and taunted the driver until he tripled the speed limit. “We went 26 blocks at 90 miles an hour with no clearances, no permissions—went in the wrong lane, went right against cross traffic, and nearly hit it. It’s something, I swear to you ladies and gentlemen,” Friedkin said, smiling, “I wouldn’t do today.”With the same boldness of mind, Friedkin went on to direct “The Exorcist”—the horror classic that earned 10 Oscar nominations—just two years later.If a filmmaking deity saved William Friedkin’s career, it was instinct, he suggested, that pushed it forward. Almost every choice made by Friedkin for “The French Connection” was either motivated by intuition or forced by circumstance. Hackman was only considered after a number of other actors were unavailable or turned the role down—among them, Jackie Gleason. Friedkin chose cinematographer Owen Roizman—who received an Oscar nomination for the film—without ever having seen a frame of film he had shot. “As a filmmaker, the one thing I did pick up somehow was to trust my instincts,” he said.These hunches pointed him toward some of the film’s most striking moments. Along with the film’s producer, Philip D’Antoni, Friedkin decided they needed a scene fit to rival the already-famous car chase from “Bullitt,” which had been released just three years before. Taking a 55 block walk along stretches of the elevated train in Brooklyn, Friedkin and D’Antoni “spitballed” the idea of a very different car chase, in which a driver pursued a man in a metro car.When the two went to the transit authority to assess the plausibility of this dream, the Movie God stepped in yet again. Asking for permission to film a train crash in an elevated train system that in over half a century had never seen an accident, the two were gravely told by the supervisor that allowing it would lose him his job. As Friedkin and D’Antoni headed dejectedly toward the door, the man stopped them and announced that he’d do it for $40,000 and a one-way trip to Jamaica.“He gave us permission, he got fired, and he moved to Jamaica,” Friedkin said.The film’s stunning last scene—which ends with the ambiguous firing of an unseen gun—was arrived at in a similarly haphazard fashion. “I was sitting in the sound mix, and I said to the sound mixer, as the music was trailing off, ‘We should end this film with a bang,’” Friedkin explained with characteristic humor. “And he said, ‘So what do you want to do?’ And I said, ‘We should end this film with a bang.’”Friday’s Q & A was not all amiable storytelling. At one point, an audience member pointedly questioned Friedkin’s choice to show a Blu-Ray version of the film—which the director had personally color-dyed, frame by frame—rather than an original or dyed 35mm print.Responding to accusations of ruining the film’s integrity by showing it in Blu-Ray, Friedkin adamantly defended his support of digital technology.“This is exactly what I had in mind when I shot the picture,” Friedkin said emphatically. “We can’t say, ‘We shouldn’t do this because of some kind of purity.’ We’re making this always as best as it can be seen by new audiences.”Later that night, the HFA screened Friedkin’s first major film, “The People vs. Paul Crump,” a documentary of a death-row inmate convicted of a murder he likely didn’t commit. The film prompted the governor of Illinois to send Friedkin a thank-you letter, saying the film led him to commute Crump’s sentence to life in prison instead of death by electric chair.“But listen,” Friedkin said, introducing the film with the same humility that elicited his constant tribute to a benevolent Movie God. “It’s not that good, folks.”

The weather was nippy outside last Saturday night, but a large crowd had weathered the cold to gather inside of Tommy Doyle’s for the MIT portion of Rockus, a musical battle royale organized by Veritas Records and sponsored by Rolling Stone. Veritas Records President Caitlin V. Crump ’10 is convinced that it will produce the next big band.MIT, Tufts, Emerson, Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, and the Berklee College of Music each have its own night of competition in which one winner from each college emerges. It is these winners who collectively go on to compete in a Boston-wide battle. Such a high-stakes event promises a wealth of rewards for the eventual winner: $1,000 worth of merchandise from Rolling Stone, a feature on Rolling Stone’s website, a CD release party at Hard Rock Café in the fall, and a three-song demo with a top recording studio in New York City.There were four contestants for this portion of the competition: SupaDupa, The Pears, Pesticide Red, and Fortran. Each band possesses a unique energy that it brings to its live show. According to several fans, these four groups are at the core of the MIT band scene. Dan Ainge, one of the organizers of the event, describes the MIT music scene as “small, since not a lot of people have time for bands.” But despite the intimacy of the scene, there was considerable fan support. For the bands, however, it seemed to be all about having fun.Jacob McGrane, the bassist of Pesticide Red, was simply excited to play with the other three bands. The other members of Pesticide Red agreed; for them, Rockus is just another concert, and they were more concerned with having a good time than with who wins the title. David Aaronson, a former organizer for the MIT Battle of the Bands, said he looks forward to “learning the state of the MIT music scene.” Like the bands, Aaronson was more interested in the music than in the competition.The camaraderie of the four groups was far more apparent than any agonistic spirit. “We used to play together all the time, so it’s nice to come back and play with these guys now that we’re all much better,” said Jonathan Krones, the bass guitarist from The Pears. Nobody appeared concerned about who won; it was simply about good music and good friends.SupaDupa took the stage first, and its colorful costuming (each member is dressed in a different color of the rainbow) matched their retro musical style. A crisp trumpet threaded many of their songs, and they used several less conventional instruments, such as a cello and an accordion. The songs were enchantingly upbeat, and SupaDupa clearly enjoyed themselves as much if not more than the audience. The Pears were next. The sheer enthusiasm and energy of their performance galvanized the audience. They transitioned seamlessly from one song to the next, and a sea of heads bobbed to the beat. It was apparent to all that each individual band member, especially drummer Balaji Mani, were exhilarated to be there. Mani was all smiles throughout the performance as he mouthed the lyrics while drumming exuberantlyMeanwhile, the bands not performing could be found in the audience, where they showed spirited support.Pesticide Red, the next band, brought a louder voice to Rockus. In an interview before their performance, band members described themselves as “pirate gypsy rock.” There was also talk of pant-less practice jams in dorm halls. This jocular attitude translated into a fun performance that was classic punk rock. Fortran was last. Vocalist Carrie McDonough added a distinctive voice to their music, and even kept a facetious conversation with the audience between sets. Before their performance, the drummer, who identified himself simply as Okie, described the band’s music as “petrified rock.” Their music was certainly crisp, but it was their individualistic performance (more conversational than theatrical) that intrigued the audience.With no fanfare, as the bands would have wanted, The Crimson hereby reports that the Pears ultimately nabbed the prize that night, and they will go on to compete at the final “battle” on April 14 at The Paradise in Boston. A publisher from Rolling Stone is slated to judge, which is, according to Crump, unprecedented. She also notes that top-notch managers from major labels will attend, though she keeps their identities secret. Harvard bands will take the stage this Saturday night at 8:30 in Tommy Doyle’s. Tickets are sold out, but Crump stresses that fans will be able to get in at 10 p.m. Whether Harvard’s night will be a true battle royale (in typical Harvard fashion) remains to be seen.

By now you’ve probably heard that the world as we know it is spiraling out of control, and no one—not even Savior-In-Chief President Obama—knows what to do. Everyone, from salt-of-the-Earth Middle Americans, to class of 2006 Harvard economics graduates, is losing his job. That more than a few current seniors will likely be spending the coming year living in Mom’s house, “working things out,” has gone from an unspoken reality to a common experience. Who knew a little banking crisis could make such a stir? Prior to the recent downturn, those in creative businesses—that is, the clothing designers, the restaurateurs and chefs, the advertisers–were certainly conscious of the extent to which the cash flow of the moneyed can affect their lives. Lower Manhattan eateries and boutiques, the large part of which stake their livelihood on the profligate spending of be-bonused Wall Streeters, were sent reeling in the wake of September 11.Consciousness does not, apparently, conflate preparedness. More and more, it appears that these nine-to-five artistes are just as without direction in this crisis as the rest of the world. Their bread crusts and beret counterparts–that is, the unsigned musicians and freelance visual artists–should be less affected by the crisis, given their relative removal from financial systems. To boot, rents are plummeting in major cities across the country, as is the cost of living. This is something to be excited about.Yes, you read correctly. While it’s a truism to say that the best art has always been created in poorer times, the real gift that all artists today have been given is the opportunity, freer than before from market-driven industry pressures, to answer an eternal question: where do we go from here? For many of the workaday sorts, the answer seems to be “backwards,” or at the very least, “stay put.” In her New York Times blog “On The Runway,” Cathy Horyn recently lamented “how serious and mature designers are acting nowadays,” noting how, “for a decade we’ve talked proudly of branding and luxury groups... Maybe the more sober business climate will put more emphasis on creativity.” Many designers at last week’s New York Fashion Week showed collections that were demure, either fearful that their clientele would not deign to purchase more outlandish clothing this coming fall, or that customers would be focusing instead on updating old standards, like coats and suits. Others, namely Marc Jacobs, chose to hearken back to times that they remember as freer or happier—the 1980s. They tended to become subsumed in their own nostalgia, however, and though exaggerated shoulders and metallic fabrics were a gleeful response to these gloomy times, they did not necessarily come off as conscious or even relevant. We all know how people dressed when times were fun, but how will we continue to enjoy ourselves and celebrate life when times are tough? I believe that the answer to this, and other similar questions all artists are charged with—whether they are business-oriented or not—lies in the realization that what we are faced with is not a moderate rearrangement of our economy and way of life. It is a seismic, massive disruption. Their reactions, then, should be equally monumental. Though the natural reaction might be to freeze or look back, some have begun to take this global shift as an indicator, fundamentally modifying their approach to creativity. British-born singer Antony Hegarty has long been invested in the constant evolution of his sense of individualism. His arresting, haunting songs are often personal and inward-looking, though recently they seem more reactive to the outside world. Hegarty’s focus and sensibility has evolved from 2005’s grand and dramatic exercise in emotiveness, “I Am a Bird Now,” to inhabit a quieter, more introspective space. With the recently released “The Crying Light,” he focuses on the more fundamental, including his relation to the Earth and connections to his parents, touching on both of these relationships on the slow-burn “Aeon.” He wistfully laments our inheritance from the world and our family, as he sees it as one of mixed potential and inevitable disappointment. “Let’s do something differently, let’s take our power back,” he implores. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” begging others to take note.If France’s Phoenix and the New York-based Yeah Yeah Yeahs are any indication, other musicians certainly have. Both bands exploded onto the indie rock scene around the turn of the millenium, but their newest offerings stand to be radically different records than their previous fare.If the first single from the upcoming “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix” titled “1901” can be taken as any evidence, the stylish and exacting pop sound that has become characteristic of Phoenix has been overhauled, replaced by a recognizable, though notably rougher and more electronic style.The Yeah Yeah Yeahs have taken it one step further on their recently leaked follow-up to 2006’s “Show Your Bones.” Not only does “It’s Blitz!” sport objectively kick-ass album art, it reveals a band that has jettisoned its old standbys in an effort to liven things up. The art punk garage band who started out supporting acts like the Strokes and the White Stripes has reportedly forbidden their lead (and very talented) guitarist Nick Zinner from doing what he does—play the guitar. Seismic, indeed. “When Karen orders, ‘No guitars for Nick!’ it makes you approach things in a different way,” noted Zinner in the SPIN magazine cover story for March. Claiming famed disco producer Giorgio Moroder, Donna Summer, and lead singer Karen O’s love of dancing as inspirations, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs promise to drop a record that sounds little like their previous, steadfastly rock-based work.Fans of the YYYs are well aware of Karen’s passion for prancing across the stage at shows in loud costumes, but never before has the rest of the band (always clad in I’m-not-here black) seemed so enthusiastic about tripping the light fantastic. While the album will not be officially released until April 14, it is clear that the group avoided the temptations of caution, uncertainty and nostalgia, favoring a spirit that embraces the opportunity for change and creativity that uncertain times present.  Who knew a little banking crisis could make such a stir?—Columnist Ruben L. Davis can be reached at rldavis@fas.harvard.edu.

Artist Heide Hatry channels Victor Frankenstein as she stitches together pieces of pigskin to make female figures. And like Frankenstein’s monster, the masquerade of life she creates never takes on fully human form, instead leaving the viewer in shock and disgust. Hatry’s current exhibition, “Heads and Tales,” is on display at the Pierre Menard Gallery at 10 Arrow Street until March 17.  Hatry fashions each of her figures out of untreated pig meat, skin, and eyes. She then dresses and paints them with makeup before modeling them for photography.  Video footage of this process streams on the back wall of the gallery. In one section of the film, Hatry cuts out pig eyes; in another, the artist rolls cleaned skins and stacks them into a box. Time-lapsed and silent, Hatry’s movements are industrial and determined, as if the hands on the screen stripping meat belonged to a taxidermist rather than to an artist.  Hatry’s work may take its roots in dead flesh, but in her display, the skin is endowed with a kind of life. Each figure is accompanied by a biographical narrative, written by a contemporary female author and inspired by the portrait. Text and image hang side by side like open pages of a book, imbuing the silent figures with history.  Meet “Mistress Victoria Chi,” a dominatrix who leaves her S&M dungeon after she falls for a client mid-whip. She shies from the camera, her black hair brushed over one eye. By her side, “Violette Nozieres” stares wistfully at the ground. Her head is decorated with a black satin band, her face delicately concealed by a piece of lace. The accompanying biography explains Violette’s tragic life: raped by her father in her teens, she was sentenced to death for killing him several years later. Violette’s tale is not alone in its violence—mistrust and anger, rape, and bodily destruction inundate the stories displayed. Even the presentation of the text itself is challenging. Words, set in uniform lines, cram the frame. As the viewer reads the narratives, he must fight to distinguish the story from his own reflection in the gleaming glass. To create further discomfort, Hatry graces the gallery with a pig flesh example of a sculpted bust. The bust lies on a butcher’s table, attached to stuffed clothing to give it the appearance of belonging to a full body. Just as mascara and blush color the photographed figures, traces of makeup tint the greening putrid flesh. Black boots, peeking out from under the sheet, sparkle like the Wicked Witch’s red footwear in the “The Wizard of Oz.” The smell of rot and formaldehyde permeates the entire gallery.   But repulsion alone does not drive Hatry’s art. In a statement about her work, she compares sculpting animal parts for her images with a photographer’s preparation of a model for a photo shoot. The resulting portraits are eerily similar. The taut expressions of the pig-skin figures are reminiscent of faces fastened by Botox injections; the flesh-strip lips pucker like mouths making kissing motions at the camera. One portrait, “Crazy Broad,” which features a figure dressed in a fur coat and paparazzi-shielding glasses, could almost have come out of the pages of “US Weekly”—were it not betrayed by the flat stare of pig eyes. By crafting these physical representations of women and then invoking their back stories, Hatry suggests that when a woman surrenders agency over her body, she relinquishes agency over her life. Pig flesh complicates the idea: no amount of makeup will turn “Victoria” or “Violette” into an attractive woman; no back story, however touching, will prevent the skin’s inevitable decay. Maybe Hatry is using Babe’s cousins to say that it’s useless to be a babe. Or maybe she just likes pig.                          —Staff writer Madeleine M. Schwartz  can be reached at mschwart@fas.harvard.edu.

The most exciting event since the expedition of Lewis and Clark recently hit the state of Oregon. Sam Adams—the openly gay mayor of Portland who had been hailed as America’s “great gay hope”—was embroiled in scandal last month when he confessed to lying about an affair he’d had with an 18-year-old political intern named Beau Breedlove. Despite the fact that Adams denied the affair throughout the course of his mayoral campaign, Breedlove insists that he welcomed Adam’s advances and had never felt victimized—he was a legal adult throughout the sexual aspects of the affair.
When the story of Adams's and Breedlove broke, the most broadcast cause of public ire was the fact that Adams had lied about the relationship—not that he’d cultivated a homosexual liaison with a younger person. Yet the calls for Adams to resign and the media coverage of the issue have tinged the affair with a pallor of homophobia and judgment of Adams’s sexual behavior.
Outside Portland’s City Hall, people waved placards and shouted “pedophile” in protest of his continued service. Major papers such as The Oregonian dubbed the affair a “sex scandal” and the relationship, “inappropriate.” Rare is coverage of the affair that doesn’t in some way construct the relationship as the older, experienced man taking advantage of a young boy, confused and overwhelmed by his own sexuality. Yet critics insist that their disgust at Adams’s behavior comes about not as a result of the nature of his sexual preferences, but because of his choice to lie about his behavior. This claim is preposterous. To assert that the Sam Adams scandal exists independently of his homosexuality is either patently duplicitous or laughably naïve.
In many ways, the Adams affair is a double disloyalty. Hidden behind the fervent insistence that the scandal isn’t about “gay predators or gay anything” (as Timothy Egan insisted in his blog for the New York Times) is the implicit acknowledgement that Adams’s “betrayal” was not just of his constituents’ trust, but also of the gay community at large. When Adams denied the relationship during his campaign, he smeared his accuser, insisting that the charges were indicative of the worst kind of homophobia. Now, some gays rightly feel duped by someone who was supposed to be a leader. Adams’s insistence that he never had the relationship was emphatic, and critics’ insistence that their objections to Adams are based on his dishonesty and not on his sexuality are similarly vehement; in both cases, the accused doth protest too much.
No one emerges clean from an affair such as this. Obviously, Adams is the clear loser in the situation. His first wrong—not fessing up when a reporter wrote a series of articles about his relationship with Breedlove—was compounded by his choice of defense against the allegations that were actually true. Adams brought his own sexuality into the picture by accusing reporters of homophobia during his 2007 campaign for mayor. Adams argued that the accusations played into “the worst deep-seated fears society has about gay men” in the Portland Mercury in 2007: “You can't trust them with your young.” In doing so, Adams reverted to a stereotype about stereotyping and became the boy who cried bigot. I would venture that Adams was indeed correct in his assumption that bigotry would inform the media’s treatment of his alleged affair. Whereas older men who hit on younger women are thought of as sleazy (read: Bill Clinton), men who solicit young men are dubbed “lewd” or “perverted” (Larry Craig, anyone?).
Gays feel the sting of Adams’s betrayal because he was their partner in the most literal sense of the word: a man who dealt with prejudice in the public arena and resisted it. But he turned from ally to enemy when his vehement protests were turned against him by his own misdeeds. It’s hardly surprising that the editorial board of Just Out—Portland’s oldest gay publication—called for Adams’s resignation. Tom Swafford—a queer supporter of Adams who donated to his campaign—told Just Out that his devastation sprung from the fact that Adams “was going to be the one to destigmatize gay people in positions of power.” That hope is now a dream, dashed and deferred.
It is dishonest to pretend that inherent judgments regarding the age and gender of a man’s sexual partner are not at play in the Adams scandal. The story of Sam Adams—that duplicitous homosexual!—indicates something we all already knew: sometimes, politicians lie, whether they’re gay, straight, male or female. End of story. People who insist that this alone is a shocking fact—independent of Adams’s sexuality—are woefully self-deceived.
The truth is that, unfortunately, Adams would not have won his campaign to become mayor had he not lied about the affair. Despite the fact that nothing illegal took place and no one got their feelings hurt, the nature of the relationship—between two men with a significant age difference—violated enough of our society’s sexual norms to prohibit Adams from ascending to office. The ultimate tragedy is that the private sphere is allowed to inform the public to such a drastic degree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, President Barack Obama called for the 19 largest banks in the country to undergo “stress tests” to determine whether they are adequately capitalized to withstand a significant economic downturn. Critics have claimed that the government’s worst-case economic condition forecasts are too weak, making the tests inadequate. Still, the tests should provide valuable information on the health of our banking system, and the administration was wise to order them. Should the results eventually show that any major bank is undercapitalized, the government should not hesitate in taking it into receivership.Dramatic action in the banking industry is crucial, since the effects of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will be strongly diminished if the credit crunch continues. The weeks spent debating the merits and drawbacks of the stimulus plan cannot go to waste. In an ordinary recession, the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates to get credit flowing, sparking the economy. However, in the words of our president in an interview with ABC News, “…we are in not just an ordinary recession.” With the target for the Federal Funds rate against the zero lower bound, the limitations of the Federal Reserve are quite apparent. Since no one can trust a bank’s balance sheet, laced with so-called toxic assets, the economy continues to be threatened. Our legislators are left two main choices: Inject the banks with more capital and hope for the best, or take over insolvent banks, wipe out shareholders, replace the executives, and make the bondholders the new shareholders.After the bursting of Japan’s asset bubble in the late 1980s, its economy showed little growth in a period known as the “Lost Decade.” Over the following years, Japan injected capital into banks that were likely to be insolvent so that they could stay open without dealing with the reality of their liabilities. This story sounds grimly similar to the Troubled Assets Relief Program, by which the Treasury handed $700 billion to the nation’s banks with little positive result. The consequences of the Japanese—and hence our—rescue plan, according to Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, “is that the banks’ top management simply burns through that cash, socializing the losses for the taxpayer, grabbing any rare gains for management payouts or shareholder dividends, and ending up still undercapitalized.” A different course of action is necessary.During the banking crisis of 1992, Sweden forced its banks to write down all of its toxic assets, took an equity stake in a handful of the largest banks at the cost of their shareholders, and eventually resold the healthy assets on the public market. Since the government held the reckless banks and their shareholders accountable, some officials say that, after the banks were reprivatized, the total cost of the bailout was close to zero.Though Sweden is, of course, an attractive model, we must remember that it was successful because the banks were successfully reprivatized. We must make sure that, if we do nationalize the banks, we minimize the barriers for the private sector to buy healthy bank assets in the future. Also, we must limit this approach to the banking sector. Not all companies should receive this special treatment—in the automotive sector, for instance, we must strongly consider allowing firms to fail if they cannot compete in the open market.President Obama has acknowledged the success of the Swedish model, but he says that “cultural differences” and the relative complexity of our banking system make the model unfit for America. However, only the 19 biggest banks would be up for government receivership. Moreover, keep in mind that the FDIC takes over small banks all the time. Even Alan Greenspan, the image of free-market capitalism as Federal Reserve chairman from 1987 to 2006, has acknowledged that, “once in a hundred years, this is what you do.” Now is certainly looking a lot like one of those times.

As of February 19, 2009, it is acceptable to lie in the pages of the Washington Post. There is no other way to interpret the e-mail that the paper’s ombudsman, Andrew Alexander, sent to reporter Pat Johnson that day, excusing a blatantly error-riddled column on global warming by George Will that the Post had published earlier in the week.Will’s piece is beyond factual defense. The problem is not that he opposes policies to fight climate change. The problem is that, again and again, the piece makes factual statements that are plainly false. Will states that there was a “global cooling” consensus in the 1970s; there was not. Will asserts that there has been no global warming in the past 10 years, citing the World Meteorological Organization; the WMO actually says that the world has been warming since 1998. Will claims that the University of Illinois’s Arctic Climate Research Center has said that global sea levels are at the same level as in 1979; the center quickly responded, clarifying that they had claimed no such thing. These are only three examples; the full list of the piece’s distortions is much longer.Despite these lies and mischaracterizations, Alexander, in his e-mail, refused to censure Will for the piece. Not only that, he echoed approvingly the Post editorial board’s statement that it “checks facts to the fullest extent possible” and even defended one of Will’s more egregious lies from the column.The message was clear. Not only would Will and his editors at the editorial page not apologize for misleading their readers, but the ombudsman, supposedly the readers’ voice at the paper, would defend the distortions. At every level, the Washington Post is prepared to support writers who lie in its pages.The obvious defense—that Will’s is an opinion piece—strains credulity. The objection to Will’s piece is not ideological; indeed, it is highly doubtful that an intellectually honest column arguing against a cap-and-trade system or carbon tax would have provoked a similar uproar. The objection is rather to Will’s repeated mischaracterization of his sources in support of assertions that are simply erroneous. The piece’s presence on the op-ed page does not excuse the editors of the Post’s decision not to pull a column they know is full of errors or penalize Will in any way.While obviously reflecting badly on Will, this incident also concerns the staff of the Post. The value of an established institution like the Washington Post is the trust its readers place in it. When someone reads an issue of the Post, they expect that the factual assertions contained therein are correct because of the Post’s reputation. By printing a column that the most rudimentary fact-checking would have exposed as fatally flawed, the Post has broken that trust.This should trouble everyone publishing in the Post’s pages, from its metro reporters to its style editors. The decision to run Will’s piece has instilled in the public considerable doubt about the publication’s veracity as a whole. If a reader cannot trust that the facts cited on the Post’s op-ed page are true—and, after the Will incident, she cannot—why should she trust the facts in its news coverage or its investigative journalism?Obviously, newspapers should strive for intellectual diversity on their opinion pages. But the old Pat Moynihan quote, “Everyone is entitled to his opinion, but not his own facts,” is a cliché for good reason. By printing and defending George Will’s lies about climate science, the Washington Post has deceived its readers, and undermined its credibility as a journalistic enterprise.Dylan R. Matthews ’12, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Wigglesworth Hall.

Every time a 13-year-old in rural Peru or Tuvalu touches a keyboard, she bypasses the Industrial Revolution and rockets into the Information Age. She can network, learn calculus, study crop-growing techniques, or e-mail a hospital for advice on illness treatment. She can access a wealth of knowledge beyond the horizon fortune has aligned for her. But how much does it really help? Lately, efforts to bring computers to youth in developing areas have been assaulted as ineffective, or even worse—impulsively imperialistic.    Last month, One Laptop per Child—an NGO aiming to provide a $150 laptop to very child in the world—suffered major production setbacks, laid off half of its employees, and came under heavy fire for supposedly misjudging the needs of youth in the developing world from the get-go. Talking heads on all continents profess communities need fresh water and malaria nets before Skype and Wikipedia. After all, there are 2.5 billion people on the planet living on less than $2 per day. They need the bare necessities—and you can’t eat pixels.OLPC was launched three years ago to provide children with “rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected laptops with content and software designed for collaborative, joyful, self-empowered learning.” The machines—called “XOs”—run without electricity and rely on hand cranks for power. Since its beginning, OLPC has distributed about 500,000 XOs in 31 countries. Even better, for $399, a consumer can simultaneously purchase an XO and donate one. OLPC also receives major ad time from worldwide corporations like News Corp, CBS, and Time Warner. Still, they have not sold as well as intended due to hardware problems and government skepticism. Many claim OLPC siphons time and energy from more pressing needs, doesn’t support local infrastructure, and assaults the integrity and dignity of many non-Western cultures. It’s true that the XOs are not survival essentials. At the unveiling of the laptops at the World Economic Forum in 2006, Marthe Dansokho of Cameroon declared that African women who work in the countryside don’t have time to sit with their children and research crops, assuming they’re even literate. But the XO is not a gimmick cure-all. OLPC is not even a laptop program. It’s an education and communication program: the key to smashing cycles of strife. In the long run, this is the right way to go. And, in the long run, they’re not all dead: The global south is not quite the dark abyss of despair the North Atlantic media hypes it up to be: Most people in developing countries find ways to eat and meet their psychological needs each day, although it’s certainly a struggle. OLPC admits that its task is not to cover the basic basics or ease every ill. It is to equip people to improve their lives on their own terms.  Perhaps a more apt criticism of OLPC is that the laptops don’t directly support local educational infrastructure. The project is decentralized and shifts agency to kids and away from state educational systems. OLPC supplies equipment, not teacher training or better curriculum. But there’s no reason why OLPC can’t accompany other state-sponsored initiatives. Ablorde Ashigbi ’11, an OLPC representative, claims, “An XO is never supposed to substitute for a teacher. But it does purposefully empower the children. People don’t realize there’s an insatiable intellectual hunger in many of these areas. My parents, who grew up in Africa, tell stories of reading their one book all night until the candle wax melted into nothing. You can take a laptop anywhere.” Some communities are not comfortable with children browsing foreign advertising, entertainment, and general worldviews whenever they like. There’s a legitimate fear the OLPC pushes flashy consumerism and invasive technology on peoples. Mohammed Diop, a Malinese economist, has attacked the project as an attempt to exploit poor nations by making them pay for millions of impractical machines. To many who are used to a history of false promises and downright lies, allowing a U.S. company to hold a financial stake in the education of their children is anathema. But there is certainly more than one way to be culturally demeaning in development. One way is to make decisions about “them,” without “them.” Another way is to assume peoples are too close-minded to adopt technology or that they would not enjoy the same opportunities as others. So long as the program’s coordinators and supporters don’t adopt a blind charity mentality but converse to find ways to use the equipment best on the terms of recipients, there should be no reason to stop for fear of cultural debasement. So long as OLPC shies away from the popular “Save the Third World from All Its Self-Imposed Problems” rhetoric, tensions can dissipate enough for the laptops to do what they’re supposed to do. OLPC should not lose heart. There may be hardware problems, and even over-ambition problems, but the NGO is on the right track. Indeed, groups around the world are emulating its endeavors: The Indian government is busy working on a laptop for a mere 500 rupees. They should keep smoothing out the kinks: There are 13-year-olds’ horizons to transform.Raúl A. Carrillo ’10, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Lowell House.

Harvard Medical School Professor Edward E. Harlow was awarded $100,000 last Wednesday by the Melanoma Research Foundation to fund his work developing therapeutic approaches to treat melanoma, a skin cancer that kills thousands of Americans each year.The award—the Established Investigator Grant—will support Harlow’s research for two years.Harlow was one of five to be selected from an applicant pool of 60 for this award after a scientific advisory committee looked over all the proposals and chose the most promising ones, according to the Tim Turnham, the foundation’s executive director.“Our goal in funding is to find new treatments that will help patients live longer and better,” he said.Harlow, who was been studying melanoma for about three years, is working to find an indirect way to treat this cancer by targeting genes that support harmful mutations, a method originally proposed in 2005 by Medical School Professor William G. Kaelin, Jr.Harlow is focusing on genes supporting MITF—a gene critical to melanoma growth—and hopes to find a way to control the gene in order to stunt tumor growth.In collaboration with David E. Fisher, the chief of dermatology and director of the Melanoma Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harlow plans to screen about 500 genes to identify which ones MITF depends on.“In our experiment we’re trying to deal with a cell that has cancer...and find things that are essential to the original mutation and attack that,” Harlow said. Fisher said he is looking forward to working with Harlow and having a “cross-campus” collaboration between Mass. General and Harvard’s Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology.According to Professor Andrew B. Lassar, a member of the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harlow’s “work will not only deepen our understanding of the signaling pathways that are necessary for cancers to grow but hopefully will lead to therapeutic interventions.”

A packed audience took a critical look at Disney films last night in Boylston Hall, examining the popular childhood movies and their portrayals of race, gender, and class. The event, “Mickey Mouse Monopoly: Disney, Childhood and Corporate Power,” involved a screening of the documentary of that same name followed by a discussion led by Michael Baran, who teaches Expos 20: “Race in the Americas.”The event was the brainchild of Jessica M. Ch’ng ’12, who saw the documentary in Baran’s course last fall.“I wanted to encourage people to examine popular culture more critically and to encourage dialogue about race and gender,” Ch’ng said.The documentary incorporated scenes from Disney classics like “The Little Mermaid,” “Peter Pan,” “Hercules,” and “Mulan,” and argued that they negatively shape children’s conceptualizations of race and gender beneath a guise of innocence and fantasy.  For instance, the documentary showed clips from “Aladdin,” “The Jungle Book,” and “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” contending that they contain highly sexualized representations of females, and that “Oliver Twist,” “Pocahontas,” and “Peter Pan” communicate stereotyped, white supremacist messages. After the screening, Baran turned to the audience for reactions, sparking a discussion about whether the films’ messages were innocuous or harmful, how portrayals have changed over time, and Disney’s social responsibility.  “Children are being socialized with very strong images,” said Ryan P. Mahoney ’12, recalling stereotypes of torn dresses and headdresses in “Pocahontas.”“Disney is so omnipresent, so it needs to take responsibility for its messages,” he said.Audience members said that the documentary made them realize how deeply certain values had been ingrained in them.“I was conditioned to believe in true love and love at first sight without fail—an idealized notion of romance,” said J. Alex Mays ’12.The screening and discussion was sponsored by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and the Race Relations Proctors.  Brendan W. Randall ’88, a race relations proctor for Ivy Yard, said he was thrilled with the turnout and students’ engagement in the discussion. “I can safely say that this is the most successful race relations event in the last few years,” he said.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

Cambridge Public School Committee member Luc D. Schuster said last week that he will not seek reelection in November, hoping that the early announcement will encourage non-incumbent candidates to run for his seat.Schuster, who was first elected in the fall of 2005 at age 25, said that though serving his two terms on the committee has been “the most meaningful work” of his life, his interests have broadened beyond educational policy. “Local public service is something that everybody should have the opportunity to experience,” he said.A Cambridge native who had gone through the city’s public school system, Schuster said he was originally encouraged to run for school committee by the Green-Rainbow Party of Massachusetts. Schuster, then working as a teacher in CPS, said he noticed that the committee lacked teacher representation. When he was elected, he was the only current teacher on the committee.During his time on the committee, Schuster said he emphasized civics education and helped start a sub-committee to improve the way the school committee’s decision-making process. Schuster said that he, along with other members, strove to help the committee to work “collectively as one rather than seven individuals fighting for four votes.”Committee member Alfred B. Fantini, who is in his thirteenth term, called Schuster a “bright young man who brought our discussions to a healthy and thoughtful level.” Fantini said he tried to convince Schuster to stay but ultimately respected his decision. Schuster said that not having to campaign for re-election will allow him to focus on the superintendent search, the budget, and the district’s controlled choice policy. A current student at the Harvard Kennedy School, Schuster said he will complete his Masters in public policy in 2010 and hopes to run for public office in some capacity in the future.—Staff writer Michelle L.

Before Kenneth B. Schwartz died of terminal lung cancer in 1995, he founded the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, a facility promoting compassionate treatment for patients in part patterned after the care given by his oncologist—Thomas J. Lynch, Jr.Now Lynch, the chief of hematology and oncology at the Mass. General Cancer Center, will leave Harvard after 23 years to become the director of the Yale Cancer Center and physician-in-chief of the Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven Hospital, Yale announced Wednesday.“They gave me the opportunity to take some of the lessons I learned in the phenomenal success of MGH and apply it in a setting like Yale,” Lynch said. “It was an opportunity that was irresistible.”He said that Yale is making a major investment in cancer research, both in clinical care and translational research, and that he has a once in a lifetime opportunity to lead it. Those who worked with Lynch at Mass. General praised him for both his research and mentorship.“Tom is a one in a million, a one in a billion leader,” said Jeffrey A. Engelman, a lung cancer specialist who trained under Lynch. He said that Lynch is a visionary, both in his ability to develop young oncologists and in his research.“This was his chance to build a cancer center from his own vision and he will be extraordinary.” Engleman said.  He said that Lynch, along with Cancer Center Director Daniel A. Haber, led what was probably the biggest discovery in lung cancer in the last 20 years. Lynch helped identify a new kind of mutation in the EGF receptor that has led to treatment for patients with this genetic mutation.“Because of this work we now routinely do this genetic test on our patients, and if they have this mutation, they take a pill once a day and have a great chance of achieving remission,” Engleman said. “In lung cancer, remissions are normally hard to come by.”In addition to his research and clinical work, Lynch founded Rounds, a program at the Schwartz Center that provides a monthly forum for hospital personnel to talk about their experiences during patient treatment. The program has spread to 165 sites around the nation and involves more than 37,000 doctors. Lynch still runs the sessions for over 125 people at Mass. General, according to Julie Rosen, the Schwartz Center’s executive director.“He is a superb administrator and he is a superb human being,” Rosen said. “He is the doctor you want if you or your family member gets sick.”—Staff writer Laura G.

Massachusetts General Hospital violated Boston regulations last week when it waited four days to report a gastrointestinal infection that had stricken nine patients and 18 staff members on one floor of the building.According to The Boston Globe, Mass. General—a Harvard Medical School affiliate—had known about the outbreak since Feb. 15, immediately prompting administrators to stop sending new patients into the ward. But hospital officials did not notify the Boston Public Health Commission until Feb. 18, breaking a city regulation that requires institutions to alert authorities of potential outbreaks within 24 hours of discovery.Commission spokeswoman Ann Scales said that early notification is important to prevent the disease from mushrooming.“We were not very happy to find out four days later.” Scales said, adding that the delay was out of character for Mass. General.She said that the commission wants to ensure that Mass. General has all the information it needs to address such problems properly in the future.“The idea is not to be punitive, but to call them out on it,” she said.Anita Barry, the Commission’s director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease, told the Globe that her agency would engage with the hospital to discuss prevention of similar episodes.“If we don’t hear about these smaller groups first, how can you start to identify if there’s a larger issue?” she said in a interview with the Globe, citing concerns that hospital staff carry the disease to more than one healthcare institution.Neither Barry nor representatives from Mass. General could be reached for further comment yesterday.Gastrointestenal disease, or GI, is an infection that causes nausea, vomitting, and diarrhea, and lasts 24 to 48 hours. —Staff writer Sean R.

Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement (SLAM) posted 400 Valentines in the Science Center this week to protest University investment with HEI Hotels and Resorts, a company accused of violating its workers’ rights. The valentines read, “I love Harvard because [blank] but I’d love it even more if it invested responsibly.” Students filled in the blanks with individualized thoughts, such as “it is a second home,” “it’s so diverse,” and “Expos rocks.” The students’ protest stemmed from allegations about the HEI’s treatment of workers, and in particular accusations of high worker injury rates, anti-union intimidation, and low wages, according to John F. Bowman ’11, one of the protest’s organizers. Bowman said that Harvard has at least $69.9 million invested in HEI, though the actual investment may be larger.The students launched the protest following a joint meeting with Yale and Brown two weeks before Valentine’s Day. Representatives from the three schools met in Providence and decided to organize the protest in order to show student solidarity for the movement against the company.HEI Hotels draws approximately 80 percent of its funding from university endowments.Students from Harvard agreed that while they would not call for divestment, they would encourage the University not to pursue further investment until the labor issues have been addressed. They also decided that they would encourage Harvard to take a more proactive stance in resolving this issue.“We want Harvard to engage in dialogue with executives at HEI Hotels and Resorts, which means making a phone call and talking to the HEI executives and finding out why there is a labor dispute,” Bowman said.For the protest, SLAM members collected the valentines by tabling at various dining halls and reaching out to several student organizations, including the Harvard College Democrats and Phillips Brooks House Association groups. SLAM members displayed the valentines on posters and presented them to President Drew G. Faust, who responded by promising to set up a meeting with Marc Goodheart ’81—the secretary to Harvard’s chief governing boards. Students expressed optimism that Faust would follow through with her promise.“We hope that the University acknowledges our multiple attempts to bring this issue that students care about to them,” said SLAM member Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09. “We hope they’ll see that HEI is a really irresponsible company.”—Staff writer Evan T.R. Rosenman can be reached at erosenm@fas.harvard.edu.

In a sharply-worded letter sent to University President Drew G. Faust yesterday, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino expressed his “grave disappointment” at the University’s decision to slow construction of the Allston Science Complex, and listed a set of community concerns that he expected Harvard to address in the near future.
“The University may not make unilateral decisions [regarding construction in Allston],” Menino wrote, emphasizing that Harvard’s actions inherently affect the local neighborhood.
“The City’s ability to review and approve steps going forward in this process will require direct and open dialogue between the parties,” he wrote. 
University spokeswoman Lauren Marshall said that Harvard understands the issues the Mayor raised in the letter, and that the University “looks forward to working with the City and the Allston neighborhood to address the concerns highlighted by the Mayor.” 
Menino has engaged in an on-going dialogue with University officials regarding construction in Allston, and he met with Faust last Tuesday to discuss a possible slowing of construction. 
Many of the actions and discussions he requested in the letter mirror demands made by local residents at the Harvard Allston Task Force meeting on Monday. 
The letter called for Harvard to provide details within roughly two weeks about the budgetary quandary that forced the construction slowdown, as well as an outline of the slowdown’s impact on contracted workers. Menino also wrote that within 30 days, Harvard should provide a community impacts mitigation plan for the construction slowdown, as well as a proposed schedule for the development of the Institutional Master Plan for the Allston campus that identifies a “transformative project for the community.” 
At a task force meeting in early February, Chief University Planner Kathy A. Spiegelman said that it was unlikely the University would file an updated IMP in early 2009 as planned, due to financial stress.
Longer-term requests from Menino include an inventory of the University’s property holdings in Allston not being used for institutional purposes, a report on the interim uses of such property, a memorandum detailing conditions under which Harvard may purchase more property, and an outline describing “the immediate development of a more active involvement of the university in the North Allston community.” 
Task force member and long-time Allston resident Paul Berkeley said everything in the Mayor’s letter is doable within the specified time frames, but whether or not Harvard will agree to proceed according to the schedule is another issue. 
“It’s up to [Harvard] to either agree to do it, or to go back to [the Mayor] and tell him if they need more time for some issues,” Berkeley said. Nevertheless, he said he appreciated the new-found tone of Menino’s letter.
“I see a shift here where the city is kind of stepping up and saying, ‘We’re going to take some control of this process here,’” Berkeley said, noting that in the past residents “had to sit back and wait” to react to Harvard’s construction plans and goals. He added that he thought the Mayor was “not being a bully,” and appreciated the Mayor’s recognition of the on-going working relationship between the City and University.

The Holyoke Center—home to  many of Harvard’s administrative offices—has taken University cost-cutting recommendations to heart, instituting a series of penny-pinching measures to cut operation expenses.
The changes took effect last week and span a variety of maintenance services, including the frequency with which the carpeted areas are vacuumed and the bathrooms cleaned. The two elevators facing Mt. Auburn Street will no longer be shuttling employees up to their offices overlooking the Square. A piece of paper taped over the elevator buttons explains that shutting down the elevators will “save energy and reduce occupancy costs” incurred by the 10-story building’s tenants.
Notices listing the changes were displayed on walls throughout the building. Staff were notified of the news via e-mail but not informed how much would be saved by implementing such measures.
Representatives from Harvard Real Estate Services, which conceived the energy-saving plan, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Across the University, changes have already been evident. In an effort to reduce costs, custodial directors from Harvard Medical School have also reevaluated the number of times that highly visible locations—such as restrooms and labs—need to be cleaned, determining that the frequency may be reduced to only twice a week or weekly.
Though the changes at the Holyoke Center are relatively minor and more symbolic than anything, its effects did not go unnoticed by staff.
“The cleaning lady doesn’t come every morning anymore,” mused Eric A. Nitschke, a staff assistant who works on the third floor. “I miss her.”
Blue recycling bins peeking out from under office desks will no longer be emptied by the cleaning crews. Staff and administrators will now be responsible for transporting the bins themselves to the communal receptacles at the end of the hall.
“It’s going to be a little more laborious for us,” Nitschke said, as the notice also asked staff to be more “conscientious” about cleaning up self-created mess and washing food-encrusted dishes in the kitchens located on each floor.
Nitschke added that he and his colleagues have speculated whether there will be “sanitary issues” in the restrooms—particularly the men’s. 
According to the notice, the management team deemed the state of those restrooms to be adequate after “successfully piloting” a reduced cleaning schedule on the eighth and tenth floors. Specific “conditions” will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
But some employees in the Holoyke Center have felt little impact from the steps the management team has taken to weather the financial crisis.
Sarah S. Bennett-Astesano, an assistant director of the Office of Work/Life on the sixth floor, said that the now inoperative elevators that used to shuttle her and her colleagues directly to the top five floors “spoiled” her. But any complaints raised at this point, she said, would only reflect a general laziness.
“It’s good for people,” Bennett-Astesano said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan ascended to the masthead of the storied Harvard Law Review, she inherited a journal that had gone unpublished for four issues due to the previous year’s dysfunctional student management. As supervising editor, Kagan played a central role in bringing the journal up to speed, sacrificing much of a summer to complete her predecessors’ unfinished issues.Nearly 20 years later, Kagan rose to lead the Law School, another institution plagued by infighting and discontent. Though it had begun to experience a revival, the school still faced major unresolved issues when she assumed the deanship in 2003.The peace and institutional reform during Kagan’s tenure as dean of the Law School have marked a significant shift from the ideological battles in the 1980s and early 1990s, when a warring faculty became symbolic of the school’s larger problems.Kagan embarked on a wide-ranging reform campaign to address many of the issues she had experienced firsthand as a student at the Law School, hoping to improve the student experience that many describe as cold and unwelcoming.Hailed by students for providing free coffee and an ice skating rink—which administrators have pledged to spare from of budget cuts—Kagan has achieved a series of major successes including the completion of the largest capital campaign in the history of legal education and the start of a large-scale construction project known as the Northwest Corner.Kagan’s colleagues and former classmates echo one another in saying that her own experience as a Law School student shaped not only her character, but her vision for the future of the school and her approach to her next would-be position as solicitor general in President Barack Obama’s administration.‘ONE OF A MILLION’Kagan speaks fondly of her years at the Law School but acknowledges that her positive memories were the exception rather than the norm.“When I was here in the mid-80s, those weren’t the best years. That was the baseline I had for the Law School,” Kagan said in an interview last October. “I had a very fine experience, but I was always conscious that most students did not have that view.”Many of Kagan’s former classmates cite large class size as the driving factor behind the widespread grumbling among the student body. Compared to other top-tier schools such as Yale or Stanford—which have been characterized as having happier students—Harvard’s class size is roughly three times as large.“It was easy to think you were one of a million,” says William K. Kelley, a fellow student who worked under Kagan on the Law Review.As Dean, Kagan embarked on an ambitious expansion of the faculty to decrease class sizes, bringing the total number to 102 full-time professors before recent departures for the Obama administration. In the process, she has poached more tenured faculty—including Cass R. Sunstein ’75, the most cited legal scholar in the country—from other institutions during her five-year deanship than during the previous 20 years combined.Other programs that Kagan introduced testify to the six years she spent soaking up a more collegial atmosphere as a University of Chicago professor, her first academic appointment. In an effort to improve the student experience—academic, residential, and social—she brought both the clinical writing program and that school’s then Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove from Chicago to the Charles.These changes have caught the attention and acclaim of legal institutions nationwide and have even elicited dismay from administrators at rival schools that have lost top faculty to Harvard.“Competitors don’t naturally say great things about you, but I think all this has been noticed across the world,” Kagan says.NO LONGER AN AFTERTHOUGHTDespite the structural problems that Law School faculty and administrators freely acknowledge, most negative impressions of the Law School from both former and current students seem to com from a vague sense of neglect and disregard from professors and administrators, rather than specific grievances.Law School Professor Carol S. Steiker ’82, who served as president of the Law Review when Kagan was supervising editor, says the competitive atmosphere was a source of discontent among her fellow students. As a result, only a small subset of the student body, such as many members of the elite Law Review, felt they received attention from the aloof faculty.“The people who were stars got a lot of pats on the back,” Steiker says, “but those who weren’t, didn’t feel sufficiently appreciated.”By switching to a pass/fail grading system last fall, Kagan says she has taken a step toward reducing the perceived level of competition—though students acknowledge that competition is a way of life at Harvard. For her part, Kagan calls her student body “extraordinary” and a “privilege to teach.” Her willingness to hear student views contributes to what has been described as a shift in institutional culture to treat students as more than an afterthought at the august school.“I very much wanted to instill an attitude that the reason we were doing this was the students, the measure of our success was the student experience,” Kagan says.BEIRUT ON THE CHARLESThe absence of community cohesion among the student body during the 1980s and early 1990s may have trickled down from the spirited and sometimes vitriolic debates held during classes, as professors from both ends of the political spectrum flaunted their ideological differences.While many students saw the heated discussions as “amusing” incidents, others felt that they created unnecessary tension and divisiveness outside the classroom. Students who held unpopular views sometimes found themselves the target of personal attacks.“Students were hissing at unpopular political views and really hot political issues,” Steiker says. “The political dysfunction slopped over into student life.”Beyond making life uncomfortable for the political minority, the ideological divides among the faculty also hamstrung lateral hiring efforts for the two decades prior to Kagan’s deanship. Because a new candidate requires a two-thirds majority vote of approval in the faculty, professors who were ideologically opposed to new hires could and did grind the hiring process to a halt.In contrast, Kagan introduced an emphasis on open-minded thinking, welcoming academicians from across the political spectrum, and even hiring noted conservative and Bush administration attorney Jack L. Goldsmith. Her efforts to reach across divides were already evident during her time as editor of the Law Review, say colleagues at the journal.They ascribe the success of her leadership as a member of the masthead to her earnest determination to express an idea accurately and to her ability to judge an idea on its merits, instead of through a politicized perspective. They describe working with the future dean as a welcome respite from the school’s political battles, saying she applied a measure of fairness absent from many of the debates that characterized that era at the Law School.Unlike many argumentative law students who perpetuated the politicized mindset of the time, Kagan was skilled in the art of listening to conflicting viewpoints, her classmates say.“She was the adult presence in the room, the one who could get people to sit down and reconcile their differences,” says Owen J. Clements, a member of the Law Review under Kagan’s leadership. “She struck me as wise beyond her years.”D.C.-BOUNDNominated to the post of solicitor general, Kagan may soon have the opportunity to exercise her diplomatic skills in the political arena, returning to a realm she left in 1999 after working for several years as an adviser in the Clinton White House.Though critics point to her lack of experience arguing before the Supreme Court—a key duty of the solicitor general—her supporters say that the skills and qualities that served Kagan well since her days as a student will allow her to succeed in her new role.“A lot of the extraordinary qualities, her brilliance, and the ability to bridge divides were evident then,” Steiker says, “and I think those things are evident now.”Steiker also pinpoints Kagan’s “very natural, New Yorky” grounding as one of the sources of her likability.Kagan’s “somewhat self-effacing” sense of humor makes her an engaging personality who can connect well with a diverse group of people, Steiker says. During the Senate confirmation hearing, Kagan elicited chuckles from the panel by calling herself a “pipsqueak” clerking for then-Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, whom she called “a giant of the law.”“It’s almost an anti-charisma kind of charisma, but it’s very, very charming,” Steiker says.When Kagan was passed over for the University presidency two years ago, students at the Law School threw a “We (Heart) Kagan” party to celebrate her continued presence there. As the Senate prepares to vote on her nomination, Kagan will likely depart the institution where students and faculty alike sing her praises.Kagan, though, reflects back on her accomplishments in a characteristically unassuming manner, pondering the rare missteps that faded out of institutional memory in the face of her many successes.“You try not to make mistakes.” she says, “but if you never fail, it means you weren’t doing enough.”—Staff writer Elias J.

Harvard Kennedy School Professor Ashton B. Carter was named the U.S. military’s chief weapons buyer by President Barack Obama on Monday.Carter—who is co-director of the Preventive Defense Project—has been a vocal critic of the Pentagon for purchasing what he deems to be unnecessary weapons and has called for greater alignment between military strategy and spending.Carter was originally scheduled to teach the class “American National Security Policy” at the Kennedy School this spring, but he joins the growing list of Harvard professors who have traded their office in Cambridge for one in DC.This hasn’t been the first time that Carter has worked for a presidential administration. More than a decade ago, Carter served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy for three years during the Clinton administration. As Assistant Secretary of Defense, he dealt with the possession of weapons of mass destruction in the United States and abroad. In particular, Carter worked toward the removal of nuclear weapons from parts of the former Soviet Union and managed military planning during the U.S.’s response to North Korea’s growing nuclear program in 1994.Carter also oversaw the Department of Defense’s Counterproliferation Initiative and managed the reform of DOD’s national security export controls.His colleagues at the Kennedy School said they were optimistic about his upcoming tenure in DC. “The Belfer Center [for Science and International Affairs] and Harvard Kennedy School will have a difficult time filling the void Ash will leave, but he is setting such a wonderful example of what this school and center are about: putting policy into practice,” said Graham T. Allison ’62—a colleague of Carter’s at the Belfer Center—in a statement released yesterday. Former Dean of the Kennedy School Joseph S. Nye, who has been offered the position of U.S. ambassador to Japan, echoed Allison’s statement, calling the nomination a “terrific choice” when rumors of Carter’s potential nomination first circulated. Though Carter is a leading expert on arms control, he has not spent his career in either government procurement or with the weapons industry besides his stint as Assistant Secretary of Defense.Instead Carter, who graduated from Yale with a degree in physics and medieval history and earned his doctorate at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, has worked at Harvard since 1984.—Staff writer Lauren D.

Harvard has inked a custom loan arrangement with financial services giant JPMorgan Chase designed to make it easier for international graduate students to fund their education, University officials announced Friday.The recently signed deal with JPMorgan, which had been in the works for over six months to replace a previous arrangement with Citibank, will provide eligible international students with loans up to the total cost of attendance at Harvard’s graduate schools.The announcement did not contain further details for the program, and both JPMorgan and a number of Harvard financial aid officers declined to comment Friday afternoon.International students have historically had difficulty finding suitable loan options, as they are ineligible for federal aid.A previous arrangement with Citibank, the consumer and corporate banking arm of Citigroup, allowed international students to take out loans without a cosigner, a requirement for most student loans.The announcement did not specify whether the newly negotiated partnership with JPMorgan will contain the same provision.Citibank terminated its arrangement with Harvard in early October, citing the effects of the frozen credit markets. International students typically have a higher probability of defaulting on their loans than American students, a Citibank spokesman said at the time.The bank had also canceled similar agreements with other schools including MIT and the University of Michigan.The abrupt termination of the program left Harvard administrators scrambling to find ways to maintain their commitment to financial aid across the University.University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly said that Harvard will sustain current levels of graduate student financial aid for the next year—which she has deemed one of the University’s top priorities—even at the expense of other programs in school operating budgets.In the past year, the University had rolled out a series of financial aid expansions, including programs at the College, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Medical School that University officials hailed as a renewed commitment to meeting student need.University officials said they will continue to explore additional programs for all students in order to increase the flexibility of loan options.—Staff writer Athena Y.

In a single regular season, a Harvard squash player meets each equally seeded adversary from opposing teams only once.  It is a fleeting opportunity to upset the competition and climb in the national rankings. If there’s a time for individual skills to be tested, rematches to be played, and grudges to be settled, it’s this weekend as members of the Crimson head to the 2009 Collegiate Squash Association (CSA) Individual Championships.“You only get to play each team once during the regular season,” said junior No. 1 Colin West. “[This is] definitely going to be a good weekend for some possible redemption.”Much of the men’s and women’s teams traveled to Williams yesterday to compete in what will be a very competitive national field. Tournament play begins this morning with first round match-ups and concludes on Sunday with championship matches scheduled to begin at 4:00 pm.Each year the CSA compiles team and individual squash rankings according to results from individual collegiate matches played during the season and updates these rankings monthly. At the season’s conclusion, the CSA invites the nation’s top 160 individual players (80 men and 80 women) to compete for individual titles. This year, 56 colleges will be represented at Williams, providing a breadth of talent and opportunity for stellar match-ups.“It is pretty exciting to see all of the best players in one place,” said junior No. 7 Frank Cohen.Last weekend, the Crimson traveled to Princeton for the CSA Team Championships. The squad was ranked fifth headed into the tournament but finished the weekend in fourth place. In the first round, Harvard took revenge on No. 4 Cornell, a team they had lost to, 6-3, earlier in the season. This time around, the Crimson had the edge and defeated their Big Red opponents, 5-4. A loss against eventual-champion Trinity sent the Crimson into the bronze medal matchup against a strong Rochester team, where it battled for third, but came up short, losing 7-2.Harvard deemed the fourth place finish a success, but the team is looking to exhibit its individual talent and make a big impact on the college squash scene in its final showing this season.“Because this is an individual tournament, the goals are individual,” said Cohen. “Colin is going to play for a national championship and we are really amped up about that, and Richard Hill is looking to repeat as winner of the B bracket.”West, ranked No. 3 in the country entering the tournament, will play in the A bracket and is Harvard’s best chance at claiming a National title. Among those entered in the tournament are Princeton’s Mauricio Sanchez and Trinity’s Baset Chaudhry, the only players who have defeated West this season .“I’m very excited to get another shot at the two guys who beat me earlier this year,” West said.Sanchez and Chaudhry won’t be the only talents that West may face. The junior will have to contend both against players from outside the Ivy League as well as lower-ranked opponents who may pose threats to West’s run at the title. Last year, West lost in the quarterfinals to Kimlee Wong.“It is very difficult [during the season] to say who is better,” said West. “[If it is] number seven on Harvard versus the number three on Dartmouth, you can never be sure [who will win]. This [tournament] is a great way to get different matches that no one has ever played before.”The top 32 players compete in the A bracket with the remaining competing in the B division. Captain Verdi DiSesa, Harvard’s No. 2, and No. 3 Senior Niko Hrdy will join West in A bracket competition. Each of the three stands a chance at earning All-American honors, which are awarded to the final top-20 players.Last year sophomore No. 6 Richard Hill was the only member of the Crimson to advance to the third day of tournament play, where he captured the Malloy Cup as winner of the B bracket.Harvard will look to strong individual performances to cap off an already successful season. The young team’s performance this weekend may be a preview of what we can expect to see next year.

Yesterday, we learned that Harvard has unlocked the secret to weight loss: eat less. Oh, and by the way, exercise helps too.
And the media is apparently starving for news, because they're gobbling it all up.
Check out the headlines from USA Today, U.S. News and World Report, Reuters, CNN, The Boston Herald, The Boston Globe, and yes, even The Gray Lady was shocked by the breaking news.
And readers were about as impressed as we were:
“Wow that's brilliant. Eat less, move more -- lose weight. How much did the taxpayers pay for this study?”
“It's absurd that this is newsworthy, but what's even more absurd is that we waste thousands upon thousands of dollars to ‘scientifically prove’ that eating less leads to weight loss.”
“Good Lord, my doctor told me that years ago. This is news.”
At least U.S. News and World Report tried to spice it up by introducing some doubt: “This might not be the end of the debate, however.”
But perhaps USA Today said it best: “Yes, it does seem like common sense…”
Ya think?

The next big thing on campus: giving up alcohol for Lent. The season of sacrifice is upon us, and the campus Christians are all deciding what to avoid for 40 days. Candy, soda, and swearing are the easy choices reserved for children; the big kids need more of a challenge. Alcohol is the staple of college life, so giving it up is a logical choice.
Ayn Rand once said there is no such thing as a selfless act, and it turns out that this phenomenon is no exception. My own highly scientific, super official survey showed that a number of people abstaining from liquor were doing it to cut calories and get in shape for spring.  Move over Beyoncé, Jesus has the newest diet trend to sweep the campus.
This means two things. 1) The next few weekends won’t be very fun for those of you who rely on alcohol to spit game for you. 2) Easter Sunday is going to be the craziest night since New Year’s Eve, since a good chunk of campus will suddenly have a much lower tolerance.
So even if you’re not giving up anything for Lent, if you can survive for 40 days, you’ll be rewarded with hotter and, uh, friendlier potential dates.

Need plane tickets home this spring break but still having trouble with that whole calendar thing?
Two Harvard students want you to start booking flights through their aptly named GetOutofCambridge.com, a site whose main advantage over existing services seems to be a set of garish-looking buttons that give you the right dates for Harvard breaks.
What are its prospects for success? Harvard students may well be lazy enough to make this site work.
Our prediction, on a scale of 0 to Facebook:  .0005

Fran Drescher, comic star of the '90s sitcom "The Nanny," visited Harvard yesterday. The star spent her afternoon talking to students at Lamont about her experiences as an accomplished actress, best-selling author, and cancer survivor. Then she went for a night on the town. Find out more after the jump...
Much later Thursday night, Fran was spotted partying at the Hasty Pudding social club and the Harvard Lampoon -- a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to publish a so-called humor magazine. Sources say after a few (too many) drinks, Fran got pretty cozy with one of the members.
Did this nanny rob the cradle?

Well, almost. Harvard Athletics and Qdoba Mexican Grill are awarding a taco bar to the House with the most students in attendance at this weekend’s Harvard sporting events. Sure,it’s not Chipotle, but anything's better than HUDS. Find out more after the jump…
Students attending the 7:30 p.m. Men’s Hockey game tonight v. Quinnipiac were able to swipe their Harvard IDs at the game to count toward the attendance tally. Tomorrow’s 2:00 p.m. Women’s Hockey Game and 7:00 p.m. Men’s Basketball Game, both vs. Cornell, will also count toward the weekend total.
This isn’t the first delicious Qdoba giveaway this month. We loved the free tortilla soups coupons hidden in The Indy a few weeks ago. Didn’t see them? Don’t worry. We stole your copies and used your coupons. So all you taco lovers, grab as many of your housemates as you can find and drag them across the river, and make sure to leave early: if sports don't bring Harvard students together, food always will.

Your funding applications are finished and you need a way to forget about the seven-page essay you have due on Monday. We’ve got you covered. We tracked down the hottest events of the night (read: ones you can get in to), so put down that p-set and take your pick.
UNRATED
The over-circulated e-mail for this party promises that those in attendance will “find out what Friday nights should really be about.” Unfortunately, the answer is not a dining hall party. The advertisement also claims the party is not like those other “PG-13 parties.”
Since when were Harvard parties up to “PG-13” level? Also, will there be nudity, or just someone saying the "f-word" more than once?
When: 10 p.m. – 2 a.m.      Where: Pfoho D-Hall     Price: $7
Renaissance Ball
If you prefer to get your groove on in a classier setting, stop by the BSA’s Renaissance Ball at the Hyatt Regency in Boston. This year’s theme is “an exotic escape,” which sounds like it could be the name of a spa or the tagline on a bottle of fruity perfume. Maybe the dance floor will smell like a floral medley with a hint of tangerine. Doubtful.
When: 9 p.m. – 1 a.m.    Where: Hyatt Regency Hotel in Boston   Price: $25 at the door
Angels in the Oppfield
If you’d rather spend you night listening to the sweet sounds of a capella than Flo Rida’s latest hit, this is the spot for you. Two female a capella groups, the Opportunes and the Fallen Angels (hence the clever title) are holding a concert in Sanders Theater tonight. What's more Harvard than spending your Friday night listening to a capella? (Maybe doing that p-set...)
Where: Sanders Theater    When: 8 p.m.     Price: $8
And what a better way to nurse your aching head tomorrow than with some women’s hockey? Answer.
