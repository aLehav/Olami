After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
The Harvard Kennedy School of Government has reached a crisis point when it comes to racial inequity and injustice. This is not just our opinion but one shared by multiple affinity groups on campus and 375 Kennedy School affiliates who have signed a letter calling on the Kennedy School to create a “culture and environment built on the principles of anti-racism.” This problem is not new. The Kennedy School has a well-documented history of struggling “to recruit and maintain minorities” as professors; prior students have demanded “more attention to issues of race and racism in curriculum”; and current students say “institutional racism lives at HKS.”
That’s why we’re so disappointed to see a recent article “Harvard Kennedy School Dean Elmendorf Says He Supports the ‘Passion’ of Student Activists” (February 27). While we appreciate Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf’s engagement and the steps the Kennedy School has taken, they are too little too late. For example, the open letter called for “a mandatory course on the history of race and inequality for Fall 2020.” Dean Elmendorf’s proposal to incorporate these issues into existing classes is inadequate. The choices we make reflect our values, and the decision to not include a core, mandatory course on race and inequality speaks volumes. It also continues to fail students who need this knowledge to avoid perpetuating systems of oppression in their public policy work.
We were also disappointed to see that no student voices were included in this piece, especially given The Crimson’s public commitment to “make every effort to contact the individuals and institutions we write about.” Instead of giving the the Kennedy School administration yet another opportunity to avoid meaningful collaboration with students, The Crimson should have included the voices of students who have been working to hold the Kennedy School accountable. Recognizing our passion is not enough. We demand real change, and we won’t wait.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2020 Democratic candidate must have the temperament and platform that motivates every Democrat — not to mention their independent father — out to the polls. That candidate is Elizabeth Warren — and not just because she is an emerita professor at Harvard Law School.
Two overarching questions face Democrats right now. The first question asks, “Will Democrats win 2020 by appealing to the median voter, or will they win by mobilizing the Progressive flank?” And the second question asks, “Is Trump an aberration, or is he a symptom of the nation’s deeper ailments?”
I am not the first to raise these questions — just go over to CGIS and you’ll hear them debated ad nauseum. But as Super Tuesday approaches and many Harvardians gear up to vote in Massachusetts or mail ballots home, people outside the political punditry must fiercely interrogate these questions themselves. After all, how we answer them matters for how we answer the bigger question of who is best positioned to beat Donald Trump in November.
If Democrats believe that galvanizing the progressive vote will carry them to victory in 2020 and that Trump is symptomatic of deeper issues, then the logical conclusion is to nominate Bernie Sanders. Conversely, if Democrats believe that victory rests with the median voter and that Trump was an aberration, then the logical conclusion is to put forward Joe Biden, Michael Bloomberg, or Amy Klobuchar— who can appeal to middle-of-the-road America.
The answers to these two questions, however, are not so black and white. Looking at 2016 voting, for instance, it is noteworthy that 12 percent of Sanders's primary voters ultimately voted for Trump, which should be a cautionary tale about nominating a candidate with lackluster progressive credentials. Still another 12 percent of Republican primary voters (particularly supporters of John Kasich and Marco Rubio) cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton, indicating that the median voter is not “dead” as many progressives decry. It would therefore be dangerous to put forward either a progressive who risks alienating the median voter or a moderate who can’t keep progressives in the fold.
Let’s instead nominate a candidate positioned to straddle the intraparty rift; who promises to usher in big, structural change while not going so far as to abandon America’s core systems; who dreams big and fights hard; who refuses to hold her punches. Let’s nominate Senator Elizabeth Warren.
When it comes to envisioning a more equitable America, Warren is unparalleled. Her dizzyingly comprehensive agenda, genuine sensitivity to issues of race, gender, and identity, and expansive interpretation of executive power qualify her as the best standard-bearer for the progressive cause, not Bernie.
Unlike Sanders, Warren has spent the past 40 years studying the factors exacerbating inequality and degrading American mobility. Unlike Sanders, Warren has the record of creating a highly effective federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has returned $12.4 billion back to American households cheated by financial companies. And unlike Sanders, Warren has actually fulfilled her Senatorial duty and legislated — the primary sponsor on nine Senate bills, compared to Sanders’s three, and since 2013, a co-sponsor on 50 laws, compared to Sanders’s 17 over the same period. Warren is therefore the more qualified representative of the progressive cause, eager to pick up the fragmented pieces of the executive branch and better people’s lives through the subtle yet seismic push-and-pull of regulatory levers.
Warren would also handily maintain moderate’s support.
First, Warren’s establishment support — proxied by endorsements — is surpassed only by Biden and Bloomberg, according to FiveThirtyEight’s analysis. And I would argue that merely analyzing Warren’s endorsements from the likes of Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Julian Castro, Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) actually under-estimate her cache. After all, she was also a professor at Harvard Law School, where she taught current members of Congress, including Katie Porter (D-Calif.), and Kennedy, both of whom formally endorsed her, and she maintains strong ties to the Obama administration from her days building the CFPB and cleaning up after the Global Financial Crisis.
Second, the mantelpieces for Warren’s campaign — anti-corruption, reviving the American Dream for all, education, and labor rights — are broadly popular among the American electorate, which will motivate Moderates to embrace her platform given their belief in victory through broad appeal. In turn, down-ballot Democrats will be able to ride Warren’s coattails with a laser-focus on not-so-sexy but oh-so-important policies.
Finally, Warren elevates reform over revolution, channeling the legal and political traditions of Louis Brandeis, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, and Lyndon B. Johnson to inform her plans for a more equitable and just America. These three figures are demigods in Democratic lore, and Warren gives Democrats the chance to revive some of that transformational glory.
Up until this point, the electability conversation has focused too much on individual candidates and too little on party unity. So, before we cast the last ballot, let’s be straight with ourselves: Neither moderates nor progressives will win without each other, and neither moderates nor progressives can govern alone. There is only one candidate positioned to unify the party. That candidate is Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Warren is ready to roll up the sleeves of her Nina McLemore blazer and fight like the dickens. Her persistence, her intellect, and her fierceness is Trump’s worst nightmare. And it is the Democrats’ best shot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What’s the largest amount of money that you can think of?
The biggest U.S. lottery jackpot of all time was $1.586 billion. The total net worth of the world’s richest man, Jeff Bezos, is estimated to be $116 billion (at the time of publishing). And in 2018, the Gross Domestic Product of the entire world was $85.910 trillion. With those figures in mind, I ask again: what’s the most money that you can imagine?
There is an asteroid between Mars and Jupiter, named 511 Davida, which is estimated to be worth $15.4 quintillion. That’s 15,400,000,000,000,000,000 dollars — in other words, just enough money to afford popcorn at your next trip to the movies. In fact, Davida is one of a few dozen asteroids in our solar system that are valued at over a quintillion dollars; hundreds more are valued in the trillion- and quadrillion-dollar range.
Given those numbers, it should come as no surprise that, since the start of the century, numerous companies have emerged seeking to bring asteroid mining from science fiction to reality.
There are two main ways to accomplish this feat. The first involves launching an unmanned spacecraft equipped with mining gear, which would collect a chunk of an asteroid and bring it back to Earth. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency has proven that this is technically feasible; its Hayabusa mission brought asteroid dust samples back to Earth in 2010, while its Hayabusa 2 mission is expected to bring back larger samples later this year.
The second method is more ambitious. As the research shows, we could hypothetically build a spacecraft that could capture a small asteroid and place it in orbit around the Earth or the Moon. Once it’s that close, we could collect the mineral resources with relative ease; with the right asteroids, this could allow trillions of dollars worth of material to be brought to Earth.
If asteroid mining does take off as the next big industry — as some magazines have predicted — then this would certainly have its benefits; the most obvious is a potentially massive economic boost to us here on Earth. (Looking at the Dow, we could certainly use one right now.)
If asteroid mining were carried out by a government agency like NASA, the unbelievably high profits could be used to support a host of beneficial causes, from funding welfare programs to supporting scientific research. If, on the other hand, asteroid mining was performed by private companies, the monetary benefits would certainly not be as widespread. Even so, this money would be a big boost to the global economy — and governments could still profit off of it through high corporate taxes.
Of course, introducing a massive amount of precious metals into the global economy would steeply devalue those materials, so the overall profits of asteroid mining will probably be far lower than they appear on paper.
But asteroid mining could also help lessen the destruction caused by current mining here on Earth. The Guardian reports that “Extraction and primary processing of metals and other minerals is responsible for 20% of health impacts from air pollution and 26% of global carbon emissions.” If we shift our attention from the Earth to the sky in order to satisfy our needs for certain minerals, we could avoid much of the environmental degradation caused by Earth-based mining today. Plus, if humans were to deplete Earth’s cheap mineral resources — which we are in the process of doing — mining asteroids may one day be viewed as a necessity.
That being said, advocates of asteroid mining must be mindful of the ideology underpinning their movement. I found myself fascinated by Asterank’s interactive table of asteroids. The chart lays out the distance of the solar system’s asteroids from the Sun, the eccentricity of their orbits, and their velocity — so far, all things you might expect to see in an astronomy textbook. But the central two columns stick out like sore thumbs: “Value ($)” and “Est. Profit ($).”
Viewing asteroids through the lens of “How profitable might they be?” can have dangerous implications. If we begin our exploration into space with a profit-oriented mindset, then the next few centuries of space travel will likely be dominated by that perspective; we’ll enter a period of space exploitation, not space exploration. And, if we don’t restrain that mindset, scientists warn that we could use up all the solar system’s essential resources in a matter of centuries.
So, the prospect of asteroid mining offers a turning point for how humanity interacts with the natural universe. Will we allow ourselves to be ruled by greed, quickly gobbling up all the natural resources within reach of our spacecraft? Or will we use space travel as a tool to explore and appreciate our planet’s surroundings, taking only the resources that we truly need? The choice is ours — and it’s a choice that will affect humanity’s future for centuries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department will be undergoing a review of its internal climate with the help of national policing experts Ronald L. Davis and Brenda J. Bond-Fortier. The review, which will be spearheaded by HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley and University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, comes as a response to The Crimson’s report on HUPD’s culture of sexism, racism, and alleged favoritism spanning two decades.
The decision is by no means sufficient. It is also entirely unsurprising. Our institution has a long history of dodging responsibility behind obscure internal reviews and hiding behind administrative proceedings. From opposing third-party arbitration for sexual assault allegations to its controversial handling of the sexual misconduct claims against former Government Department Professor Jorge I. Dominguez, Harvard has repeatedly shown itself reluctant to accept fully external and transparent probes into its internal issues. That attitude, both during the Dominguez controversy and now, actively endangers its student body.
When the deeply troubling allegations against HUPD first emerged, we voiced our opinion unequivocally: “Riley Must Go.” As we detailed then, there is a strong moral case for demanding Riley's resignation. He either tolerated or actively facilitated the growth of a racist and sexist culture within his department. We also expressed the practical reasons for the necessity of his departure, given the possibility that students might grow reluctant to engage with a police department that fosters such a culture. We, like several student activist groups on campus, stand by that assessment, and by a completely unambiguous meaning of the word “must.”
Instead, Riley will be overseeing the review committee tasked with dealing with the very issues that several sources link directly to him.
The notion itself is, of course, borderline satirical. Riley has had 24 years to improve his department’s morale and deal with internal issues regarding discrimination and diversity. Doing as much is a core part of any leadership position. Instead, he presided over a period that saw as many anti-discrimination lawsuits directed against him personally as women promoted to leadership positions within the department. He has been specifically named as the origin of the HUPD’s toxic culture by several sources, including allegations that he sought to create an "old boys' network" where personal connections to him were excessively prized. Perhaps even more concerningly, three female employees filed affidavits detailing specific instances of sexist behavior allegedly perpetrated by Riley.
His actions speak for themselves. Yet according to the email announcement of the internal review he will be spearheading, Riley remains committed to improving department morale. Given his allegedly central role in a litany of climate issues within the department itself, it seems that goal would be best served by his departure. Indeed, unless Riley can definitively show that recent reports do not offer an accurate picture of the department, his resignation is imperative.
A response by HUPD and the University rooted in bureaucratic secrecy rather than accountability and transparency is not the solution; an internal review is by no means enough. Riley must go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pair of Harvard Business School students launched two new events this weekend — the Black New Venture Competition and the Black Tech Masters Series — which they say are meant to help black entrepreneurs clear hurdles in the business world.
Created by Business School students Tyler Simpson and Kimberly E. Foster, the new events combined with the African American Student Union’s 47th annual conference to form a two-day experience dubbed “Uncharted: Black Visionary Leadership and Redefining What Is Possible.”
Simpson and Foster partnered with multiple external sponsors, including General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures, Google for Startups, and eBay, to put on the events.
Simpson and Foster said they created the events to ensure that black entrepreneurs both inside and outside the Business School have access to the skill sets and knowledge to succeed, adding that most attendees were not Harvard affiliates.
“Our goal for the project this weekend is to really invite and enable people within the black community to gain an understanding of entrepreneurship in a way that is much more dynamic than looking things up online or trying to understand resources that they don’t have access to,” Simpson said.
“The hurdle to get capital is so much higher for this demographic,” Foster added.
The Black New Venture Competition is designed to connect aspiring black entrepreneurs with resources, mentors, and advisors to develop and expand their ventures, according to the competition’s website. Competitors pitch ventures to a panel of judges and audience members, vying for $175,000 in prize money.
Simpson and Foster described Friday’s Black Tech Masters Series, meanwhile, as a “one-day masterclass on how to be a good entrepreneur.” The day consisted of workshops and panels covering subjects like “how to build a winning team” and “brand value and marketing in the digital age.”
Jewel Burks Solomon, the head of Google for Startups, gave the morning keynote address. Damien Hooper-Campbell, the Chief Diversity Officer of eBay, closed the event with an afternoon keynote session, in which he shared advice about diversity in networking and discussed his experience hiring an eBay CEO who was actively engaging in diversity and inclusion.
Alfred Y. Jackson, who traveled from St. Louis, MO, to attend the Black Tech Masters Series, said one of his main takeaways from Hooper-Campbell’s speech was that employees should actively attempt to intervene when their workplaces fail to adequately address concerns of diversity and inclusion.
“We have to be the ones to raise our voice when things are not going the way things should be going, sometimes we have to provoke our coworkers to action and our team members to action,” Jackson said.
Another attendee — Amoi S. Nelson, who works for American Express — said she came to the event because she wanted to better understand the trials and financial struggles that business owners and entrepreneurs go through.
“It actually exceeded my expectations, because I was able to take even just little bits, although I am not an entrepreneur myself, that I can apply to my own career — hiring, learning how to balance diversity within work,” Nelson said.
Simpson and Foster stressed that they want their projects to continue even after they graduate, saying that “we want this to be a part of the institution in some way.”

Members of Quincy House and other Harvard affiliates gathered in Memorial Church Saturday afternoon to honor the life and work of former Quincy House Faculty Dean Deborah J. Gehrke.
Speakers at the event — including family members, Quincy students, alumni, tutors, and fellow faculty deans — told personal stories about Gehrke on topics ranging from ping pong to karaoke to Quincy’s 2018 Straus Cup victory.
Known by House affiliates as the “fun dean,” Gehrke served in her position alongside her husband, Lee, for nearly 12 years before her death in December at the age of 66. Lee Gehrke informed Quincy residents in January that he would step down at the end of the academic year, citing the loss of his wife.
The couple’s two children, Andrew R. Gehrke and Lindsay Gehrke-Shainker, addressed the crowd assembled in Memorial Church on Saturday. Andrew said he wanted to set a tone of “celebration” for his mother and noted that her life was spent driving away sadness from those she knew.
Multiple speakers also recounted meaningful late-night text exchanges with Gehrke. Former Pforzheimer House Faculty Dean Nicholas A. Christakis said he and Gehrke texted about everything from insomnia to ice cream.
Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 — dean of administration and finance for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — said she met Deborah and Lee Gehrke during the renovation of Quincy’s Stone Hall, which ended in 2013. Kirwan cited both deans’ “enthusiastic” attitude about the construction, which set a “high bar” for future renewals.
Kirwan also recounted a unique — and perhaps unrealistic — plan Deborah Gehrke had originally proposed to mark Stone Hall’s reopening.
“When planning the grand opening of Stone Hall, Deb had the bright idea to mount a zip line from the faculty dean’s residence into the courtyard which she intended to ride down herself to kick-start the festivities!” she said. “While that did not happen, I have no trouble picturing Deb flying down the zip line, golden hair flying, and laughing her infectious deep laugh.”
Christakis said students’ devotion to the late faculty dean bordered on “fanaticism” and praised Gehrke’s ability to always be “playful” and “genuine.”
“Deb was funny and spirited, and an astute observer of human frailty,” he said. “I have spent my whole professional career trying to understand the human condition — as a hospice physician and as a social scientist.”
“But I can tell you that no training in the world — no science, no education — can capture the meaning of losing someone as truly alive as Deb,” Christakis added.
Other speakers included Director of the Office for the Arts Jack Megan, Quincy House alumni Giannina “Gia” Marciano ’18 and Karen Chee ’17, current Quincy House resident Cameron B. Jones ’20, non-resident tutor Field Brown, and Divinity School Professor and Interim Pusey Minister Stephanie A. Paulsell.
Quincy House tutor Michael F. Esposito ’09 recalled the lessons that Gehrke taught him during his time living in the House, describing them as “Yoda-like.” One particular adage — that “no one is safe” — served as both a serious reminder and a source of humor for him and other tutors.
“It’s less ominous than it sounds, although, as tutors, seeing that subject line in your inbox usually meant an email with the silliest and most ridiculous pictures of us Deb could find from the most recent House event,” he said. “For tutors, ‘no one is safe,’ also means that you need to be ready to step up on behalf of the House at any moment, and that may require leaving your dignity at the door.”
Esposito added that Gehrke’s refrain, “no crying in ping pong,” not only displayed her love for the game — often pulling unsuspecting Quincy students into spontaneous matches — but also her attitude of selflessness and service.
“When I found out that Deb had died, I cried for a long time,” he said. “And then I practically felt her jab me in the ribs and tell me: ‘no crying in ping pong.’ Get back out there and keep going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council endorsed a statement condemning the actions of Harvard police during their arrest of a man at the Smith Campus Center last Thursday.
The statement, which the Council will present to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley, and other administrators, has circulated around campus in the week since the arrest. It includes a series of demands: that HUPD drop the trespassing charges against the man, that the department release its code of ethics and budget, and that police issue an apology and discipline the officer involved.
Council treasurer Noah Harris ’22 and Ivy Yard representative Chloe E. V. Koulefianou ’23 sponsored the legislation to endorse the statement.
The Council’s Black Caucus had previously endorsed the statement. Harris and Koulefianou proposed the legislation to have the entire Council adopt it.
“With the UC being such a loud voice on campus, we believe that it’s our duty to stand up for not just members of the Harvard student community but the Cambridge community and the space we take up,” Harris said. “The following statement would be a start for what we can do to be sure that no injustices take place and we don’t say anything about it.”
Adams House representative Alexa C. Jordan ’22 raised concerns about the wording of the statement.
“I think it’s a great statement and it needs to go out. I just think for number one we should make it more specific,” Jordan said. “I think vagueness could cause more problems than we’re trying to solve. Otherwise, I completely support it.”
The Council also voted to publicize an undergraduate health and wellness survey Sunday evening. Leverett House representative Jenny H. Gan ’22 sponsored the legislation, under which the Council would publish the Harvard University Health Services survey to students at the College.
Council members also voted to fund a “Meet the Queer Caucus” Event,” after previously voting to fund similar events for the Black Caucus, First-Generation Low-Income Caucus, International Caucus, and Asian American Caucus. The Council will allocate $300 from its Burst Pack — which is marked for discretionary spending — to pay for food and publicity materials for the event.
At the end of the meeting, Council members proposed a pair of acts aimed at increasing transparency and accountability.
The first act, which passed, changed the bylaws of the Council to require that representatives submit monthly reports updating their constituents. The Council’s bylaws previously included an unenforced rule mandating weekly reports.
The second act, which did not pass, attempted to change the Council’s attendance review procedures. The UC reviews members’ attendance after they rack up three unexcused absences.
Still, the executive board of the UC can decide to dismiss absences due to reasons set in the Council constitution.
The act presented at Sunday’s meeting would expel representatives called to a second attendance review, unless two-thirds of the executive board of the Council vote otherwise. The legislation represented a reversal of UC procedures — currently, representatives stay by default and are only dismissed after a vote.
Council vice president Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 and secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 sponsored the ill-fated act.
At the meeting, several representatives gave speeches in opposition to the legislation.
“This bill would basically say that the metric of attendance directly determines how committed you are to the UC,” Currier House representative Jack M. Swanson ’22 said. “I don’t think any of us agree here that if you miss four meetings you should be kicked off the UC automatically.”
Brennan disagreed, and after the meeting, he said he was disappointed that the act did not pass.
“This bill was motivated out of an earnest desire to increase our accountability to the constituencies,” Brennan said.
Correction: March 2, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that a piece of UC legislation would expel representatives called to a second attendance review unless two-thirds of the entire Council voted otherwise. In fact, the act mandated that two-thirds vote of the UC's executive board vote otherwise.

When Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Ph.D. candidate Martha H. “Holly” Elmore applied to study at Harvard in 2013, she did so with a particular professor in mind.
She chose that faculty member, Anne Pringle, to be her academic advisor, interviewing for a position in Pringle’s lab, where she would work closely with her mentor over the course of her studies.
Seven years later, Elmore has changed advisors twice after two of her mentors left Harvard. Pringle departed in 2014 after being denied tenure, while Elmore’s second mentor decided to take a job at another university.
Now, as she approaches the end of her program, Elmore says that having to change mentors and look for new advisors “derailed everything,” adding undue amounts of stress to her course of study.
“I had to go around the department and to someone and be like, you’re my third choice,” Elmore said. “The whole department feels really bad for me.”
For many Harvard graduate students, faculty advisors are integral to their academic experience. Advisors help guide students through their research and advocate for their mentees to receive grants and scholarships.
Harvard faculty might depart from the University for a variety of reasons, including tenure denial, retirement, and job offers from other institutions. Multiple students said taking a younger, tenure-track professor as an advisor rather than a tenured faculty member increases the risk of departure impacting their studies.
When their advisors leave Harvard, graduate students have to alter their plans. They can choose to find a new mentor at the University, follow their mentor to their new job, or stay at Harvard and work with their mentor remotely.
In response to an email sent over the Graduate Student Council’s mailing list, 20 graduate students told The Crimson that their advisors left or would be leaving in the middle of their studies. Some students wrote they changed mentors up to three times.
“People can easily fall through the cracks,” Elmore said. “A lot of people really wanted to help me, and I want to help myself, and I still feel like I fell through the cracks.”
Of the 20 graduate students who replied to The Crimson, 15 said they remained at the University to finish their studies even after the mentor they had been working with departed Harvard — leaving them responsible for finding a new advisor.
Harvard School of Public Health Ph.D. candidate Ian M. Leavitt said in an interview that his advisor, Andy S. L. Tan, announced he would be leaving at the end of this year to teach at another institution. Leavitt said he will now be tasked with searching for a new advisor halfway through his program.
“It’s still a shifted ideology,” Leavitt said. “I came into the University expecting to be with one person.”
Though Leavitt said he came to Harvard to work with his original advisor, he said he would be open to working with another faculty member at the University.
“I wouldn’t say it’s the end of the world at all,” Leavitt said. “I’m a very flexible person in terms of there were some other people that I identified that I had research interests that kind of aligned with.”
Other graduate students, however, said finding a new mentor can pose challenges.
Government Ph.D. candidate Pablo E. Balan — who said he has lost three advisors during his course of study at Harvard — said working with a new advisor requires “building a whole new relationship.”
“The department doesn’t have any institutional mechanism to take care of students who lose advisors for whatever reason,” Balan said. “It’s up to us to reach out to other professors, which can be costly, since investing in a mentoring relationship is a long term investment.”
When students do eventually find a new Harvard faculty member to assist them, that advisor may not necessarily have the same academic interests as them, according to Elmore.
“My advisor at Harvard I love, I’ve learned a lot from, but he doesn’t work on what I work on at all,” Elmore said. “So actually, it’s a terrible situation. Really bad, like really unacceptable.”
Other graduate students said they have found that the best course of action is to follow their mentors to another institution. Medical Sciences Ph.D. candidate Michael A. Tartell said he plans to follow his advisor, Sean P.J. Whelan, to Washington University in St. Louis, where Whelan will serve as the Chair of the Department of Molecular Microbiology beginning later this year.
“You can’t do virus lab work from home,” Tartell said. “When you work in biology, a lot of your day-to-day work relies on a back and forth with your advisor about experiments.”
Tartell said he anticipates both benefits and drawbacks to changing universities. He said moving to a new institution could help him form new academic relationships with members of his field, but it would also involve leaving behind his previous life in Boston.
“It’s just kind of holding on to the idea that your friends will still be your friends no matter where you are, even though in the moment that feels very difficult,” Tartell said.
When former Harvard Chemistry professor Alán Aspuru-Guzik moved to the University of Toronto over concerns about the American political climate, most of his advisees followed him to Canada, Aspuru-Guzik said.
Florian Hase — one of Aspuru-Guzik’s advisees — wrote in an email that he moved to the University of Toronto to continue his research alongside his colleagues.
“Of course I was a little bit sad that I would have to leave Cambridge behind, but I was also excited by the adventures ahead of me, with lots of opportunities at the University of Toronto while still being affiliated with Harvard University,” Hase wrote.
For students who cannot follow their mentors to another institution, they have the option to continue their existing advising relationships remotely. Aspuru-Guzik said he communicates with his advisees who chose to stay at Harvard through Slack, Skype, and frequent visits to Boston.
“I explained to them that groups move all the time,” Aspuru-Guzik said. “I worked with them on an efficient plan that is individualized.”
Germanic Languages and Literatures Ph.D. candidate Hans M. Pech — whose advisor, Racha Kirakosian, will be leaving at the end of this year after being denied tenure — said he plans to work with Kirakosian remotely, though he fears communicating with an advisor remotely might prove “tedious.”
“It’s always better to have somebody physically present to advocate for you getting a certain scholarship or whatever it may be,” Pech said. “Just meeting on a weekly basis, for example, or regular basis in person to discuss your research is obviously more productive than writing an email.”
Regardless of what course of action graduate students decide to take, many agreed that their advising relationships are crucial to academic success.
Balan said that in addition to providing intellectual advice and funding, mentors can “offer protection.”
“Having a strong supportive advisor lowers the probability that you are professionally harassed, harassed in the context of teaching, employer-employee relations and so on,” he said.
Leavitt agreed that advising relationships can help graduate students, adding that they should not be “put on the back burner.”
“You're just looking for somebody to basically help you navigate the process amongst many other things,” Leavitt said. “If I needed them, they're there for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf declined to comment on whether Harvard should divest from the fossil fuel industry in an interview last week.
After the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School faculty each voted in support of divestment, Elmendorf refrained from weighing in on his own school’s decision to call a vote for divestment during a faculty meeting.
“I’m not going to comment on that,” Elmendorf said Wednesday. “Deans have a particular responsibility. This differs from that of individual faculty members.”
The Faculty Council of Harvard Medical School voted 23-5 in favor of divesting the school’s endowment from fossil fuels on February 12th. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences supported divestment in a 179-20 vote earlier this semester.
Elmendorf demurred when asked if divestment would come to a vote at the Kennedy School.
“Whether our faculty vote on divestment is a matter that our faculty will decide,” Elmendorf said.
“In the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and I think also the Harvard Medical School, those votes are faculty-driven votes, not dean-driven votes,” he added. “And I think that same principle applies here.”
Students across the University have mobilized in the past year to push University President Lawrence S. Bacow and the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — to divest the school’s endowment from fossil fuels.
In early February, Kennedy School students sent a proposal to the dean advocating for more robust climate change education. The proposal aimed to bolster faculty and teaching around the topic, improve academic structures, and create a center for climate research.
The dean said Wednesday that there is an “outstanding” group of 15 Kennedy School faculty members whose teaching and research focuses on climate change.
During the interview, Elmendorf referred to a letter he sent in response to the students’ proposals. In the letter, which he sent Wednesday, he wrote that there are about a dozen courses at the Kennedy School and roughly 65 courses at other Harvard schools that give “substantial attention” to climate change.
“Including all courses that cover climate change in some way would roughly double those figures,” he wrote. “To provide the broadest set of options for students across the University—on climate change and other topics—we deliberately avoid offering courses that duplicate ones offered elsewhere on campus and instead aim to complement other courses.”
Elmendorf wrote in the letter that hiring faculty and researchers who are academic authorities on the climate crisis continues to be a priority. He wrote that the faculty members involved in designing curriculum for the school are “considering how to increase the coverage of climate change.”
“The faculty members who are involved in designing the new core curriculum are considering how to increase the coverage of climate change, because we agree that it is a crucial issue for future public leaders,” Elmendorf wrote.
In the letter, Elmendorf wrote that there is an existing Harvard University Center for Environment that many Kennedy School students and faculty interact with regularly.
Elmendorf ended the letter by asserting that the school did not make decisions to prevent backlash from those who may not support efforts to strengthen climate change education.
“When the School’s administrators or faculty members make decisions, we are not trying to avoid unpopularity with members of our community who hold any particular view on any particular substantive issue; instead, we are trying to advance our mission by creating the best environment for learning, research, and contributions to practice,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Humanities 10a and 10b curriculum has evolved over the past several years, some students say they are still dissatisfied with the lack of racial diversity in the year-long course’s reading list.
Several students criticized the brevity of an assignment that included seven pages of the essay “Criteria of Negro Art” from W. E. B. Du Bois, Class of 1890 — one of the only black authors on the course’s syllabus. The course — often referred to as “Hum 10” — is an intensive introductory course to the humanities, regularly assigning students hundreds of pages of reading per week.
Philosophy Professor Samantha M. Matherne — one of the eleven professors teaching the course — paired Du Bois’s essay with work by famed writer and philosopher Alaine Locke as part of a discussion on the philosophy of art and the Harlem Renaissance.
Hum 10 student Brittany G. Shrader ’23 said she perceived the inclusion of the short Du Bois essay to be reflective of the reading list’s lack of representation.
“We have thousands of pages of reading in Hum 10 overall, and you’re going to dedicate seven of those to black literature?” Shrader said. “Their justification was that it was for philosophy, and then this week we had [Friedrich] Schiller — and that’s philosophy — and they gave us 90 pages of reading.”
“Instead of actually giving us James Baldwin, works that are black art, they gave us a work about what it means to be black art, and it felt like a kind of disservice to that,” Shrader added.
Some students also took issue with what they saw as a Western emphasis in the syllabus, which prompted a few students to disenroll from the course, according to course member Sahaj Singh ’23.
Charlotte A. Powell ’23 said she thought the course’s focus on Western works made its title misleading.
“I think it’s a little presumptuous to name it Humanities 10, because it does give a sort of implication that Hum 10 will teach you all of humanities, or give you a view of what all of humanities is. That’s simply not true,” Powell said.
Course leader and English professor Louis Menand IV said the reading list largely depends on the course’s invited professors, who each select two texts to teach. He said he believes the professor’s care for and expertise in the material are the most important factors when designing the syllabus.
“The course is not designed to represent different ethnic groups or different national groups or anything like that. It’s designed for the instructors to teach two texts they care passionately about,” Menand said.
Menand added that he aims to assemble a diverse group of instructors, but that the dearth of professors of color in the humanities has made that task difficult.
Anthony A. Derveniadis-Hernández, a teaching fellow in the course, said he believes students’ concerns relate to a broader issue of underrepresentation of people of color.
“It’s sort of stemming out from this larger, broader problem of the lack of representation in literature or in academia,” Derveniadis-Hernández said.
Nonetheless, some students say they appreciate previous changes to the course, despite their perceived shortcomings of the reading list.
“I feel like it has made a conscious effort to expand,” course member Jonathan Zhang ’23 said. “I feel like, slowly but surely, it will become a more international, more widespread kind of curriculum.”
Correction: March 2, 2020

Harvard Law School announced Wednesday that it has launched a new Voting Rights Litigation and Advocacy Clinic and plans to launch a Religious Freedom Clinic.
The Voting Rights Litigation and Advocacy Clinic offers students the opportunity to work with local or national nonprofit litigation and advocacy groups, including the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union Voting Rights Project.
The clinic will focus on redistricting law, voter suppression, and threats to voting rights. Students in the program will take Election Law, taught by Professor Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos, and can individualize their approach to election law by focusing on areas such as election administration, political party regulation, or campaign finance.
“The Voting Rights Litigation and Advocacy Clinic will give our students the opportunity to learn, contribute, and practice law in a field that is central to American democracy,” Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in a press release.
Ruth Greenwood will lead the clinic. A graduate of the University of Sydney and Columbia Law School, Greenwood previously served as an adjunct professor of law at Loyola University Chicago and as co-director of voting rights and redistricting for the Campaign Legal Center in Chicago.
Greenwood has worked as an advocate for voting rights for more than a decade and advised several states on the implementation of independent redistricting commissions. She was also the Lead Counsel for Voting Rights at the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and a Redistricting Fellow with the Democratic National Committee’s Voting Rights Institute.
Her work focuses on ending partisan gerrymandering and promoting minority representation. She has litigated two cases involving partisan gerrymandering — Whiteford v. Gill and LWVNC v. Rucho — from the initial trial level to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Ruth Greenwood is a deeply experienced practitioner, thoughtful and principled lawyer who will be both a superb teacher and a wonderful mentor to our students,” Manning wrote. “I am delighted to welcome Ruth to Harvard Law School.”
The forthcoming Religious Freedom Clinic will be based on the Religious Liberty Clinic at Stanford Law School. It is designed to allow students to represent people who are restricted in the exercise of their religious freedom, according to a Law School press release.
In the Stanford clinic program, students can either represent individuals facing obstacles in the exercise of their faith or small churches, synagogues, or mosques with zoning issues.
Examples of the Stanford clinic’s work include the representation of a Muslim person sentenced to capital punishment who sought pastoral services in the execution chamber and a Seventh-day Adventist employee who could not work on Sunday because they observed the Sabbath.
“Students will have the opportunity to directly serve individuals from a wide range of faiths who would not otherwise have an advocate,” Law School professor Kristen A. Stilt, who directs the Law School’s Program on Law and Society in the Muslim World, wrote in a press release. “Students will learn the skills needed to engage with clients from diverse backgrounds, understand their faith commitments and the obstacles they are facing, and make legal arguments to achieve their clients’ goals.”
The Law School currently offers 46 legal clinics and student practice organizations aimed at giving students an opportunity to apply their education outside of the classroom.
“Providing students with practical lawyering experience and skills is one of the most important aspects of a Harvard Law School education,” Manning wrote in a press release.

The Global Ambassador program at the Harvard Extension School aims to foster connections between students taking courses off-campus by tasking select student representatives with hosting events for their respective cities.
Launched in fall 2018, the initiative has since expanded to 25 student ambassadors spanning 10 countries and five continents. The ambassadors receive support from the Extension School to host meetups in their designated cities and create local networks of Extension School students.
Extension School students may choose from a mix of online and on-campus courses to complete their Bachelor of Liberal Arts or Master of Liberal Arts degrees, as well as a variety of certificate programs.
Kenneth M. Marshall, a Seattle-based ambassador, said he chose the Extension School in part due to its flexible online learning options.
“I was interested in attending an online school that was challenging in terms of core curriculum and also something I might be able to do around full time work,” Marshall said.
Several current ambassadors said they first heard about the initiative last fall through an email encouraging them to apply.
“After learning about the program and reading about it, I was motivated to apply because I wanted to help contribute,” April Fong, an ambassador based in Taipei, Taiwan, said.
Extension School ambassadors are granted access to the Zoom video conferencing platform, which allows them to facilitate discussions digitally.
“The meeting kind of took a life on its own, and people started having real conversations between them and pretty much they forgot about me, which I love,” Pablo G. Maceiras De Araujo, an ambassador who recently hosted a digital meet-up for students in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, said. “They started talking and giving recommendations to each other.”
Several current ambassadors said the program gives students the chance to build support networks, especially amidst confusion regarding the Extension School’s role at Harvard.
“One interesting discussion we had was how did you represent yourself to people who don’t understand, who don’t know what HES is,” Eric X. Ding, a New York ambassador who hosted a panel discussion last week, said. “I think that is a very interesting and a tricky matter for a lot of new students to navigate.”
Chicago-based ambassador Carmen Gardner, who also serves as the President of the Harvard Extension Student Association, said students are enthusiastic about the initiative.
“They’re excited that there are efforts to engage them,” Gardner said. “It’s really exciting to me just because I think that these kinds of programs need to exist because it allows the Extension School to collaborate with dedicated students.”
Gardner added that there are some barriers that prevent Global Ambassadors from reaching the entire student body.
“As a Global Ambassador, you don’t receive an email list, so you don’t necessarily know how many students are a part of your community,” Gardner said. “The other challenge is that as a Global Ambassador, you do not receive any funding, so what you’re essentially doing is organizing an event and asking people to either buy tickets or just show up and pay cash.”
Division of Continuing Education spokesperson Harry J. Pierre said the DCE is excited about the Global Ambassador program’s positive reception, though he added that the program is still in its pilot phase.
“We’re glad that a lot of students are getting more involved in the Global Ambassador program and that they’re finding a sense of community through this program,” Pierre said. “Those are concerns that the program is going to work through and work on as it gets more mature and as it gains more members.”

Harvard’s African and African American Studies department celebrated its 50th anniversary at a two-day symposium Friday and Saturday, which boasted a global guest list of pre-eminent scholars in the field.
AAAS was founded in 1969 following student demands for such a department. Activism for the creation of the department surged in April 1968 in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.
The celebration began with remarks from AAAS chair Tommie Shelby, who said though the department has faced “missteps, disappointments, crises, and setbacks,” the demands of the original student activists “continue to be satisfied and even greatly surpassed today.”
“My colleagues and I are grateful to those who pioneered this effort, and we sincerely hope they are proud of what we have done with their legacy,” he said.
Several professors involved in the founding of the department attended the event, including Sociology professor Orlando H. L. Patterson and former AAAS professor Ephraim Isaac. University administrators involved in the department’s development — including former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky and former University President Neil L. Rudenstine — also attended.
Current prominent faculty members, including Dean of Social Science Lawrence D. Bobo, University Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr., History department chair Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Philosophy and AAAS professor Cornel R. West ’74, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, also participated in the two days of programming.
“Through its profound commitment to the multidisciplinary study of the global African diaspora in all its richness and complexity and even contradictions, the Department of African and African American Studies has become an unequaled leader in its field, to the enormous benefit of the Harvard community and the wider world,” Gay said in her remarks.
The celebration featured multiple panels, including discussions on the founding and early days of AAAS, scholar activism, and alumni experiences.
Farah J. Griffin ’85, African American and African Diaspora Studies department chair at Columbia University, and Wale Adebanwi, director of the African Studies Centre at Oxford University, delivered the keynote addresses on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
Friday’s events included musical performances by the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College and the Yosvany Terry Quintet, as well as the presentation of artist Dell M. Hamilton’s exhibition “The Extraordinary Commission: Student Activism and the Birth of Afro-American Studies at Harvard.”
Saturday’s faculty panel on scholar activism discussed the extent to which black scholars have a responsibility to advocate for black people outside of academia.
Princeton University African American Studies professor Imani Perry, one of the panelists, said she does not consider herself a “scholar-activist” but believes that, as a professor, she has a responsibility to address the ways that academia may perpetuate inequality.
“To be a person of conscience in this career demands a commitment to disruption,” Perry said. “So, at the very least, I can try to undo the ways that I participate in injustice.”
In an interview after the symposium, Shelby said the programming was meant to celebrate the department’s “extraordinary” achievements, but also to foster important discourse on ways to improve.
“I think it did manage to be appropriately celebratory, reflective,” Shelby said. “What I wanted was, yes, celebration, but also dialogue with our peers in the field to think about places where we could be better.”

At the start of their terms, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon reflected on their decision to run for the city’s top offices and their plans for the City Council moving forward.
The Cambridge City Council unanimously elected Siqqiqui and Mallon as mayor and vice mayor, respectively, for the 2020-2021 term at the council's inaugural meeting in January. Siddiqui and Mallon are both in their second term on City Council.
Siddiqui — a Pakistani immigrant raised in Cambridge — is Massachusetts’s first Muslim mayor. Siddiqui and Mallon are the first women to lead the City Council together as mayor and vice mayor.
Mallon wrote that the 2016 United States presidential election inspired her to run for office in a Feb. 24 email to The Crimson.
“I knew that this current administration would be a constant assault on vulnerable residents: our immigrant community, low income residents, LGBTQ+ residents and students, and more,” she wrote.
“I wanted to ensure we had City Councillors here in Cambridge who were going to be ever mindful of our vulnerable population, and actively work on policies that protected them,” she added.
Mallon added that she uses her “lens as someone who grew up low-income” to implement policies while on City Council that give resources to those who need them the most.
During her first term on council, Mallon worked on an initiative to expand the city’s summer food service program, a food security program that provides free lunches to anyone under eighteen. She also helped create a program that facilitates the opening of children’s savings accounts.
She wrote that she wants to focus on supporting small businesses and passing Cambridge’s affordable housing overlay during the 2020-2021 term.
In addition to their roles at City Hall, Siddiqui and Mallon also run a podcast entitled “Women Are Here” about their own lives and Cambridge events. The idea for the podcast emerged when the two met on the campaign trail in 2017.
“We immediately bonded over our shared experiences of running for office, as well as running as women,” Mallon wrote in an email. “We knocked on so many doors over that spring, summer, and fall, and we heard over and over again from residents that there was no easy way to keep connected to what was going on in the city.”
In a January interview with The Crimson, Siddiqui said she and Mallon started the podcast to make local government “more accessible” and “easier to digest.”
Each week during the podcast, Siddiqui and Mallon discuss what is happening in the city — from council meetings to fun events.
“We keep it light sometimes talking about our favorite new restaurants or TV shows we are bingeing,” Mallon wrote in an email. “Other times we dive deep and personal into areas of family, how hard it is to do this job and be in the public eye.”
The podcast also touches on the experiences of women in state and local politics.
In an email to The Crimson, Mallon wrote that “a tremendous amount of talented and incredible women” have taken office since 2016.
“I am so proud that not only does Cambridge have an all female leadership team, the Vice-Chair of the School Committee is a woman as well,” Mallon wrote.
“We also have an incredible female led state and national delegation that includes State Representative Marjorie Decker, Congresswoman Katherine [M.] Clark, Congresswoman Ayanna [S.] Pressley and Senator Elizabeth Warren,” she added.
Mallon also wrote that women in politics serve as important role models for local youth.
“Cambridge kids needn’t look further than their own backyards to find strong, capable women leading the way and providing role model material,” Mallon wrote.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will discuss a motion to simplify rules for simultaneous course enrollment during its monthly meeting Tuesday.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh submitted the motion on behalf of the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy following the committee’s review of simultaneous enrollment policies.
The proposed revision will allow students to enroll in two courses that meet at the same time or overlapping times in one of two cases. Students must receive permission from the heads of both courses and the Administrative Board, or may enroll without a petition if the Standing Committee has granted one of the two courses a waiver from the simultaneous enrollment petition process.
According to the Harvard College Handbook, FAS currently allows simultaneous enrollment in one of three circumstances: when one of the course heads agrees to provide “hour-for-hour direct and personal compensatory instruction” for the missed class time, when lectures are available on videotape and a student will miss no more than one-third of them, or when a senior needs both courses for graduation requirements.
“It has become increasingly clear that the current translation of the underlying principle into a policy and system is dysfunctional,” the committee’s report reads.
Claybaugh wrote in a letter to the Faculty Council that current procedures do not make sense for courses such as Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability” and Economics 10a: “Principles of Microeconomics,” which upload online lectures as an alternative to in-person lectures and provide other opportunities for in-person instruction.
If adopted, the motion would create a formal process through which course heads may apply for a waiver from normal simultaneous enrollment rules, which some courses have already been granted. FAS has exempted Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science” from simultaneous enrollment rules since 2014; Ec 10 and Stat 110 received similar exemptions in 2019 as an interim measure.
Additionally, the new rules will no longer mandate that instructors provide hour-for-hour compensatory instruction for missed class time. Instead, the motion recommends that the Administrative Board only approve simultaneous enrollment petitions for students who provide a plan indicating they can “participate fully in all course components” for both courses, which may include compensatory instruction.
During the faculty meeting Tuesday, Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Francis J. Doyle III will also give an update on his school’s impending move to Allston.

After more than a year of listening to punditry about early states, Massachusetts voters on and off campus will formally weigh in on the 2020 presidential campaign Tuesday.
Voters in 14 states will head to the polls to dole out 33 percent of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention Tuesday. In Massachusetts, which will award 91 pledged delegates, polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Cambridge boasts 34 polling locations, including one at Harvard’s Quincy House.
When they step into the ballot box, Democratic voters will choose among six major candidates still in the race.
Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04 announced he would drop out of the Democratic race ahead of Super Tuesday. Nevertheless, Buttigieg’s name — alongside the names of other Democrats who have dropped out of the race — will appear on the ballot Tuesday.
Harvard affiliates were out in force over the weekend campaigning for their candidate of choice. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) held a canvass kick-off event in Harvard Square Saturday, and several other groups also rapped on doors in hopes of boosting turnout.
The Crimson examined what experts and Harvard affiliates say Tuesday means for each Democratic hopeful, both in Massachusetts and across the country.
No candidate has more on the line in the Bay State primary than Senator and former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren.
Despite briefly leading in national polls, Warren struggled in the first four states that weighed in on the race. Warren has finished above 15 percent — the threshold required to receive a delegate to the DNC — just once, in Iowa.
Polls suggest Warren could be in jeopardy of losing her home state. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Massachusetts presidential primary, is leading Warren on her home turf, according to the RealClearPolitics state polling average.
“It is jarring that an incumbent senator might in fact lose her home state’s primary,” Stonehill College Political Science Professor Peter N. Ubertaccio said. “But the seeds for that were sown four years ago.”
Warren has strong support from high-profile elected leaders in Massachusetts, including U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), and state Attorney General Maura T. Healy ’92.
Warren recently also picked up the endorsement of a high-profile Harvard student: Jaclyn L. Corin ’23, a survivor of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who went on to co-found the gun-violence prevention group March for Our Lives.
Corin, who canvassed for Warren over the weekend with other Harvard students, said she is confident in where the campaign stands.
“Going around Cambridge and talking to voters, I felt so much excitement around Elizabeth specifically,” she said. “I know that Cambridge is really loving Warren right now and I’m hoping that Massachusetts swings that way.”
After finishing in first place in three out of four of the state primaries that have taken place so far, including a dominant finish with almost 47 percent of the vote in Nevada, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is entering Super Tuesday as a clear front-runner.
He announced Sunday morning that he had raised $46.5 million in February — far more than any other 2020 candidate in any given month.
Sanders held a rally in Boston that was attended by more than 13,000 people on Saturday.
Xavier R. Morales ’23 said he believes Tuesday’s primaries — including the Massachusetts contest — will buoy Sanders’s chance of winning the nomination.
“I don’t necessarily agree with everything he wants and how he wants it,” Morales said. “But I think he’s the best fit.”
Like Warren, Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also struggled to gain traction in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.
But after a 29-point win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday, Biden supporters on campus hope his campaign is on a rebound.
“A lot of the pundits tried to count us out, but the campaign is still alive and it seems like we’re poised to be a strong contender for the nomination,” Harvard College Democrats for Biden co-founder Diego A. Garcia ’20 said.
Biden is not scheduled to campaign in Massachusetts ahead of Super Tuesday, but several high-profile surrogates who support him will do so, including former Secretary of State John F. Kerry and U.S. Representative Seth W. Moulton ’01 (D-Mass.).
Garcia, who has canvassed for Biden around the country, said he hopes that Buttigieg’s decision to drop out of the race will help Biden.
“I hope that some of his supporters both across the country and on campus will consider the Biden campaign,” Garcia said.
As early-state primaries rolled on, former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has loomed over the race as an unknown.
Bloomberg, whose net-worth is estimated to be around $55 billion, has been spending big in Super Tuesday states, including Massachusetts. Bloomberg has 60 staffers and six field offices open in the Bay State.
Ubertaccio said he is skeptical of Bloomberg’s ability to succeed in Massachusetts, despite his spending.
“I don’t make much of people who pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a race and think that that’s somehow going to translate into support on the ground,” Ubertaccio said.
Bloomberg has surged in national polling quickly since entering the race last November, but he lags well behind Sanders and Warren in Massachusetts polls.
For U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Super Tuesday will likely be her last shot at reviving a campaign that has endured disappointing results in all of the primaries thus far.
Harvard College Democrats for Amy Klobuchar founder J. Alexander White ’23 said the group will hold a canvass Tuesday morning to “hit a few houses with literature.”
“My only hope is that some of the support can go Klobuchar’s way,” he said. “She should try to remain viable in case there’s a brokered convention and people are looking for a candidate at that time that maybe isn’t quite as controversial. I can see her being that if she can make it there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the clock wound down in the third period, Harvard held a 3-2 lead over Yale. Then, with 14.1 seconds remaining in regulation, Bulldog senior defender Saroya Tinker executed a shot from the point which Dalton successfully redirected in the air, steering the puck past Crimson sophomore goaltender Lindsay Reed’s shoulder to send the game into overtime.
For the subsequent two twenty-minute overtime periods, Harvard (18-13-1, 15-6-1 ECAC) and Yale (17-15-0, 13-9-0 ECAC) fought an evenly matched, scoreless battle. While both teams fired pucks towards the net, all either sailed wide, rang iron, or were blocked by the goaltender. Neither team incurred a penalty. The contest appeared locked in an endless 3-3 tie.
Then, at the 17:21 mark in the third overtime, junior forward Becca Gilmore redirected captain Kat Hughes’ shot into the net, sending Harvard to the Conference semifinals. After over 100 long, hard-fought minutes of hockey, the Crimson emerged victorious.
“We were able to get a quick shot on net, Kristin [Della Rovere] didn’t let up on the play, and Kat worked really hard to get [the puck] out of the corner, and after the shot, I was able to just get up on the net and get the puck and kind of shoot my own rebound,” Gilmore said. “Not a fancy goal but just getting a lot of traffic to the net.”
Gilmore was named ECAC Player of the Week for her combined four goals and one assist during the ECAC Quarterfinals, including the series winner.
The conference quarterfinals this past weekend featured a best-of-three series against the Bulldogs. Harvard went 2-0 against Yale in the regular season, though going into Friday’s game, the two teams hadn’t met since Dec. 6. The Crimson emerged victorious in game one, though it faltered in an overtime loss in Saturday’s game two. Harvard entered Sunday’s game looking to eliminate Yale and advance to the conference semifinals.
At the game’s onset, possession constantly shifted between the Crimson and the Bulldogs as each team struggled to gain the edge on the ice. After a scoreless first period, the momentum shifted in the second when both teams received simultaneous penalties. 48 seconds later, sophomore forward Kristin Della Rovere took a long shot down the ice which Yale goaltender Gianna Meloni batted behind the net. Della Rovere raced forward, giving the Bulldogs no time to regroup as she intercepted a Yale defender behind the net and stole the puck, wrapping around the backside of the goal and slipping the puck past an open post. The unassisted tally put Harvard up 1-0 with 16:57 to go in the second.
However, 6:25 into the second stanza, the Bulldogs responded with a score of their own. Yale sophomore forward Charlotte Welch skated into the Crimson’s zone before completing a short pass back to fellow sophomore forward Claire Dalton, who was following just behind her. Dalton deftly received the puck and found twine by nailing a hard shot past Harvard goaltender Lindsay Reed. Welch, who had the assist, also notched three scores in Saturday’s game two.
Penalties characterized Saturday’s contest, with the two teams combining for 41 total penalty minutes. However, in Sunday’s rematch, the first penalty did not arrive until the final second of the first stanza, when Yale first-year forward Grace Lee headed to the box for checking. While Sunday yielded only 14 total penalty minutes, the match-up produced three power-play goals.
9:38 into the third period, Yale senior forward Kirsten Nergaard headed to the penalty box for roughing. Della Rovere capitalized on the power play opportunity with her second score of the day, receiving a pass from junior forward Keely Moy and shooting the puck through traffic to put the Crimson up 2-1.
“Maryna [Macdonald] did a great job of keeping the puck in, and Keely just came around the net with the possession and gave me a perfect pass that I was able to bury with a shot,” Della Rovere explained, adding that, “having the man advantage and knowing you have more time with the puck is very useful.”
The Bulldogs responded less than three minutes later with a power-play goal of their own. After sophomore defender Maryna Macdonald received a two minute minor for high sticking, Yale launched a flurry of attempts in front of the net, culminating in Lee sliding the puck past Reed to even the score. Welch added her second assist of the day on the play.
Harvard’s second power-play goal arrived after Welch went to the box for checking. With 1:16 left in the third, Moy controlled a pass from junior forward Brooke Jovanovich directly in front of the net and fired the puck past Meloni to give the Crimson a 3-2 lead late in regulation.
However, the game was far from over, as Yale’s late tying goal would send the game into over 42 minutes of overtime.
“There were some very special moments just getting ready to go back out there,” said Della Rovere about the atmosphere in the locker room between overtime periods. “I think that everyone in the locker room knew that we were going to come out successful, so we were just trying to keep the energy high and keep working hard.”
Indeed, the team’s perseverance and tenacity paid off with Gilmore’s game-winning goal.
“That was probably one of the best wins I’ve been a part of in my Harvard hockey career,” Gilmore said.
Harvard will head to Ithaca to face host and one-seed Cornell on Saturday, March 7 at 1 p.m. in the ECAC Conference Semifinals.

We’ve all been there. We are waiting for the interviewer to arrive at a coffee shop, not knowing what his face looks like and desperately trying to ignore our nervousness. Should we take one more bathroom run? One more check in the mirror to make sure that our faces don’t reflect the events of the past week? Also, why is it even called having “butterflies?” Butterflies are pretty, little creatures, and what we feel waiting for this interview is anything but beautiful.
We wait. And wait. And wait. Finally, the door swings open, and a 21 year-old interviewer walks in, seemingly just as confused as we are. He searches around, walking up to all the other young-in-appearance coffee drinkers, and eventually lands at our table. Thoughts rush into our heads. First, why are we even being interviewed for a six-day-long summer program? Second, how in the world did a 21 year-old land a job interviewing us? Third, why does he even want to be here on a Sunday morning? Considering that he’s our age (or younger), we’re sure (or we hope) he spent his Saturday night out on the town. Whether you’re preparing for your first interview or your 15th, here’s a list of the most irksome interview-related things we’ve encountered.
1. The “What makes you think you should be chosen to work here?” Question.
Quite possibly the worst question asked, yet it shows up in every. single. interview. The answer to this question is always the perfect balance of awkwardness and haughtiness.
2. The *Checks their phone (and acts as though you can’t see him doing it)* Dude.
We are the experts when it comes to hiding our phones and pretending like we aren’t actually spending class scrolling through Instagram. Life in Science Center Hall B has taught us well, even with no desks to hide the screen’s light. Dear interviewer: we see you and know you’re not paying attention to why we think we should be chosen for the internship.
3. The “I’m so sorry I was 30 minutes late” Interview. 
Dude. That’s so rude. Like super duper rude. We arrived here an hour ago. With all this extra time wasted, we could have finished our LS pset due tomorrow morning, napped, gone to the gym…
4. We don’t have to pay... right? 
Interviews that are held in bougie cafes or restaurants are definitely a win. Sitting on those plush benches and sipping on a matcha latte are all that one could wish for. But when it comes time to pay and the interviewer doesn’t say, “Oh, I’ll cover it,” we freeze. Did we really just spend $7 on a latte? Will we be able to afford our once-a-month $15 Sweetgreen splurge? Guess not.
5. And finally, why do we even have to be interviewed?
Studies show that interviews are not a good indicator for how one will perform at the workplace. So why are we even being interviewed in the first place?
