After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professor of Government Eric M. Nelson ’99 has authored three books, speaks three languages, and reads five languages—all at the tender age of 32. To top it all off, the University has appointed Nelson, a political theorist, full professor in the government department.
Nelson's scholarly journey has taken him deep into the academic thickets of the history of political thought in early-modern Europe and America, his primary area of study. He is schooled in Thomas Hobbes' philosophy and edited Hobbes' translation of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
“I am incredibly humbled by the confidence of my colleagues and very excited by the prospect of a career at Harvard," Nelson said.
Nelson's undergraduate years at Harvard were marked by academic fervor. The history concentrator won a Hoopes prize for his thesis, entitled "The Reluctant Humanist: Thomas Hobbes and the Classical Historians," and graduated summa cum laude in 1999.
After winning a Marshall scholarship and earning his MPhil. and Ph.D. at Cambridge University, Nelson joined the Harvard faculty as an assistant professor in 2005. He became an associate professor in 2009, and received tenure only a year later.
His colleagues know Nelson not just for his impressive array of credentials, but the mind and persona that lie underneath.
“I admire his work greatly," Professor of Government Michael E. Rosen said of Nelson in an e-mail. "The way that it combines historical erudition with conceptual acuteness is really extraordinary and the amount that he has written at such a young age…is remarkable too.”
Nelson, who has taught numerous courses ranging in subject matter from the Jewish political tradition to the politics of music, said he plans to continue teaching undergraduate courses at the same level of intensity in the foreseeable future.
“He's a dedicated teacher who teaches in areas of the subject that might otherwise not get covered," Rosen said. "He is also a very public-spirited colleague and a very nice man. How could I not be happy?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 6:01 p.m.
Harvard-educated biology professor Amy Bishop, who was charged with a shooting at Alabama University in February, was indicted for the killing of her brother in 1986, prosecutors announced today.
Earlier this year, Bishop had shot six of her colleagues and killed three, prompting authorities to reopen the case of her brother's death. Bishop had originally told the police investigating the incident that she had accidentally shot him, and the case—ruled as an accident—fell quiet for more than two decades.
After recent further investigation into the case, Bishop has been charged with first-degree murder of her then-18-year-old brother, Seth. Roy Miller—Bishop's attorney during the case of the Alabama shootings—indicated that he is considering an insanity defense for his client.
Then-Norfolk District Attorney William Delahunt said that Braintree police reports of Bishop’s actions after shooting her brother were never mentioned in state police detective reports. Bishop had allegedly tried to steal a car at gunpoint from a local car dealership, then refused to drop her 12-gauge shotgun until officers ordered her to do so repeatedly.
In April, investigators revisiting photos from the crime scene discovered a 1986 newspaper clipping in Bishop’s room of the killings of actor Patrick Duffy’s parents, who were shot by a teenager with a 12-gauge shotgun and stole a getaway car from a dealership.
William Keating, the Norfolk district attorney, ordered an inquest, during which 19 witnesses testified to consider evidence, including the newspaper clipping, that was not present in 1986. A grand jury heard the evidence this month.
According to the Associated Press, the attorney of Bishop’s parents later released a statement saying that the investigation did not reveal new evidence that Seth’s death was not an accident. They also said that the review that led to Wednesday’s indictment was “an enormous waste of public resources.”

In Cambridge this summer but missing the delights of a HUDS meal plan? Don't subsist entirely on food bought with buy-one-get-one-free coupons from Qdoba. We just discovered this (slightly out-of-date but still useful) list of menus from a smorgasbord of Harvard Square and Cambridge area restaurants that you should check out.
The author of the list, a Harvard grad, compiled it years ago, so some restaurants—like Qdoba, Boloco, and Oggi’s—are noticeably absent. There are also some amusing relics of the past, like the name "Mr. & Mrs. Bartley's Burger Cottage."
If you’re looking for more menus, or if the Square’s offerings aren’t enough for you, try online food ordering services like Grub Hub, Campus Food, or Foodler. Want to make sure that eating out every day doesn’t get the best of your waistline? Calorie King and Daily Burn both have extensive databases containing nutrition facts for a variety of fast food restaurants ranging from McDonald’s to Boloco
