After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past week, freshmen have been lingering in Annenberg after dinner, sharing with their new friends what classes they want to shop, what clubs they might want to join, and more. Students at Harvard learn about and explore all the resources and opportunities that the University affords them by talking to their peers. Collaboration of this sort seems to be Harvard’s goal.
Hence, I was surprised to discover that Harvard’s new policy states that Peer Advising Fellows should limit or eliminate discussions about course selection with their freshmen advisees. These new guidelines seem at odds with Harvard’s broader emphasis on the importance of collaboration and discussion amongst students as integral to the community. Moreover, they unfairly disadvantage students who cannot find that peer-to-peer academic advising through other avenues.
As a freshman who came from a high school that sends a handful of students to Harvard each year, I had several established connections to upperclassmen before setting foot on campus. Throughout the summer, I texted two friends who had just finished their first year at Harvard. Most of my questions surrounded course selection. How early should I complete my General Education requirements? I wondered. Do you like the History and Literature concentration? Do you have any tips about getting into application-based seminars? What was your favorite class during your first year? These discussions and their opinions were invaluable as I began to navigate the process of creating a new world for myself on campus while simultaneously navigating the beginning of my academic career and first shopping week. And even after a string of texts with these upperclassmen, I still had a million questions that I wanted to ask my PAF about course selection.
But many students, and, I would imagine — a disproportionate number of first-generation students or students who come from high schools not well-represented at the Ivy League schools — are not as lucky as I was. These students might not have someone to text when they’re confused about the freshman seminar application process or when they want advice on what Humanities 10 is like. They may need guidance navigating Harvard’s curriculum and not already know any Harvard upperclassmen to help guide the way.
A logical conclusion might be that a freshman’s academic adviser should serve as the main contact for students seeking this guidance. And, as has been the case for many others, my academic adviser has been nothing but supportive. She is knowledgeable about Harvard’s curriculum and willing to get any specialized information I ask for through her various contacts across campus.
But no matter how strong the freshman advising program is, students serve as an invaluable resource to one another that simply cannot translate in a fair way to the new system in which academic advisers serve as the primary resource for freshmen to gain information about academics. Even beyond all the nuanced course selection advice that PAFs might be more equipped to give, having gone through it themselves, there’s a wealth of information that is simply not appropriate for adult advisers to provide. A PAF, for example, is much more likely to give honest information about professors’ teaching and grading styles than an academic adviser, whom I imagine would be unlikely to criticize their colleagues.
Further, for many Harvard students, the academic and social realms of campus are inextricably connected. To assign a peer adviser to serve as a mentor and de facto friend, to allow that person to talk about clubs, activities, and sports, but then to discourage or forbid that person from talking about academics, which connects the other aspects of our lives and brings us together, is puzzling. We are here for academics; our classes and course of study are on every freshman’s mind. To prohibit peer advisers from discussing academics, then, does a disservice to all first years.
By removing the opportunity to talk about such an integral part of our lives, especially during orientation and shopping week, Harvard has created an artificial divide between PAFs and freshmen that only serves to remind the freshmen that their PAF is paid to help them within the constraints of their job description. The relationship seems artificial and transactional, instead of convivial. If a freshmen can’t relate to their PAF in a way that seems organic and natural, if asking a question about academics is met with a stock referral to someone else, then the relationship is forever tainted.
The new guidelines merely limit freshmen’s access to critical information, especially during a shopping week that has been full of unexpectedly-stressful General Education lotteries and issues with my.harvard. To address any concerns or questions surrounding the role of PAFs, provide them with training on the right way to contextualize advice about course selection and then allow our relationships to grow naturally, even if that means we talk about academics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaving the gates of Harvard College was the best decision I’ve made in my college career.
When tourists and overzealous high school seniors ask what your favorite part of Harvard is, the “right” answer is that it’s the people who make Harvard worthwhile. But what does that translate to in practice? There are people, good and bad, at literally every institution, by definition. Why is Harvard worth fighting for over many other colleges? Three years into my time here, I’m happy to report that Harvard isn’t terribly special: It’s everything that the College enables that makes Harvard the place to be as an undergraduate.
I am thankful to have learned this lesson early on: Eight weeks into freshman year, after I had just joined the organizing team of HackHarvardCollege, an annual hackathon, a group of 10 Business School students approached me and my co-organizers with a pitch. They wanted our expertise to create an event like no other: a social impact hackathon held at the Vatican City with the support of the Catholic Church.
This was quite an oxymoron to me: Hackathons — events of innovation and rapid iteration — are the antithesis of the Vatican City — a theocratic bureaucracy known for being anything but innovative and iterative. The expenses, logistics, language barriers, and newness of it all made it a recipe for disaster. We foresaw months of planning, weeks of pursuing what would become dead ends, and days of insurmountable stress to bring life to this oxymoron. And yet, we saw what it could be: a future in which the Catholic Church, an organization with a reach on the order of billions, champions new technologies as a vehicle for social change. There was so much for the world to gain, and a lot for us college students to lose.
So, of course, we bit.
We somehow did it. We found 120 of the brightest minds across every continent and flew them all out to the Vatican in less than six months’ time. While it was great proving to the world that faith-based institutions like the Church have both the ability and the obligation to lead global humanitarian efforts, I learned another equally profound lesson: Business School students are rockstars. With their marketing and business experience and our hackathon logistics experience, we made the perfect team. The larger Harvard community, where ideas and skills merge to form a collective power, is strongest together.
In navigating Harvard’s cutthroat pre-professional scene, I also found that the most rewarding opportunities can from the most unlikely of places. In the lull of the sophomore-slump life, I found myself scrolling mindlessly through Facebook videos until I stumbled upon a video of a man flying a jet suit.
Flying humans — I felt another oxymoron brewing. It was time for another rodeo: this time in a term-time engineering co-op at Gravity Industries, a U.K.-based startup building jet suits. Five micro-jet engines (two on each arm, one on the back), a bladder of A1 kerosene jet fuel, and some fancy electronics give you the experience of untethered human flight. I didn’t earn any course credit, money, or Iron Man fantasies fulfilled during my time at Gravity — but every minute at this company focused both on future modes of transportation and inspiring the youth through STEM education was worth it.
Aside from the weird flex, the stories of VHacks and Gravity Industries are an invitation to question your time at Harvard: Where can you take a risk? Where can you do something stupid and crazy where failure is likely the only option? What can happen if you succeed? And, most importantly, how bad will it be, really, if you fail?
As I see it, Harvard is the safety net that should enable us to reach far past the gates of Harvard Yard. With guaranteed food and shelter, access to jobs and internships, and that sweet, sweet grade inflation, the College is comfortable. But being comfortable is dangerous — it can either make us very risk-tolerant, or very risk-averse. I implore you to choose the former.
In pursuing my off-beaten path at — or more precisely, outside of — Harvard, it is because of this safety net that I’ve felt confident to venture into new lands (and air). The College is just the beginning: As remarkable as it may appear, a look outside the hobbit-hole reveals something greater.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The launch of Harvard’s new Academic Resource Center, meant to replace the old Bureau of Study Council, will be accompanied by a restructuring of services the BSC used to offer. The biggest differences? Students will no longer pay for one-on-one tutoring — regardless of financial aid status — as the ARC moves to emphasize a group-session format. The ARC also seems to shift away from the BSC’s broader mission of social and emotional academic support.
While we stand behind any move to increase socioeconomic accessibility to academic resources, we also worry that the ARC is neglecting a critical part of the BSC’s mission: giving students advice on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, dealing with high academic workloads, and offering individualized counseling. Emblematic of that shift is that while the BSC used to offer a privacy policy, the ARC does not. On a campus where students feel they’re always performing, losing confidential resources is troubling. It’s essential that the College work to support and maintain the intimate relationships and trust that students have built with counselors and other staff. Moreover, it’s imperative that they continue to provide students, who have not yet developed those relationships, with opportunities to do so. Privacy is one assurance that is critical to that process.
To be sure, the ARC will offer students the opportunity to meet with academic coaches in 30-minute sessions. But the scope is much narrower: Academic coaches will assist in identifying “ideal learning styles,” “customizing [students’] semesters,” planning around concussions, and finding other academic resources, according to the ARC’s website. Academic counselors at the BSC had a mandate aimed to assuage students’ anxieties not only about their academics but about the intersections between their academics and their wider experience of life. As the BSC website noted, in bold no less, “Academic counseling is conversation about life and learning.” The question we have to ask is who is filling that prodigious gap.
At Harvard, many students have a problem less with the actual content of their academic work as with balancing the stresses, social, emotional, and otherwise, of completing that work in a highly competitive and often isolating environment. Between classes, extracurriculars, and the oft-forgotten notion of fun, how should we manage our time? How should we prioritize our efforts, when we have so much to care about and so much we really don’t? And how do we find a sense of purpose and meaning in the piles of articles and lines of code that just keep going? Students don’t need “coaches”; they need counselors.
Helping students deal with those pressures and questions was a vital part of what BSC did and what made it such a special service. It’s a shame to see the University abandon that approach to helping students. We are concerned that abandoning this aspect of the BSC’s mandate in favor of more narrowly defined — though commendably free — academic services will do a disservice to the students who relied on other aspects of the BSC’s support structure.
That said, we are hopeful that the new ARC will deliver free tutoring to students who need it and that increased access will help students achieve higher academic results and perhaps even a healthy work-life balance. To accommodate what may be significantly increased demand for tutoring services given the elimination of fees, the ARC should consider surveying people who used those resources in the past or even tutors who conducted sessions under the BSC, so as to get a better sense of what classes and disciplines they should expect to have the highest demand for tutoring. These efforts should be coupled with diligent work to ensure that the ARC has enough resources to support students in those classes and fields.
As the BSC restructures into ARC, administrators should take advantage of the opportunity to market their changes to both students and tutors. Only by working to hire a comprehensive and academically diverse set of tutors can the ARC hope to achieve its goal of meaningfully increasing access to vital academic resources for students all across the College, regardless of socioeconomic status.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventeen Cambridge City Council candidates fielded questions on affordable housing challenges and solutions at a forum Wednesday night.
The event — held in the Cambridge Public Library — was hosted by A Better Cambridge, a nonprofit organization that aims to increase affordable housing and tenant protections in Cambridge. In order to participate, both new and incumbent candidates were required to complete a questionnaire on affordable housing issues facing the city.
ABC Co-Chair Alexandra Markiewicz said the goal of the forum was to foster an “informed discussion” on housing before the election in November.
“We wanted to put the forum on as an opportunity to educate voters about what candidates feel on housing and what they think they would want to do to really address our housing crisis problems,” she said.
Moderator David E. Sullivan — a former city councilor — asked questions about Cambridge’s housing challenges, councilors’ current affordable housing proposals, and each candidate’s strategy to combat the issue.
Jeffrey McNary criticized past policies for not doing enough to address the crisis, and said more should have been done.
“This housing crisis just didn't jump out of the Charles River like ‘The Creature From the Black Lagoon’ — this has been here for a long time,” he said. “And if you didn't see that and plan for that, then you have got to own that.”
First-time candidate and recent MIT graduate Burhan Azeem said rising rents have forced him to consider leaving Cambridge. He said the possibility was “haunting” to him as a resident.
Much of Wednesday evening’s discussion focused on a proposed affordable housing overlay. Introduced in March, the proposed zoning reform would incentivize developers to build affordable housing units in Cambridge by streamlining approvals processes and reducing costs.
In a Monday meeting, the City Council unanimously voted to table the proposal after it became clear that they would not have enough votes. Tabling the measure brought an anticlimactic end to months of heated debate among councilors and residents alike. The council left open the option to revisit the proposal after it expires.
Current councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan defended the council’s actions during the forum, arguing that the proposal deserved more discussion.
“We’re all committed to building more affordable housing,” he said. “And again, it’s really important that we get it right. And in order to do that we need more time to address all the different parts.”
In addition to addressing the overlay, candidates also discussed original plans for addressing housing issues. Candidate Adriane B. Musgrave said she would work to increase parking availability and commit $20 million to affordable housing each year, calling funding a “major limitation.”
“We are an incredibly well-off and wealthy city, we are a high opportunity city, it is our collective responsibility to make sure that others who start off with less have access to live here,” she said.
Three candidates — John Pitkin, Sukia Akiba, and Ilan Levy — and Councilor Dennis J. Carlone failed to complete the mandatory questionnaire and were not invited to the forum. Councilor Timothy J. Toomey was invited, but did not participate.
Pitkin said he did not agree with their decision to keep him from the forum.
“I shouldn't have to answer their questions in order to participate in a public forum. That's odd,” he said. “They have the right to ask whatever questions they want, if they want to make endorsements. But I decided when I saw their platform that it wasn't something I was going to seek.”
Markiewicz responded to the criticism by saying she understands the complaint, but that the guidelines were “clearly delineated.”
“I completely understand that a candidate would be frustrated by not not being able to speak on a forum on one of the most important issues in the city,” she said. “But also, we have to respect the fact that we laid out the rules for everyone. We want to follow through with that.”
A Better Cambridge Action Fund, the political affiliate of ABC, plans to announce endorsements in the council race within the next week, according to Markiewicz. She added that the group will make these endorsements by weighing both candidates’ records as well as responses to the questionnaire.

After their first semester in office, Undergraduate Council President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 said they will spend the remainder of their term institutionalizing initiatives they started last semester.
The duo piloted many programs during their term, including a community lunch during Junior Family Weekend, the First-Year Students of Color Welcome Event, and the First-Year Interfaith Welcome Event. Though the UC funded the events this year, Huesa said they hope Harvard offices like the Office of Diversity Education and Support will be able to manage and fund the events in the future.
“One of the things that we’re really focused on is continuity and understanding that it is important to run these types of programs, events, and initiatives, but it is even more impactful if they are able to continue far into the future,” Palaniappan said.
The pair’s recent measures have largely focused on inclusion, a major pillar of the platform they ran on. Beyond these events, Palaniappan and Huesa’s legislation to establish a Social Inclusion Grant passed the council Sunday. Each week, the grant will give up to $750 to one individual and one student group looking to host an open social event on campus. The program is set to run for 10 weeks this semester.
The team also worked this summer to establish a $15,000 Public Service Travel Grant with the Office of Career Services to help students who cannot afford to travel to internship or job interviews at public service-related organizations.
Palaniappan also said that she and Huesa realized some of their campaign platform ideas were unfeasible once entering office. For example, they proposed a monthly concert series during their campaign to create more social spaces for students, but logistical issues hindered the idea's implementation.
“There will be initiatives that you thought were going to very well be possible, and it’s okay that not everything is going to always pan out as expected,” Palaniappan said.
Huesa said that the UC’s rules committee has hindered their ability to perform their duties as president and vice president.
In April, the committee created a separate group to interpret the UC’s constitution. The new group voted to strip the president and vice president of their voting rights and ability to sponsor legislation.
Enough representatives changed their votes the week following the meeting, however, to nullify the group’s establishment, leaving the president’s and vice president’s powers in the council uncertain.
“It made the barebones execution of a lot of our platform items — or also just items that the entire UC was trying to pass last semester that had the ultimate objective of improving student life — exceedingly difficult,” Huesa said.
UC Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, a member of the rules committee and a former Crimson Sports Chair, rejected Huesa’s characterization of the committee’s work.
“The Rules Committee did not disenfranchise the executive, but has simply attempted to resolve the constitutional crisis,” he wrote in an emailed statement. “The effort, beset on all sides by individual members of the council, has thus far failed.”
Palaniappan and Huesa will leave office at the end of the semester after the UC presidential election in November.
The UC will also hold elections in the coming weeks as all UC representatives – except for juniors and seniors who serve as committee chairs, treasurer, or secretary – must run for re-election. Voting will take place between Sept. 17 and 19.

Leverett House residents aired concerns about newly off-limits House common spaces and a dearth of social events under the leadership of Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras in emails and a public document this week.
Students’ concerns included the recent closure of Leverett’s private dining room, sporadic house-wide events, new keycard access restrictions, changes to the Senior Common Room, and challenges booking social spaces. In a Google Doc shared among undergraduates, students listed their grievances and discussed bringing them to House management.
Farrell wrote in an emailed statement that he and Ferreras are aware of some of the students' criticisms and are “very concerned” about students’ engagement in House life.
Leverett residents Nicholas E. Stauffer-Mason ’20 and Amalia E. Frohna ’20 both said they believe the House’s culture changed after former Faculty Deans Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi left in 2018.
“Basically as soon as they took over they took away access to a lot of community spaces that people use,” Stauffer-Mason said.
The Georgis continued to serve in an official capacity at Leverett last year as members of the Senior Common Room, a group of professors, administrators, and local professionals affiliated with the House. At the start of this semester, though, they informed some Leverett residents they would transfer to the Lowell House SCR.
Howard Georgi wrote in an email that they made the decision as a result of “disappointment” with changes Farrell and Ferreras made to SCR policies.
In particular, Howard Georgi cited biweekly lunches SCR members held for students during his tenure.
“We hoped that something like this would continue and that we would be able to attend occasionally to keep in touch with our many student and SCR friends,” he wrote. “The current faculty deans have not continued the tradition and have disinvited many long-time SCR members. So while we are still very close to many of the current seniors, we thought it best to start over in another Senior Common Room.”
Farrell and Ferreras were among the lowest-rated faculty deans in a May Crimson survey of graduating seniors. Asked how much they trust their faculty deans, just under 27 percent of Leverett respondents indicated they trusted the pair.
The role of the College’s 24 faculty deans has come under increased scrutiny in the wake of controversy over former Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in his criminal trial. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana dismissed Sullivan and co-Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson in May after months of student outcry.
Khurana’s announcement came one day after The Crimson reported allegations that Sullivan and Robinson fostered a hostile work environment in Winthrop during their decade as deans. At one point, 13 Winthrop resident tutors threatened to quit, though they ultimately stayed.
Farrell and Ferreras sent an email to Leverett residents Wednesday night stating they believe student input is important.
“Our goal is a house culture where everyone feels empowered to shape their house experience. It is clear that we need to think how we can create such an environment for all,” they wrote. “Leverett is already a vibrant, wonderful community. It will be even stronger when all members feel they can share their concerns, voice their ideas, and together build the community we aspire to be, together.”
Frohna and Leverett resident Samantha J. Frenkel-Popell ’21 both said they think communication between students and Farrell and Ferreras could improve.
“I think actually, this has almost been good because you really see that a lot of people care about house life, and I would just love to see that harnessed,” Frohna said. “I think definitely we need to have more communication from the house deans about how they're going to address some of the grievances that we have.”
“I think change came quicker than people expected — and maybe it wasn't explained — so people were kind of surprised by the way things used to be versus the new faculty deans,” Frenkel-Popell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Institute of Politics’ new class of resident fellows engaged in a lively conversation about civic life and bipartisanship on Wednesday evening to kick off a semester of study groups and events the fellows hold for students.
Former Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), kicked off the forum by recounting his lifetime of expeditions to remote islands with no food, water, or tools. He said he took one such trip with fellow Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and nothing but a machete, “to prove that Republicans and Democrats can get along.”
Flake’s anecdote set the stage for an evening of conversation about pursuing civility and bipartisanship in politics and public service.
Bob Cohn, the former president of the Atlantic, offered commentary on the state of the journalism industry.
“The industry itself — and journalists in particular — are under profound attack from this administration,” he said.
Alice Stewart, a former Republican campaign communications director and commentator on CNN, shared her experience being called out on Twitter by President Donald Trump less than 24 hours before the forum.
“Thank you for the nice words while on @CNN concerning the TWO big Republican Congressional victories,” he tweeted. “You’d be great on a network with much higher ratings. Keep up the good work!”
Later in the forum, Flake said that he hopes politics will return to an earlier era when respect and civility toward members of the opposite party was commonplace.
In response, LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of the Black Votes Matter Fund, burst into song. “We who believe in freedom cannot rest, cannot rest until it comes,” she sang.
“I absolutely 1,000 percent disagree with [Flake’s] position. I think the goal is never to backwards. It’s actually to go forward,” she said, following the song. “The goal isn't to retreat and fear and go back to a place of safety, because what was safe for some has not been safe for me."
After the event, forum attendees called the exchange exemplary of the forum’s values.
“It was done in a very bipartisan, conversational way,” said Katherine A. Krolicki ’20, one of the co-chairs of the Fellows and Study Groups program. “That's the essence of this program and seeing those two very, very different voices come together and have these conversations and understand, that is what this program is about.”
Michael A. C. Hla ’23 said the fellows are role models for his generation.
“I think all of these fellows really believed in bipartisanship rather than hostility,” Hla said.
The forum also included a conversation about the different routes to politics and public service. For example, Deesha Dyer, an Obama administration Social Secretary, discussed how she went from dropping out of college at 18 to holding a senior staff position in the White House.
Deyer said she will focus her study group, titled "Imposter to Impact," on people like her “who had a very unconventional journey into politics.”
H.E. Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado, the former vice president of Panama, also said she never dreamed of running for office before becoming a vice presidential candidate.
“Never say never,” she joked.

If you’re already aching to get off campus after just a week of class, you’re in luck! We’ve rounded up four adventure ideas for four days at the end of this week. From a Jordan Peele screening and science exhibition to fireworks and local food options, these events are sure to distract you from your first round of semester stressors.
Thursday:
“Us” @ Museum of Fine Arts
Loved “Get Out” but still haven’t seen Jordan Peele’s most recent horror movie? There are definitely worse ways to spend your Thursday evening than by catching a sunset screening of “Us” on the Museum of Fine Arts’s Huntington Avenue Lawn. Bring your own blankets and snacks and enjoy!
Friday:
College Fridays @ Museum of Science
This one’s for everyone who loved STEM as a kid, but not quite enough to declare a concentration in it. Every Friday this month starting at 5 p.m., Boston’s Museum of Science is offering free admission into the General Exhibit Halls with a college ID. The events will boast duck tours, lightning bolt demonstrations, and exhibits on all sorts of different science subjects.
Saturday:
Riverfest @ Assembly Row
With a movie theater, LegoLand, and plenty of shopping and dining, there’s already enough to do at Assembly Row. This Saturday, though, there will be even more — a full day of live music, food and drink pop-ups, games, and giveaways. The best part? Fireworks over the Mystic River at sundown.
Sunday:
Boston Local Food Festival @ Rose Kennedy Greenway
Wrap up the weekend by supporting regional businesses and celebrating sustainable eating at the Boston Local Food Festival. There will be chef demos, opportunities to learn about food in New England, and lots to eat. It will be delicious.
Harvard isn’t the entire world. Go forth and burst the Harvard bubble with these Boston events!
