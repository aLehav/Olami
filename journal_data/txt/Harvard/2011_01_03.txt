After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t always pretty, but the Harvard women’s basketball team will take it.
Although UMass (3-11) made a spirited comeback, the Crimson’s 17-point halftime lead was too much to overcome yesterday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion. Led by junior Brogan Berry’s 18 points, Harvard (6-5) snapped a two-game losing streak with an 83-70 victory.
“We really put the pressure on them early, got up,” Berry said. “Unfortunately, we were a little bit inconsistent towards the end of the game, let them come back. But overall, I think we finished strong, played as a team, and got the W.”
The two squads traded baskets in the early going before a pair of three-pointers from sophomore Victoria Lippert just past the midway point of the half sparked a 21-6 run that let the Crimson pull away for good.
“Victoria, she’s an awesome player,” Berry said. “She’s a scorer. You give her the ball, she’s going to put the ball in the basket. And sometimes you need players like that to take over.”
Although Lippert came off the bench on her 20th birthday, she still put up 17 points and six rebounds in 25 minutes of play.
“Victoria is better and better now that I’m making her my sixth player—and I know the world is looking at me like I’m an idiot,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “But it’s so great for our team that she’s doing what she’s doing as a sixth player. So if I can get her to keep getting better, or be mad at me trying to earn a starting role back, and she plays like that, then that makes me a good coach.”
Though Lippert provided the offensive spark, it was a team defensive effort that allowed Harvard to build up its insurmountable halftime lead.
After Minutewoman Jasmine Watson put in a layup with 7:08 to play in the first, the Crimson defense did not allow another field goal until after halftime.
“Being at home was definitely a huge part of our success,” Berry said. “Everybody came off the bench with a lot of energy. We buckled down on defense, which is where we really struggle. And once we play solid defense, we can really get our offense flowing, and that’s when we start pulling away from teams.”
At the break, Harvard was up, 39-22, shooting 53.3 percent compared to UMass’s 20 percent.
“I actually liked our whole game in the first half, to be honest—I thought we shared the ball well,” Delaney-Smith said. “I want to be a better defensive team, and I thought we were.”
The Crimson came out strong to start the second half, building its biggest lead of the day—a 46-24 advantage—on a pair of buckets from freshman Christine Clark. But towards the end of the second half of the frame, Harvard’s defense began to falter.
Minutewoman freshman Sara English subbed into the game midway through the second half and quickly made an impact. English scored seven straight points, tying her career high in just six minutes of play and giving her team a much-needed spark, cutting the deficit to 13.
Though the Crimson would rally back to push its lead to 19 with 4:55 to play, UMass clawed its way back. The combination of Dee Montgomery’s inside presence and Megan Zullo’s timely three-point shooting trimmed the margin to as few as eight points with two minutes to play.
“We were forcing some shots up on offense that gave them easy rebounds, easy fast breaks, and transition defense is the hardest defense to play,” Berry said. “They took advantage of that, so they got some easy baskets, got some easy threes.”
Berry sunk a deep two from the left corner with 1:30 on the clock to give Harvard a 75-65 lead, and though the Minutewomen tried to foul to get back into the game, the Crimson hit all six of its last-minute free throws to seal the 13-point victory.
Fourteen different Harvard players saw the court, with four of them—Berry, Lippert, Clark, and senior Emma Markley—finishing with double-digit point totals.
But as the team looks ahead to a midweek matchup with No. 25 Boston College, Delaney-Smith still sees much room for improvement.
“By this point, I’m expecting 40 minutes, and we didn’t get it,” she said. “We’re better than that—that shouldn’t have happened...This isn’t a feel-good game for me...We’re not putting 40 minutes together, and we should be ashamed of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some say the new year brings new fortune, and that looked like it just might be true for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
After a seven-game losing skid to close out 2010, the Crimson (3-9, 2-7 ECAC Hockey) returned to the ice on Saturday afternoon to defeat Army (5-12-1, 4-6-1 Atlantic Hockey) 4-2 in its first game of the Sheraton/TD Bank Catamount Cup at Gutterson Fieldhouse in Burlington, Vt.
But the triumph would be short-lived, as Harvard was handed another loss by Vermont (3-10-4, 1-6-3 Hockey East) in a 3-1 decision last night.
All three teams have struggled in early season play and were looking to boost the latter part of their schedules with a successful tournament run.
Ohio State won both of its games against Vermont and Army to capture the Sheraton/TD Bank Catamount Cup title. Killorn, who has now registered points in 10 of Harvard’s 12 games, was the lone Crimson player named to the six-member All-Tournament Team.
VERMONT 3, HARVARD 1
The Crimson and the Catamounts share unique common ground—both are coached by two former Harvard hockey captains and teammates: Ted Donato ’91 and Kevin Sneddon ’92, respectively.
But the two squads looked like they may have had more than just coaching in common at the beginning of their matchup Sunday. The first frame was scoreless, with both teams limiting their opponent’s shots—despite two Vermont power plays.
Harvard looked to get on the scoreboard late in the first period and early in the second with dangerous shots from senior Michael Biega and sophomore Marshall Everson, but Catamount junior netminder Rob Madore denied every opportunity.
Just past the game’s halfway mark, Vermont struck with a slap shot that made it past senior Crimson goalie Kyle Richter to put the Catamounts up 1-0. And before the close of the second period senior Vermont defenseman Kyle Medvec added another goal to give his team a two-score margin.
At the beginning of the final frame, Medvec and Catamount freshman Connor Brickley combined to bounce a shot off Richter to bring the score to 3-0.
Amidst some controversial and physical play, a Vermont penalty gave Harvard the man advantage and junior Alex Killorn, Harvard’s leading scorer, put away a slap shot just out of Madore’s reach.
Minutes later it looked like the Catamounts had struck once again, but the late goal was disallowed after video replay revealed Brickley had tripped Richter.
The Crimson tried to recover in an aggressive last few minutes of play, but the effort proved futile, and the game ended in a 3-1 loss.
HARVARD 4, ARMY 2
Before Saturday, it had been almost 20 years since the Crimson and the Black Knights last met on ice. But before tha,  Harvard had dominated the series with a 29-5-1 overall advantage.
The Crimson continued its runn in the two teams’ most recent meeting this weekend.
Harvard came out looking strong, controlling the puck and getting shots off early in the opening period. Aggressive play kept the Crimson on the offensive attack, but Army found the back of the net first. The Black Knights scored on their first shot of the game during an Army power play.
The Black Knights kept their momentum, taking a 2-0 lead just four minutes later. As a result, Harvard went into the first intermission facing a two-goal deficit, despite outshooting its opponents 9-5.
But when the Crimson returned for the second period, it took control of the ice and of the scoreboard.
Early in the frame Harvard freshman Danny Fick set up a good look for sophomore Brendan Rempel, who sent a tough shot towards the Army goal. Senior Michael Biega got his stick on the puck just enough to deflect the shot past the Black Knights’ goaltender.
Halfway through the period, sophomore David Valek scored his first goal of the season, with help from junior Rence Coassin and freshman Dan Ford, to tie up the score at 2-2.
It wasn’t long into the third frame when Killorn got Harvard its first lead of the game when he put away a backhand shot off the rebound of a try from Biega.
Sophomore Luke Greiner scored the Crimson’s final goal five minutes later when he deflected another shot by Fick, giving the Harvard freshman two assists on the day.
But with more than half the period left to play, there was still time for Army to attempt a comeback. The Black Knights racked up seven shots in the final period, almost as many as they had all game, but Richter kept the puck out of the net, accumulating 13 saves—even with almost two minutes of 6-on-4 play.
The Crimson defense prevailed and locked up the 4-2 victory for a positive start to 2011 play.
