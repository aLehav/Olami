After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is borrowing $480 million to refinance its debt and to fund capital projects on campus, including the construction of a new Harvard Law School building, according to a credit rating report released Friday by Moody's Investors Service.
Despite the new bond issuance—which brings the University's total outstanding debt to $6.5 billion—Harvard will maintain its top-notch 'AAA' credit rating from both Moody's and Standard and Poor's, another credit rating service.
Harvard's Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore had said last fall that Harvard would likely need to take on more debt this year, even if the University aimed to sustain only a "shrunken down" series of capital expenditures for the campus. But he added that the University would be careful in issuing more debt, and that it would prioritize the maintenance of its vaunted 'AAA' rating.
A Moody's credit rating report issued last April said that Harvard was considering halving its capital spending and new debt issuance, and the University recently announced that it would be halting construction of its Allston Science Complex, the roughly $1 billion cornerstone of the University's future campus across the Charles River.
The last time Harvard issued debt was in December 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis, when it borrowed $2.5 billion to raise cash, refinance risky short-term debt, and terminate certain investment agreements. The move drew heavy media attention and criticism, with a Forbes cover story suggesting that Harvard was in a "cash-raising panic."
Despite reining in its ambitious Allston expansion plans, Harvard has continued to push forward with other campus construction and renovation projects, including at the Harvard Art Museum and Arnold Arboretum. Law School administrators decided last year to continue construction of HLS' Northwest Corner Building, in spite of University-wide efforts to cut expenditures, because the project would have been more expensive to halt than to continue, according to Law Professor and then-Interim HLS Dean Howell E. Jackson in interviews last year. Administrators did make modest changes to the plan by deciding not to demolish buildings adjacent to the expansion.
The HLS building, scheduled to be completed by winter 2011, will house the school's rapidly growing clinical programs, a student center, and classrooms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, Ivy League play began at Lavietes Pavilion with one team rolling and the other reeling. On one side, Harvard had just finished its non-conference schedule with an all-time best 11 wins. On the other, Dartmouth was playing without a head coach as the Big Green’s Terry Dunn resigned on the eve of the Ivy opener.
Momentum did not change for either side. Harvard (12-3, 1-0 Ivy) built a lead in the first half and cruised to a 76-47 win behind a career-high 22 points from sophomore forward Keith Wright.
“We played hard,” Wright said, “especially on the defensive end. Everything starts with defense.”
Dartmouth’s 46 points represented the lowest offensive output against the Crimson this season. Harvard limited the Big Green (3-11, 0-1 Ivy) to 34.5 percent shooting from the field and 25.0 percent shooting from three, while yielding only ten free-throws.
“A tremendous defensive effort, I thought,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “To be able to hold them to [47 points] and then the shooting percentage…I was very pleased with that.”
In one defensive stretch midway through the second half, co-captain Jeremy Lin stole the ball four times in five possessions. The senior finished with six steals in the game.
On the offensive end, Lin struggled to find his shot, but Wright picked up the scoring burden. The sophomore dominated the low post, scoring from both blocks with either hand. Wright even drifted outside the paint and showed off his jump shot, knocking down two from midrange in the first half.
“I worked on the midrange jumper a lot this summer,” Wright said. “It’s all paying off.”
The big man finished with his career-best 22 points on 11-of-16 shooting, pacing the Harvard offense on a night when it scored 50 points in the paint.
“We have a lot of weapons offensively that allow us to be a dangerous team and give us great balance,” Amaker said.
The Crimson’s depth paid big dividends as Harvard got a boost from its bench throughout the night.
With the Crimson leading by eight late in the opening half, freshman forward Kyle Casey came into the game and made two high-energy plays. On the first, he chased down Dartmouth guard Robby Pride on a fast break and swatted his lay up off the backboard. Moments later, sophomore guard Oliver McNally launched an alley-oop from outside the three-point line to a soaring Casey, who flushed home the deuce.
After three-straight games of setting a career-high in scoring, Casey finished with six points to go along with four blocks.
In the second half, freshman guard Dee Giger provided the Crimson with a similar lift. First, the freshman knocked down a pull-up jumper from the left corner. Then, on the next possession, Giger drove baseline and flushed home a one-handed jam for two of his eight points on the night.
Another weapon, freshman guard Christian Webster contributed 12 points on five-of-six shooting.
“We have a saying—we stole the saying from the Celtics and we use it a lot with our kids. It states, ‘Stay ready, so you don’t have to get ready,’” Amaker said. “Our bench knows that we’re going to use them, so they’re ready to go when we go to them.”
The win—Harvard’s first conference victory—also marks the start of the final phase to the Crimson’s season. Without a conference tournament, every remaining game carries postseason implications.
“Any game in our league is a tough game,” Amaker said. “Our next game, we play [Dartmouth] again at their place. We anticipate they’ll be ready, give their best shot at us, and hopefully we’ll be up to the challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I took the opportunity tonight to  watch Harvard men’s basketball recruit (committed to the future class of  2014) James Moore, a senior at Jesuit High (Calif.), as his Marauders  took on the Kennedy Cougars at his home gym.
Moore’s coach Greg Harcos had heavily praised the 6′8 forward’s  ability to shoot the three ball when Moore announced his commitment to  Harvard in early December, and he did not disappoint tonight. Launching  the ball with a high, smooth release, Moore knocked down a pair of three  pointers on consecutive possessions in the game’s opening minutes. The  second and third quarter each found Moore hitting a clean triple, the  latter coming off an immediate catch-and-shoot. Moore’s only missed  three-pointer was his last attempt, a transition three in the third  quarter.
The tallest player on either team, Moore was not very quick in  transition or closing out on shooters, but he took advantage of his size  to tip multiple jump shots on defense. His main role on offense was as a  perimeter player. Moore was unsuccessful on his two inside shots in the  first half and did not look comfortable attacking the basket. In the  third quarter, he did receive the ball in the post and spin for a layup,  adding on the free throw. Overall, Moore spent much more time on the  wing than in the post, and his style is not particularly physical.
Moore needs to add weight to his  relatively thin frame, and he does not use his body as much as simply  relying on his height and long arms to grab rebounds. Though neither  Moore nor the Harvard coaching staff has commented on his future role,  his skill set appear similar to that of current freshman Jeff Georgatos,  who was also touted as a sharpshooter coming out of high school.  However, Georgatos has seen limited minutes so far this season for the  Crimson.

Let’s Go, the organization that publishes budget-friendly travel guidebooks, is turning the big 5-0 this year.
According to Let’s Go Head of Sales and Marketing Ashley R. Laporte '10, there will be two different events commemorating the organization's 50th anniversary.
The "Wine and Cheese and Travel Workshop," which will help prospective travelers plan their vacations, is set to take place on Jan. 26 at the Harvard Book Store. In addition, Let’s Go, OCS, OIP and STA Travel have teamed up to organize a “Summer Travel Opportunities Kickoff” information session that will take place on Feb. 4 in Ticknor Lounge.
Let's Go staff members told us that they certainly plan to keep the original spirit of the books alive.
“Let’s Go started out as student travel guide, and we’d like to keep that philosophy in mind. It does not have the staid, formal prose of other guides. It is witty, sarcastic, and has true and honest opinions,” said Managing Editor Iya Megre ’11.
Founder G. Oliver Koppell ’62 said he was enthusiastic about the progress that Let's Go has made over the past five decades. “I’m very excited that the guide has been published for 50 years," he said. "I never anticipated the growth the guide itself has undergone. I use the guides myself, and I’m very impressed.”
As a freshman in 1959, Koppell began organizing charter flights to Europe for Harvard faculty and students. The Let's Go guidebooks, he said, grew out of this initiative.
“My father, who had worked in both the travel business and publishing, said, ‘Oliver, since you're organizing these charter flights, why don’t you make a guide book for the students on these flights?' So I made a pamphlet in 1960,” said Koppell.
Since then, Let’s Go has evolved quite a bit—it now boasts an impressive collection of 49 guides. It was also the first travel guide series to post all of its content online free of charge, according to Executive Editor Nathaniel S. Rakich '10, who is also a Crimson editorial editor.
Although Let's Go faced some challenges when its publisher, St. Martin's Press, terminated their 25-year relationship (around the same time that the national economy started going downhill), Rakich told the Crimson last year that he was optimistic about the series' future.
So what is it about Let's Go that makes it so special? “We’re not just about giving you information about all these different places," Megre told us. "We’re telling you why you want to visit them.”
Cheers to you, Let’s Go! Here's to another half century of success.

Readers of the Cambridge Chronicle—the inferior other Cambridge newspaper—may have noticed a rather strange placement of a sticker advertisement on this week's front page.
The "most unfortunate juxtaposition," as Media Nation called it, is the coincidence that the sticker, advertising a wine sale at Cambridge Wine & Spirits, has been placed over the photo of (now) former Mass. State Senator Anthony D. Galluccio being handcuffed after receiving his one-year sentence for a drinking probation violation.
"We couldn't have planned this if we tried," wrote Greg Reibman of GateHouse Media New England (the Chronicle's publisher) in his response to Media Nation's post. He added that they "sincerely apologize to former Sen. Galluccio and anyone else who might, understandably, be troubled by this."
Reibman wrote that the advertisement had been ordered and scheduled way before the news article had been written, and that the stickers had been placed onto the newspapers by a machine about 25 miles away from the building that created the front page.
In October 2009, Galluccio left the scene of an accident in Cambridge that had caused injury to two individuals. The Crimson reported that he was put on alcohol probation last month but failed his first breathalyzer test just three days after the start of the probation (he blamed his toothpaste). Galluccio resigned earlier this week.
Well, at least we know that behind the sticker is a man with clean teeth.

During a late-afternoon perusal  of New York Magazine’s Daily Intel blog, we were amused to find an interesting little  “quote” from one of our very own—HBS  professor William W. George (better known as simply Bill George). “If you don’t  pay them  for their performance, you’ll lose them. It's much like professional  athletes and movie stars," George had said, supposedly referring (as the blog had initially suggested) to bankers.
A little…intrigued by this statement, we called George’s office to see what  was up.
George could not be reached for comment, but his people did give us a copy of the Big Think interview from which the quote was extracted.
The transcript makes it immediately clear that the Daily Intel had taken George's statement way out of context. He had been talking about “traders," not “bankers"—a fact that would have been made abundantly clear by a cursory glance at the sentence preceding or following the quote. To get the scoop, we called the author of the post, Jessica Pressler of New York Magazine.
A little later,  she called us back to let us know that she had checked the interview  transcript and understood the mistake in her post. It has now been changed to reflect more accurately the meaning  of George’s words.
We don’t really think this little  kerfuffle is a federal issue, but we do feel a little bad for George, who was  just trying to make the point that long-term performance should  be rewarded with long-term compensation.
