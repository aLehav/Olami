After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In December, I argued that government attempts to regulate personal genomics testing were misguided and counterproductive. No less important, inquiries by Congress into the practices of direct-to-customer genetic testing disregarded the buyer’s right to know his own genetic information.
This satisfied buyer is relieved that Congress has backed off. As a Hanukkah present for myself, I purchased a spit-collection kit from 23andme for $99, expectorated, and waited in eager anticipation for my full genetic sequence—complete with special profiles on my ancestry and health.
After a six-week-long wait, my genome saw the light of internet publication. I carefully navigated from tool to tool, uncovering a thorough mix of banalities and discoveries.
I read down a list of traits: brown eyes, shorter than average, does not flush with alcohol. 23andme had so far succeeded in describing someone’s first impression of me out on a Saturday night.
“Ancestry Finder” estimated my descent in terms of broad groups: European, Asian, and African. Having lived my entire life as a white man, I could have guessed that they’d tell me I was European—but maybe not the 99.97 percent that my genes volunteered.
“Paternal Line” and “Maternal Line” told the stories of my direct paternal and maternal lineages with shaded maps. As a carrier of haplogroup E1b1b1c1 on my Y-chromosome, I can trace my shtetl-dwelling great-grandfather’s line back thousands of years to the Holy Land.
It’s harder to comprehend that a vial of spittle can place odds on your future.  23andme offers a battery of health predictions, rating their confidence based on the strength of current genetic research on different conditions. As my father’s father has already manifested, I have a genetically elevated risk of stroke, ill reaction to blood thinners, and essential tremors.
As an 18-year-old, cancer is something I’ve scarcely imagined ever happening to me. But I’m told with four yellow stars of confidence that I have a 43 percent lifetime risk of prostate cancer, two and a half times the genetic average for a white man.
Unlike the “news” that I have brown eyes, or that I’m 99.97 percent white, this means something. I hope to find the resolve to start taking preventive measures as soon as I can, while keeping an eye out for warning signs and avoiding risk factors.
Along similar lines, 23andme detects that I’m a carrier for Canavan disease, which entails an average lifespan of four years. Incident at a rate of one in 40 among European Jews, the allele for Canavan is harmless if you have just one. Two recessive alleles spell a death sentence. A baby born with two cytosine alleles at the Canavan mutation site will degenerate progressively through early childhood as the myelin sheaths coating his nerve connections start to break down.
Unlike the estimated risk judged for prostate cancer, the meaning of a mutant Canavan allele is certain. If I were to reproduce with another carrier, every child would have a 25 percent risk of developing Canavan disease. Before I consider having children with anyone, I will have no humane choice but to know whether she’s also a Canavan carrier.
It’s manifestly clear that my Canavan allele could be a force for devastation and heartbreak – but there exists a possible flipside.
Conjectural work by Gregory M. Cochran and Jason Hardy of the University of Utah says that Canavan carriers might enjoy unusual, but beneficial changes in brain structure due to a single, potentially lethal allele. Could this begin to explain why my roommate calls me “the most different person I’ve ever met”?
The answer is nowhere near as sure as the color of my hair or the wetness of my earwax. But it’s hard not to swoon at the idea that one quirk in my genome could explain an infinity of quirks that defines my real-life comportment. 23andme is admittedly imperfect, and the computer readout of our disease risks in big, red letters evokes a very natural cognitive dissonance.
But don’t dismiss it.  The science behind sequencing our genomes has become standard and irreproachable, and 23andme carries out the rest with a proper balance of caution and warning. I hope to act on my own results accordingly, with an added dose of reverence for every base pair. After all: DNA might not be destiny, but it’s what you’re made of.

All Harvard diplomas are not created equal.
Every year, a select portion of the graduating class receives a few additional lines of print on their diplomas designating Latin honors: summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude. The English, or departmental, honors, however, represented through the respective distinctions of highest honors, high honors, or honors, connotes a slightly different type of achievement. Departmental distinctions go to students who are “especially distinguished” in their concentration and are noted in transcripts only—not on diplomas. By contrast, the Latin honors go to students who have been recommended for departmental honors and also attain a minimum cumulative GPA; a subcommittee of the Faculty Council determines the cutoff each year.
Interestingly enough, during a recent Faculty meeting, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented a motion to revise the current system of Latin honors. Dean Harris ’s proposal would mandate that five percent of undergraduates receive summa cum laude degrees, as opposed to the current system that selects between four and five percent of undergraduates at the discretion of the Faculty Council subcommittee. A policy that requires summa cum laude honorees to receive As in two classes in the humanities, in the social sciences, and in the natural sciences would also be reconsidered.
These, of course, are good steps, but the honors system should be reconsidered more broadly.
By rewarding students who achieve a minimum GPA across classes, the Latin honors system does more to discourage academic achievement than to encourage it. It encourages students to view classes outside of their concentration as a means to an end, the end being the highest possible grade, rather than an opportunity for intellectual exploration. High-achieving classics concentrators looking to take a course in, say, physics might be discouraged from taking Physics 15a not because of a lack of interest but because they believe they will not get equivalently high grades as they do in their own concentration. Such students fail to push their own boundaries and to discover hidden talents and passions. This works against the purpose of a liberal arts education, which is to expose students to a broad range of different fields and to discover a variety of interests.
In determining Latin honors, the College considers a single number in judging whether or not a student is worthy of a distinction that carries connotations of academic prowess. As a result, students who take notoriously easy classes are rewarded, in part, for the low standards they set.
In contrast, the English, or departmental, honors system is less harmful to the academic spirit of the College. It accomplishes the purpose of an honors system—to reward exceptional academic achievement—while allowing students room to take risks and find their feet in disciplines where they feel less at home. 
Because English honors reward high achievement without dissuading academic exploration, they should be kept and promoted as the University’s main honor system, and Latin honors should be abolished. To be sure, this move is certainly not the ultimate answer to the age-old problem of students taking classes merely to increase their GPAs for reasons outside of academic honors, such as jobs or fellowships. Culture shifts, however, are hard to achieve over night, and we feel certain that banishing Latin honors from Harvard would at least be one concrete step the College could take to encourage and defend the spirit of intellectual pursuit that should characterize any liberal arts education.
Ideally, of course, honors should remain an afterthought in the course of one’s college experience. But we nevertheless believe that eliminating Latin honors is a necessary step in correcting the troubling trend of students motivating themselves for the honors themselves instead of the accomplishments they are meant to connote.
High achievement deserves to be honored, but only when it is present alongside sincere motivation and considerable ambition. Just as not all diplomas are created equal—neither are all GPAs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I’m Barbara Bush, and I’m a New Yorker for marriage equality,” declares George W. Bush’s daughter on last week’s Human Rights Campaign video. Unsurprisingly, critics are up in arms. Some, like a writer on “Dispatches from the Culture Wars,” insinuate that Daddy Bush’s support for the Federal Marriage Amendment was mere political pandering “to bigots.” Others, like a writer on the “Republican Redefined” blog, solemnly suggest that this video is the end of the beginning of the road toward legalization of gay marriage. These predictions are all well and good—God forbid journalists fail to exaggerate the impact of the younger, more progressive Bush’s opinion—but far more fascinating are the moralistic claims about the nature of marriage that this video inspires.
Moral rhetoric is the culture war’s current weapon of choice, but the culture war’s real meat lies in the orthodoxies that compel the moral intensity at the front lines. We cannot adequately understand how the culture wars evoke such moralistic passion until we recognize the authority of these orthodoxies. Effectively, two camps wage the culture war: the secular orthodoxy, composed of those who identify with the medley of feminism, pluralism, liberationism, and multiculturalism, and the traditional orthodoxy, wed to Judeo-Christian values. As the incessant unrest over Roe v. Wade illustrates, the intrinsic disparities between these orthodoxies render them philosophically incompatible.
Both orthodoxies utilize moral rhetoric and indeed must utilize moral rhetoric in order to gain public approval on the three major battlefields: religion in the public sphere, issues of human life, and sexuality. On the sexual battlefield, the secular approach to sexual morality is as fiercely moralistic as the traditional approach to sexual morality. A Harvard “contraceptive justice” event this fall advertised Planned Parenthood’s Cecile Richards as “a leader in the reproductive justice movement” and perfectly illustrates the self-righteous rhetoric of justice wielded by secularists. This social justice rhetoric is particularly persuasive to our generation, which is programmed to stop, drop, and roll whenever we hear the words “equality” and “fairness.”
But the secularists’ use of moral rhetoric should not be taken for granted. Secular morality owes its origin to a conscientious shift in language resulting from centuries of philosophical debate. This is the shift away from moral relativism and toward the rationalist, objectivist approach of traditionalists.
Traditionalists maintain that reason must reign over emotion and passion. Intellect must master appetite for the common and personal good, and desires must never seek their own fulfillment. The Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle also came to view reason as the master of passion: Plato spoke of the rightly ordered soul in which virtues lead to happiness, and Aristotle saw moderation as the divine virtue. The traditional view of morality presupposes intrinsic goods that humans must affirm to enable human flourishing. The belief that all human life, regardless of age or “quality,” has intrinsic value serves as a good example of this view of morality.
In contrast, classic secularist thought revolved around the idea that reason is the instrument of emotion. As one of the first secular philosophers, David Hume, wrote in “A Treatise on Human Nature”: “Reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and may never pretend to any office other than to serve and obey them.” Reason itself is thus utilitarian, existing to manipulate, rather than to discover the rational.
In “A Clash of Orthodoxies,” Princeton Professor Robert P. George gives credit to 20th century liberal philosopher Joel Feinberg for pointing out the dangers of relativism, which denies the validity of moral judgments. Feinberg once reminded his own secularist camp that those waving its flag “must beware of [using] relativism—or, at least, of a sweeping relativism—lest they be hoist on their own petard." Both George and Feinberg wondered where we acquire fundamental rights if reason is instrumental. What is the foundation for freedom of religion? Speech? Equality? This became immensely problematic for Hume-influenced secularists as they defended their beliefs. In a cultural theater judged by public opinion, relativism is futile, and moralism is persuasive.
Many modern secularists found that relativism did not serve their own purposes. For instance, the right to abortion is a moral claim and can exist only if we deny holistic relativism. In one of the greatest recent philosophical shifts, the secular orthodoxy awoke from its moral neutrality; secularists are now as moralistic as the traditionalists.
The secular orthodoxy has taken a page out of the traditional book (no Biblical allusion intended). While the competing orthodoxies have irreconcilable philosophies on life, community, and happiness, shared rhetoric is a rare point of accord. But does our mutual moralism compel us toward common understanding or simply drive us further apart under the fire of name-calling and assumptions that “the other side” is morally reprehensible? The American cultural landscape currently suggests the latter. After all, as British politician Tony N.W. Benn once observed, we would die for our faith, but we would kill for our doctrines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As uprisings in Egypt against President Hosni Mubarak continue, the country appears to have entered something of a time warp. America, which once supported Mubarak in an attempt to maintain stability, is now pressuring him to resign. People on the ground are embracing the ideals of the reformist Kefaya movement, which briefly gained popularity with the 2005 constitutional referendum before losing momentum over the past few years.
But the clock is rolling back in another way as well—in the surprising emphasis on the physical presence and personality of foreign reporters at the scene of events. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, as of Feb. 5 there had been 114 direct attacks on the media, one of which resulted in the death of a reporter last Friday. Anderson Cooper took a knock on the head: The doors of his car were kicked in and the windshield broken; later he reported huddled in darkness from an “undisclosed location.” A reporter from Al Arabiya was beaten; the Belgian correspondent Maurice Sarfatti was arrested twice in the same day; multiple journalists were detained overnight. Those unhurt were firing off wire reports, phoning bureaus back home, shuttling in and out of hotels, swapping information. Tugging at various threads in her skein of connections, Christine Amanpour scored an “exclusive interview” with President Mubarak himself.
All of it, of course, was covered extensively.
If the sheer intrusive presence of this foreign media comes as something of a jolt, it is because jobs of this kind are increasingly rare. There is something essentially thrilling about the work, which places it in the same category as detective or spy as profession. (A Hitchcock film exists called Foreign Correspondent; there is no Hitchcock film titled Investment Banker.) But the heady springtime of Fleet Street—as popularized in books like Scoop, A Burnt-Out Case, and England Made Me—is over. Foreign bureaus are closing down; the days reporters would chum with leaders of dusty remote countries over Plymouth and angostura bitters have the same outdated feel as an order of pink gin. There are no more “dusty remote countries”—the world, as we are constantly reminded, is now “global” and “connected” as never before.
Every day, technology providing instant access to other regions of the world increases in sophistication, bypassing internet, mobile phone, and video to canvas more ambitious undertakings. The recently launched Google Art Project, for instance, employs the cameras used for Street View to zoom in on individual paintings at 17 museums, from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to the National Gallery in London. The bubble and gloss of a Van Gogh-yellow paint smear are much easier to view on a hi-def monitor than in the crowded confines of an Amsterdam gallery.
What does all this signify? Evelyn Waugh—who worked simultaneously for several newspapers out of locations from Abyssinia to East Africa—once wrote in his journal: “9 May 1962. Abjuring the realm. To make an interior act of renunciation and to become a stranger in the world; to watch one’s fellow-countrymen, as one used to watch foreigners, curious of their habits, patient of their absurdities, indifferent to their animosities—that is the secret of happiness in this century of the common man.” Waugh—who kept his fleshy lips at all times pursed, had a great-great-grandfather named Lord Cockburn, and chose to kill off a character by having him held hostage in the Brazilian jungle reading Charles Dickens aloud—was an odd bird of the old school, and the “common man” remark is very much a part of his humor.
But he was remarkably perceptive regarding the world rushing by. For if we have gained the convenience of technological delivery and the more “organic,” if necessarily biased, reportage of citizens who happen to be on the scene, we have also lost a stratum of the population which—while technically affiliated with one country—is always willing to move to the next. Roger Cohen’s column for The International Herald Tribune is called “The Globalist”; the correspondent’s job is, indeed, to be a truly global citizen. It is the life of the apostate—the deliberate renunciation of national ties in order to remain instead a free-floating entity.
In some ways, while making information more internationally accessible—Cairo from a laptop—we entrench ourselves more deeply nationalistically. All the world becomes familiar, mapped out; it becomes increasingly difficult to put stock in narratives by journalists or explorers claiming access to previously undiscovered regions or voyages into some exotic heart of darkness. The change can be tracked on a small scale in the kinds of grants awarded by Harvard’s Office of Career Services: According to one representative, traveling fellowships now more often cover work for international organizations and NGOs than individual exploratory ventures.
This is why the clear presence of the journalist, and the media’s incessant coverage of its own activity, is a refreshing change. There is something touchingly idiotic, and sublimely old-fashioned, about the spectacle of these reporters who still feel the need to enter the fray. In July of last year, The Guardian published an obituary for Basil R. Davidson, a reporter who made his name covering the death throes of Portuguese colonial influence in Africa before the Carnation Revolution. Davidson was the product of a different time, journeying solo through the continent to record its unwritten history. Later in the year, the same publication reported the passing of one of its younger journalists, who had died a quiet death in the office. His task had been to write reports on countries around the world, but he’d never had to leave his desk.

The Institute of Politics welcomed students to its spring open house Friday afternoon and showcased the arrival of its spring fellows and the new director of the IOP, C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, Kentucky’s outgoing Secretary of State.
Grayson has been reaching out to student groups all week at events like pub trivia at the Queen’s Head Pub and dinners with students at various dining halls. Friday afternoon was no different as he welcomed students to the event and was constantly surrounded by a swarm of open house attendees.
“Every night this week, I have been out meeting students and getting reacquainted with campus,” said Grayson.  “[The IOP] is a place that meant a lot to me when I was here and I hope to get as many people involved as possible.”
The IOP, unlike some student organizations, heavily recruits new members half-way through the academic year, Harleen K. Gambhir ’14, program chair for the Special Events Committee, said that the open house helps to inform students that the IOP is a welcoming student organization.
Gambhir added that the spring open house tended to appeal particularly to freshmen who are still shopping extracurriculars on campus.
“Freshmen can start out with some activities and then decide to drop them or that they want to look for other things to get involved in,” Gambhir said.
“The IOP is great in that we welcome people at this point half-way through the year.”
Members of the IOP said that the new members that the IOP brings in every semester are one of the ways that their organization stands out on campus.
“Because the fellows are new every semester, it’s a way for us to bring new energy and movement to the program,” said Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, president of the IOP. “Every semester is a little bit different because we have a new group of fellows.”
All of the fellows were in attendance at Friday’s open house and spent the afternoon meeting students and presenting information about their upcoming study groups. Caroline J. Croft, a former senior adviser at the State Department said that she enjoyed she meeting students and hopes to get more people involved in politics in her upcoming study group.
“I’ve had a great time today and I’ve had a chance to meet many students, including many international students who have shown interest and offered up their own ideas,” Croft said.
“I’m hoping this semester I can encourage more students to get involved in international affairs and international service.”

David Blumenthal ’70 will return to his position at Harvard Medical School in March after spending two years as the national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C.
Blumenthal, a professor of medicine at the Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a memo to his staff Thursday that he had always planned on leaving the position after two years. Harvard professors lose tenure after two years of absence, according to University policy.
Blumenthal spent his tenure at HHS overseeing the digitization of medical records as part of the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, a piece of the Obama administration’s stimulus package.
The act provides up to $27 billion for doctors and hospitals that demonstrate “meaningful use” of health information technology. Blumenthal directed the creation of standards for “meaningful use” and the implementation of other HITECH act projects.
“Under the leadership of David Blumenthal and his entire team at the [Office of the National Coordinator], we have made significant strides in the implementation of [electronic health records],” said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sibelius in an email message announcing Blumenthal’s departure to HHS staff.
David J. Brailer, the first national coordinator for health IT told Kaiser Health News that Blumethal had served a successful tenure.
“He’s taken all the good things that we got started and laid it into a very durable, much more sophisticated framework,” Brailer said. “We had an upstart insurgent group and he turned it into a standing, legitimate agency.”
Kennedy School Professor Richard J. Zeckhauser ’62 said that Blumenthal had been preparing for the job for years. As director of the Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital, Blumenthal oversaw the implementation of new technologies. Zeckhauser said that Blumenthal had been praised “across the political spectrum” for his work at HHS.
“I think it’s good for Harvard,” Zeckhauser said of Blumenthal’s departure from the government. “It’s a little disappointing for the nation,” he added.
Zeckhauser, who has collaborated with Blumenthal in the past, said he looks forward to being able to work with him again.
Prior to his appointment, Blumenthal had been a health policy adviser to President Obama’s campaign and had worked for three years on former Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s ’54-’56 health policy staff. He also served as a senior vice president at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a lecturer at the Kennedy School, from which he earned an M.P.P. degree.

In its first general meeting of the semester, the Undergraduate Council launched a new initiative aimed at improving social life on campus.
The Council voted to create the Social Programs Task Force, a new committee that will be responsible for implementing a series of social events from now until the end of the semester.
UC Vice President, Bonnie Cao ’12, said that the Task Force was created largely to promote social life for the campus as a whole. While students often socialize in dorms, houses, and “segregated areas”, Cao said that this new committee would attempt to provide opportunities for students to socialize as an entire campus community.
Events will be selected, planned, and executed by the task force in collaboration with a variety of student groups on campus. “We know we are not going to be the premiere social programming group so we want to partner with other groups that will have means,” Cao said.
Such groups will include the College Events Board, First Year Social Committee, Harvard Concert Commission, and the Harvard Foundation.
Coordination has already begun with the College Event Board, and Cao said they are currently looking into the possibility of throwing a campus wide “End of Year” party. Other potential events that the Task Force is looking into include a Boston or Harvard-wide Concert for Charity, as well as a “Welcome Back” week or weekend, with campus-wide events before classes start next semester.
The UC has set aside $10,000 to fund the activities planned by the Task Force. Cao said that, based on the program’s success, this may not be enough money. “If that is the case,” Cao said, “We hope to convince administrators and deans that supporting a strong, campus-wide community is a necessity.”

Two hundred and sixty eight women rushed Harvard’s three sororities this year, representing the largest rush class in the University’s history, according to sorority leaders.
In past years, rush classes have averaged 150.
Members of each sorority confirmed that in response to the increased number of applicants, this year each sorority extended bids to more women.
“The whole point of taking so many is getting as many girls involved in Greek life as possible,” said Kappa Kappa Gamma president Anna S. He ’12.
Most of the women who rushed were freshmen, although a significant number of sophomores and a small number of juniors also participated in rush, He said.
Kappa extended bids to 57 women, according to He. Theta offered spots to 55 women, according to Kappa Alpha Theta President Ellis A. Bowen ’12.
Delta Gamma president Caroline T. Quazzo ’12 said that the sorority did not have final numbers on the number of new members, but several women who accepted bids from DG said that the sorority offered spots to approximately 60 women.
Partially in response to the large number of applicants, Harvard’s Panhellenic organization is entertaining the possibility of establishing a fourth sorority on campus as soon as next year, according to He.
“The record number of girls demonstrates that there’s definitely a demand for sorority life on campus,” He said.
Bowen and Quazzo both confirmed that the possibility of creating a fourth sorority was on the table.
Women who rushed this past week said that they were excited by the large number of women in their rush class.
“I definitely think that having so many people interested made me more interested,” said Elizabeth A. Holden ’14,a new Kappa.
Caroline F. Davis ’14, also a new Kappa, said that the sorority sisters she spoke to said that because so many people signed up to rush this year, the rush organizers were motivated to put in extra work to make sure the process ran smoothly.
“Girls that were already in sororities were staying up until four or five in the morning because they just had to go through so many girls,” said new Kappa Chloe G. Veron ’14, in reference to the evaluation process that the sisters had to go through after each round of rushing.
During the rush process, which lasts less than a week, potential members attended a series of four rounds at local restaurants and final clubs for meet-and-greets with current sisters. Women were separated into groups and rotated through each night’s events.
After the second, third, and final rounds, women were asked to rank their choices and sororities ranked prospective members. Based on those numbers, smaller and smaller groups of women returned to sororities after each round.
At the end of the final round, sororities extended bids to those women that had completed the rush process.
As so many women decided to rush this year, the sororities had to separate women into more than the normal number of groups during the rush process, according to Quazzo.
For example, on the first night women were separated into five groups. As there are only three sororities, some women had to wait in the Garage and in Adams.

The Hasty Pudding Theatricals awarded the Pudding Pot to their 2011 Man of the Year Jay Leno on Friday. But to get his golden reward, Leno first had to complete three tasks—make fellow talk-show host David Letterman laugh, prove his generosity to University President Drew G. Faust, and best the talents of Joan Rivers, Ellen DeGeneres, and Oprah Winfrey—all played by members of the Hasty Pudding cast.
The awards ceremony began with Nikolus A. Ray ’11 and Matthew E. Whitaker ’12—co-producers of the Hasty Pudding Theatrical’s current show “Kashmir if you Can,”—roasting Leno on topics ranging from his generally older viewer base to his conflict with Conan C. O’Brien ’85.
“In order to give our man of the year time to rest we considered moving our 8 p.m. show back two hours later,” Whitiker said.
But, Ray said, “We do realize that no one wants to watch a show that starts at 10 p.m.”
After the roast Leno was given a choice between signing a contract—another jab at his conflict with O’Brien—or completing three tasks.
“I’ll take the three secret tasks,” Leno said.
Leno first had to entertain talk-show host David Letterman, played by Ryan P. Halprin ’12, by proving that his prowess for reciting monologues surpassed that of Hamlet’s.
Leno recited lines from Shakespeare’s famous play, while Hamlet countered with monologues from Leno’s show.
“I think you’re funnier than Hamlet.” Halprin—as Letterman—said to Leno. “Reasons why—your face. I just love laughing at your face.”
Toward the end of the performance, Leno had to confront his late night rival, O’Brien, who came out on stage dressed in a janitor’s outfit with mop in hand.
For his third and final task, Leno had to confront three fellow talk-show hosts and “beat them at their own game.”
Joan Rivers, played by Matthew J. DaSilva ’12, forced Leno to put on a bra in the shape of a car’s headlights.
Ellen DeGeneres, played by Kyle J. Dancewicz ’11, challenged Leno to a dance-off to “Party in the USA.” Leno strapped on a pair of bright blue pumps, donned a red curly wig, and gyrated to Miley Cyrus’ famous tune.
Leno then competed against Oprah Winfrey in a celebrity name shout-out showdown. Charleton A. Lamb ’11, who played Winfrey, replicated Winfrey’s flamboyant shout-out style, but Leno emerged victorious. Lamb is an inactive Crimson editor.
Leno was finally able to accept his Pudding Pot after 20 minutes of good-natured humiliation, though the riotous crowd refused to let him remove his comedic costume during his semi-serious acceptance speech.
Leno said that Harvard and the Hasty Pudding had always been important to him.
“The first show I ever did was right here on the campus of Harvard,” Leno said.
Leno, an Andover, Mass. native who attended Emerson College, worked at Foreign Motors when he was young. Leno said that he was selected to drive celebrities like Fay Dunaway, Peter Falk, and Liza Minnelli to Hasty Pudding Man and Woman of the Year events.
Because of his job he met Jack Lemmon ’47, who won the Man of the Year Award in 1973. According to Leno, Lemmon always teased Leno, asking him whether he got “that Hasty Pudding award yet.”
Leno dedicated his Pudding Pot to Lemmon, who passed away 10 years ago this June.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Trans Task Force (TTF) is circulating an online petition protesting the possible return of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps before the military allows trans-identified and intersex individuals to openly serve in the military.
As of yesterday afternoon, 93 people had signed the petition launched Friday and circulated over a number of student e-mail lists.
ROTC is not recognized by the University because “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—which bars gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals from openly serving in the military—violates Harvard’s anti-discrimination policy.
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was repealed in November, but top ranking government officials must certify the decision before it takes effect.
While the University has said it would recognize ROTC following the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” trans-identified and intersex individuals are still not permitted to enlist, since the military considers gender identity disorder—the medical diagnosis describing the attributes of transgenderism—and intersexism to be medical disqualifications. Transgender describes individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex assignment they were born with. Intersex refers to people who are born with a combination of male and female physical features.
So even with the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” gender-equality advocates consider the Pentagon’s restrictions on who may serve in the military to be discriminatory.
“Continuing to withhold official recognition of ROTC until the military allows Americans of any sex or gender identity to enlist would reaffirm Harvard’s commitment to equal opportunity and provide an incentive for the military to develop more inclusive policies,” TTF wrote in its petition.
Jia Hui Lee ’12, who is spearheading the TTF’s petition signing initiative, said that he hopes to get 1,000 signatures on the petition before submitting it to University President Drew G. Faust.
“[The petition] is not so much about not having ROTC on campus but only having programs on campus that are open to everyone regardless of their gender identity,” Lee said.
Former chair of TTF Eva B. Rosenberg ’10 said that she believes that the University stance is inconsistent as a result of “an oversight, rather than a result of any malicious intent.”
The University did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.
Rosenberg said that because the inclusion of gender-identity in the anti-discrimination policy is relatively recent, “the University hasn’t really figured out what it means to face up to issues relating to gender-identity discrimination.”
“We are very hungry for the administration to recognize the existence of trans people on campus and the struggles they face,” she said. “It may be easier and faster to favor the rights of gay and lesbian people over trans, but I think it is ethically insupportable.”
Other members of the Harvard community said that they feel that the recognition of ROTC should not be contingent upon the military’s policy regarding trans and intersex individuals.
Nathaniel G. Butler ’68, a Navy veteran and board member of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus, was an advocate for the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. While he said that he would like to see trans-identified and intersex individuals granted the ability to serve, Butler said that their exclusion should not be a barrier for ROTC’s return to Harvard.
“I think that will have to be a separate campaign to get that kind of approval for people serving in the military,” Butler said.
Butler said that because of the amount of time required to repeal Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, he does not expect that this issue will be resolved anytime soon.
“I am in favor of people being allowed to serve openly, but I would not be in favor of delaying [the return of ROTC] 20 years,” Butler said.
Chairman of Harvard Advocates for ROTC Capt. Paul E. Mawn USNR (Ret.) ’63 said he believes that protests over trans-identified and intersex individuals right to join the military represents little more than a tool for anti-military activists to prevent ROTC’s return to campus.
“A lot of people at Harvard are blatantly anti-military,”  Mawn said. “Everyone blatantly hid behind the shield of DADT.”
TTF is a recognized student group under Queer Students and Allies’ umbrella.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a week after the first anti-government protests erupted in Egypt’s Tahrir Square, Devon A. Youngblood ’10 reflected on the movement that had displaced her from her post-graduate year of working and studying abroad in Egypt and decided that, since her neighbors had begun to arm themselves against looters, it was time to leave Cairo.
“It wasn’t about activism—it was more about a general wanting respect in your own country and wanting to feel 100 percent human,” she said of the uprising.
Last Monday, Youngblood boarded a U.S. embassy flight out of Cairo as tensions escalated and civilians armed themselves against increased looting.
While Youngblood took refuge in Berlin, Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman met with members of the opposition party in an effort to negotiate a transition to a democratically-elected government.
Though negotiations threaten to stall the removal of Mubarak, significant political reform could be within reach for the Egyptian protesters who have flooded into Cairo’s streets in recent weeks.
Soha Bayoumi, a Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations teaching assistant, was politically active while growing up in Egypt and said that the current political moment holds a potential for radical political change that has not been seen in recent memory.
“We’ve always chanted for democracy and for human rights, but we were dozens, we were hundreds,” she said. “Now it’s millions.”
Bayoumi, whose brother has been injured by rubber bullets, tear gas, and stones during the demonstrations, added that injuries are common among protesters but that they have not deterred them from demonstrating.
“They just go down again and again, and they are not retreating in front of the thuggery,” she said.
History of Science lecturer Ahmed Ragab, whose brother-in-law was injured by a rubber bullet, wrote in an e-mail that protestetrs “have the feeling that they are witnessing a new beginning in their lives and in the history of the country.”
The U.S. government now backs a plan for a more gradual transition with Mubarak remaining in power, a move that has generated criticism from protesters who had hoped for stronger support from President Obama.
“Mubarak and Suleiman’s actions are trials to buy time, while hoping that the revolution will lose steam,” Ragab wrote in an e-mail.
Despite the government’s efforts to avoid the ousting of Mubarak, most believe that the protesters will not settle for less. Since the first protest, Mubarak’s resignation has been a central and unequivocal demand of the demonstrators.
“The negotiations so far do not represent the people in the street who insist they are not willing to negotiate before Mubarak leaves,” Bayoumi said.
Bayoumi also said that the representatives who met with Suleiman were members of formal opposition parties not considered legitimate by most Egyptians.
Chaos has marked recent weeks in Cairo and other major Egyptian cities as protestors have fought pitched battles against supporters of the government and pushed hard to gain concessions from the current government
“You couldn’t really tell what directions things were going to go, and if they were going to get more violent,” she said.
Youngblood was awarded a Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Fellowship—which provides select Harvard seniors with $18,000 for purposeful international travel—in order to study race and cultural identity in Egypt. Before her departure, she was working at the Townhouse art gallery in downtown Cairo.
“Cairo won’t be the same,” she said, but she intends to return to Egypt and finish her year working at the gallery despite the political unrest.
This political movement could potentially signal the return of a political voice for millions of Egyptians.
“It’s beautiful because Egyptians are getting back their sense of ownership of their own country,” Bayoumi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A man was stabbed early Saturday morning at Mt. Auburn and Holyoke Streets, according to the Cambridge Police Department.
Police responded to a call around 2:45 a.m. regarding a disturbance in the area after a fight was reported.
The victim, 36, is a Boston resident and was transported to the hospital with serious injuries to his chest and abdomen.
Madeleine Smith ’13, a Crimson associate sports editor, said she saw a fight in front of the nearby Bank of America at the intersection of Mt. Auburn and Holyoke Streets.
About 10 people were gathered in that area before several taxi drivers drove toward the scene, she said. Cambridge police arrived shortly thereafter.
According to the press release, one suspect was arrested after a thorough search of the area. The incident is currently undergoing an “extremely active investigation” by the Cambridge Police Department.
In 2010, violent crimes—murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault—made up for 12 percent of the index crime reported to the Cambridge Police Department, according to the BridgeStat data released by the Cambridge police on Jan. 7. Index crimes—the eight categories that the FBI examines when it produces its annual crime index—include both property and violent crime.
About 7 percent of all crime reported were aggravated assaults, 5 percent were robberies, and 1 percent were rapes.
Aggravated assaults decreased by 2 percent in Cambridge from 2009 to 2010, according to the same report.
There were no murders reported in Cambridge in 2010, and the last homicide to occur in Cambridge was 18 months ago in June 2009.
The number of aggravated assaults reported in 2010, with 251 incidents, was 2 percent less than the five-year weighted average of 255 incidents per year.
The 163 robberies reported in 2010 represented a 5 percent decrease from the total reported in 2009.

Harvard Law School announced that it would appoint Nancy Gertner and Stephen E. Shay as professors of practice on Friday in a recognition of their accomplishments during their careers in the legal community.
Professors of practice—titles reserved for prominent, successful individuals in the legal profession—are appointed to help students transcend the boundary between academia and real-life practice.
Often cited as one of the leading tax attorneys in the world, Shay—formerly a deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. Treasury Department—has spent over 35 years practicing tax law and policy, working in private practice, and publishing articles. He will lecture on tax law at the Law School, according to a press release from the school.
Gertner has served as a U.S. District Court judge since being appointed by President Clinton in 1994. Before becoming a judge, she worked as a criminal defense attorney and civil rights activist and was named by the Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly as one of the “Most Influential Lawyers of the Past 25 Years.”
Gertner explained that she hopes to impress upon students the multidimensionality of the law by drawing on her experience as both a lawyer and a judge.
“Law is unusual in that it embodies aspects of philosophy and sociology and political science—and also what happens on a day to day [basis] in the courtroom,” Gertner said.
She said that she looks forward to reflecting on her career and the evolution of the law after a lifetime of working within the system.
“By bringing their recent and substantial experience into the classroom, appointees will offer students a deep understanding of the kinds of real-world situations that are typically encountered today by practicing lawyers,” Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in an e-mail statement.
Gertner has taught internationally and nationally at Arizona State Law School and intermittently at Yale Law School. She explained that judging and teaching are alike, saying that judges must “teach” their rulings to the jury and the parties in the case by explaining reasoning which is made up of legal traditions and precedents.
But Gertner added that the two professions are also dissimilar.
“The difference is that I have to come to a decision [as a judge,] and in teaching, I can raise the issues and let students decide,” Gertner said.
“I can’t rule in the classroom, which I’m going to miss,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In sports, hard work does not always equal success. This weekend, the men’s tennis team learned that lesson the hard way.
The No. 64 Crimson hosted Indiana, William & Mary, and Boston University at the Murr Tennis Center this weekend. Harvard (2-3) could not overcome its competition in the first two matches and lost both, but the Crimson rebounded from the defeats to crush Boston University yesterday evening, 7-0.
“I was really encouraged,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “Indiana was a classy team and really well-conditioned. There was not a weak spot in the lineup. We learned about the level they’re seeing everyday in the Big Ten, and we’re getting better from it.”
HARVARD 7, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 0
Harvard started off its matchup against the Terriers by winning all three doubles matches to decisively claim the doubles point. Junior Davis Mangham and senior Alexei Chijoff-Evans teamed up for a comfortable 8-1 win over their opponents.
Co-captain Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman John Thornton were even more ruthless, keeping their opponents from winning a single game on their way to an 8-0 victory. The Crimson continued its sweep into the singles portion of the matchup, winning all six matches against its opponents.
WILLIAM & MARY 4, HARVARD 3
Fans of professional tennis may find singles to be more exciting to watch, but the doubles was the heart of the real action against William & Mary. All three matches went to a tiebreak to decide the winners.
Omodele-Lucien and Tchan were down 7-6 in the set, but managed to break their opponents to even the score. The two teams continued to a tiebreak that saw the Harvard players get out to an early lead. On the first match point, an overhead smash by the Tribe pair kept its hopes alive, but, on the next point, the opponents hit the ball out to give the Crimson the win.
Pearlman and MacMaster had another close match, but could not pull out the win against their competitors. The duo had two match points in the tiebreak, but failed to convert either of them, instead going down, 8-6, in the breaker.
“It was very close,” assistant coach Andrew Rueb said. “We had two match points that would have given us the doubles point, but that’s tennis for you.”
Despite this early setback, the Crimson still had a chance to win, but the squad split the singles matches. Tchan had a comfortable 6-1, 6-2 win over his opponent to get his team out to an early lead in singles, but Harvard lost three of its other five singles matches to give William & Mary a 4-3 victory.
INDIANA 6, HARVARD 1
The weekend got off to a rough start for the Crimson with a 6-1 loss to Indiana, the squad’s second defeat of the season’s three dual matches so far. Harvard started out the day by losing all three of the doubles matches to forfeit the doubles point to Indiana. The duo of Felton and Nguyen came the closest to scoring a win, but the two fell to junior Stephen Vogl and sophomore Josh MacTaggart, 9-7.
Things only got worse in the singles portion of the event, with five of the players dropping their individual matches—four of them doing so in straight sets.
Sophomore Andy Nguyen scored the lone point for his team in the matchup against Indiana. There was a high-pressure tiebreak in the first set, which Nguyen lost, seven points to five. The sophomore turned things around though after, taking the next two sets and the match, 6-3, 6-4.
Omodele-Lucien had a two-match winning streak going into the weekend, but any chances of extending that were stopped in its tracks against freshman Claes Goransson. Omodele-Lucien cruised through the first set comfortably, 6-1. Then things started to go downhill for the captain as he lost the next set by a similar score, 6-2. It was a tight third set, but Goransson was just too strong in the end, taking the match—and another singles point for his squad—6-4 in the third.

The intensity and the spotlight were all on the Harvard men’s volleyball team Saturday night, when it rallied for a furious three-set comeback against MIT in front of a boisterous crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center.
The Crimson (3-1, 0-0 EIVA Hay) dropped the first set against the Engineers (10-2, 6-0 AVCA), only to come back with three straight victories to take the game.
“[It was an] incredible match on both sides,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “I thought the quality of volleyball was very high. [It was] intense competition. Our guys did a great job.”
With the score tied at 29-29 late in the fourth set, Harvard knew that it had come too far to allow another frame. As fatigue set in on both sides, the roar of the crowd gave the home squad the strength for one last push.
Indeed, momentum was on the Crimson’s side, as it had already rallied back from a 21-13 deficit. Freshman Kyle Rehkemper crushed a set by junior Rob Lothman to gain the advantage, 30-29. MIT could not respond—as it had successfully done for 10 straight points—and a fatal attack error ended the game, 31-29, in favor of Harvard.
“We were way down in the fourth game,” Baise said, “and to come back like that showed a lot of strength. I’m really proud of them.”
The Crimson had started the night off strong, taking a 10-5 lead early in the first set. But the Engineers rallied to eventually tie the game, and the two teams exchanged points until the very end with Harvard leading, 24-23. Three straight Crimson errors gave the set away to MIT, resulting in a score of 26-24.
“The first game was ours,” Baise said. “I think we had three game points, but MIT hung in there. We gave away some points we shouldn’t have, and we’re working on that.”
Harvard took the second and third set through a combination of great serving and solid defense. The Crimson’s blocking really troubled the outsides of the Engineers, forcing difficult and often inaccurate adjustments by the outsides in mid-air and causing several unforced errors.
“We served pretty well,” Jones said. “[That] got them out of their system. Those big freshmen just go up there and go to work. We read their hitters pretty well, and we [were] getting some good hands up.”
With the game on the line, the Engineers turned up its offense in the fourth set, and despite the roar of the home crowd, gained a 5-1 lead, forcing the Crimson to spend a timeout. After trading blows, MIT used its offensive rhythm to expand the lead to 21-13.
But that was when Harvard began its own rally, chipping away at the Engineers’ lead until a crushed kill from Jones brought the game within three, forcing two back-to-back MIT timeouts.
But even that could not cool off the red-hot Crimson, which tied the game off MIT errors.
“We had some great blocking,” Baise said. “No ball hit the floor we weren’t going for. We really made it tough for them to score points in the fourth game, especially when we were down by six or seven points, and they had to swing four or five times, and we kept getting the ball up. They get tired, and we get a little momentum, and that was key—it was absolutely our defense.”
The Engineers capitalized on two Harvard mistakes to regain the lead, 24-22, but two powerful kills brought Harvard back into the game, tying the game at 24-apiece. MIT and the Crimson exchanged a point at 25, but a tremendous rally ended in the Engineers’ favor, giving them a one-point lead.
Harvard tied up the game with an outside shot, and then put it down once again for the lead. The two teams exchanged points furiously, and with the scored tied at 29, the Crimson sealed the set—and the contest—with two straight kills, ending the match at 31-29.
“The fourth game—you don’t get many of those,” Jones said. “We got down by a lot, but we just found a run late in the game. That was huge, especially for a young team like us to get a confidence boost...to know we can pull games out like that.”

PRINCETON, N.J.—The stage was set and lights were on, but the Harvard men’s basketball team didn’t show up in top form.
In the first matchup between the two Ivy League favorites, Princeton got the upper hand, defending its home court with a 65-61 victory Friday night at Jadwin Gymnasium.
Led by Douglas Davis’s six points, the Tigers (15-4, 3-0 Ivy) used a 19-2 run between the end of the first half and the start of the second to take a commanding 11-point lead.
Thanks to strong post play from junior co-captain Keith Wright and some timely shots from freshman Laurent Rivard down the stretch, the Crimson (15-4, 4-1) managed to pull within two, but was never able to even the score.
“Certainly a disappointing loss for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought it was a tremendous effort by both teams. It showed how much they really wanted to win the game here [Friday] evening.”
The Crimson got off to a strong start, and—led by sophomore Christian Webster’s nine points—opened the contest on a 15-4 run.
But Harvard’s 11-point lead just six minutes in would prove to be its largest of the game.
Tiger Dan Mavraides pulled his team within five, scoring Princeton’s next eight points off two three-pointers and a pair of free throws.
After Crimson sophomore Jeff Georgatos followed with layup, Mack Darrow struck from deep on the Tigers’ next possession, bringing the home team within four, 19-15.
Harvard’s lead hovered around four for the remainder of the period, but a late Princeton run game the Tigers the momentum heading into the break.
With 52 seconds left and the Crimson up six, the Tigers fed the ball to forward Kareem Maddox in the post. Working on the 6’5” Rivard, the 6’8” Maddox turned and scored on the freshman for two of his 14 points.
With the shot clock turned off, Harvard let the clock run down, but with four seconds left, sophomore Brandyn Curry fired a tough shot that clanged off the rim.
Davis pulled down the rebound and raced the other way. With .5 seconds left on the clock, Davis let a running jumper fly from the perimeter that missed its target, but Rivard was whistled for a foul on the shot.
Davis knocked down his three free throws, and Princeton went into the break down by just one.
“I thought that was a huge play,” Amaker said, “I thought we didn’t execute very well at the end of the half. I mentioned to our guys, I thought that was where the game was won and lost.”
The Tigers picked up from where they left off to start the second, opening the frame with a 14-2 run. Davis sparked the run with a corner three pointer on the Tigers first possession. Princeton continued its attack from the post, getting layups from Maddox and sophomore Ian Hummer.
Darrow capped off the run with a trey from the top of the key to put the Tigers up, 43-32, forcing Amaker to take a timeout.
“Guys just came out and really just dug in,” Princeton coach Sydney Johnson said. “It was a pretty special thing to see—at least during that stretch—how passionate we were.”
Over the next 10 minutes of play, the Crimson relied on Wright to keep the team afloat, as the forward notched 12 of Harvard’s next 16 points to pull his team within six with 4:17 to play. Wright finished with a team-high 16 points and 11 rebounds for his eight double-double of the season.
“I thought Keith gave us really solid play,” Amaker said. “I thought he turned it up and gave us great energy and finished around the goal.”
The Tigers built their lead back up to eight with 1:35, but the visitors made one last push.
Rivard ignited the comeback attempt, stroking a deep ball to cut the deficit to five.
Using a full court press, Harvard forced a turnover on the ensuing possession, but Curry returned the ball to Princeton on a weak pass that was picked off by Hummer.
Harvard intentionally fouled Hummer, and the sophomore missed the front end of a one-and-one. The Crimson secured the rebound and got the ball to sophomore Kyle Casey, who exploded to the basket and drew a foul with 39 seconds. Casey made one-of-two to get Harvard within four.
The Crimson sent Tiger Dan Mavraides to the line, and Mavraides hit one of his two attempts.
Rivard followed with another deep three off a botched play, making it 61-59 with 18 seconds.
The Crimson sent Mavraides back to the line, but the forward sank both attempts this time around to make it 63-69 with 12 seconds remaining.
Harvard fed Casey in the post for an easy slam to get back within two with six seconds. The Crimson tried to force a turnover off the inbounds pass, but the Tigers got the ball to Hummer, who was quickly fouled with four seconds left.
But Hummer iced the game, sinking both of his attempts to give Princeton the 65-61 win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—Princeton came up big against the Harvard men’s basketball team Friday night, quite literally. The play of forwards Kareem Maddox and Ian Hummer was the difference in a highly competitive 65-61 Tigers win.
“Hummer and Maddox [are] two very tough matchups for most people, let alone for us,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought those two kids in particular were just tremendous in how they played.”
In the first half, with the Princeton offense struggling to find a rhythm, Maddox picked up his team right before the break. The senior reeled off six straight points in the paint for the Tigers to keep them within striking distance of Harvard. He had 10 of Princeton’s 29 points at halftime and finished with 14 on the night.
But Maddox’s presence was felt equally on the defensive end, where he tallied five blocks and one steal and pressured the Crimson big men into numerous turnovers.
“He’s a nightmare of a matchup,” Amaker said. “He’s 6’8”, he handles the ball very well, he’s dynamite driving it, [and] he’s a tremendous passer. Then you talk about his ability to post up whatever matchup you put on him—it’s very difficult.”
Hummer was just as instrumental to the Princeton victory. Picking up two fouls in the first six minutes, the sophomore was relegated to the bench for much of the opening frame, but he made a big impression when he returned to the court in the second half.
“Sitting out of a big game like that in the first half was pretty frustrating,” Hummer said. “I just wanted to get in there, get my hands dirty, and help my team win.”
Getting loose on a number of backdoor cuts and posting up in the paint, Hummer exploded for 15 second-half points after scoring just two in the first period. He finished 7-of-11 from the field and led all scorers with 17 points in only 23 minutes of action.
On the night, the two Tiger big men combined for 31 points on 13 of 21 shooting.
RUNNING AFOUL
Part of the Princeton frontcourt’s success was a direct result of the Harvard’s post woes. After picking up two fouls apiece in the first half, forwards Keith Wright and Kyle Casey got in serious jeopardy of fouling out early in the second half. Casey bit on a pump fake by Tiger forward Patrick Saunders with 11:19 remaining to pick up his fourth foul, and exactly one minute later, Hummer drew an offensive foul as Wright backed down in the post, giving the Crimson junior co-captain his fourth as well.
Because Princeton’s lead swelled to 11 points, Amaker was forced to play both Casey and Wright, and the Tigers went after the two big men.
“That was certainly a tough moment for us to try to work ourselves through,” Amaker said. “[We tried] playing zone, [going] offense-defense. I think sometimes when you have those kind of fouls, you’re playing obviously a little more tentative, and I thought that was the case with both of our guys.”
Although both Wright and Casey managed to stay in the game without fouling out, their limited effectiveness, especially on defense, hindered the Crimson’s comeback chances.
“Those guys had to play a little tentatively because you want to stay in the game,” Maddox said. “[Their foul trouble] was a critical part of the run we went on.”
THERE’S NO WIN IN JADWIN
The loss was Harvard’s 22nd in a row at Jadwin Gymnasium. Not since Feb. 3, 1989, have the Crimson left Princeton, N.J., with a win.
“They’ve been able to have our number for a while,” said Amaker, dismissing the notion that the two schools are rivals. “If we can do a little better against them the next couple times, maybe we can see if becomes a rivalry.”
The Tiger victory was played out in front of a capacity crowd that reminded Johnson, a former Princeton player from 1993-97, of his playing days in the golden years of Tiger basketball.
“I remember playing Pennsylvania as a player, and it was standing room only…It came pretty dang close [to that tonight],” Johnson said. “Since I’ve been here, that’s all I’ve ever wanted for these guys—to have the type of experience I had—and we’re getting close.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—Although Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker has insisted that no single league win or loss will make or break his team’s season, Saturday night’s classic between the Crimson and Penn will surely retain significance through the remainder of the Ivy slate.
Had Harvard fallen to its hosts, its pair of Ivy losses would have dropped the squad to third in the league, behind fellow title contenders Princeton as well as the Quakers.
Instead, what the Crimson will take from its 83-82 double-overtime victory is most likely a lesson about the challenge of holding a lead on the home turf of one of the league’s premier playmakers: Zack Rosen.
A night after nearly clawing its way back from an 11-point deficit against the Tigers, Harvard found itself with an 18-point advantage over Penn four minutes into the second half.
Then it all began to unravel. Five Crimson turnovers over the next four minutes, coupled with a traditional three-point play by the junior standout Rosen, helped the home team cut the Harvard advantage to 49-39 with 11 minutes to play.
The Quaker’s offensive catalyst, Rosen seemed to elevate his level of performance as a thunderous Palestra crowd of 6,283 grew in volume.
The two-time team captain went right at Harvard sophomore guard Brandyn Curry, who had handled him well in last year’s matchup in the same building. But this time, it was Curry who fouled Rosen on a three-point attempt, leading to a trio of free throws that kept Penn in the thick of it at the eight-minute mark.
While Rosen’s shot was off in the first half—he tallied just two points on 1-of-7 shooting—he turned things on when his team needed him the most, using screens and dribble penetration to great effect.
The guard had a hand in all but one of his team’s final five baskets of regulation, first finding senior Jack Eggleston at the top of the key for a three-pointer, then keeping it himself and hitting a triple from nearly the same spot a minute and a half later to bring his team within one point.
Drawing a foul on Curry with 10 seconds left in the second half, Rosen calmly knocked down a pair of game-tying free throws and sent the contest into overtime, when he proved just as invaluable.
After fellow guard Tyler Bernardini fouled out minutes into the extra period, Rosen took over. He picked up an assist and six consecutive points—including a fall-away jumper at the buzzer to extend the game for another stanza.
Only when Harvard was able to hold the star scoreless—highlighted by the persistent Curry’s forcing of a jump ball on Rosen on the perimeter—did the final buzzer sound with the road team on top.
“Everybody made great plays…especially Brandyn’s jump ball in the corner on Rosen,” junior co-captain McNally said. “It was extremely heady and just a smart play—a big-time winning play.”
BIG PROBLEMS
The Quakers encountered defensive issues of their own when trying to deal with Harvard big man Keith Wright, who was once again unmatched on the interior, nabbing a career-high 25 points and six rebounds.
The 6’8” forward got going early, picking up four layups in the game’s first six minutes, as his formidable combination of size and speed confounded whomever tried to match up with him—most often, forward Conor Turley, who picked up four fouls halfway through the second half and sat out the rest of the frame.
But then guarded by freshman Fran Dougherty, Wright went curiously silent, going without a shot attempt over the final 10 minutes of regulation.
Whether the problem had been with Wright’s lack of aggressiveness or his teammates’ inability to get him the ball, it was resolved by the start of overtime. Coming out with a renewed focus in the first extra period, Wright was again a force in the post, dropping in a pair of buckets in the paint to go along with two clutch free throws and a key block.
“I thought that we played with a lot of poise,” Amaker said. “[For example,] Keith Wright, just powering up and making free throws. Everyone had to make a number of plays…for this game to...have the drama that we all witnessed here this evening.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—It took 50 minutes and two overtimes, but the Harvard men’s basketball team emerged from the Palestra on Saturday night with a victory.
After squandering an 18-point second-half lead, the Crimson (16-4, 5-1 Ivy) battled back from a deficit in the second overtime period to pull out a gutsy 83-82 win against Penn (9-9, 3-1).
Junior co-captain Oliver McNally delivered the victory, sinking a baseline floater to give Harvard the one-point advantage with 11 seconds on the clock.
“I just saw a smaller guy on me,” McNally said. “I tried to take it strong and tried to get to the rim.”
On their final possession, the Quakers put the ball in the hands of their top scorer, junior Zack Rosen. But Rosen’s last-second attempt was swatted away by sophomore Kyle Casey, securing the Harvard victory.
“Anytime you can come and win a basketball game like this against an outstanding team, in a tremendous environment on our second night on the road, it’s a tremendous victory for us,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said.
While Rosen’s final attempt was off its mark, the Ivy League’s reigning scoring champion had more success at the conclusion of the first extra period, sinking a floater at the buzzer to even the score and extend the contest.
Penn rode the momentum into the second overtime, grabbing its first lead 46 minutes into the game off a baseline layup from Jack Eggleston. The senior scored 23 points on the night.
Moments later, Quaker Conor Turley got to the line, hitting one of two attempts.
Sophomore Christian Webster cut into the Quakers’ lead, sinking a pair of free throws, but Penn built its lead back up to three, 82-79, thanks to a backdoor layup from Eggleston.
Two minutes away from suffering its second conference loss in as many days, the Crimson received a clutch play from Casey. The forward received the ball under the basket and powered to the hoop, picking up a foul. Casey drilled both attempts to pull Harvard within one.
The Quakers managed to beat the Crimson’s press, but sophomore Brandyn Curry forced a jump ball on the other end to return possession to Harvard.
With less than a minute on the clock, Webster was fouled driving to the basket and went to the line with a chance to regain the lead for Harvard. But Webster—an 88.5-percent shooter from the stripe—missed both attempts.
The Quakers pulled down the rebound and let the clock run down to under 25 seconds. With 21 on the clock, Penn swung the ball to Eggleston in the corner. But Eggleston missed the deep jumper, and Curry pulled down the long rebound. With the shot clock off, Curry pushed the ball up the court and found McNally in the corner.
McNally gave an upfake and then dribbled to the cup, finishing with a floater that sailed through the net. The floater—just McNally’s second basket on the night—proved to be the game-winner.
But judging by the way the game began, few could have predicted that it would take two overtimes to determine the outcome.
Thanks to 11 first-half points from Wright and Penn’s 1-of-9 shooting from beyond the arc, the Crimson went into halftime boasting a 10-point lead. And coming out of the break, Harvard extended its advantage to as many as 18.
Fueled by a pair of Wright layups and a Webster trey, Harvard opened the half on a 12-5 run to grab the 47-29 advantage with 15:43 left in regulation.
But on the backs of Eggleston and Rosen, Penn fought its way back into the game. The duo combined for 16 of the Quakers’ final 23 points in regulation, leading the team on a 23-10 run over the final 8:22 of the second half to force overtime. “I thought that they showed a great deal of determination and character and fight,” Amaker said. “They inched their way back in it.”
Tyler Bernardini cut Harvard’s lead to single digits off a pair of free throws, and Eggleston followed with a triple from the right corner to make it 56-51 with 5:53 remaining.
A Webster three-pointer and a Curry free throw put the Crimson back up by nine, but Eggleston answered with another three. Penn freshman Miles Cartwright scored a layup, and Rosen drilled a triple off the dribble to bring the Quakers within one.
Casey answered with a pair of free throws, but a three from Bernardini with 45 ticks on the clock evened the score for the first time since the opening tap. Coming out of a timeout, Curry found Casey open on the left baseline. Casey sank the jumper with 19 seconds left, putting the visitor up by a deuce.
On the other end, Rosen attacked the basket, drawing a foul on Curry with 11 seconds to go. Rosen sank both attempts, knotting the score at 64.
On the final possession of regulation, Harvard put the ball in the hands of freshman sharpshooter Laurent Rivard, but Rivard’s mid-range attempt with one second left was off its mark.
Curry swooped in for the offensive rebound and was fouled on a last-second put-back attempt. But after huddling at midcourt, the referees ruled that Curry’s final attempt came after the buzzer, sending the game into overtime.
In the first overtime, the Crimson built a five-point lead with 1:01 to play, but, once again, the Quakers fought back. Rosen scored eight points in the final minute of the first overtime, leading Penn on a late 8-3 run to put another five minutes on the clock.
But in the second overtime, Harvard managed to squeak out the one-point win, sending the squad back to Cambridge on a high note.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the greatest teams produce consistent results, they also display a level of resilience and persistence that carries them through the toughest times. Even though the Harvard men’s wrestling team has lost more matches than it has won, the squad still continues to fight and pick up wins.
The Crimson traveled to Penn and Princeton this weekend for its first Ivy matches of the year, splitting its two contests.
Harvard (2-10, 1-1 Ivy) picked up its second dual win in as many weekends, defeating Princeton (4-8, 1-2) narrowly, 21-15. The squad failed to carry this momentum to Penn (8-4, 4-0), losing a lopsided contest, 35-7. Despite the loss to the Quakers, the team seemed satisfied with the level of play the team displayed this weekend.
“I definitely felt we could have wrestled better against Penn,” co-captain Andrew Knapp said. “But I really felt we wrestled well against Princeton…It was a great team effort.”
PENN, 35, HARVARD 7
The Crimson put up a tough fight against Penn but could not stop the Quakers as they rolled to a comfortable 35-7 victory, capping off a perfect 2-0 record for the weekend.
For sophomore Steven Keith, this weekend proved to be anything but perfect.
After picking up two victories last weekend against Army and Lehigh, Keith lost in a 10-3 major decision to No. 19 junior Mark Rappo.
The Crimson’s chances did not get any better, with sophomore Shay Warren and freshman Joseph Marino losing at 133 and 141 lbs., respectively. The two losses gave Penn a big early lead, putting the Quakers up, 10-0.
As co-captain, sophomore Walter Peppelman should be used to picking up the team when it’s down, and this time proved to be no different. Peppelman crushed freshman Brad Wukie, 8-0. It was his sixth major decision victory of the season.
“I was pleased with my performance,” Peppelman said. “I always felt that my team could win and come back.”
Unfortunately, Harvard could not capitalize on the momentum from Peppelman’s victory.
Four of the remaining five Crimson wrestlers lost their bouts to give Penn the decisive victory. Freshman Cameron Croy was the only other Harvard winner in the contest, defeating junior Erich Smith, 10-6.
HARVARD 21, PRINCETON 15
The Crimson got the trip started off on the right foot with a win against Princeton early on Saturday. It was the squad’s second win of the season and first against an Ivy League opponent.
The Tigers got off to an early lead against Harvard. As Keith proved in his freshman season and much of this year, he’s often the one with his hand raised at the end of the match, but he was surprisingly pinned at 5:34 by sophomore Garrett Frey.
Despite the early setback, the Crimson quickly regained its footing. Warren earned a 5-3 decision against sophomore Richard Krop, cutting down the Tigers’ lead.
Harvard dropped the next two bouts, including a forfeit at 149 lbs. Down 15-3, the Crimson mounted what seemed to be an insurmountable lead and made an even bigger comeback to trounce the Tigers.
Harvard’s wrestlers swept the next six matchups to earn the victory.
“We just trusted our training and…everyone did their part,” Peppelman said of overcoming the deficit. “Everyone wrestled really well.”
Peppelman picked up his first win out of two for the weekend with a 2-0 decision over junior Daniel Kolodzik. Croy also earned the first victory of what would turn out to be a perfect weekend for him. He defeated senior Michael Erdman, 5-1, at 184 lbs.
Knapp wrapped up the day for the Crimson with a dominating performance. The 285-pounder toppled his opponent, sophomore Charles Fox, by a score of 7-1.
As the Harvard wrestling program has shown thus far, the team will continue exhibiting persistence and resilience to find more success this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The alpine skiing hierarchy is a system that reinforces itself. Because start orders are determined by previous finishes, those stuck on lower rungs of the ladder compete when course conditions are at their worst.
All season long, Harvard skiers have been among the last to start in the collegiate fleet, and, perhaps not surprisingly, the Crimson has often had trouble moving up in the rankings.
The status quo held for Harvard at the University of Vermont’s Winter Carnival in Stowe, Vt., as the Crimson placed ninth for the third time this winter.
Harvard finished behind Bates College and ahead of St. Michael’s. Meanwhile the Catamounts won their third carnival of the year, solidifying their place as the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association’s top squad.
But in the slalom, sophomore Catherine Sheils was undeterred by her starting position. Sheils fought her way through the rough course conditions for a sixth-place finish, the best result of her career and one of the best finishes the alpine team has seen in recent history.
“It was a difficult day because the snow was pretty soft,” alpine coach Tim Mitchell said. “She started 26th...she just survived the first run. She had the third best second run. She got really charged. She had a very good tactical run...she has a lot of speed. It’s about limiting her mistakes.”
The alpine team’s most consistent finisher of the weekend was Caroline McHugh. The junior took 29th in the giant slalom and 21st in the slalom.
“I was really really happy with Caroline McHugh,” Mitchell said. “That [slalom] is definitely her best college run.”
The women’s alpine team will get a boost next weekend when freshman Rebecca Nadler returns to the lineup. Nadler was in Turkey competing in the World University Games, where she placed 21st in the slalom.
Freshman Ian Anderson was the team’s top finisher in the giant slalom with a 46th place finisher, while captain Alec Boardman paced the squad in a slalom with a 34th place finish.
“It’s been a season marked by inconsistency,” Mitchell said. “The speed is there, just a lack of consistency.”
On the Nordic side, sophomore Alena Tofte had another strong weekend. Tofte opened the weekend with a 30th place finish in the 15k classic but rallied to take ninth in the 5k free race.
“I think on Friday I was kind of wiped out,” the sophomore said. “I didn’t feel as good. I think I got a good night’s sleep [on Friday night]. I started 15 seconds in front of a girl I had raced before. She caught me, and then I skied with her and got to work to wish her and ended up up passing her.”
Captain Cara Sprague was the team’s top finisher in the 15k classic race.
“She just kept moving right up,” Tofte said. “She looked very strong, and I think she was very happy with it.”
Meanwhile, rookie Jen Rolfes was able to carry her momentum from last weekend’s sixth-place finishes into the collegiate circuit. Rolfes finished 29th in the skate race on Saturday.
Freshman Chris Stock was the team’s top finisher on the men’s side in both races. Stock finished 20th in Friday’s 20k classic race and 31st in the 10k free race.
Next up for the Crimson in both events was Tony Ryerson. The sophomore took 35th in Friday’s race and 44th on Saturday. Rookie Tanner Wiegand was right behind Ryerson in the 20k, placing 37th.
“For Chris Stock and Tanner Wiegand, it was their first 20k collegiate race,” City said. “You never know what you’re going to get. It’s longer than they’re used to racing. For Chris to come in 20th is pretty great.”
“Tanner was not too far behind,” City added. “He skied a really nice race. He paced himself and was passing people at the end.”
“I think the boys had a great day on Friday,” Tofte said. “On Saturday, they looked a little flat, but they held right in there and had a good day.”
Tofte thought the team benefited from the weekend break in the college carnival circuit.
“I think it helps everyone out to have a little break,” Tofte said. “It’s great to be back into it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night, in what was the final dress rehearsal before the Ivy League championship, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams cut through the competition, grabbing three wins—and bragging rights—against Duke, Hunter, and Penn at the Eric Sollee Invite across town at MIT.
For the day, Harvard put on a fencing clinic, dominating its three opponents in all three swords competition—epee, sabre, and foil.
“We just out-fenced every other team with every weapon,” said Crimson sophomore sabre Thomas Kolasa. “We had fencers who generally don’t start still outclass the competition. Overall, it was a really good day.”
In its opening match, the No. 2 Crimson men easily defeated Hunter College, 22-5. After cruising towards victory against the Hawks, the Harvard men would follow up with a pair of victories over the Quakers, 16-11, and the No. 8 Blue Devils, 16-11.
The No. 3 women similarly coasted to victory with wins against Hunter, 21-6, Penn, 17-10, and Duke, 20-7.
Leading the Crimson with strong individual performances were sabre specialist Thomas Kolasa and freshman foil Alexandra Kiefer on the women’s and men’s sides, respectively. Kiefer, who went 9-0 on the day, will now head into the Ivy league championship without a single loss to her name throughout the entire season.
“[Alex] is quite determined to keep her record perfect, but she definitely stood out from everyone,” said Harvard coach Peter Brand with a chuckle. “Even though she had one close bout today, other than that, she pretty much crushed everyone today as she has all year.”
Kolasa, who suffered an ankle injury earlier in the week, led the Crimson men sabre squad to convincing victories against Duke and Hunter, while also posting a 8-1 record for the day.
“[Kolasa] just really sparked our entire sabre squad,” Brand said, “And despite his recent injury, he came out firing on all cylinders and got our other guys motivated and led us to a great day on the men’s side.”
One of the notable stories coming out of the MIT invitational was the rivalry between Duke sabre fencer and Olympic bronze medal winner Rebecca Ward and Crimson junior Caroline Vloka. In the 2009 NCAA championships, Ward bested Vloka to win the women’s national individual sabre title, with Vloka redeeming herself the following year to strip the title away. At yesterday’s meet, it was Vloka who walked away victorious once again.
With both the men’s and women’s teams rising in the national rankings, the day’s outcome proved quite promising for the Crimson as it hopes to carry some of yesterday’s momentum into Ivy League play and to the NCAA championships.
“It’s looking pretty good for us,” Brand said.” “I think that both the men and the women are definitely ready for next week, and I’m pretty optimistic going into the Ivy League Championships.”
Nevertheless, Brand did throw up some cautionary flags leading up to next week’s tournament.
“I think our toughest competition next week will be both the men and women from the Princeton side,” Brand said. “They are the defending champions [after all].”
“Right now, the Princeton women in particular look like the strongest team on paper,” Brand continued. “On the men’s side, things look a little even right now, but both Princeton teams will definitely be our toughest challenge.”
The fencing team will next see action on Feb. 12, when it squares off against conference opponents in the Ivy League Championships in Princeton, NJ.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the annual Battle of Beantown Invitational, the Harvard men and women’s track and field teams proved that they remain forces to be reckoned with.
On Friday at Gordon Indoor Track, the women’s squad successfully defended its title at the 2011 Battle of Beantown, while the men finished third in the four-team meet against local rivals Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern, dashing the Crimson’s hopes of winning a third consecutive Beantown title.
“Overall, I was really pleased with both the men and women,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “Obviously, [his satisfaction] was greater on the women’s side after they had such a dominating performance. They won last year, so it was great to not only defend our team’s trophy, but to have such a convincing win.”
While the women waltzed through the competition, finishing with 191 points—well ahead of the second-place Terriers and Eagles, which both totaled 104 points—the men’s squad faced a tougher challenge.
Although the men initially kept pace with Northeastern and Boston University, by afternoon’s end the competition had shrunk into a two-way race between Huskies and Terriers. By the end of the meet, the Harvard men’s squad finished third with a respectable 131 points, short of first-place Northeastern and second-place Boston University, which accumulated 159 and 158 points, respectively.
“With the men’s side, every year it seems like it’s neck and neck,” Saretsky said. “Even though we came out on the short end this year, it was still an exciting competition, and our team did really well.”
“We were hoping to keep the trophy here for another year, but it was still a fun and competitive meet against all the local schools,” said senior distance runner Dan Chenoweth. “We knew going into the meet that it was going to be pretty tough...but we were still happy with our performance. “
On the women’s side, early wins in the 200 and 400-meter dash built momentum going into later events.
Freshman Christina Twicken got the ball rolling for the Crimson women with a gold-medal finish in the 200-meter dash in 25.33. Twicken then followed up this victory by leading Harvard in a 1-2 finish in the 400-meter dash with a mark of 56.86, along with runner-up and classmate Meisha Brooks, who finished in 56.95.
The women also posted victories in the 500-meter dash and 800-meter dash, as junior Magdalena Robak finished the 500 with a with a winning time of 1:16.46, and senior Thea Lee came back from behind on the final straightaway to win the 800 with a time of 2:14.15.
The highlight of the Harvard women’s day came when the the 4x440-yard relay team of Robak, Twicken, sophomore Jasmine Cho, and Brooks ran away with gold and smashed the previous meet record with a winning time of 3:50.48.
The Crimson women also boasted a number of ECAC qualifiers throughout the day. Junior Kailyn Kuzmuk (4:53.99) and senior Claire Richardson (4:57.67) placed fourth and sixth in the mile to qualify for the ECAC mile. Sophomore Mary Hirst qualified by clearing 1.70 meters in the high jump for second place in the event. In addition, freshman Alysha Johnson (13.80 m) and sophomore Shannon Watt (13.62 m) finished 1-2, and both qualified for the ECAC meet in shot putting.
“[The Beantown Invitational] was a great confidence booster,” Richardson said. “It was our first meet where we really got to display all the hard work and effort we have been putting in, and I think that we did great.”
The men’s side also had its share of noteworthy performances through the day. Junior John Dingus brought the Crimson men their first victory with a win in the 500-meter dash with a IC4A-qualifying time of 1:04.33.  Dingus’ teammates followed up his performance with a win by senior Brian Hill in 800 (1:52.46), a victory by junior Darcy Wilson in the 1,000 (2:28.24), and a second-place finish by Chenoweth in the mile with a IC4A qualifying-time of 4:12.25.
The Harvard men and women’s track team return back to action next week when it travels to New Haven, Conn., for the annual HYP meet against Yale and Princeton.
“I think [the Beantown] was a great stepping stone,” Saretsky said. “But next week, things will definitely be amped up a bit, and there will be a lot more on the line. We’ve got the momentum right now, but we certainly need to buckle down and be ready to compete hard, because Yale and Princeton are going to be firing on all cylinders for sure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard men’s hockey played Yale earlier this year, the Bulldogs were ranked first in the nation. Currently sitting at second in the USA Today poll, they have not weakened much since then.
The Crimson (4-17, 3-13 ECAC) managed to keep the most recent matchup between the rivals close but could not hold on, dropping Friday’s game to Yale (19-4, 13-3) on the road, 1-0. Harvard has not beaten the Bulldogs in New Haven since 2005.
With the win, Yale stays on top of the ECAC and improves to 14-0 at home, while Harvard sits at 11th in the conference.
“When you know that you’re playing a team like that, you’ve got to simplify your play and limit the amount of mistakes that you make,” co-captain Chris Huxley said. “They can capitalize on those opportunities, even more so than other teams.”
Despite the significant difference in teams’ records, a sold-out crowd of 3,500 at Yale’s Ingalls Rink saw a close and competitive game. The contest remained tied for more than 44 minutes, but the home team broke through in the third period to all but put the game away, when Bulldog captain Jimmy Martin dealt the final blow 5:36 into the final period.
“We came out hard—that’s what we were planning on doing,” Huxley said. “We knew it was going to be an energetic game, and we knew that we had to come out hard with a lot of energy, and I thought we did that.”
The Crimson nearly matched the ECAC leaders shot-for-shot—Harvard had 34 such offensive chances to the Bulldog’s 35.
On the other end, Harvard’s goalie—senior Ryan Carroll—made 34 saves in 35 opportunities, while the Bulldog netminder blocked all of the shots that came at him.
“It looked like he really never lost track of the puck,” sophomore David Valek said. “They were always trying to get bodies in front of him...but he did a really good job of looking around him and never lost sight of the puck. He controlled his rebounds.”
Carroll’s play of late has allowed the Crimson to stay close in its games. In the team’s last four games, opponents have taken 126 shots, and he has allowed just seven goals in that time.
But in a game where defense shined, the power play remained a struggle for Harvard. The team had three chances, one in each period, but failed to convert.
The team has scored just once in its last nine chances on the power play, dating back three games.
Defense has been central in allowing the Crimson to keep its games close of late, but the team has struggled to generate much in the way of offense.
Since the Sheraton/TD Bank Catamount Cup at the beginning of 2011, Harvard has scored more than two goals in a game only twice. The Crimson netted three in a loss to Brown and six in an offense onslaught against ECAC cellar-dwellers Colgate. Moving forward, the team knows that its work around the net needs to be a focus.
“We just need to bear down when we get those opportunities,” Valek said. “We had a break-away [Friday], and we had a couple back-court plays…In terms of going forward, we need to focus more on those little plays that result in a win or a loss. We proved that yesterday.”
Harvard’s offense had its fair share of opportunities. Four players—Huxley, junior Alex Killorn, sophomore Marshall Everson, and freshman Dan Ford—each took four shots. Ten different players took at least two shots on the evening.
“Offensively, we tried to put a lot of pressure on their D and get turnovers and I thought we did a pretty good job with that,” Huxley said. “Sometimes, goalies make big saves, or sometimes it’s just not there. We had a lot of chances and a lot of opportunities, so it shows that we were in their zone a lot and getting a lot of pressure on them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With one period remaining in the contest, the Harvard women’s hockey team looked to be skating its way to a two-loss weekend.
But with three goals in the third frame, the Crimson (13-8-2, 12-4-2 ECAC) was able to overcome a two-goal deficit and will its way to a 3-2 victory over Quinnipiac (18-10-1, 10-8) in Bright Hockey Center on Saturday.
From the opening whistle it was clear that the Bobcats, currently fourth in ECAC standings, were prepared for Harvard’s speed and intensity. While the Crimson controlled possession in the early minutes of the game, Quinnipiac kept Harvard’s skaters from getting too close to the net.
And trips to penalty box were all it took to derail the Crimson’s domination over the puck. By the end of the period, the Bobcats were starting to mount offensive pressure of their own and finished the frame only two shots behind Harvard.
The first period might have been characterized as a back-and-forth battle.
The beginning of the second was anything but.
Less than a minute into the frame, Quinnipiac freshman Kelly Babstock sliced through Harvard’s goal-line defense and fired the puck past sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy. Currently the top-scoring rookie in the country, Babstock has had a knack for scoring on the Crimson and posted a hat trick in two teams’ last meeting.
Seeming to be inspired by their young teammate’s solo effort, the Bobcats took control of possession following Babstock’s tally. And less than six minutes later, Quinnipiac struck again. Rookie Erica Uden Johansson, a member of Sweden’s 2010 Olympic team, fired the puck across the goal, and classmate Amanda Colin stuffed it in the goal to put the Bobcats up by two. Babstock was credited with the second assist.
Quinnipiac entered the game on the heels of a 4-0 victory over third-place Dartmouth, and the Bobcats looked to be well on their way to their second weekend victory over an opponent higher in the ECAC standings.
“They’re good,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said of her opponents. “They play a strong team game.”
Harvard seemed to pick up its pace after the second goal but time spent killing penalties limited its offensive options.
“We were having a tough time with penalties,” freshman Kalley Armstrong said. “And so that pretty much took up all of the second period.”
Bobcats sophomore netminder Victoria Vigilanti lived up to her last name and shut down each of the eight shots the Crimson fired.
“Their goaltender does a tremendous amount to keep them there,” Stone said.
Heading into the final frame of the weekend, Harvard needed a to shift the momentum to its side.
Two minutes into the period, tri-captain Kate Buesser found freshman Kalley Armstrong streaking down the ice. Buesser’s pass caught Vigilanti off balance, and Armstrong was able to one-time the puck into the net to put her team on the board after 42 minutes of futility.
Three minutes later the game was tied. Sophomore Josephine Pucci slammed the puck into an open net after junior Alisa Baumgartner grabbed the attention of Vigilanti.
By the time Pucci evened the score, the Crimson had all the momentum on its side. Eventually, Vigilanti broke down for a third and final time.
Once again, it was Armstrong with the one-timer, this time off an assist from sophomore Kaitlin Spurling.
Armstrong’s two-goal effort came a day after missing the Princeton game.
“We’d have liked her in the lineup yesterday,” Stone said. “She was ready to go, and she did well. She took advantage of her opportunities.”
“I’d say it was more my teammates that made it happen,” Armstrong said of her performance. “They put it right on my stick. I just fired it towards the net. That was it.”
After two periods of fighting its way through Quinnipiac’s defense, Harvard was able to find space for three one-timer goals.
“Solely hard work, honestly,” Stone said of the open nets. “I mean, [the team] worked hard to get open, and they did a good job puck protecting, they kept their feet moving, they rolled off the cycle, but it was hard work...They were relentless and so again...another example of you put your mind to this and you dig in, and good things are going to happen.”
With its one-goal lead in hand, the Crimson controlled the puck in the final 10 minutes of play, allowing its opponents only two shots all period. Though the scoreboard showed the outcome to be a narrow escape, Harvard was able to close out the game with the composure of a dominating victor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the last minute ticked off the clock Friday night, the Harvard women’s hockey team assailed the Princeton goal with a flurry of shots—including three from tri-captain Kate Buesser.
Unfortunately for the Crimson (12-8-2, 11-4-2 ECAC), this late effort would not be enough, as Princeton (11-11-1, 8-7-1) held on to a 3-2 lead at the Bright Hockey Center to end Harvard’s recent hot streak.
“We all played hard tonight,” junior forward Alisa Baumgartner said. “Our system was working well, and we were all over the ice…We came out ready to go, and had some [good opportunities].”
The Crimson created more scoring opportunities during first period of play—recording nine shots on goal to the Tigers’ five—though the scoreboard showed a different story. With 2:40 remaining in the first, a hooking penalty on senior forward Katharine Chute gave Princeton an advantage near the close of the period. The Tigers made the most of the contest’s first power play, netting a goal 1:14 before the buzzer.
Coming into the second period, Harvard stayed composed and was able to contain the Tigers’ attack. After just under eight minutes of play, tri-captain Liza Ryabkina evened the score for the Crimson.
After a shot by sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey was deflected by the Princeton goaltender, Ryabkina swooped in and scored off of the rebound at the mouth of the goal.
“It was a tight game,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Everything was back and forth, back and forth…The goaltenders on both sides played very well.”
Sophomore goalie Laura Bellamy had 20 saves for the Crimson on the night, while her Princeton counterpart Rachel Weber recorded 25 stops.
Harvard took its only lead of the game a few minutes after tying the game, as Baumgartner netted one of her own off of a pass from sophomore defender Josephine Pucci. The shot, assisted by Pucci and freshman forward Elizabeth Parker, also put Harvard ahead in shots on goal by double figures, as Harvard recorded its 20th shot on goal to Princeton’s 10.
The Crimson would not be up for long, though. Another late surge put the Tigers back in the game with just over two minutes remaining in the period. Charissa Stadnyk snuck the puck past Bellamy on a shot the goaltender initially appeared to have saved.
After about five minutes of play in the third, Princeton took the lead again, this time for good, when Denna Laing stuffed in a rebound off a Bellamy save.
The Crimson kept the pressure on, creating many scoring opportunities during the remainder of the period. A few of Harvard’s most dangerous chances came in the last seven minutes, as a checking penalty on the Tigers with 6:26 to play gave the Crimson its second and final numbers advantage of the period.
As time began to run out, Harvard was forced to pull its goaltender in an attempt to gain one last offensive advantage.
“With just a couple seconds on the clock, we knew we were a goal down and had to throw everything at the net,” Baumgartner said.
Though the last minute was Harvard-dominated, the Crimson was unable to put one away before the clock ran out.
“Of course [losing to Princeton] was disappointing,” Stone said, “We know there were a lot of things we could have done better… especially defensively [with] our 5-on-5 zone coverage.”
Harvard entered Friday’s contest on a six-game winning streak—the fourth longest active streak in the nation. The Crimson was also ranked second in the ECAC coming into Friday’s game.
Though the game against the Tigers was a big one for Harvard, Stone emphasized the importance of every game on the team’s schedule.
“It’s just another big game for us and we try to treat every game the same,” she said. “[Princeton] always comes in with a lot of jump and it’s great to play them.”
Despite the loss, Harvard remains positive as it looks toward its next challenge.
“Our focus is always to get pucks and bodies to the net and to outwork and outhustle the other team,” Baumgartner said. “We came out trying to do that…We didn’t get the result today, but we’re going to pick it up and be ready for [our next game].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (8-0, 5-0 Ivy) has not lost a match in almost two years.
As matter of fact, the women are a mere eight days short of hitting that two-year mark.
The squad kept its winning streak alive this past weekend on its final road trip of the regular season. It toppled No. 5 Penn (8-3, 4-2) on Saturday and No. 4 Princeton (8-3, 4-3) yesterday, undoubtedly providing some key momentum for the tough matches that lay ahead.
“It was our first real test of the season,” said captain No. 13 Alisha Mashruwala of the weekend. “Everyone stepped up when they needed to.”
HARVARD 7, PRINCETON 2
The Tigers may have had the home-court advantage at the Jadwin Squash Courts, but that ultimately proved futile in the face of a strong Crimson performance.
Coming off a close victory against the Quakers, the Harvard women channeled their confidence into a dominant showing.
“We learned from the match [on Saturday] and we came out firing,” sophomore No. 17 Natasha Kingshott said. “Everyone improved from their match the day before…Every single player went into the match with a plan and knowing their strengths and weaknesses.”
Mashruwala likewise noted the confidence of her teammates.
“The team went into today mentally prepared and very ready to play,” Mashruwala said. “There was a lot of energy and a lot of confidence after [Saturday’s] match. Everyone, win or lose, played the best that they could.”
Utilizing that energy, Kingshott, fellow sophomore No. 42 Sarah Mumanachit, junior No. 37 Cece Cortes, and senior Alexandra Zindman all defeated their opponents in straight sets, 3-0.
Also capturing victories were sophomore No. 1 Laura Gemmell and senior No. 29 Bethan Williams—both won in four frames. Senior No. 9 June Tiong rounded out the wins with a five-frame triumph.
Faring less well, but not for lack of effort, were Mashruwala and junior No. 7 Nirasha Guruge.
Mashruwala couldn’t quite hang on for the win, losing in five sets, and Guruge fell in three.
“Princeton played great,” Mashruwala said. “Princeton is always hard. They always come out at you, and they’re one of the strongest teams, always, in the Ivy League.”
HARVARD 5, PENN 4
With the recent 5-4 upset of the Tigers fresh under its belt, Penn was gunning for another underdog victory at the Ringe Courts this past Saturday.
The Quakers fell short of that goal, but the match was the closest yet of the season for the Crimson.
“It was a great match to start the second half of our season,” Kingshott said. “[Penn is] really competitive, and we knew it would be a challenge.”
And live up to the challenge, the Quakers did.
“Penn played very, very well,” Mashruwala said. “Penn was motivated, and everyone [on the Harvard squad] knew they needed to step up.”
With the match hanging in the balance right through to the final matchup, each court saw close competition.
Gemmell, at No. 1, dropped sophomore No. 15 Nabilla Ariffin in four frames, 11-5, 10-12, 11-4, 11-5. It marked the first regular season match of Gemmell’s career that wasn’t won in straight sets.
Yet, with the win, Gemmell maintained her undefeated record.
Also maintaining spotless records were Cortes, Mumanachit, and Guruge, although Guruge lost the following day. Cortes and Mumanachit won in three sets, and Guruge pushed through a grueling five frames for her victory.
But despite these victories, Mashruwala, Tiong, Kingshott, and Williams all fell short in their matches, and the score was knotted at four apiece.
It was Zindman, fighting her toughest match yet, who clinched the win. She downed No. 80 rookie Hyland Murphy in five, 14-12, 8-11, 13-15, 11-6, 11-3.
“This was her first big match after being injured for so long,” Kingshott explained. “That was the crucial match and crucial win for us…She showed incredible tenacity. We were all so excited and inspired to see her play well.”
Ultimately, then, the Crimson narrowly pulled away with a win.
“Penn came out fighting,” Kingshott said. “But we dealt with the pressure really well. Penn is a formidable opponent and we had to respect them, but at the same time we had to have confidence in our own skill. We did a good job dominating play and making our marks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the women’s water polo team scored 60 goals across its three opening games at Blodgett Pool on Saturday, the Harvard squad gave a huge glimpse of the firepower in store for this season.
“We saw every game as an individual game and went hard and didn’t try to save our energy,” freshman attacker Shayna Price said. “We just went hard all day.”
The Crimson dominated its opening day with a solid defense and pure speed. Within less than seven hours, Harvard routed Boston College, 23-2, Iona, 17-7, and Villanova, 20-5.
“It’s a good way to start,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “These are hopefully the worst games we play all year—we’re going to keep getting better as we go on.”
HARVARD 20, VILLANOVA 5
From the starting whistle, Harvard came out strong, putting up eight goals on the board before Villanova finally snuck one past senior goaltender Shami Entenman at the end of the first.
Against the Wildcats, the Crimson looked as if it were coasting through just another practice in Blodgett. Possessions in the first half averaged only a few seconds and usually ended with a Harvard goal.
With six minutes left in the opening half, sophomore two-meter defender Elise Molnar went untouched by the defense as she slowly wound up from the five-meter mark and placed the ball in the upper right corner of Villanova’s net.
On the following Crimson possession, freshman attacker Riley Kessler stole the ball and tossed it down the pool to classmate Christy DiSilvestro, who drew an ejection and skipped the shot right under the arms of the Wildcat’s goalie.
“What I think is amazing about our team this year in comparison to last year is that not only do we have a new coach who has a system that we’re supposed to be running, but we were able to pick it up so quickly,” said junior attacker Monica Zdrojewski, who notched five goals against Villanova.
With the second half came the second string, and even the reserves outplayed the Wildcat’s starting lineup, allowing only a single goal to slip in the final seconds of the game.
HARVARD 17, IONA 7
Iona matched Harvard goal-for-goal in the first quarter of the Crimson’s second game of the day. The first period ended 4-3 in Harvard’s favor and proved to be the Crimson’s greatest—if not only—challenge of the weekend.
“We just really buckled down on the defensive end,” said Minnis. “I told the girls, ‘If it’s not going our way, then get a stop and then go and try to get a goal. If we don’t get a goal, we’re still going to try and comeback and get a stop.’”
Three of the Gaels’ leading scorers returned for the 2011 season, including junior Cecilia Leonard who scored 97 goals last season. But even she proved to be no match for Harvard’s defense, which limited her and her cohorts to seven goals.
“They have some very strong players, but we recognized that and were able to meet that defensively and shut them down,” Zdrojewski said.
HARVARD 23, BOSTON COLLEGE 2
The Crimson kick-started its weekend and season with quite the confidence boost Saturday morning by pelting 23 goals into the back of their cross-town rival’s net.
Sophomore Aisha Price led the charge by scoring two times as many goals on her own than the whole Eagles roster could in the 32 minutes of the contest. Her younger sister, Shayna, contributed two goals and led the team in steals.
“I don’t think you can ever expect this kind of performance on the first day,” Minnis said. “I’m really happy with the girls…and I’m pleasantly surprised by the way they played.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a weekend of key Ivy League contests for No. 6 Harvard (7-3, 3-2 Ivy), the Crimson played to mixed results, defeating Penn (4-6, 1-4) in the first match on Saturday but losing to Princeton yesterday afternoon.
PRINCETON 7, HARVARD 2
Playing away from home for the last time this regular season, Harvard matched up well to a tough Princeton squad yesterday. But, despite picking up 10 games over the Tigers (8-1, 5-1), the Crimson was unable to pull out the upset over No. 3 Princeton.
“We were hoping to take momentum from [the win on] Saturday and bring it to the match against Princeton,” senior Richard Hill said. “But, they were better than us [yesterday].”
Harvard went into the matchup riding a four-game winning streak but suffered its first loss of the New Year. Though a win against the Tigers was a necessary piece in the Crimson’s quest for an Ancient Eight title, Harvard will likely get a chance at retribution in the near future, with CSA nationals looming in the distance.
“There are a lot of good things we can take away from [the match],” Hill continued. “We won two matches, there’s a lot to be learned, and this weekend was good preparation for Trinity on Wednesday.”
Freshman Nigel Koh and classmate Tom Mullaney picked up wins for the Crimson at the No. 6 and No. 7 spots, respectively.
Koh swept his opponent, though just two points decided the first and final sets. Mullaney beat his challenger in five games, winning the second, third, and fifth.
“We played a lot of close matches, but we weren’t able to pull it through in the end,” freshman Gary Power said.
Individual losses suffered against the Tigers were closer than they appear. Of the seven matches the Tigers won over the Crimson, three went to at least four games, and Harvard took six sets to extra points.
“Today we didn’t play badly, we just didn’t win the close matches,” freshman Gary Power said. “At this level everyone is so close that [a match’s outcome] can vary a lot week to week.”
HARVARD 8, PENN 1
In Harvard’s first contest of the weekend, the Crimson soundly defeated the No. 10 Quakers.
“The match against Penn went really well for us,” Hill said. “It was a great test for all players, top to bottom.”
At the No. 1 spot, Power won out against Thomas Mattsson, defeating his Quaker opponent, 3-1. The match was a close one, with the first and last sets going into extra points. But, after dropping the first game of the match 12-10, Power came back with three strong sets to win the contest in four.
Co-captain Reed Endresen picked up his third win at the No. 2 spot for the Crimson, defeating Quaker Danny Greenberg in four sets.
The first set finished in favor of Penn, but Endresen was able to outlast his opponent. This was especially evident in the third set—a 16-14 battle for the 2-1 advantage in games.
“Fitness was a key element in helping us win,” Hill said. “It also took mental strength to be able to handle the pressure of the crowd and the opponents. That really carried us through in the end.”
Outstanding performances for Harvard came from everywhere in the lineup, with freshman Thomas Mullaney and sophomore Alexander Ma picking up dominant victories in straight sets. Hill and freshman Brandon McLaughlin defeated their respective opponents in tough five-game matches.
Harvard’s one loss came at the No. 9 spot, as Penn’s Justin Ang defeated Crimson junior William Ahmed in four sets. The match included an 11-9 victory in the first set and two other games decided by just two points.
Overall, this weekend marked one of the season’s biggest tests yet for the Crimson, which has just two more regular season matches left to play. For the rest of the season, fitness appears to be one of Harvard’s main focuses.
“We’ve been doing a lot of fitness, about three times a week,” Power said.  “Our bodies will definitely be well prepared for our [upcoming] matches.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard women’s basketball team learned Saturday night, no matter the school sitting on the other bench and no matter its record or rank, every game will be intense.
“You can’t take anyone lightly in the Ivy League now,” sophomore Victoria Lippert said. “Every game is for the Ivy League championship, so there can’t be any letdowns, from playing Princeton to playing Penn. We have to bring it every night because everyone is coming at us.”
Hosting Penn (7-12, 1-4 Ivy) at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson (13-6, 5-0) needed two overtime periods to secure an 88-84 victory and maintain its undefeated league record. The Quakers, ranked sixth in the Ancient Eight, kept the score close for most of the game, until Harvard junior Brogan Berry made three free throws in the last seconds to put the game out of Penn’s reach.
“We didn’t expect the game to be this close,” senior Emma Markley said. “I don’t know what attributed to that; it could be fatigue from last night [against Princeton], but we were definitely back on our heels for awhile. It’s not going to happen again.”
Harvard started play with a quick 11-2 lead in the first five minutes of the game, but after a nine-point run by Penn rookie Alyssa Baron, the Quakers stood within one. Later in the half, the Crimson grabbed five unanswered points in a span of 19 seconds, setting the score at 29-19. But Baron again retaliated, cutting Harvard’s lead to one point going into halftime.
“I thought we should have played a little better,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We were gassed in the middle portions. You can’t have those lapses. I think there was some periods in the first half where I thought we just didn’t play tough.”
In the second half, both squads continued to trade baskets until Markley scored three straight points to put the Crimson ahead, 55-50. As for Baron and the Quakers, the freshman led Penn on a 14-0 run midway through the second half. After Lippert drained a three to stop Penn’s momentum, Harvard returned fire with an 11-point run of its own.
“We did everything we thought [to guard Baron], and then we had breakdowns,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a great little player, this was a great game, and she did a great job. We will go back to the drawing table and figure something out.”
The Crimson seemed to have the game with 22 seconds left on the clock and a 72-69 advantage, but thanks to Harvard fouls and Baron’s free throw, Penn tied it up at 72 with 10 seconds left. A missed shot by Lippert in the final three seconds allowed the game to go into overtime
“That was our mindset [going into overtime],” Lippert said. “We’re not going to lose this game. We refuse to lose.”
The first overtime started slow with neither team finding the basket. The Quakers continuously hit the rim, while the Crimson missed crucial passes. Penn took advantage of Harvard’s mistakes, stripping the ball from Lippert for a layup and the first two points of overtime. Lippert redeemed herself by making the next two free throws to tie the score once more.
Like in the Columbia contest a week before, Crimson freshman Christine Clark had the opportunity to win the game for Harvard with a last-second shot, but this time the ball bounced off of the rim and hit a Quaker falling out of bounds. Clark sent the sideline pass to a guarded Markley underneath the basket, but the senior—who had 21 points on the night—wasn’t able to convert, leaving the score tied.
“Going into double overtime can be pretty exhausting, but I felt a lot of love, a lot of support from the bench,” Markley said. “We were there for each other even when things got really hectic and confusing and pretty nerve-wracking.”
In the second overtime, the Crimson gained its composure despite the pressure, taking an 85-82 lead before Baron scored two for Penn. Baron’s foul on Berry, though, sent her out of the game and led the way for Berry to score the free throws that put Harvard ahead for good.
Although another victory for the Crimson, the close score and extra minutes of play reminded the Harvard squad that during the Ivy season, every team is going to come out playing its best.
“Now that it’s Ivy League season, we have to be able to sustain our energy after Friday into Saturday night,” Markley said, “and learn the lesson that every game counts. You have no idea who’s going to come out and give it to you the next game, because everyone’s in it this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the final buzzer went off Friday night, only one women’s basketball team remained at the top of the Ivy League: Harvard.
Following Crimson sophomore Victoria Lippert’s three-pointer from the top of the arc—which had turned a one-point deficit into a two-point lead—a crowded Lavietes Pavilion witnessed her teammate Christine Clark drain a closely defended jumper with only 45 seconds left, giving Harvard a four-point advantage from which Princeton (14-4, 3-1 Ivy) never recovered.
Up to that point, a 9-0 Tiger run late in the second period had allowed the visitors to tie and surpass its hosts, but the Harvard women’s basketball team (12-6, 4-0) came up with the critical shots to prevail in the end, 73-67.
“This win was really big,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Princeton has been a really dominant team, not only in the Ivy League, but they have also done some really good stuff outside of the league...Harvard and Dartmouth have dominated [over the years], but now all of a sudden Princeton comes in.”
Clark finished as the top scorer of the night, posting 18 points to go along with five rebounds. Lippert was third on the team with 14 points and seven boards.
After the first half ended with Harvard on top, 35-25, the Tigers clawed their way back into the game, hitting tough shots from long distance to keep the score close.
Guard Laura Johnson was critical to the team’s efforts, scoring 16 points on 4-of-7 shooting from downtown.
Junior point guard Brogan Berry, who scored 17 points on the night, was the glue that kept the team together down the stretch, setting up critical plays for her teammates and taking over when necessary.
With less than seven minutes to play and the shot clock winding down, Berry drove to the hoop, only to step back and sink a jumper to set the score at 57-50.
“We wanted to get Brogan on those isolations because she had been hitting them all game,” Clark said.
“If you’re blessed with someone who can take you off the dribble, that’s [the play] almost everybody [calls],” Delaney-Smith said of allowing Berry to take over the game.
Tiger guard Krystal Hill then scored on two consecutive possessions, draining a high-arcing three and then coming up with a steal leading to a fast-break layup. Berry tried to go strong to the hoop again but couldn’t get her shot off, and Princeton’s Devona Allgood made an inside shot on the ensuing possession to tie the score at 57.
It was then Harvard’s turn to respond. Berry ran along the baseline and found forward Miriam Rutzen, who caught the pass and quickly banked in a shot. The sophomore had nine points and five rebounds in 28 minutes of play.
The Tigers responded quickly, as junior guard Lauren Edwards sank a trey to give the Tigers their first lead of the game, 60-59. Edwards finished the game with nine points on 2-of-10 shooting.
Senior Emma Markley, who totaled nine points, tried to score on the other end, but the ball rolled in and out, allowing Princeton to come back for more.
Allgood was fouled, and though she missed the front end of the one-and-one, Edwards caught the rebound and was fouled on her way up to the basket. The junior made both her shots from the charity stripe to set a three-point lead, 62-59.
Cue Clark, the rookie who had drained the game-winning shot at Columbia last weekend. The guard showed no fear as she drove to the hoop and then let a shot fly while fading away. A fanatic crowd cheered as the ball dropped through the net, cutting the deficit to just one point.
“Christine is one heck of a player,” Delaney-Smith said. “She has never really played like a freshman. She does make mistakes because she doesn’t have college experience, but she makes up for them two-fold—no, 10-fold.”
Princeton wasted two possessions to add to its lead, and the Crimson made its Ivy rival pay. With 1:34 left to play, Lippert got the crowd on its feet as she caught the pass for an open three, which she coolly drained to make the score 64-62.
“Fabulous,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s made out of the same mold [as Berry and Clark]. She wants the ball; she wants the shot. She’s ice.”
After Clark’s jumper made it a four-point game, Harvard controlled the outcome by playing strong defense and hitting its free throws. The Crimson hit 18-of-21 free throws, with Clark making all eight of her attempts—four of which came in the contest’s final 11 seconds.
“We just needed to keep our composure the entire game,” Berry said. “We knew it was going to come down to defense and rebounding the entire time, so we just tried to keep our focus on those things.”
After having lost both games of the season series against the Tigers last year, Harvard defeated Princeton for the first time in two years in a matchup that had been spotlighted by ESPN.
The Crimson showed how much the win meant emotionally—not to mention to its Ivy title aspirations—celebrating at midcourt after the game’s final seconds had ticked away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the outcome of the Crimson women’s tennis team’s match against BC hanging in the balance—Harvard narrowly ahead, 3-2—the day’s two remaining singles matches were forced to three sets.
The Crimson (2-2) had started slowly Saturday at the Murr Center, losing its doubles point for the fourth straight time in the nascent season.
But junior Samantha Gridley managed to garner the momentum she needed to lift her squad to a win.
Playing at No. 6, the junior rebounded from a tough first set to topple Eagle sophomore Ina Kauppila, 2-6, 6-0, 6-4.
Soon after, No. 45 junior co-captain Holly Cao added an insurance point with her 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 win over sophomore Alex Kelleher to finish off BC (2-2, 1-0 ACC) by a final score of 5-2.
“Our team performed really well,” Cao said. “We lost the doubles point, and that was a disappointment because we’ve been working on our doubles. [But] we did a really good job coming back after the doubles point. As a team we did really well in the singles matches. We were all really proud that we came away with the win.”
Harvard coach Traci Green was likewise pleased with the match’s result.
“BC is a very talented team,” Green said. “We weren’t taking them lightly. Every match we were focusing the best we could, and the match went our way.”
Indeed, the Eagles demonstrated their skill right from the start. At No. 1, Kelleher and sophomore Olga Khmylev made quick work of Cao and fellow co-captain Samantha Rosekrans, nabbing an 8-2 victory.
“Sam and I didn’t play our best in doubles,” Cao said. “We had a slow start.”
Sophomore Hideko Tachibana and freshman Natalie Blosser captured a sound 8-1 victory for the Crimson at No. 2, but the crew ultimately lost the doubles point, when sophomore Kristen Norton and freshman Hannah Morrill fell, 8-5, at court three.
But the discouraging start only inspired the Harvard crew to push harder in the singles matches.
“We mustered up all of our energy to pull through,” Green said.
Cao was undoubtedly a prime example of putting it all on the line. Even after her teammate Gridley had clinched the match, the Australia native endured deuce after deuce to eventually come away with a dominant third-set comeback.
“I thought she played pretty well,” Cao said of her singles opponent. “She played a smart match.”
Cao also noted an important factor that would not make it into the game statistics—the fans.
“BC had a lot of supporters, because many of the players are from Massachusetts,” she explained. “[For example,] my opponent had her parents and lots of relatives there to support her.”
“I think the entire team did a really good job of supporting each other, and that was what made the difference for us in the end,” Cao said.
With her squad firmly behind her, Norton bounced back from her doubles loss to senior Katharine Attwell and junior Katarina Gajic. She faced down Attwell at No. 3 and was one of the first off the courts after a dominant 6-0, 6-2 win.
Sophomore Hideko Tachibana secured her second win of the day soon after at No. 2, dropping only four games to rookie Eagle Veronica Corning in her 6-0, 6-4 win.
Blosser likewise nabbed two victories, defeating Gajic at No. 4, 6-2, 6-3.
The only singles loss for the Crimson came at No. 5.
After a tough doubles match, Rosekrans fell to Khmylev for a second time in two quick sets, 6-2, 6-2.
Despite the losses, Green said that she viewed the match as an opportunity for her players to gain individual match experience. She also pointed out the importance of developing a strong mental game.
“The main thing that our team is benefitting from is that we’re getting more and more mentally tough,” Green said. “Mental toughness will be very important...[especially] in Ivy League play.”
As the young season progresses, then, the ladies of the Harvard tennis team will look to apply this toughness to their doubles matches in particular.
“Our number one for us is our doubles,” Cao said. “When Ivy season rolls around, we’ll really need our doubles point.”

Two Lowell House students will take the podium in Lowell dining hall to deliver a five-minute speech on a topic of personal significance on weeknights at 7:20 p.m. this semester. Students will prepare their speeches with help from Lowell Senior Common Room members who will continue to serve as advisers for upcoming speakers.
Lowell House Resident Scholar Sandy Alexander leads the program and was inspired by his own experience preparing and delivering a speech at Memorial Church.
"It was a perfect, engaging, terrifying assignment," Alexander said, recalling what drew him to make Lowell students take the speech-writing plunge. "I spent 30 hours on my five-minute talk; involved my parents, my wife, my friends; learned a ton; and said something that mattered to me."
Don't fret if you can't make it at 7:20 p.m.; videos and texts of the speeches will be posted online the following day.

Rather than taking the time to mourn the University’s reluctance to declare a snow day, James E. Hawrot '12 decided to take advantage of last week's massive snowfall and construct an igloo in front of Cabot House on the Quad lawn.
Hawrot said that he was inspired to build the igloo after hearing about the snow antics of other undergraduates.
After searching online for "how to build an igloo," he stumbled upon a 1949 Canadian short film on the igloo-building process.
Following the film's instructions, Hawrot began building the igloo this past Friday.
"We used milk crates to build the blocks," Hawrot said. "The snow was too dry, so for a bit, we had to fill buckets of water and pour it on the snow."
About 20 students helped Hawrot with the construction process, which was spread out over two days and took approximately 12 hours in total.
Hawrot, who is on the fencing team and is co-chair of the Cabot House Committee, said that although his practice schedule has prevented him from spending much time in the completed igloo, other Cabot students have already been taking advantage of it.
"People have been in there studying and having fun," Hawrot said. "I think it's a good addition to Cabot House."

As Cambridge residents took to the streets of Harvard Square to protest Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime, Jon Stewart casually referenced the "Let's Go" series of travel guides written entirely by Harvard undergraduates during a segment of his highly popular nightly comedy show.
During the piece— titled "Let's Go Exile!"—Stewart advises Mubarak to take refuge in France and enjoy its "eclectic ex-pat community," though Stewart warns that France could potentially be "too Western and too close to the Hague" for Mubarak's tastes. Stewart offered other options for exile to Mubarak including the Arabian Peninsula or Senegal where, according to Stewart, "the national disease is yellow fever with a touch of mosquito-born leprosy."
Although this is not the first time Stewart has mentioned "Let's Go" on his nightly program—the publication's editors blogged about being mentioned on "The Daily Show" back in November—"Let's Go" writers and editors were happy to be referenced on the show for a second time.
"Everyone was really excited about it," Joseph B. Gaspard '12, publicity and marketing director for "Let's Go," said. "We love it."
