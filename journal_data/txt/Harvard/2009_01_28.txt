The F-22 Raptor—one of the Air Force’s stealthy new fighter jets—is the sort of military project that the New York Times crowd loves to hate. It is incredibly expensive, it has not been used in either Iraq or Afghanistan, and it seems to be entirely useless in a world where our foes prefer decidedly low-tech means of destruction. Critics, including current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, have been vocal in their calls to end procurement of the controversial fighter jet, currently stalled at 183 aircraft.  But with all due respect to Secretary Gates—who has rescued the Pentagon from the nearly criminal incompetence and arrogance of his predecessor—those who call for the end of F-22 production are dead wrong.
After the end of the Cold War, many military procurement projects found themselves on the Congressional chopping block. The A-12 Avenger II—an all-weather, carrier-based strike bomber that suffered from massive cost overruns—was cancelled in 1991.  Similarly, the XM2001 Crusader, a new howitzer that promised both mobility and accuracy but delivered neither, was struck from the list in 2002. But unlike these projects—which were real Cold War dinosaurs—the Raptor has proven itself to be a highly effective and necessary part of the Air Force’s inventory.
First and foremost, the Raptor promises to save American lives and end air combat against any potential adversaries in a decisive fashion. During a recent military exercise, dubbed “Northern Edge” by the Pentagon, the Raptor amassed a truly impressive virtual kill ratio against the F-15 and F-16 fighters that have been the de facto standard for aircraft designers all over the world.  This simulated exercise, known as a “Red Flag,” pits highly skilled United States Air Force pilots against each other in mock combat. At the end of the fortnight-long excursion in Alaskan airspace, the pilots flying the Raptor had “shot down” 108 enemy planes without suffering a single loss.  
While it is indeed unlikely that al-Qaeda or its ilk will field a significant air force in the near future, it is foolish to assume that every adversary that America faces will only be capable of cowardly attacks on civilians. If military action against Iran becomes necessary, the Air Force will need the stealth capabilities of the Raptor—which render it all but invisible against air-defense radars—in order to guarantee the total destruction of Iran’s nuclear and military assets without risking American lives.  Similarly, if the People’s Republic of China were to threaten the Republic of China on Taiwan—as it did during 1996, when Taiwan held its second free presidential election—the Raptor could provide an important deterrent against Chinese land-based aircraft.  
Looking into the future, the F-22 will also play an important role in creating a flexible and capable inventory for the Air Force. While many critics have pointed to the F-22’s absence from current theaters of operation as an example of its uselessness, they are missing the point. The Raptor is an air superiority fighter—a jet that is designed specifically to destroy an opponent’s air force with minimal losses.  In this role, it is designed to complement and protect the new F-35 Lightning II, a new multifaceted fighter that can perform the more mundane but very necessary tasks of air-to-ground combat but lacks the F-22’s double-engine redundancy and is decidedly less stealthy when carrying any significant amount of weaponry. 
Finally, the most compelling argument for the continued production of the Raptor is the fact that the F-15 Eagle—the Raptor’s predecessor—is more than three decades old.  While the Eagle is, without a doubt, one of the finest fighter jets currently flying, it has begun to show its age in recent years. Last November, an Air National Guard F-15 simply disintegrated in mid-air, prompting the Air Force to ground most of the F-15 fleet.  When structural problems—not a pilot error or a freak accident—were determined to be the cause of the crash, General John D.W. Corley announced that “the long-term future of the F-15 is in question.”  If F-22 production is not resumed, the Eagle is slated to remain in service until 2025; the consequences of such a move could be devastating. 
There is no question that military projects involve a great deal of time, money, and other resources. This is especially true of the F-22 program, which began in 1991.  But, more often than not, the equipment procured by the Department of Defense has proven invaluable when the United States or its allies are under threat. The Raptor is not just another Cold War relic—it is a much-needed replacement for older equipment that will provide our soldiers and airmen with the tools they need to keep us safe. President Obama and Secretary Gates would do well to recognize this fact and issue a bipartisan call of support for the program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of all the congratulatory messages received by then-Senator Barack Obama just after his victory in the tightly contested 2008 presidential race, perhaps the most interesting was a rather direct missive from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. “The great Iranian nation welcomes real, fundamental, and fair changes in America’s behavior and policies,” he said, “particularly in the Middle East region.”  Over the first few days of its tenure in office, the Obama Administration has made it a public priority to right the wrongs of the Bush years and restore competent diplomacy to its prominent role in American foreign policy. Toward that end, the United States should take a major step forward by establishing diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
First and foremost, re-establishing relations with Iran will inspire the morose progress of nuclear negotiations by demonstrating America’s seriousness in actually approaching, and not just bullying, Iran. Since 2006, negotiations have dragged on with virtually no results; the politically hamstrung Iran Six (China, Britain, France, Germany, the US, Russia) have continued to press their relatively toothless sanctions while a determined Iran keeps plodding on in its ascent to the nuclear club. As a senator, President Obama compiled an impressive record on nuclear non-proliferation. By engaging Iran effectively on this issue, he could help to keep the world a safer place.
The importance of direct negotiations on this issue cannot be understated. The current diplomatic approach to Iran’s nuclear ambitions is overwhelmingly dependent on economic sanctions and is simply not effective. This is due to the volatile state of global energy markets, particularly crude oil. Since Tehran relies on oil exports for 85 percent of its foreign exchange revenue, UN sanctions can be rendered meaningless by steady increases in the price of oil and gas—a trend that has reached alarming rates in the past five years. 
In fact, establishing diplomatic relations with Iran would allow the US to use the rising price of oil to its advantage. Currently, Iranian oil production is barely 60 percent of what it was in 1977.  This fall in production has been largely attributed to a lack of foreign investment.  Without formal diplomatic relations, US companies cannot effectively do business in Iran. Similarly, US diplomats are unable to make credible promises. If the US re-establishes official relations, American oil companies—who have some of the most advanced petroleum extraction technologies in the world—could easily increase Iranian oil output to its pre-revolutionary output. Reviving the Iranian oil industry to this standard could bring the country nearly $7.5 billion monthly, a massive sum for a country whose annual GDP is around $760 billion.  
Furthermore, releasing Iranian oil into the market would be positive for all parties. Rather than carrying out costly exploration for difficult-to-attain oil, Western oil companies could instead reap the benefits of relatively accessible Iranian oil. Moreover, Iran and the West would share the economic benefits of increased investment and increased oil supply. 
Re-establishing diplomatic relations with Tehran would also have immediate benefits for our forces in Iraq; a friendlier Iran would be less likely to support sectarian belligerents in that divided nation. The bipartisan Iraq Study Group contends that a friendlier Iran is crucial to this endeavor. If the US establishes relations, it will be able to use its diplomatic and economic clout to garner enforceable agreements on arms control between Iraq and Iran. Coming to an accord will certainly help secure the safety of American troops. Other problems with the Islamic Republic notwithstanding, the potential to disarm the enemies of American soldiers should take first priority.
Of course, many may contest the idea of enriching a non-democratic, repressive, and relatively unfriendly government. However, considering some of the other countries from which the US purchases oil—a radically unfriendly and Soviet-esque Chavez regime in Venezuela and the notoriously absolutist monarchy in Saudi Arabia—any strategic or moral reservations about buying Iranian oil are moot points. In reality, the hardliners who oppose both developing trade with Iran and developing alternative energy sources are doing more damage to American security than re-opening our embassy in Tehran ever will. 
Of course, some supporters of Israel may see the re-establishment of relations as a threat to the Israeli state. However, the truth is a bit more complicated. The re-establishment of formal relations will open diplomatic channels by which the US can help Iran to reconcile its differences with Israel and other Middle Eastern states. The present situation leaves the United States in a bind, unable to effectively mediate between two hostile parties and forced to resort to bullying and bellicose language. Opening relations with Iran will at least put negotiation on the table. 
It is time to shed the Bush-era belief that diplomacy doesn’t work. Unlike outright military coercion, simple diplomacy is a powerful tool whose countless successes greatly outnumber its failures. Although the Iranian Revolution and the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 still leave many Americans bitter, the time for holding grudges has passed. Simply put, the potential for economic benefits, a more stable Middle East, and—perhaps most importantly—saving American soldiers’ lives are simply too great for the US to overlook, even in the face of such a gross offense to international diplomacy. President Obama has already pledged to take America in a new direction; establishing relations with Iran would be the best way to do so, at least in the Middle East.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s questionable appointment season: On Tuesday, just weeks after the Senate finally agreed to seat Roland Burris—the nominee of a governor currently in midst of impeachment proceedings—Kirsten Gillibrand became the senator from New York amidst speculation that her selection was a political move by New York governor David Paterson. Senator Gillibrand, who, up until her appointment, was largely unknown to New Yorkers outside her Congressional district, was rumored to have been chosen for her ability to help Paterson appeal to upstate New Yorkers and women in his upcoming reelection bid.
These recent events are good cause to question the nature of the process by which such seats are filled.
The 17th Amendment to the Constitution states that, in the event of a vacancy in the Senate, the state legislature may empower the governor to appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the term. All but five states still retain this outdated procedure, although it raises some troubling issues.
The appointment of senators by governors circumvents the democratic process and leaves the electorate completely out of the process of selecting its own representative. Governors’ personal political interests can easily take precedence over voters’ preferences, leading to the selection of senatorial appointees with little or no appeal outside their district. Moreover, as the Blagojevich-Burris saga demonstrated so well, there are virtually no limitations on a governor’s power to appoint, which raises the possibility that corruption and nepotism could play into the decision. By the time the competence of appointed senators is eventually put to the test before voters during reelection, they already have the political advantage of running as an incumbent. 
Instead of allowing the appointment of a senator to remain in the hands of a single individual, the Senate should follow the policy of the House of Representatives and fill empty seats by special election. The current system of gubernatorial appointments seems reminiscent of the framers’ original conception of the Senate as an elite body, elected by the state legislatures in order to remain insulated from popular opinion. Pressure throughout the late 19th century led to the passage of the 17th Amendment, allowing for the direct election of senators by the people and dramatically weakening the distinction between Senate and House. Given that both members of the House and senators are currently popularly elected, it is illogical for there to be differences in the way that vacancies in the two houses are filled. All congressmen should have the approval of voters in order to hold office.
We applaud Senator Russ Feingold, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, for introducing a constitutional amendment this week that requires special elections to fill Senate vacancies. While special elections are often expensive and difficult to execute in a short amount of time, they are necessary to ensure that replacement senators are as responsive to their constituents as possible. Preserving democratic principles is well worth the extra trouble.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Emancipation Proclamation was passed over a century ago, many Americans made the mistake of believing that color lines had been erased, blinding them to the harsh realities of the post-Civil War African-American experience. Now, as the first president with black heritage ascends to the White House, Americans are again quick to congratulate themselves for triumphing over prejudice. But, though Obama’s mixed background and encouragement of diversity are an essential first step in breaching racial divides, we should not be naïve enough to believe that racism no longer poses a problem in America.
Racial incidents still occur far too frequently. A few weeks ago, for example, my sister and a group of other middle-school students were on a school trip to Macon, Georgia. Their African-American bus driver parked in an almost-empty Dairy Queen parking lot so that the children could get something to eat. After everybody had made their purchases, the white manager of the restaurant came over to the bus and demanded that the bus driver move out of his parking lot, claiming he had not bought anything. 
The bus driver and several of the children on the bus held up their DQ bags as evidence to the contrary, but the white manager still demanded that the black bus driver move; he then called the police, and the two white police officers who showed up enforced the manager’s demand. When the bus driver went to the policemen to protest the decision, he was arrested. It took the efforts of the trip’s white chaperones to convince the police that they needed the bus driver to take them back to Atlanta.
This blatant show of racism left an imprint on both the bus driver and the schoolchildren. That this event took place not in 1958, but in 2008, well after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and soon after the election of an African-American president, indicates how much work remains to be done in combating racial discrimination.
While an event like the one I mentioned is unlikely to occur in many parts of America—and perhaps if he lived somewhere else, the black bus driver would be quicker to take legal action for such treatment—there are unfortunately still several regions that linger in the pre-civil-rights era and have certainly not reached a post-racial state.
A brief look at the numbers makes this clear. According to a CBS News poll conducted earlier this year, three out of four Americans still believe that racism and sexism continue to be serious problems, and over six in ten African-Americans had recently heard a racist remark. A 2007 Department of Justice survey also found that blacks and Hispanics are more than twice as likely as whites to be searched, arrested, threatened, or subdued with force when stopped by police. The mere fact that an African-American was elected does not mean that there were people who specifically did not vote for him because of his race and that even those who did vote for him may experience racism in their daily interactions. Indeed, in some ways, diversity in America has even aggravated the problem: As the number of minority groups in America has increased, discrimination has been extended on a racial and religious basis to Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, Arab-Americans, Muslims, Sikhs, and others.
Obama addressed these issues of race in America during his campaign, and he should not forget them as president. His administration has the power to heal such wounds in the form of much-needed legislation discouraging racism, institutional and otherwise—that of racial profiling, for instance. By formulating a diverse team, his administration can also set an example, encouraging diversity throughout businesses and institutions across America. 
Obama’s election represents the overcoming of one significant hurdle to a post-racial America, but many obstacles remain. Only when we work together to eradicate all forms of prejudice from our society can we begin to contemplate a truly post-racial era.

As an African-American, people expect me to be excited by the inauguration of the first black president of the United States last week. Of course, symbols matter. A black man could not have ascended to the presidency 40 years ago. But the inauguration of President Barack Obama means considerably less than what the pundits say it means.
True, it indicates that racism is lessening in America. But the black unemployment rate will stay the same. The black poverty rate will stay the same. Policemen will still murder elderly black women with impunity. Confederate flags honoring those who killed to preserve slavery and racial segregation will still disgrace our public spaces. And Obama will not do or say anything about any of this.
Certainly, having a black president will be a first. But just because you are a first for blacks does not mean blacks are first for you. For example, Thurgood Marshall, the first black Supreme Court justice, informed on other blacks at the behest of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He also hated black America’s Saul of Tarsus and shining prince, Malcolm X.
While it would be absurd for blacks to practice “shadism”—the great Harvard graduate W. E. B. DuBois, intellectual and freedom fighter, had the blood of two continents in his veins—it would be naïve to ignore the weighty significance of the truth: that many black political “firsts” in America, such as Marshall, have been light-skinned mulattoes, like Obama. 
Admittedly, Obama represents a new type of African-American politician: He is not a minister, he did not march with Dr. King, he has no line item in his budget for pregnant mistresses and keeps food—not cash—in his refrigerator. Brotherman is no Uncle Sambo. He is not an embarrassment in that sense.
Yet he is an embarrassment in another sense. At least the misleaders and pied pipers who came out of the bowels of the civil-rights movement paid lip service to the idea of uplifting the race. Obama and the new generation of black policy-makers, such as Newark, New Jersey, mayor Cory Booker, self-professed drug-dealer-cum-Harvard-professor Roland Fryer, and former Tennessee congressman Harold Ford, Jr., pay scant allegiance to the past or feel little obligation to their fellow blacks as blacks. 
Unlike black conservatives, such as Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, whom the African-American community mostly derides, the new black politician does not usually declare openly that he is against the issues blacks support. He just never declares that he is for those issues. For instance, the issue of reparations for slavery is avoided. At one presidential debate, white congressman Dennis Kucinich said he was for it, while Obama dodged the question.
Blacks make the false assumption that, because the new black politicians have somewhat dark skin, they in fact share the same goals and do not need to say so. When pressed a year after the aforementioned debate, Obama admitted he was against reparations for slavery. He can support giving $700 billion to corporate crooks and incompetents, but he cannot support reparations for slavery. Obviously, he knew he would still get 99 percent of the black vote.
African-Americans are like dogs at the park: If you fake throwing a Frisbee, they run away looking for the Frisbee you didn’t throw. When the dog comes back, you do it again—and the dog falls for it again, drooling. Blacks who swoon over Obama are akin to the blacks who dance to the song “Sweet Home Alabama.” They clearly haven’t listened to the words.
This is why the inauguration of Obama as the nation’s first half-white president was nothing to celebrate. One can only succeed as a black American—in politics or at your job—by submitting to majority authority and control. You can’t say you don’t want to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. You can’t suggest you were ever not proud of the country that murdered Indians with gifts infected by smallpox and that blew up little girls as they prayed.You certainly can’t speak the truth about racism, as Obama’s pastor, Jeremiah Wright, proved. 
Obama’s rival, Senator John McCain, all but called Obama a child molester, all but called Obama a traitor, and in response Obama called McCain a “hero.” Wright, on the other hand, praised Obama endlessly, officiated at Obama’s wedding, baptized his children, and gave him the title of his best-selling book. But he also made a few correct remarks about American racism, labeled too “controversial” to keep them from being discussed seriously. Instead of standing by his friend and supporter as the statesman Nelson Mandela would have done, new black politician Barack Obama assailed Wright without mercy. 
Obama’s election is exactly the wrong signal to send to America’s ebony youth: that, if you don’t raise any issues that make the majority uncomfortable, you, too, can become the president. We can only celebrate the election and inauguration of a black president when he can represent and articulate black interests, and not before.

In the first debate of the 2008 presidential campaign, Senator John McCain attacked then-Senator Barack Obama’s foreign policy platform of opening dialogue with America’s geopolitical adversaries. “Senator Obama,” he accused, “twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez, and Raul Castro without precondition.” Senator Obama emerged from this debate—and the entire campaign—victorious. But aside from the immediate political ramifications, McCain’s remark succeeded in making one thing clear: American policy toward Cuba is woefully out of date. In the transformative spirit of the 2008 election, President Obama should significantly revise our relationship with the reclusive island by lifting the embargo and re-establishing diplomatic relations.
For more than four decades, Cuba has been an international pariah of sorts. The reclusive dictatorship was expelled from the Organization of American States in 1962 at Washington’s request, and Cuban-American relations have been officially nonexistent for even longer. While this policy of economic and political isolation may have made sense during the Cold War—when the Soviet Union was actively supporting the Castro regime through military and economic aid—the policies currently in place are anachronistic and actually harmful to regional stability. Nor has the international community been silent in the condemnation of the status quo. Since 1992, the United Nations General Assembly has voted nearly unanimously—with the exception of the United States and Israel—for an end to the unilateral embargo and a normalizing of relations. 
In particular, the American embargo of Cuba has proven spectacularly unsuccessful in its stated goal: bringing down the Communist dictatorship. It has, however, succeeded in impoverishing the general population and placing the Cuban people in a state of cultural isolation, such that they have no opportunity to see the beneficial side of our mixed-market economic system and continually view the United States as a dangerous aggressor and a cause of their poverty. Today, many experts agree that ending the costly and counterproductive embargo would almost certainly contribute to an end to the Castro regime. Its continuation does little but galvanize support for Cuba’s outdated and undemocratic governmental system.
The United States has not budged on the Cuban embargo for several complex reasons. First, many Cuban refugees in the United States directly oppose any open gestures of amity toward their former oppressors. Second, many United States companies who possessed property in Cuba before the government seized and nationalized it during the early ’60s still stand strong in lobbying against an end to the embargo. While both of these admittedly powerful constituencies have legitimate grievances against the brutal Communist regime, the Cuban government has not and will not become more accommodating to their interests on a mere whim. Dropping the embargo would allow us to facilitate the change we hope for without holding ignorantly to egotistical positions that do nothing but broaden the rift.
Moreover, there is a strong geopolitical argument for dropping the embargo: the re-emergence of the Russian Federation as a global power. Russia’s prime minister, Vladimir Putin, has made restoring a close strategic relationship with Cuba a priority in Moscow. This alone should be more than enough evidence that the embargo is counterproductive. In 1962, the world watched with bated breath as Kennedy and Khrushchev faced off in the Caribbean, and many historians today recognize that the Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest that the world had ever come to nuclear holocaust. 
The increase of Russian influence in Cuba reached a new grade in mid-December when three Russian warships sailed into Havana’s harbor. This is the first time that the Russian navy has visited Cuba since the end of the Soviet era and represents a clear effort by the Russian Federation to flex its muscle in America’s neighborhood. Nor have Russian moves been limited to the Caribbean. The invasion of South Ossetia last summer and the Bush administration’s plan to construct a NATO-backed missile defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic are just two reminders of how tense Russo-American relations have become in the post-Soviet era. Instead of encouraging further tension in this relationship by fixating on the ideological character of the Castro regime, it is imperative that the United States defuse tensions in the Caribbean and limit the Kremlin’s opportunities to stir up trouble in our southern backyard. 
For once, there is an inclusive and internationally respected way for the United States to advance its foreign policy interests. Dropping the embargo will allow us to reincorporate Cuba into the inter-American community, reopen a dialogue with a government not more than 90 miles from United States coastline, and allow an influx of American culture and influence that is expected to bring social change to the Cuban people. As such, it would behoove the Obama administration to place the normalization of relations with Cuba high on its list of foreign-policy goals.

After six years serving as masters of Winthrop House, Stephen P. Rosen and Mandana Sassanfar announced plans to step down at the end of this academic year.
They informed the House community in an e-mail last Wednesday, citing personal reasons for the decision.
Though Winthrop residents said the announcement didn’t come unexpectedly—Rosen and Sassanfar have children, some of whom will soon be attending college—they said the Masters would be missed for their warmth and welcoming nature.
“To me, the most important thing about them: They’re just kind, normal people that you want to be around,” Caitlin v.V. Crump ’10 said.
In his e-mail, Rosen individually addressed sophomores, juniors, and seniors—a reflection of what Crump called Rosen and Sassanfar’s emphasis on House community.
The Masters serve food in their residence to undergraduates every Sunday, and they’ve attempted to get to know as many sophomores as they can, she said.
“People in the House like them because they do more than manage the House—they try to know and become friends with the students,” Stephen R. Barchick ’09 said.
Rosen, the Beton Michael Kaneb Professor of National Security and Military Affairs, is perhaps more widely known for his career accomplishments, which span academia and government.
He has advised national military organizations—serving as the Director of Political-Military Affairs in the National Security Council and participating in the Gulf War Air Power Survey—and has written numerous award-winning books, including Winning the Next War: Innovation and the Modern Military.
Sassanfar, who is an instructor of biology at MIT, has delved into science education throughout her career. She is the Director of High School Science Outreach at MIT, directs the Massachusetts Junior Academy of Science, and consulted with the Massachusetts Department of Education from 2000 to 2001.
But Rosen and Sassanfar aren’t just fixtures in academic settings. They both sit in on House Committee meetings, which are run by undergraduates, and provide input, often about raising funds for HoCo projects.
Barchick, the outgoing HoCo secretary, said the House community will miss Rosen and Sassanfar’s active participation in House life.
“I know they have a really difficult job, managing a lot of different things,” he said. “But they’ve been doing a good job for the past six years, and people have been really pleased.”
The Masters are also self-professed Strauss Cup aficionados. In fact, Rosen alluded to the intramural grand prize in his e-mail.
“[J]ust a warning: nobody graduates if we do not win the Strauss Cup (soon to be in the display case in the dining hall) again this year,” he wrote.
According to Crump, who was commissioned by the Masters to spend last summer making artwork for Winthrop, Rosen and Sassanfar have made an effort to place art throughout the House, especially when it is Winthrop-centric.
Rosen and Sassanfar’s departure announcement follows Pforzheimer House Masters Sue and James J. McCarthy’s in November.
And other House Masters may soon follow suit. In an interview last month, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said more might retire in the next few years. She also said she hopes to recruit minority members of the Faculty to fill vacated positions.
Neither Rosen nor Sassanfar could be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Frustrated by years of wrangling with city business restrictions and what he considers infringements of his First Amendment rights, Kenneth A. O’Brien—owner of the used bookstand on Mass. Ave between Linden and Holyoke Streets—said he plans to give away his entire inventory by April.
O’Brien, who said he has spent most of his life on the streets, recently found a home in Cambridgeport with his partner and pets. But the 55-year-old said slow business has made paying the rent difficult, and now he faces possible eviction from his home.
While O’Brien said “the streets of Harvard Square can actually be as comfy for me as indoors,” he wants to trade the bustling sidewalks of Cambridge for the tranquil wilderness of the Rockies.
“Living indoors actually hurts me physically,” the Cambridge native said.
The bookstand—officially named “Almost Banned in Harvard Square Booksellers”—is registered with the Harvard Square Business Association.
O’Brien said that if he cannot clear out his remaining 15,000 books in three months, he will have someone take them away.
WANDERLUST
After completing eighth grade, O’Brien left Cambridge to pursue the vagrant lifestyle popular among young people in the 1960s and 70s.
“It became addictive for me and I stayed on it,” he said.
O’Brien said that between hitchhiking and hopping freight trains, he has crisscrossed the country and held a variety of jobs.
“I left with 40 cents in my pocket and 80 pounds on my back, came back with a lot less weight and a lot more cash,” he said. “I learned how to walk into environments and survive.”
But O’Brien said that concern for his pets and his partner, Earlene French—whom he calls “Frenchie”—prompted him to return to Cambridge and establish a home off the streets.
“I’ve gone through a year of speed when I was a kid, drank really heavily for quite a while,” O’Brien said, “but I finally quit all the craziness because I got a dog.”
But he added that he was uncomfortable in the confines of a regular job and preferred self-employment.
“I’m psychologically incapable of working for anybody else anymore,” O’Brien said. “I have a tendency now to be overcritical of things, find ways of doing things better, ways of analyzing things down to the point where people get pissed off at me and tell me to screw.”
FIGHTING THE POWER
In June 2006, O’Brien started a bookstand with his friend Gary Kibler. Shortly thereafter, Kibler was arrested by Cambridge police for allegedly violating a city ordinance that outlined the regulations for selling merchandise on the street.
Kibler challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance, saying that the First Amendment protects his right to sell books.
The judge in the case, Jonathan Brant, dismissed the city’s complaint against Kibler because of insufficient evidence. 
Brant, however, ruled that while selling books is constitutionally protected, the city reserves the right to implement time, place, and manner restrictions, and identified a 50-cent peddler’s permit that would allow Kibler to continue his business. According to O’Brien, Kibler soon left the bookstand.
O’Brien said he tried to obtain this permit, but found himself mired in bureaucracy. When the city granted his request in Sept. 2006, the permit included restrictions that put him on MBTA property. 
In June 2008, MBTA officials asked him to move, but O’Brien said he refused to comply unless a federal judge ordered him to do so, as the city gave him permission to operate at that location.
“Unfortunately, sometimes the city will say one thing but the city’s not always right,” said City Councillor Craig A. Kelley, to whom O’Brien has voiced his concerns. “It may take a more vigorous challenge to figure out for sure that the city’s right.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she remembered O’Brien as a man of integrity who sought to gain credibility among local business owners.
Jillson said that when O’Brien first approached her about joining the association, she was reluctant to ask him to pay membership dues. But “he came back later with cash in hand and insisted I take his money,” Jillson said. 
She added that O’Brien has always paid his dues in full—even when he had to pay in installments—and was actively involved with the organization. 
“He attended the annual meeting, he asked thoughtful questions, he participated in our events and tried very hard to be a member in good standing,” Jillson said. 
O’Brien said he has been “in and out” of the city solicitor and manager’s offices this past fall, seeking a “legitimate” business certificate, but to no avail. 
In protest, O’Brien opened a second book stand in front of City Hall in December, hoping to publicize his plight. He handed out flyers stating, “I PUBLICLY ACCUSE THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE OF CONSPIRING TO DEPRIVE ME OF MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS!!!”
“I was hoping they would arrest me for not having a permit,” O’Brien said. “I came to the point that I realized, no matter what, I’m not going to be accepted in the business community, at least by [city] officials.”
Kelley said that he still does not understand O’Brien’s complaint and that he doesn’t recall O’Brien’s presence outside City Hall. 
“I don’t know what he wanted to do and I don’t know what he needed to do to get what he wanted,” Kelley said.
A DREAM DEFERRED
While the book stand was originally intended to be a means to support his family, O’Brien said he had hoped that the business could also give other homeless people an opportunity to become self-reliant.
“The basic plan behind that bookstand is still solid,” O’Brien said. “My business plan was in three years to have six tables and 15 to 20 low-income homeless people working there, spread throughout Cambridge and Boston.”
Jillson said that O’Brien serves the homeless of Harvard Square “in a very unique and powerful way,” often providing them with advice and referrals. O’Brien, who is known to buy coffee for acquaintances when business is good, even ordained himself as a minister online so that he could feed runaway teenagers without legal repercussions. 
But because of his conflicts with the city—which he says is treating him as a “second-class citizen”—he intends to shut down his business and panhandle for the summer.
“Why should I be part of a society that doesn’t want me?” O’Brien said. “I decided to stop being part of the solution and [start being] part of the problem.”
He added that soliciting in Harvard Square can actually be quite profitable. 
“A single adult male can make $50 to $100 a day,” O’Brien said, pointing out that Supplemental Security Income—government assistance for low-income and disabled individuals—only provides about $650 a month.
O’Brien said he never bothered to apply for this money before, as he was wary of becoming dependent on such aid.
But because he plans to close the bookstand, O’Brien said he will accept $9,000 worth of retroactive SSI checks to purchase supplies and rent a U-Haul for his journey. He said his knowledge of herbs, tinkering, and bartering will ensure that he will never have to panhandle again. 
In years past, O’Brien has offered free books during the holiday season, but always with the stated intention of reopening his stand for business in the spring. But this time, O’Brien said his decision to close shop was final.
“Homelessness is supposed to all be crazy drug addicts and unruly people,” O’Brien said. “I was trying to disprove that, but I didn’t.”

The exodus of top Harvard professors to the Obama administration continued last week with the announcement that Harvard Law School Professor Daniel J. Meltzer ’72 will depart for Washington to serve as principal deputy counsel to the president.
As a principal attorney at the White House, Meltzer is likely to tackle a slew of contentious legal issues facing the Obama administration—including the widely anticipated reversal of controversial Bush administration war-time policies.
“He’s a first-rate scholar on a whole range of issues involving the federal judiciary as well as habeas corpus—everything ranging from torture to Guantanamo,” said HLS Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62.
The White House Counsel’s Office advises the president on issues including constraints of executive power, judicial appointments, and adherence to federal ethics and disclosure laws. Under President Bush, the office was widely criticized for allegedly rubber-stamping presidential action and failing in its advisory capacity.
“I’m afraid the Office of White House Council during the Bush administration was unconcerned about laws,” Tribe said. 
During the campaign, President Obama pledged to make uses of executive authority more transparent and to revise some of these controversial policies and their legal justifications. 
Meltzer co-authored an article with Law School Professor Richard H. Fallon in 2007 which asserted that, contrary to Bush-era legal doctrine, civilians held in the United States or Guantanamo Bay as enemy combatants have the right to challenge their detainment in a civilian court.
Meltzer is at least the seventh Harvard professor to decamp Cambridge for Washington and the third Law School professor to leave for the capitol. Kennedy School Professor Joseph S. Nye is rumored to be Obama’s choice for ambassador to Japan.
Meltzer could not be reached for comment yesterday.

Obama for America Campaign Manager David Plouffe, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, and former Pennsylvania Governor and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge are among those who will serve as fellows at Harvard’s Institute of Politics this spring, the IOP announced Friday.“What’s most exciting about this year is the breadth and diversity of the people who will be here on campus,” said IOP Director Bill Purcell. “This group really covers a very broad territory in our political experience and our political future.”Plouffe, Chao, Ridge, and Washington Post columnist Eugene H. Robinson will join the IOP as visiting fellows, spending a few weeks each on campus throughout the spring.Five resident fellows have also been chosen for semester-long appointments to lead weekly, study groups in the spring.“The belief from the beginning was that the ability to learn from practitioners of politics would be important to undergraduates,” Purcell said. “It has always been separate from the normal academic offerings at Harvard.”The fellowship program began in 1966 and has brought numerous politicians, journalists, and public servants through the doors of the IOP. Fellows are chosen by IOP staff in conjunction with a student advisory committee, which takes the lead in developing a list of possible fellows, Purcell said.Rose B. Styron—a poet, journalist, and activist who will be a resident fellow—said she was both excited and nervous to be the first poet fellow. Her study group will focus on the interaction of the artist with the political sphere.“I think they’re taking a big risk,” she said. “It will be fun for me, but I am not a politician. They were looking for something different, and they’re going to get it!”Howard Zucker, who has held positions at the World Health Organization and the Department of Health and Human Services, expressed excitement for his upcoming fellowship.He said he will draw on his globe-trotting experience with the WHO in his study group, which will focus on improving U.S. foreign policy using health diplomacy.“This is a great forum for discussion, dialogue, and exchange of ideas,” Zucker said. “It is such a wonderful change to hear the perspectives of so many individuals. I am just ecstatic about it.”The other resident fellows will include Tina Flournoy, assistant to the president for public policy at the American Federation of Teachers and former co-chair of the Democratic National Committee’s rules and bylaws committee. Jim Ramstad, a former Minnesota Congressman who has been mentioned as a possible choice to head the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and Teresa Vilmain, a political organizer and consultant, have also been selected.—Staff writer Evan T.

Convenience store and newsstand operator Muckey’s Corp. signed a lease to take over Out of Town News earlier this week, rescuing the iconic Harvard Square kiosk from an uncertain future.
The decades-old newsstand stocking domestic and international publications was rumored to be closing this month, after its former operator Hudson News did not renew its lease, citing diminished demand for print news.
The looming threat of vacancy prompted the City of Cambridge, which owns the 450-square-foot property, to temporarily extend Hudson’s lease at a reduced price while it solicited bids for long-term occupancy. 
Muckey’s bid of $140 a square foot earlier this month beat out those of three other prospective owners, including Unofficial Tours LLC, which was founded by Harvard students; Canada-based Gateway Newsstands; and Kallol Barua, the current general manager of the building. Unofficial Tours had the runner-up offer at $136 per square foot.
According to Cambridge purchasing agent Cynthia H. Griffin, Muckey’s—which runs newsstands under the name Patriot News Inc.—will continue to operate the space as a newsstand.
The city’s call for bidders specifically required that the space remain a newsstand, Griffin said.
Though most bidders’ proposals involved little change to how the kiosk currently operates, Unofficial Tours had a different vision. President Daniel Andrew ’07 said their plan was to transform the space into a conceptual “concierge desk for Harvard Square,” providing tour tickets, maps, restaurant menus, and other resources for tourists. 
Currently, Unofficial Tours has a permit with the City of Cambridge to maintain its signs outside the kiosk. 
Had their bid been successful, they would have retained half the space as a newsstand and changed the other half into a souvenir shop whose sales would have made up the bulk of their revenue.
Griffin said Muckey’s lease lasts for five years, with an additional five-year term at the discretion of the city. Muckey’s did not return a request for comment for this article.
According to Andrew, Unofficial Tours, which uses the space as the start for its student-led tours, is already planning to work closely with Patriot News.
“It’s important to us that that stand is run well and popular since it brings us business,” Andrew said. “I hope to work with the new owners to make that space vibrant and relevant.”
The last time the newsstand changed hands was in 1994, when its owner and founder Sheldon Cohen sold the kiosk to Hudson News in the face of financial troubles.
The building was constructed in 1928 as a shelter for the Harvard Square stop of the Boston Elevated Railway and is on the national register of historic buildings.

The Cambridge Public Schools Committee worked towards resolving a $4 million budget deficit projected for the next fiscal year yesterday, continuing a process that may ultimately necessitate both expense cuts and restructured programs.
Although the committee has been able to resolve budget shortfalls in recent years without cutting school-based expenses, many members indicated that the current economic crisis may make this year an exception.
“These are sobering times,” said Nancy Tauber, co-chair of the budget sub-committee.
A 1.98 percent growth in revenue for the next fiscal year is projected to lag far behind a 4.98 percent increase in expenditures that has been largely attributed to factors such as the high cost of staff health care and increased student enrollment.
But despite the discrepancy, Deputy Superintendent Carolyn L. Turk said that the grim economic situation could be an opportunity for the district to improve not only the cost-effectiveness of its education programs, but also their quality. 
No areas have been targeted for fiscal overhaul yet, but some suggestions included reorganizing professional development, deferring school maintenance, and charging fees for student programs and transportation. Turk said that any decisions made would be in the best interests of students.
In meetings over the last four weeks Turk asked district officials, faculty members, and school committee members to brainstorm a list of areas where expenses could be reduced or reallocated.
The committee held a public hearing last night in an effort to include the community in the budget decision-making process.
“It will be really important to keep people informed, because it’s through collective thinking that we can move forward in a positive way,” Turk said.
Public input has been varied, but budget sub-committee co-chair Luc D. Schuster, said that most people tend to ask for more funding, rather than less, making cuts difficult.
“It’s much more common to hear about things they want,” Schuster said. “It’s much less common to have people advocating for something they want cut.”
Despite this year’s budgetary shortfall, committee member Alfred B. Fantini said the committee has faced tougher budget situations in the past. 
In 2002, budget shortfalls prompted the district to close, combine, or move a number of schools.
“This is a budget deficit and we need to take it seriously but it doesn’t come close to what it was [in 2002],” Fantini said.

Massachusetts lawmakers may soon consider a bill that would revise outdated investment guidelines for charities and endowments, giving institutions like Harvard greater flexibility to manage funds that the current economic climate would otherwise put off-limits. 
Known as the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, the legislation would aid universities by eliminating the “historic dollar value” rule currently in effect in Massachusetts. The rule, a product of legislation dating from the 1970s, prevents institutions from spending from a particular endowment fund if its value falls “underwater”—below levels pegged to a specific point in time, such as the donor’s date of death. 
University spokesman John Longbrake was slow to acknowledge the problem that such “underwater funds” may pose as the current financial crisis brings unprecedented losses to the University’s endowment, saying only that it was “probable that [Harvard] will see underwater [endowment] funds” in the current fiscal climate.  
But Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith spoke explicitly of the problem presented by underwater funds at a November 18 faculty meeting, and University budget officials have been drawing up budgets for the coming year with these limitations in mind.  
While UPMIFA would not allow affected institutions to spend freely from underwater funds, it would offer some breathing room—giving a place like Harvard “more flexibility to spend money for its core purposes,” according to Michael R. Kerr, legislative director for the Uniform Law Commission, which drafted UPMIFA.
The legislation, introduced in 2006 and now approved in 25 states, is likely to be presented to the Massachusetts legislature early this year, according to Kerr. 
“We’ve been getting an awful lot of inquiries about [UPMIFA], and we’re going to be talking about it to the folks on the ground there,” Kerr said. “There’s a reasonable chance that we’re going to run it this session.”
The current economic downturn has put several funds at risk of going “underwater,” and therefore helped provide an impetus to pass UPMIFA, Kerr said.   
The Uniform Law Commission held a meeting in 2008 with officials from various universities to discuss the legislation, according to Kerr. Kerr said officials from several area schools including Emerson, Tufts, Boston College, and Harvard expressed interest in receiving materials and additional information, but he was unsure if they attended the conference in person. In interviews with The Crimson, Harvard officials have not acknowledged any familiarity with the legislation.
UPMIFA was originally drafted following the collapse of the “dot-com bubble” in the early 2000s, Kerr said. Newly wealthy individuals transferred funds to foundations, only to see the value of these gifts plummet with the stock market—thereby rendering them unusable. The current economic crisis is in some ways a “repeat of the doc-com bust, but more widely spread,” Kerr said.
“There are an awful lot of community organizations, non-profits, endowments, that very much want to keep going at their mission, even though stock market reversals in the past year may have left funds near or under historic dollar value,” Kerr said. “This is one of the pressures out there to see UPMIFA widely adopted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner John H. Updike ’54, who showed early signs of his writing prowess while walking the halls of Harvard’s English department, died yesterday of lung cancer at the age of 76.
Updike is known for authoring more than 50 books over the course of his decades-long career, winning two Pulitzers for his works “Rabbit is Rich” and “Rabbit at Rest.” He spent more than two decades at The New Yorker and was also noted for his poetry and short stories.
“One of the things that is inspiring to writers is that he just never stopped writing,” said English Professor Louis Menand, an expert on American literature penned during the Cold War. “He wrote a book every year.”
Updike served an eventful term as President of The Harvard Lampoon in 1953—kidnapping the president of The Harvard Crimson and orchestrating a close save of The Lampoon’s famed ibis statue. A noted perfectionist, he graduated summa cum laude the following year with a degree in English, before going on to a fellowship at Oxford and a job at The New Yorker. 
AN ‘UNTROUBLED’ WRITER
Although Updike first arrived at Harvard hoping to become a cartoonist, he showed early promise as a writer.
Lewis L. B. Gifford ’51, who worked with Updike on The Lampoon, said that Updike once showed him a bound volume of his early writings in his Hollis dorm room. The work had been typed by Updike’s mother, herself an aspiring writer who worked in a department store.
“It was like a premonition that he wasn’t fooling around: nor was his mother,” Gifford said.
Michael J. Arlen ’52 met Updike when he arrived at The Lampoon as a freshman with stack of clippings from his high school newspaper tucked under his arm.
“He was one of those untroubled writers,” Arlen said of his younger colleague. Books, he recalled, came to Updike as effortlessly as dreams.
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
Many of Updike’s friends on The Lampoon came from wealthier backgrounds, but that did not stop the young writer—who grew up in Reading, Pa. and attended a small-town public school—from rising to the helm of the nationally-known humor magazine in 1953. 
The writer’s humble background became a factor later, when the Signet Society—Harvard’s social club of arts and letters—almost did not accept Updike into their cloistered circle. Then-Crimson President Michael Maccoby ’54 nominated Updike for inclusion in the Signet, but Updike was not able to pay the membership fee.
“I said to them, ‘Let me just tell you something: if you don’t let John Updike into the Signet Society, you’re going to regret it for the rest of your lives,’” Maccoby said yesterday.
According to Maccoby, the Signet Society then waived all of Updike’s fees.
CAMPUS PRANK
Updike’s playful side will forever be memorialized in one 1953 incident that pit The Crimson and The Lampoon against one another.
As Maccoby was walking back to Lowell House for lunch, Updike and three co-conspirators from The Lampoon burst out of a nearby building, grabbed him, and pushed him into a car, according to Maccoby. 
“I assume he orchestrated the whole thing,” Maccoby said of Updike, who was leading The Lampoon at the time. “He took credit for it.”
The kidnapping was an act of retaliation against The Crimson’s earlier theft of the iconic golden ibis figure from atop The Lampoon’s castle-like headquarters. But The Crimson maintained the upper hand.
Having escaped his captors, Maccoby and then-Managing Editor George S. Abrams ’54 went to the Russian Embassy in New York City to present the ibis as a sign of goodwill on behalf of American students. 
According to Maccoby, the Russians accepted the gift. It was crated up on the harbor—ready to be placed on a ship— when one of Updike’s minions from The Lampoon arrived to take it back to Mt. Auburn Street.
Media coverage of the spectacle reached all the way to The New York Times under the headline, “Harvard Crimson’s Gift to Reds Ends Up as Campus Prank.”
‘THE WAY THINGS REALLY ARE’
Despite the kidnapping incident, Updike and Maccoby felt “mutual respect” for each other, according to Maccoby.
“I said that this whole Lampoon was worthless except for one person, and that was John Updike,” he said, recalling a review of the humor magazine that he penned in 1952.
Rather than relish the praise, according to Maccoby, Updike walked to The Crimson to tell Maccoby that he had caused a “big problem” with Updike’s colleagues on The Lampoon, who were suspicious of what they thought was becoming “a special relationship” between the two eventual leaders.
Hijinks aside, Updike, who was producing much of The Lampoon’s content while maintaining an exemplary academic record—he was one of only eight in his class to be inducted to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior—was not at leisure to have a highly active social life.
“John certainly wasn’t a recluse,” said former Lampoon writer Eric B. Wentworth ’54, “but he wasn’t a highly gregarious guy.” He didn’t have time to devote to politics or parties, according to Wentworth, who lived in Lowell House with Updike.
Updike remained a busy man until his death, In a profile of Updike for his graduating class’s 50th reunion, The Crimson reported that as of 2004, the author tried to write three pages daily. Updike managed to publish “The Widows of Eastwick” in 2008.
While Updike excelled in a number of different genres, Menand said that he especially admired Updike’s short stories, which he said he would place at the level of Hemingway’s and James Joyce’s.
“The story’s like a mousetrap,” he said. “You leave the cheese, and suddenly: Boom! Something happens.”
“Joyce called it an epiphany: this moment in a short story where you suddenly see the story in a different way—the way things really are,” Menand added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Authorities have confirmed that the white powder sent to the office of Harvard Law Professor Alan M. Dershowitz in Hauser Hall last Wednesday tested negative for hazardous material, according to his assistant Sarah Neely, who had opened the envelope.
The substance’s identity? Starch.
Early tests had shown that the powder was negative for anthrax and other hazardous material, but authorities were not able to confirm the powder’s chemical makeup for another few days, when final lab results came in, Neely said.
Thirteen envelopes containing a similar white powder were received at the Wall Street Journal’s headquarters in New York that day. All the envelopes bore a postmark from Knoxville, Tenn.
The Journal had published an opinion piece on Jan. 2 in which Dershowitz, who is one of Israel’s most prominent defenders, supported Israel’s military actions in Gaza.
Neely said that FBI officials interviewed her Friday to determine what might have prompted the incident.
“This was the only connection we could think of,” Neely said.
Dershowitz receives hate mail on a daily basis, and his office is the only one at the Law School with bulletproof windows, Neely added.
The envelope Neely split open had “Alan” scrawled on the flap and contained a blank thank-you note, Neely said.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Knoxville is currently leading the investigation to determine who sent the powder and why, FBI spokeswoman Gail A. Marcinkiewicz said.
“We take very seriously these ‘hoax-threats,’” Marcinkiewicz said, adding that the person who sent the envelopes would likely face criminal charges if apprehended.
According to the U.S. Attorney General's office in Knoxville, the penalty for sending hoax-like threats is 5 years in prison accompanied by a fine. If the threat caused injury, this could be extended to 20 years. And if death resulted, the it could result in a life sentence. As a precaution, Dean for Administration Francis X. McCrossan requested in an e-mail sent to the Law School community last Wednesday that “anyone intending to study or conduct business in Hauser not do so until further notice.”
Classes held in the building for the day were also rescheduled. 
A second e-mail later that evening notified the Law School that law enforcement authorities had cleared the building for re-entry the next day at 7 a.m.
The Law School and Dershowitz’ office did not take further security precautions, Neely said.
