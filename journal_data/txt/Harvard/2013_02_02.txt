After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale student Brendan Ross, the driver of a U-Haul truck that killed one woman and injured two others at the 2011 Harvard-Yale Game tailgate, was granted a form of probation Friday that allows him to avoid a criminal record.
 
The program, known as accelerated rehabilitation, allows charges against first-time offenders to be dismissed if they complete probation without incident. During his probation, Ross must complete 400 hours of community service.
 
The court's decision was the result of an agreement struck between all groups involved in the trial. 
 
“It was a result of cooperation and collaboration of all interested parties," said Ross’s attorney William F. Dow III.
This past April, Sarah Short, one of the women injured in the crash and a student at the Yale School of Management, filed a suit in the New Haven Superior Court against Ross and U-Haul for at least $15,000 worth of damages caused by the incident.
In May, Ross was initially arrested and charged with reckless driving and negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, a misdemeanor charge carrying a possible punishment of up to six months in jail. He turned himself in to New Haven police after finishing his last exam of the spring semester of his junior year.
But the prosecution agreed to lower the charges against Ross to reckless driving and reckless endangerment, making him eligible for the accelerated rehabilitation program.
Dow said that throughout the legal process, he was impressed by both Ross’s integrity and the understanding of the family of Nancy Barry, the 30-year-old Salem, Mass., resident who was killed in the accident.
“It’s one of those things where the level of decency of the defendant is matched by the forgiveness and decency of the family. There was complete synchronization of values. It’s just so refreshing to see that,” Dow said.
On Nov. 19, 2011, Ross was driving a U-Haul carrying beer kegs to his fraternity’s tailgate party when the accident occurred. Witnesses said at the time that the truck unexpectedly sped up as it turned into a pedestrian-heavy area of the tailgate. The crash killed Barry and injured Short and one other woman.
Ross tested clean in a sobriety test issued immediately following the accident. Even so, Yale has since tightened its restrictions on drinking before the annual Game, requiring that tailgates shut down by kickoff and banning U-Hauls and kegs from the student section of the tailgate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Kyle Juszczyk may have made his mark for the Crimson as Harvard’s all-time leader in receptions (125), receiving yards (1,576), and touchdowns (22) for a tight end, but he is catching NFL scouts’ eye at a different position—fullback.
Interest in the two-time All-American is growing after a compelling performance at the Senior Bowl, an annual showcase for the nation’s top draft prospects, last week in Mobile, A.L. ESPN expert Mel Kiper Jr. was impressed enough to list Juszczyk as his fifth-best fullback prospect for April’s NFL Draft.
Juszczyk is projected to be a 5th to 7th round pick. If he is not drafted, he is expected to make his way as an undrafted free agent. The three-time All-Ivy League tight end hopes to join fellow Crimson alums Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, Matt Birk ’98, and Desmond Bryant ’09 in the pros.
Juszczyk, listed at 6’3”, is considered by many scouts to be too short to play tight end in the NFL, but is well suited to transition to the fullback or halfback position. Although Juszczyk faces the dual challenges of learning a new position and facing off against a higher level of competition throughout the draft process, scouts remain interested. They believe that his physicality and toughness when blocking are skills that will translate well to the next level. Further, he has prior experience running the ball, as he led his high school team in both rushing and receiving during his senior season at Cloverleaf High School in Medina, Ohio.
For now, Juszczyk will wait to see if his Senior Bowl performance was enough to earn him an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine in February, where he can further his case to impress teams and earn a shot at being drafted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Another typical night in the Ivy League,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said with a smile.
Less than a week after battling back from a 10-point deficit with 90 seconds remaining to grab an overtime victory over Dartmouth, the Crimson nearly turned in an epic collapse of its own.
Hosting Yale on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard saw its 13-point second-half lead cut to three with under a minute remaining.
But unlike Dartmouth, the Crimson managed to hold on in the final seconds, topping the Bulldogs, 67-64.
“This conference has always been that way,” Amaker said. “Hard-fought all the way.”
With the win, the Crimson improved to 3-0 in the Ivy League, leaving Harvard and Princeton the only two undefeated teams in the conference.
But the Crimson was only a few possessions away from suffering its first conference loss of the season.
With 19 seconds remaining, Yale’s Armani Cotton capitalized on a Siyani Chambers’ turnover, finishing a layup to pull the visitors within three.
The Crimson then inbounded the ball to sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi who was fouled and sent to the line with 18 seconds left. Moundou-Missi, who missed all four of his free-throw attempts earlier in the contest, stuck both shots to put Harvard back up by five.
Following a Michael Grace jump shot on the other end, Yale’s Matt Townsend pulled down an offensive rebound and was fouled going back up with six seconds remaining.
Townsend knocked down both free throws to cut Harvard’s lead back down to three.
Following Townsend’s second make, the Crimson set up in its press break. But before Harvard could successfully inbound the ball, co-captain Christian Webster was whistled for an offensive foul, returning the ball to the Bulldogs with six seconds remaining and a chance to even the score.
But on the ensuing inbounds play, the Bulldogs missed a wide-open Greg Kelley on the perimeter and Townsend missed a contested layup. Chambers came up with the ball and was sent to the line where he iced the game with two free throws.
In the win, sophomore wing Wesley Saunders recorded his first career double-double, posting a game-high 15 points and 11 assists.
“I think Wesley is the best all-around player in our league,” Amaker said. “I know I’m biased, but there’s nothing he can’t do. He handles the ball, he rebounds it, he’s big, he’s strong, he scores, and he’s our best perimeter defender. We rely on him so much that it’s amazing, and I’m so happy to see how he’s been able to come through for us in so many different categories.”
Saunders also got it done on the defensive end, holding the Bulldogs’ Austin Morgan to nine points on two-of-five shooting from the field.
“We had a point of emphasis [on Morgan], and we really focused on it and maybe focused on it so hard that Cotton was turned loose a little bit,” Amaker said. “But no question about it, we have to do a good job on Morgan, especially outside the three point line."
Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard matched Saunders with 15 points. Coming off a one-of-seven shooting performance against Dartmouth, Rivard knocked down five of seven attempts from beyond the arc.
Moundou-Missi and Chambers also scored in double-figures, posting 12 and 11 points, respectively.
Chambers, who entered the contest averaging 37.7 minutes per game, was forced to sit for more than 10 minutes in the second half due to foul trouble.
The Crimson—which led 50-40 when Chambers went to the bench—struggled with its starting point guard off the court. Harvard posted just nine points during the stretch, allowing the Bulldogs to pull within single digits.
“[Chambers] is a floor general out there,” Saunders said. “He’s the one that makes everyone go, so when he’s not out there, it’s a big blow.”
But Harvard held on, earning its fourth straight win over the Bulldogs at Lavietes Pavilion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team had nine minutes with the man advantage to address its power play woes. RPI had other plans.
The Engineers (9-11-5; 4-6-3 ECAC) allowed the Crimson (5-14-1; 3-12-0 ECAC) power play unit only a single shot on net as RPI stifled the visitors, 3-0, in Troy, N.Y., Friday night.
Officials issued a game misconduct to Johnny Rogic and five-minute major to RPI after the sophomore Engineer forward sent Alex Fallstrom to the ice with a hit from behind. Fallstrom was able to reach the bench on his own power but left the rink, limping, three minutes later.
Harvard failed to establish an offensive presence during the resulting power play. The Crimson registered zero shots on goal while the RPI penalty kill managed to put the puck on Girard.
At full strength, the Engineers went on the attack, outshooting Harvard, 12-3, in the first frame. With just over a minute left in the period, a shot from Mark Miller found its way past a dense four-player screen to give RPI its first goal of the night.
Early in the second period, the Crimson saw its best offensive chance of the game during its second power play of the game. Freshman forward Jimmy Veesey got a clean look from just outside of the crease, but his shot bounced harmlessly off the inside of the post.
A hooking minor on Harvard forward Luke Greiner canceled the remaining 14 seconds of the Crimson’s second power play. Twelve seconds into RPI’s man-advantage, freshman forward Mike Zalewski provided the Engineers an insurance marker with a wrap-around goal.
RPI continued to frustrate the Harvard attack through the third, allowing Harvard only two shots on goal during the final 20 minutes. Less than three minutes into the period, Miller recorded his second goal of the night from the top of the crease as he deflected an outside slapper from teammate Nick Bailen.
Harvard failed to convert on a third power play opportunity midway through the final frame as the Crimson fell to 4-for-63 in conference play with the man advantage. Freshman Engineer goaltender Jason Kasdorf cruised to his first career shutout as RPI finished the night outshooting Harvard, 23-11.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle led the Crimson (11-6, 2-1 Ivy) to a 67-54 win over Yale (6-11, 1-2 Ivy), registering a career-high 20 points in New Haven on Friday. The game was Harvard’s first conference road trip of the season.
After Harvard took an early lead, the Bulldogs looked to lessen the deficit heading into the second half, but the Crimson caught another quick wind and ended the game with a 43.8 team shooting percentage. The Yale offense consistently failed to find the basket throughout the match, going 20-72. By the end of the first frame, the Bulldogs put up a low 19.4 shooting percentage.
“We’ve been working really hard,” junior center Elise Gordon said. “We’ve been working on our different defenses, so the fact that we have such a variety of defenses that we can use makes [our opponents] have to counteract, which is definitely to our advantage.”
Fagbenle and Gordon pressured Yale early on in the first frame, scoring several combined points in the paint after the starting tipoff. Harvard held a double-digit lead for the majority of the period and led the Bulldogs at halftime, 32-20.
“Temi is a great player,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “She’s awesome to play with and I think [at] Yale having 20 points as her career high is a great building block for her, and I think that’s going to motivate her during the rest of the Ivy League games.”
The second period brought tighter competition, with Yale closing the gap to three points in the final 14 minutes. The Crimson defense buckled down and finished the game with a team season-high of 50 rebounds.
“We had a couple of games where we haven’t been able to overcome adversity, and what we really wanted to focus on was possession-by-possession and basically just converting to offense,” Gordon said. “We would make goals for ourselves and just be one play ahead.
Fagbenle chipped in nine rebounds and a steal of her own, while co-captain forward Miriam Rutzen and junior guard Christine Clark had a combined rebound total of 14, registering seven apiece.
“I think Yale especially was a really good team effort,” Curtis said. “I thought during Yale we did a good job of defending the following side against the post. They were playing pretty tough on our guards.”
The Harvard bench showed out with a total of 24 points, while Yale’s bench only registered eight. Rutzen, Curtis, and junior forward Missy Mullens tallied two assists each for the Crimson.
“Our team has so many weapons,” said Gordon. “We’ve got a really deep bench.”
Despite a Bulldogs rally in the second half, exceeding their first-period point total by 14, the Crimson headed to the locker room with a comfortable lead. Harvard held off the Yale second-period run that defeated the Crimson during the 2011-2012 season.
“We kept padding it inside, getting inside-out looks and I think Elise executed really well on a lot of those, as well as a lot of other players that came off the bench and really contributed to the team effort,” Curtis said.
After Fagbenle, Gordon registered the highest number of points at ten, while Curtis and senior guard Elle Hagedorn chipped in nine and eight points, respectively.
Fagbenle recently received her sixth Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor this week. The sophomore has racked in a total of eight Ancient Eight awards on the season. The forward also registered nine rebounds, one assist, one block, and one steal in under 22 minutes.
Yale’s final 27.8 shooting percentage marked the lowest of a Harvard opponent since the Crimson played against TCU in early January. The bulldogs never led Harvard by more than three points during the matchup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This time, there was no need for another dramatic comeback for the Harvard men’s basketball team. Instead, the focus was on staving one off.
Six days after storming back from down 10 with 94 seconds to go to tie and eventually beat Dartmouth in overtime, Harvard found itself on the opposite end of a similar situation Friday night against Yale.
Up seven with 50 seconds remaining, the Crimson turned it over three times before the final buzzer, allowing the Bulldogs to make a late run.
With six seconds left in the contest, co-captain Christian Webster was called for an off-ball foul as Harvard attempted to make an inbounds pass, giving Yale possession with the chance to tie. But Matt Townsend passed up a wide-open Greg Kelley behind the arc and instead chose to attempt a layup, which he missed.
“I understand the strategy to try to get a quick two,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I wouldn’t say that was a bad strategy [Friday night].”
After Harvard grabbed the rebound, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers calmly sunk his ensuing two free throws, and Harvard hung on for a 67-64 win.
But it was not one that came without suspense, continuing what has become a heart wrenching trend for the Crimson. Six of Harvard’s last nine games have been decided by seven points or fewer.
“We weren’t very disciplined, I thought, in the second half defensively, and you give a lot of credit to Yale,” Amaker said. “Obviously we did what we needed to do to finish [the game] with a W, but certainly we need to play better in stretches to give us the chance to not give up the kind of lead we had.”
MARCH OF DIMES
All season long, sophomore wing Wesley Saunders has scored consistently and often prodigiously, leading the conference with 16.2 points per game.
On Friday night, Saunders neared that average by pouring in 15 points. But the sophomore also did something to which he was not so accustomed—rack up assists.
Saunders entered the contest averaging 3.5 helpers per contest, with a season high of six. But against the Bulldogs, the wing was able to find the open man time and time again, registering a career-high 11 assists.
“I [knew] I had a lot, [but] I didn’t know I had 11,” Saunders said. “I just [went] out there and showed everybody I could pass the ball.”
Combined with his point total, that number gave Saunders his first collegiate double-double.
“The 11 assists is incredible,” Amaker said. “I think Wesley is the best all-around player in our league.... There’s nothing he can’t do. He handles the ball, he rebounds it, he’s big, he’s strong, he scores, and he’s our best perimeter defender. We rely on him so much that it’s amazing and I’m so happy to see that he’s been able to come through for us in so many different [statistical] categories.”
Saunders’ passing was especially vital Friday, as Chambers, the league’s assist leader, faced foul trouble and played a season-low 28 minutes.
Right after the point guard was forced to leave the game after picking up his fourth foul with 13:46 left, Saunders took over the facilitation of the offense. The sophomore quickly accumulated back-to-back assists by setting up sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi for a pretty reverse layup and then finding classmate Kenyatta Smith off an inbounds.
“[My teammates] were just making shots,” Saunders said. “Laurent knocked down a three, and Steve and [sophomore] Jonah [Travis] did a great job cutting to the basket when I was driving, so I think it all just worked out.”
BACK ON TRACK
After struggling from long range against the Big Green, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard rebounded Friday night by shooting five-for-seven from behind the arc for a total of 15 points.
The wing, who ranks fifth in the conference with a 43.8 three-point percentage, went just one-for-seven on long distance attempts against Dartmouth. But on Friday, Rivard helped spark the Crimson to a 15-point halftime lead—and ignite a student section that after every basket chanted “Agent Zero,” in reference to his jersey number—by hitting three of his four first-half shots from behind the arc.
After the Bulldogs began the game on a 10-2 spurt, Rivard answered with a long ball that begin what would turn into a 38-17 run for Harvard over the rest of the half.
“It was great to see him make some big threes,” Amaker said. “We needed every one of them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The victories just won’t come easily for the Harvard men’s basketball team. But no matter how difficult the Crimson continues to make things for itself, Harvard continues to win.
In a double-overtime thriller at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson (12-6, 4-0 Ivy) remained undefeated in Ancient Eight play by knocking off Brown, 89-82.
Just like its last two contests in its home arena, the triumph did not come without a great deal of nail biting for its fans, who witnessed Harvard blow a 22-point second-half advantage before eventually escaping with the victory.
“I wish we would’ve been able to hold the lead and not have all the drama associated with this, but [it was] certainly a sensational basketball game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We’re very fortunate and pleased to have won.”
After the Crimson went up, 63-41, with 12:58 to go, it looked well on its way to its first easy conference win of the season. But the Bears (8-10, 2-2) slowly rallied back from there, and Sean McGonagill hit a jumper at the buzzer to force overtime after Brown outscored Harvard, 28-6, down the stretch.
Co-captain Christian Webster’s left wing three-pointer put Harvard up three with 38 seconds remaining in the first overtime, but Brown’s Stephen Albrecht answered back with a long ball of his own 18 seconds later to tie the game at 78. Sophomore wing Wesley Saunders' reverse layup rimmed out at the overtime buzzer, and the teams went to a second set of extra time from there.
In the second overtime period, Saunders put the Crimson up six, 88-82, with an and-one layup, and the Bears could not rally back for the third time as Harvard held on for the win.
Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers posted his second career double-double in the victory, registering 17 points, 10 assists, and six rebounds. Saunders led the Crimson with 18 points, while Webster and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard both added 16.
“I gave our team so much praise in the locker room after the game to have the toughness, the poise, and the confidence after losing the lead like that,” Amaker said.
After Chambers’ 14 points led the Crimson to a 49-36 lead at the break—its most points scored in a first half this year—Harvard expanded its advantage to 22 at the beginning of the second. But it quickly witnessed its lead shrink to eight during a five-minute scoreless stretch midway through the half until Saunders finally ended the scoring drought with a steal and transition dunk at the 7:01 mark.
“It’s just a trend for us—in the second half, for some reason, we  come out slow,” sophomore wing Wesley Saunders said. “I think it might  be because our bench is on the other side of the court, so our defensive  intensity might not be as [strong]. It’s something we need to work on.”
Brown continued to chip away at the advantage and got within five on a layup by Cedric Kuakumensah, who beat Rivard off an inbounds with 1:04 remaining.
“I think we got complacent,” Webster said. “I think our defense was lacking…. That’s been something that’s been happening the last few games and that’s something we’ve got to fix.”
The Crimson committed a shot clock violation on its next possession, and Kuakumensah hit two free throws at the other end.
Rivard, fouled after the ensuing inbounds, hit one of his two free throws, but McGonagill banked in a long three from the top of the key to cut the deficit to two, 69-67, with 13.1 seconds to go.
On the ensuing inbounds pass, Albrecht stole the ball from Rivard and passed to Joe Sharkey, who missed a jumper that was rebounded by McGonagill. The guard brought the ball back around the arc and swished a long jumper of his own just before the buzzer sounded.
“There was a look and a tone in our players of being stunned, and  rightly so, the way Brown played,” Amaker said. “You give them an  enormous amount of credit. Those kids were sensational tonight.”
After shooting 3-for-11 from long distance to that point, Rivard hit a three from the right corner to begin the extra time. But Brown's Matthew Sullivan answered with a three of his own.
After Saunders hit a one-legged jumper in the lane to put Harvard back up three, Moundou-Missi went to the line with 1:19 remaining and the chance to make it a two-possession game. But the forward missed both free throws, and Tucker Halperin hit a long three over him at the other end to tie things up again.
With 38 seconds remaining, Saunders penetrated and kicked out to Webster, who drilled a long ball from the left wing. But Albrecht answered right back, and Saunders’ reverse layup rimmed out at the buzzer, sending the game into another extra frame.
“I knew it wasn’t going in after I let go of it,” Saunders said.
Webster drilled another left wing three to begin the second overtime. The teams went back-and-forth until there were 42 seconds remaining, when Chambers found Saunders backdoor for an and-one layup that put Harvard up six.
“That’s just one of the reads we have off that play,” Saunders said. “We usually like to spread the floor out and Siyani just makes the play. He made a great pass and was able to find me.”
Halperin missed a three at the other end, and Chambers hit one of two free throws to ice the victory and keep Harvard in first place in the Ancient Eight.
“I thought the game should have been over a while ago, but we showed a lot of toughness to win that game when they had all the momentum leaving regulation,” Webster said.
