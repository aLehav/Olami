After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wendy H. Chang ’12, an English concentrator and resident of Lowell House, died Saturday, Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote in an email to students at the College.
“Wendy’s death is a terrible blow to the entire community,” House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin and Resident Dean Brett Flehinger wrote in an email to Lowell House residents. "Wendy was a beloved friend who touched the lives of so many of us, and we mourn her passing."
Lowell House students and friends of Chang gathered in the Junior Common Room Saturday afternoon to mourn her passing.
Chang, who recently completed an honors thesis on Edith Wharton, had played an active role in the College community throughout her time at Harvard as a designer for the Harvard Advocate and a member of the Crimson Key Society. Chang was also an inactive Crimson news editor.
In her email to the College, Hammonds described Wendy as “young, talented, and generous.”
“Wendy’s friends loved her warmth and she had connections far and wide in Lowell House and across Harvard,” she wrote. “We will all miss her greatly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After beating Brown (8-20, 5-9 Ivy) by a combined tally of 35-4 in four games last year, the Harvard softball team snuck by the Bears, 2-1, in both of Friday’s home contests. Despite the close margin, the team’s performance was good enough to clinch the North Division title and a spot in the Ivy Championship Series for the Crimson (26-11, 13-1). Harvard will host the title tilts as it attempts to bring home a second straight conference championship
HARVARD 2, BROWN 1
The Crimson won game two but suffered a major loss in the process. Harvard entered the bottom of the third inning up 1-0 and had a runner on second base with two outs as junior Stephanie Regan stepped to the plate. Regan extended her hitting streak to eight games with a line drive through the gap in left center. The runner on second scored easily on the play and Regan rounded second with plans to go for a triple. She soon reconsidered though, and attempted to turn back to second. It was then when her knee gave, and she crumpled to the dirt.
“I was flying around the bases pretty fast, and my feet were just too fast for my knee,” Regan said.
Regan was tagged out to end the inning, but that was far from the Crimson’s biggest concern at the moment. Eventually, she was carried off the field and taken out of the game.
Regan, who tore an ACL before her freshman year, said that this injury doesn’t feel as bad. She was able to walk soon after the game and is hopeful she will be able to return to the lineup quickly after getting an MRI early this week. Before going down with the injury, the junior boasted the seventh-highest batting average in the league and was batting third in the lineup.
The Crimson’s first run of the game came in the second inning when sophomore Kasey Lange scored on a passed ball.
Brown got its sole run of the game in the sixth inning on a single that scored Stephanie Thompson, who had started off the inning with a double to the fence.
In the seventh, the Bears fought to find an equalizing score. With two outs in the inning, the visitors had a runner on third as Thompson stepped up to the plate once more. Sophomore Laura Ricciardone intentionally walked Thompson and got the game’s final out on a grounder to first, capping the 2-1 victory.
HARVARD 2, BROWN 1
Game one started with a premier matchup of two of the Ivy’s best players. With two outs in the top of the first inning, Brown’s Thompson, who is the sixth most-difficult hitter to strike out in the country, stepped up to face Harvard pitcher Rachel Brown, who is sixth in the country in strikeouts and had already added a K to her tally earlier in the inning.
Thompson won the battle decisively with a bomb to left center that put the Bears up, 1-0, but Harvard’s ace won the war. After surrendering the solo home run, Brown didn’t give up another hit in the ballgame. Thompson later fouled out to the catcher and drew two intentional walks. Brown struck out 14 more victims on the day.
On the other side of the ball, Brown’s Jessica Cherness was nearly as effective. Through five innings, the freshman had given up just five hits and no runs. But the Crimson changed that in the sixth.
After a runner was left stranded in scoring position in the fifth, Harvard converted on its opportunity in the bottom of the sixth with a single from sophomore Allison Scott to score senior Eve Rosenbaum, who was on second after stealing a base. The run evened the score at one.
In the bottom of the seventh, the Crimson had a runner on third but failed to bring her home, sending the game into extra innings.
Neither pitcher surrendered a hit in the eighth or ninth innings, but after Brown retired the side in the top of the 10th, Cherness was forced to face the top of the Harvard order, beginning with senior Jane Alexander. Alexander had reached safely in 16 of the previous 18 contests but had yet to reach base Friday. That changed quickly as she drilled a ball over the center field fence for a walk-off home run, her second round-tripper of the year, giving Harvard the 2-1 win.
“Rachel was throwing a great game, and we put her out there for longer than she needed to be…so I knew we needed a run to get her off the mound and win the game already,” Alexander said. “I was thinking single, but it went out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team picked up two victories over Ivy League rival Brown on Friday at O’Donnell Field, downing the Bears, 7-4 and 4-2.
With its fifth and sixth league wins, the Crimson snapped a two-game losing streak and moved into second place behind Dartmouth in the Red Rolfe Division of the Ivy League.
“We came in, knew we had to sweep, and took care of business,” sophomore captain Andrew Ferreira said. “It feels pretty good, especially because it was our first sweep of the year.”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 2
For Harvard, a late spark from the bench was enough to beat the Bears in the second game of the doubleheader.
In the first pitch of an eighth-inning at-bat, Crimson sophomore pinch hitter Carlton Bailey knocked a two-run ground rule double inning to break the 2-2 tie and pull Harvard (11-27, 7-9 Ivy) ahead of Brown (8-29, 5-11).
“I was hoping he would get one out to the outfield,” Walsh said. “I had no idea he would put one up the centerfield fence.”
In his only at-bat Saturday, Bailey, who has seen little playing time in his last four games as he recovers from a knee injury, gave Harvard a much-needed boost.
“He’s been clutch all year,” sophomore co-captain Andrew Ferreira said. “He came in and really stepped up for us. It was huge.”
Walsh explained that an Ivy League team traveling rule gave him some flexibility with lineup adjustments.
“It’s a nice advantage when Brown can dress only 20 guys and we have our team, so we were able to make some moves in both games,” Walsh said. “Getting some pinch hitters and pinch runners in helped us.”
The Bears scored first in a four-hit second inning, as sophomore infielder J.J. Franco grounded into a double play that advanced freshman outfielder Will Marcal home from third.
The Crimson answered in a two-run third inning, with junior second baseman Kyle Larrow and senior infielder Jeff Reynolds recording RBIs on singles to right field.
Brown tied the game at 2-2 in the top of the sixth inning when sophomore catcher Wes Van Boom scored after his triple to left-center field. But thanks to solid defense and relief pitching, the Crimson held the Bears scoreless in the visitors’ final four at-bats, and a Harvard rally in the bottom of the eighth clinched the win.
Harvard senior starting pitcher Conner Hulse tallied six strikeouts and allowed two runs on seven hits and two errors in game two. In two innings of relief action, sophomore right-hander Baron Davis allowed no hits and no runs to earn the win.
Junior pitcher Zack Olson earned his fourth save of the season, recording two strikeouts in the top of a scoreless ninth.
Overall, Walsh was satisfied with his team’s play on Friday.
“When I’m able to mention a bunch of guys, then it’s a good team effort,” Walsh said. “We needed the two wins to stay alive in the Ivy League.”
HARVARD 7, BROWN 4 (7 inn.)
A three-run sixth broke a 4-4 tie and gave the Crimson its first victory of the day over Brown, 7-4.
Harvard struck in the first inning on sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan’s home run over the left field wall.
But the Bears scored four runs in two innings to take a 4-1 lead at the end of the third.
In the rally, senior infielder Graham Tyler singled to score Marcal. Tyler came home two at-bats later on sophomore outfielder Matt DeRenzi’s ground out, and junior infielder Cody Slaughter’s two-run homer to left-center capped Brown’s scoring run.
The Crimson overcame Brown’s four-run rally with six unanswered runs starting in the bottom of the fourth inning.
Sophomore outfielder Jack Colton’s single to left field scored McGuiggan, and freshman Ethan Ferreira drove sophomore Stephen Dill home from second.
Bears pitchers Anthony Galan and Taylor Wright walked a combined three batters in the bottom of the sixth inning before allowing three runs, as Reynolds hit a two-run double to right field and Dill was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.
The Harvard defense, which committed only one error in game one, combined with a strong pitching effort to allow just one runner on base after Franco’s single down the right-field line in the top of the fifth inning.
Franco was picked off during the next at-bat, when senior pitcher Brent Suter fired the ball to first base and left the runner stranded between first and second.
Suter finished a complete game and improved his record to 2-5 on the season. The lefty allowed just six hits and struck out four of the 27 batters he faced in the contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a chance to sweep Brown and gain extra momentum for the season’s decisive final series against Dartmouth next weekend, the Harvard baseball team won in dramatic fashion in the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader but dropped the second contest in a high-powered slugfest.
After taking three out of four games from the Bears (8-29, 5-11 Ivy) this past weekend, the Crimson (11-27, 7-9) sits four games back from the Big Green (17-15, 11-5), the Ivy League Rolfe Division leader. To tie for the division title, the Crimson must beat Dartmouth four times in a home-and-home series next weekend.
“[Winning three out of four] is huge,” said senior designated hitter Marcus Way. “We really needed it confidence-wise to have a shot at playing in the Ivy League championship.”
BROWN 22, HARVARD 9
In game two, both teams combined for 31 runs on 41 hits in the highest-scoring Ivy matchup of the season.
Brown’s potent offense, which claimed a lopsided share with 25 hits and was aided by five Harvard errors, proved too much for the Crimson to overcome. It was the second time the Bears posted 22 runs this season, having last done so against Maine on Mar. 1.
Defensive miscues and pitching trouble prevented Harvard’s 16 hits—seven of which went for extra-bases—and a season-high 9 runs, from being enough to win.
Freshman Tanner Anderson took the mound for the Crimson but was unable to finish the first inning, giving up a run on a wild pitch and trading two bases-loaded outs for runs. After appearing to settle down and record those two outs, Anderson surrendered a home run and a triple to make the deficit 6-0.
Harvard coach Joe Walsh handed the ball to freshman Matt Timoney, who pitched 3.1 innings of relief, giving up three runs, two of which were unearned.
Freshman center fielder Mike Martin’s three-run homer in the second pulled the Crimson within two runs, but that was the closest it came for the rest of the game.
Brown designated hitter Mike DiBiase, who finished the game with eight RBIs, led off the fifth inning against junior hurler Matt Doyle with a deep home run to straightaway center field, opening an eight-run onslaught.
Sophomore Baron Davis replaced Doyle and was hit for five runs, though all were unearned.
With runners on first and second and one out, Bears right fielder Will Marcal sent a grounder back to Davis, who fired an errant throw to third. All runners reached base safely, loading the bases.
A subsequent series of three errors scored three runs for Brown. In all, five errors cost the team seven unearned runs.
“Obviously, we would have liked to have taken that second [game], but what can you do when a team puts up 22 runs and 25 hits?” asked junior third baseman Kyle Larrow.
HARVARD 6, BROWN 5
Way tallied his third hit in Saturday’s opener with a walk-off, solo homer to lead off the seventh inning.
“I was on deck,” said Larrow, who was batting behind Way. “Marcus looked at me and he goes, ‘Would you be mad if you didn’t hit here?’ and I said, ‘No, I probably wouldn’t care that much.’ And he put it out there.”
Way’s homer came off of David St. Lawrence, whose 1-0 fastball was sent over the right field wall, sending Harvard’s players running out from the dugout.
Sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan also had three hits in the contest and scored a run on Way’s double in the first.
After junior starter Joey Novak retired the Bears in order in the first, the Crimson opened the scoring when sophomore catcher Steve Dill knocked in sophomore left fielder Jack Colton on a sacrifice groundout.
Brown bounced back with two runs in the next frame, scoring on a bases-loaded walk and then on a fielder’s choice.
Novak allowed three more runs in the top of the fourth inning, but Harvard senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds tied it up again with a ground-rule double to dead center field.
Sophomore captain Andrew Ferreira was impressive in relief, stifling the Bears’ bats for three innings of one-hit, no-run work to earn the win.
In need of a sweep, the Crimson will have to align the offensive power it showed on Saturday with solid defense and pitching when it faces the Big Green for two games at O’Donnell Field next Saturday and two in Hanover, N.H., next Sunday.
“This is the first time I’ve taken three out of four games since I’ve been at Harvard, and I’ve been here three years,” Larrow said. “At least now we know that we can take three out of four, or four out of four.”

Enjoy awkward silences and endless introductions? We've compiled a list of the highlights of this year's Visitas weekend.
 
"Slow Dancing" presented by Office for the Arts, Friday, April 20, 7-11 p.m.
 
Although this video project, which will run nightly in the Yard through April 29, is described as a stunning visual display of dancers practicing their art, we're hoping that it incorporates a lesson in dance floor etiquette for the upcoming freshman. For example, if all your dancing peers drunkenly tumble off the table, you should too.
 
Crimson Key Practical Campus Tour, Saturday, April 21, 11 a.m. - 12 p.m.
If this tour accurately follows the paths of current freshman, then "practical" stops include Annenberg, Lamont, the Yard, and…that's it. Current freshmen may want to hop on this tour, which begins at the John Harvard statue, just in case the guide decides to venture to the elusive Union dorms. If you've never been to Greenough, does it exist?
 
"What I Wish I'd Known," a panel by the Senior Class Committee in Sever 113, Saturday, April 21 8-9 p.m.
And a bonus tip from Flyby:
If you fall asleep in Lamont, someone will take a picture of you.
 
 
Panel: What It's Like to be a Harvard Freshman, Sunday, April 22 10-11 a.m.
 
The truth? Late nights in Lamont, busted dorm parties and putting everything you own on a lanyard. Join Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67 in Science Center B to hear otherwise.
 
 
Pre-Frosh Palooza: A Night of Entertainment, Sunday, April 22 9-11 p.m.

The Major League Baseball season may just be getting underway, but the Bay State's other great showdown, the U.S. Senate race, has been progressing for weeks. As the Boston Red Sox preparing to celebrate the 100th birthday of Fenway Park on Friday, it seemed the candidates wanted to play ball too—on MSNBC's Morning Joe, that is.
The morning political talk show set up camp outside the Red Sox dugout Friday morning and invited Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Senator Scott Brown onto the show to talk shop. Though they did not appear together, the two campaigners offered mostly light-hearted jabs at each other and shared stories from the trail.
The Democrat and Republican pulled out some of their favorite lines for national TV. Warren called Brown one of Wall Street's favorite senators and Brown called Warren a partisan "rock thrower" in return.
Some polls in recent weeks have shown Brown winning the race, while others have put Warren ahead. Needless to say, it is going to be a tight race well into the fall.
Look out for more updates as they come.
