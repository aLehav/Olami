After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Fourth of July holiday in 2020 was a solemn day for a nation in turmoil. Among the countless distressing political events on the minds of many Americans, rapper, billionaire, and husband to Kim Kardashian Kanye West announced on Independence Day that he would throw his hat in the ring of the 2020 presidential race. West made the announcement via Twitter, calling for the nation to “realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future.” He received immediate support from his most loyal fans.
It would be generous to say that West’s chances of success are dubious. The Federal Election Commission looked into his declaration, investigating whether West’s filings constituted a “false or fictitious claim” without the necessary paperwork to make the run official. West’s campaign also missed filing deadlines to get on the ballot in many states.
Many popular media outlets chose to largely ignore West in the first weeks of his run. The New York Times ran their first, heavily skeptical, coverage on July 16, and the Washington Post published a similarly incredulous op-ed. However, over the past few months, as the campaign sputters along, the run has mobilized investigative reporters to allay confusion and skepticism.
Although it is possible to hyper-analyze how West’s lyrics could have been reflected in a potential political platform — will West support subsidizing Chick-fil-A so they will not be “closed on Sunday?” Does he have thoughts about white feminism, specifically “white girls,” such as Sarah Palin, “politickin’?” How does West feel about the “war on terrorism” relative to other nation-wide struggles? — this is undoubtedly a waste of breath. West’s platform is ambiguous and he has only had one public event.
The impact of West’s campaign is not in his policy proposals, one of the most articulate being the development of an “eco-village” that he would call “Birthday Lake,” or his tweets, including a recent one where it appears that he is urinating on a Grammy award. West’s run poses a risk of delaying mail-in votes across the country due to lawsuits about whether he belongs on the ballot. In Wisconsin, one of the key states to watch this presidential cycle, West took the issue to the State Supreme Court after missing the deadline to be on the ballot by 14 seconds. Other legal disputes about West’s campaign have played out in Arizona and Virginia. While he has ultimately lost in court, West’s lawsuits in similar states have the potential to delay when ballots are finalized and mailed to voters, costing valuable time in the final push for November. West’s run may exacerbate weaknesses in mail-in voting infrastructure during an election year already fraught with concerns about higher numbers of absentee ballots and the functionality of the USPS.
West’s candidacy exemplifies the chaotic and frustratingly absurd attributes of current American politics, particularly distrust of the “Establishment” and partisan divisions. In a nation sprinkled with yard signs reading “Any Functioning Adult 2020,” it’s hardly surprising that another egotistical billionaire is testing out their presidential prospects, this time running as a candidate for “The Birthday Party.” Albeit bizarre, West’s candidacy is yet another symptom of Americans’ dissatisfaction and exhaustion with the candidates put forward by the two major political parties.
Further, the immediate rush of both support and dismay after West’s declaration reveals how the American political landscape continues to be inextricably linked to social media and celebrity. West declared his candidacy on Twitter; perhaps a rookie mistake, or perhaps part of a cunning strategy to make himself accessible and easily digestible for the masses. Despite recent efforts to distance himself from Donald Trump, West once visited the Oval Office of a man who managed to turn his wealth and fame into self-serving political power.
The political debacle of Kanye West serves as a reminder that the presidency, while at the forefront of many Americans’ minds, cannot be conceived as the sole mechanism for addressing societal problems or fostering social change. While this might be obvious to some, it is easy to lose sight of in an election cycle that has felt especially interminable. The most salient evidence of this problem is our tendency to blame the current president — not systemic racism, not economic inequality, not corruption and incompetence at any and all levels of government — for our nation’s ills.
While justified to a certain extent, the hysteria around West’s election expounds on a misconception that electoral politics, and especially the presidential election, determine the fate of a nation far more than anything else. This disheartening conclusion erases the power of citizens and overlooks governmental failures on many other counts.

If there’s one thing that can salvage the shipwreck that is 2020, it’s a Victoria sponge. With its latest season airing on Netflix now, “The Great British Baking Show” (or “The Great British Bake Off” if you’re feeling extra Tory) might be the only good thing to come out of this year. Thanks to one new host, one undisclosed location, and one Prue Leith promising — yet again — to judge extra hard this time around, viewers are sure to experience the tent in ways they never have before. Be that as it may, it’s reassuring to know that some things will never change. To rekindle that sense of nostalgia, and satiate your incurable sweet tooth, revisit the Top 5 Great British Baking Show Contestants of all time.
5. Val (Series 7)
Ah, Val. Who doesn’t love Val? Trick question — everyone loves Val. From her quirky “I’m listening to my sponge” dance to her interpretive “I’m watching my cake bake in the oven” dance, Val is the personification of wholesomeness in the flesh. Her unfaltering positivity and warmth can melt even the iciest of judge Paul Hollywood’s “Bread Week” glares. Humanity as a whole would benefit from more people like Val.
4. Kim-Joy (Series 9)
If you like splashes of color and eccentricity, you are almost certainly familiar with the enigma that is Kim-Joy. Bubbly and always smiling, she has captivated the hearts — or at least the attention — of millions, all while being unapologetically herself. Most of her signature bakes turned out to be so great precisely because of that unconventionality. So if you personally identify with being beautifully weird, you should hit up her YouTube channel. Just don’t mention chocolate mousse… she will cry at you.
3. Selasi (Series 7)
Out of the abundance of joy that series 7 has bestowed upon us, this baker just might be one of its best. The epitome of steezy, Selasi never failed to dial up the spice while maintaining a cool and level head. His charisma and borderline flirtatious attitude (in a detached and minimal effort kind of way, of course) got him as far as the semi-finals. He exited the tent, but in our memories he remains victorious.
2. Liam (Series 8)
Is your pocket feeling a little light these days? If so, you can always put Liam in it. The innocent and all too relatable baker is sure to have made you go “uwu” at some point. The whole baking community took a collective moment of silence when he was eliminated in the quarterfinals, but quickly recovered after seeing him revived on numerous other media platforms post-GBBS fame. From student baker enthusiasts to lonely nanas who miss their grandbabies, Liam is a sweetheart loved and cherished by all ages.
1. Nadiya (Series 6)
And the Star Baker goes to… you guessed it: Nadiya. One of the most iconic and successful women to come out with the crystalline platter, Nadiya is a universally cherished figure in the GBBS community at large. Her modesty and self-criticism had her fans rooting for her victory, and her practical approach to baking kept them sticking around for her Netflix miniseries, “Nadiya's Time to Eat.” If the stacks of credentials alone are not enough to earn your respect, behold and wonder at the impressive range of facial control she exhibited over the course of the show (especially when being directed at Paul Hollywood).

If there’s one thing Alicia Keys is known for — besides her no-makeup campaign, the Grammys, or her first autobiography — it’s opening an album with a piano. Five of her previous six studio albums contain keyed preludes which swell with intimacy — a nod to her continual efforts to blend child fame, classical training, and Black neo-soul’s celebrations of mature love. Her new eponymous album, “ALICIA,” features that same piano intro on “Truth Without Love” — but this time, it gives way to a work more layered, dense, and weighty than her previous albums. “ALICIA” is concerned with what it means to be a true role model. The album answers the question posed in the intro of her very first album, 19 years ago: “Do you know my name?” Yes, we certainly do now, but what comes next?
Keys’ answer is, well, a lot of things. The album’s first half is choppy, spacey, and experimental, a departure from the arena-made motivational songs that some audiences expect of her; the final product is more akin to Prince, Janelle Monáe, or Erykah Badu than “This girl is on fire!” These songs mix collaborations with African artists, Black alternative geniuses, and piercing love tracks to prove that she can really do it all. It’s hard to imagine these early tracks, with their breathy vocals, being performed live, but they’re electrifying nonetheless. By the time “Show Me Love,” the smooth Miguel duet, comes in halfway, Keys switches back to her normal arena-ballads for the rest of the album with “Perfect Way To Die” and “Love Looks Better.” They’re all passable, with more supported vocals and direct lyrics of working-class struggle fit for both arenas and brand commercials. What to make of this structural pivot? Is it just giving in to the classic idea of Alicia Keys, proving that experimentation is incompatible with her knack for creating large-scale songs about social impact? Or, instead, is it a more sophisticated choice: placing the spacey, ambitious songs first to show that the “regular,” piano-ballad Alicia is actually the construct?
For an answer to that question, just glance through the features. Keys’s collaborators, like Sampha and Jill Scott, appear on the songs where she asserts herself through affirmations of romantic love, a tone distinct from the motivational anthems she performs solo. “It’s too much for me to take,” she and Sampha sing together. “I care too much about you,” layered with Tierra Whack. Alongside Khalid: “I’ve given in, I’ve changed my identity, I didn’t mean to go so far.” These collaborations press into the most intriguing question lying beneath the “Alicia Keys” brand: What happens when the impulse toward uplifting others stretches into a burden for the individual? Keys’ achievement with this project appears to be elaborating the emotional confusion born out of that pressure. This theme comes through not just the lyrics, but the unmatched vocal production — choirs hauntingly echo around the edges of tracks, and on “So Done,” she and Khalid simulate a quartet. This experimental sound seems to evoke the newest album “græ” from Moses Sumney, whom Keys has referenced as one of her favorite artists. On the interlude for the spoken-word song “also also also and and and,” guest vocalist Taiye Selasi proclaims, “I insist upon my right to be multiple,” a message which Alicia Keys seems to take in stride.
“What if I wasn’t Alicia?” she asks in the album’s opening. Well, what does that mean? Keys has called this album an expression of the different sides of herself, a full work only possible now, 20 years into her career as a Black woman creating inspirational soul music. Alicia Keys has always been the coolest person in the room, a class act of R&B and neo-soul. That is, when her public persona doesn’t collapse in on itself — like her corny, vocalized commendation of celebrity nominees at this year’s Grammys. In that performance, it appears she’s forcing “authenticity” through exhaustion, and it’s clear she needs to return to the piano to figure herself out before she can lift up others. Keys’ signature style may be “inspirational,” but that doesn’t mean there won’t be a little mess along the way.
The gift of this album is that it complicates what it means to be a good role model, to feel good in love, and to be good at being Alicia Keys. Unfortunately, some of that nuance is lost on the album’s closer, “Good Job.” With the piano providing infrastructure for her classic inspirational anthems, the song’s lyrics fall back to the feel-good tendencies she’s known for (“the world needs you now, know that you matter”). It feels oddly redundant; the music has already spoken for itself.

In a world turned upside down, television is our saving grace.
There is solace in easing into bed after a particularly arduous day of Zoom learning, the Netflix loading page a welcome sight for sore, pset-laden eyes. And if we’re all spending our free time watching television anyways, wouldn’t a better icebreaker question — instead of the antiquated “What are you planning to major in?” — be “What are you watching?”
Of course, there are always the folks who say all too cooly, “Oh, I don’t watch television.” Well, now you know who to avoid.
And with TV-watching at an all-time high, the 72nd Emmy Awards, held Sept. 20 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, were more important than ever. As expected, the ceremony itself was radically different than previous years. It was clear, however, that planners made an effort to recall the usual Hollywood pomp and circumstance, particularly when Jimmy Kimmel took a gratuitous pump of hand sanitizer from an absurdly ornate dispenser shaped like an Emmy trophy.
Kimmel’s opening monologue gave the brief illusion of normalcy as the comedian entered the stage, greeted by superbly groomed celebrities in decadent attire. Alexander Wang, Dolce and Gabbana, and Vera Wang evening gowns were a much-appreciated change of scenery after seeing nothing but sweats and Gildan cotton t-shirts since March.
Of course, normalcy nowadays has its limits. “Well, hello, and welcome to the Pandemmys,” Kimmel began. “Thank you for risking everything to be here, thank me for risking everything to be here. You know what they say, you can’t have a virus without a host.” A wave of delighted laughter.
It’s funny until it becomes all too clear none of this should be happening. How could Hollywood’s elite be packed into a crowded auditorium in the middle of a socially-distanced pandemic? “Hey, was that me?” the host asks. “Wait, if I’m down there, how am I up here?” Sure enough, the camera turns to Kimmel’s perspective just as the stage lights illuminate a completely empty auditorium.
“Just like prom night,” he says to the camera.
“The world may be terrible,” Kimmel continues, “but TV has never been better.” Considering the recent conclusion of beloveds such as “Game of Thrones,” “Modern Family,” and “Fleabag,” his claim may be a hot take, but it’s a legitimate one nonetheless. While timeless classics including “Saturday Night Live” still populate the nominee list, plenty of new heavy-hitters are gaining steam. “Ramy,” a comedy-drama series following the spiritual odyssey of a first-generation Egyptian-American has received critical acclaim since its premiere in 2019. “Insecure,” written by and starring Issa Rae, is a trailblazer for Black representation in a diversifying but still largely homogeneous industry.
And, of course, there was the complete “Schitt's Creek” takeover — the Schitt-storm, if you will. The refreshingly witty series, which follows an eccentric mogul family fallen from grace, has emerged as a clear Netflix favorite. Although the Canadian comedic sensation has been the talk of the town for TV lovers, a clean sweep of Outstanding Lead Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor, and Actress in a Comedy Series is a difficult feat. In fact, “Schitt’s Creek” broke the Emmy record for the most wins for a comedy series, edging out “All in the Family,” which bagged six golden trophies in 1978.
Other delights included Zendaya’s first Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Rue Bennett, a conflicted teenager battling drug addiction in HBO’s “Euphoria.” The 24-year-old accepted her trophy in custom Giorgio Armani Privé, her hair made up in a timeless dramatic updo. “I know this feels like a really weird time to be celebrating,” the star said, “but I just want to say that there is hope in the young people out there… and I just want to say to all my peers out there doing the work in the streets, I see you, I admire you, I thank you.”
In his opening monologue, Kimmel addressed that gargantuan elephant in the room. “It might seem frivolous and unnecessary to do this during a global pandemic, but you know what else seems frivolous and unnecessary?” he said. “Doing it every other year. What’s happening tonight is not important. It’s not going to stop COVID, it’s not going to put out the fires, but it’s fun.”
“And right now we need fun,” Kimmel said, “My god, do we need fun.”
If the 72nd Emmys reminded us about anything, it was that we are starved for laughter, for fun. It has been a dark year, one whose unwelcome, looming legacy casts our futures in shadow. There is a radical merit to immersing oneself, if only for a moment, in television, in film, in cinematic universes filled with diverse people and their hearteningly human stories.
Television may not save America, but America sure as hell needs television.

If there’s a recipe for contemporary action/sci-fi/superhero movies that are entertaining but oh-so clichéd, then “Project Power,” a Netflix film directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, follows that recipe to a T. Nevertheless, it somehow doesn’t turn out right: Instead of feeling satiated and eager to consume it again, one is left hungry with an odd, indescribable aftertaste. Like an undercooked double chocolate chip brownie or watery mac and cheese, the movie bears some semblance to the engrossing tale of adventure, bravery, and badassness it could have been. It’s not quite something one would regret having, but they also would not be devastated or even remotely affected if they didn’t have it to begin with. Unfortunately, Joost and Schulman — in their misguided eagerness to acquire all the ingredients and plate the dish well — didn’t dedicate enough attention to the preparation and cooking of their one hour 54 minute action-packed meal. The results? A visually appealing but dull platter of events in need of some spice and flavor.
But enough with the food comparisons — we have more pressing concerns to address: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jamie Foxx acting… together! The film, which takes place in a gloomy yet vibrant New Orleans, follows the intertwined endeavors of Robin (Dominique Fishback), an outspoken and intrepid aspiring teen rapper; Frank (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a rebellious cop; and Art (Jamie Foxx), a terrifying but caring ex-soldier searching for his missing daughter.
Over the course of the film, the trio inadvertently form an alliance through their shared goal of discovering the origin of and defeating a drug cartel that threatens to weaponize and expand the use of a destructive pill. Referred to as “Power,” this pill alters the DNA of humans and gives them a random superpower for five minutes.
Joost and Schulman certainly introduce an intriguing concept — that of unlimited power for a fixed amount of time. But the progression of the plot is so prescriptive that it negates the potential for a unique story to unfold. As with most cliche action movies, there are dramatic fight scenes involving fire; cheesy, paternalistic talks; a collection of graphic deaths; crouching over a looks-dead-but-not-really-dead person’s body; and a sudden and abrupt resolution.
For all its formulaic qualities, Joost and Schulman’s movie features exceptional, inventive visual and special effects. So good, in fact, that one may watch the film just to witness the craftsmanship of the FX artists. Primarily used to illustrate various characters’ powers, the CGI, manipulation of lighting, compositing, and prosthetic design (amongst many technical feats) contribute an element of realism to a film that would otherwise just be a motion picture with extremely disparate levels of believability. Perhaps what is most impressive is the consistency of the FX work: Machine Gun Kelly on fire (yes, you read that correctly), invisible camouflage robber, frozen woman, veiny tumor man, and bulletproof cop are all not only visually stunning, but also magnify the terrific capabilities packed into the tiny pill. Regrettably, the flimsy storyline lacks this ability to incite awe and build upon an essential plot point.
However, the fundamental flaws of the movie aren’t rooted in its plot; instead, they stem from the archetypal and at times dull characters. Fishback, Gordon-Levitt, and Foxx’s respective performances complement each other and enhance their characters to the best of their abilities. Even so, Robin, Frank, and Art are banal to such a great extent, lacking both character development and backstories, that no amount of creative interpretation can save them. Robin in particular is a living, breathing cinematic trope. By portraying her as the stereotypical Black drug-dealing rapper who has difficulty focusing on academics because she is the primary caretaker of her sick mother, the filmmakers did a great disservice to a strong BIPOC female lead that could have — for an overdue change — been dynamic and multifaceted.
Despite its shortcomings, “Project Power” is, for the most part, a painless watch. Although its reliance on cliched tropes can be tedious, the overall experience manages to be enjoyable nonetheless. The visual and special effects command your attention and ensure that the movie unfolds at a relatively reasonable pace. While one will most likely neither be on the edge of their seat nor glean artistic insight from the film, Joost and Schulman’s work presents viewers with an enticing opportunity to escape into a fictional realm where the tensions and complexities of the contemporary world do not exist. Just as the characters escape from reality by taking the pill, audiences can break free from the myriad of stressors in their lives for two hours. “Project Power” might not be a decadent full-course dinner, but it’s still an adequate and dependable treat.

In the epoch of face masks, social distancing, and constant reminders in the media of the dangers posed by COVID-19, the importance of physical health is omnipresent. Just recently, the United States surpassed 200,000 deaths as many states continue to ease restrictions in hopes of a return to normalcy. However, another silent killer walks among the 2.2 million Americans diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: suicide. Even before the pandemic, 36 percent of patients with OCD reported suicidal ideation, and today, both the fear of coronavirus infection and social isolation risk increasing this rate. September is national suicide awareness month, so it is only fitting to raise awareness of how those with OCD are facing an epidemic within a pandemic.
OCD is often portrayed in the media and popular culture as an innocuous quirk synonymous with perfectionism, such as maintaining order and ensuring everything is in the correct place. Examples off the top of my head include Sheldon from “The Big Bang Theory” and Monica from “Friends.” Furthermore, OCD has entered colloquial jargon when non-diagnosed individuals need to organize their bookshelf or align their fork with their knife. “It’s my OCD” is a common phrase uttered which, despite good intentions, downplays the severity of the condition.
These media imitations, in reality, only “represent” one half of the disorder — the compulsive half — and fail to convey the harm caused by many of its resulting symptoms. Intense cleaning can mean anything from washing one’s hands for five minutes straight in order to alleviate the anxiety to spending the entire day wiping down surfaces, inhibiting the individual from doing anything else. When I was a child, I would stand at a lightswitch for minutes on end to make sure that the lights were off, for fear of causing a house fire.
The other half of the disorder consists of unbearably obsessive thoughts, which I confront daily. These can range anywhere from fears of disasters (a fire while I am sleeping), contamination (fueling the incessant hand-washing), and uncertainty (what if I fail this assignment?). The aforementioned thoughts may sound comically ridiculous to a bystander — which is why I refrain from sharing this aspect of myself — but are crucial insight into the challenges individuals with OCD may be facing. Furthermore, these thoughts do not simply disappear; they will hound you while you work on a pset, go to dinner, or try to focus during lecture.
This brings us to 2020. While the invisible viral killer continues to spread, OCD also attacks the mind, creating a dually challenging lifestyle for Americans with OCD. For an individual who exhibits compulsive tactile behaviors such as picking things up or biting nails, this time period is extremely difficult. Refraining from these tactile behaviors means dealing with the burning anxiety for hours on end. Furthermore, aggressive hand washers will likely feel the need to increase this behavior. For example, going out to get the mail may warrant an intense washing upon returning inside.
Obsessions are equally as excruciating during the pandemic, which I can attest personally to. On campus, after watching a group of students by the river socialize without masks, my brain floods my head with worries, constantly telling me that I am going to catch COVID and die soon (the odds of which are statistically slim). Or, when I grab the handrail on the T, my brain says I must immediately wash my hands or face the consequences. Again, the emotional anxiety is much more powerful than the rational half of my brain.
In addition to the health factors, this pandemic has brought one more huge blow to individuals grappling with OCD and other mental conditions: the lack of social connection. Any other year, I would take my mind off of my struggles and go to a party or hang out with friends at Felipe’s. Now, however, we must fight these battles alone and resort to text or FaceTime for social support. Social isolation is known to compound this risk of suicide, and this will be felt especially acutely by those with pre-existing mental health conditions.
As September is suicide awareness month, I implore anyone reading this to do what they can to support those with OCD. The easiest thing to do is keep following health guidelines: wear a mask and wash your hands! Whether or not you know it, this can alleviate the stress of someone with intrusive thoughts. More importantly, though, reach out to friends and stay connected. You never know when a text from a friend is a call for help as opposed to an effect of boredom. Check up on your loved ones, whether virtually or safely in person. Use resources. CAMHS wants to help you, and I want to help you. The beautiful thing is that community support can be the solution to individual pain.

Harvard’s Title IX Office certainly didn’t have it easy this summer, as it scrambled to respond to new regulations issued by the Department of Education, which relaxed the standard of sexual harassment, limited University purview, and ramped up procedural requirements for investigations. And the office, no doubt, showed a nimbleness and creativity in its response: devising two procedural pathways, one in line with the federal regulations and one seeking to catch other cases of sexual and gender-based harassment that will fall through the cracks.
Still, Harvard’s notably “interim” policies leave a lot of questions up in the air. And they leave us wanting more decisive and more combative actions from the University.
Most strikingly, the Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy — whose very name reflects how amorphous it is — will lack the legal force of Title IX investigations laid out in the new regulations, since it covers violations they do not. Under this policy, the Office of Dispute Resolution will conduct an internal investigation — instead of a hearing and cross-examination as with the Title IX policy — and then issue a report to the relevant school. We are glad the University has maintained a mechanism to address off-campus cases, but we question ODR’s capacity to do so robustly given the new Department of Education guidelines. We fear that this new policy is basically just the Obama-era approach minus legal teeth.
Say that ODR determined — after the case was deemed not to fall under the new Title IX regulations — that a undergraduate had committed sexual harassment at an off-campus party. What teeth would this have? How would the college be held accountable to determining a just punishment? And might the student have a strong legal case that it would be unjust for the College to, for example, expel them, given that the case was “Title IX invalid,” investigated by an extralegal body, and never confirmed in a court of law?
In terms of the Title IX interim policy, we are concerned about the composition of the “hearing panels” that will preside over cases. Community members going through this process — and especially survivors — should not have to do so with familiar faculty members or administrators as their effective judges. The University should ensure that panel members do not have prior relationships of any sort with those involved.
Equally concerning is that the new policy only complicates and makes more opaque an already complicated and daunting process. If Title IX was already a bureaucratic black box that by its very nature deterred students from filing formal complaints and induced retraumatization of sexual assault survivors and other victims of sexual and gender-based misconduct, the new process — with its two pronged approach, daunting cross-examinations and hearings, and ethos of futility — can only be more damaging.
At minimum, the Title IX Office needs to pursue a broad and continuous campaign to explain how the new procedures work and what support resources community members have to aid them — not least what “severe” and “pervasive” actually mean. But it should also present to the community the process by which it translated the new regulations into institutional practice. To many, it may be concerning that individual institutions have so much latitude in their interpretation of policies. The community has a right to know how its leadership is thinking about these issues and interpreting federal policy.
Further, the Title IX Office must do more to clarify to students what these new policies entail for Harvard affiliates in a remote, COVID world. How do these policies apply to the plurality of students who are away from campus physically? How does the standard of “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive” apply to interactions that may be happening through messages, emails, or on zoom calls? Clarity around these issues is necessary to prevent fears that may otherwise lead to students feeling vulnerable right now.
The previous Obama administration Title IX policy guidance was issued in the form of a 19-page “Dear Colleague” letter from the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education. These new Title IX changes come in the form of 2,033 pages of actual regulatory rule changes from the Department of Education. In other words: These new changes come with the full force of the law that the previous Obama guidance did not. Because of this it will be much more difficult for these regulations to change going forward, which means they likely represent a new reality that the University will have to work with for a while.
While Harvard should act to secure all its affiliates' safety as if these changes were permanent in the meantime, it should also continue to use its influence in Washington to try and get the new regulations changed. Harvard has successfully challenged federal policies before, most recently with restrictions on international student visas from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And Harvard is certainly not new to the practice of lobbying lawmakers either. While this situation is different to those previous policies, we reiterate that these regulations demand another visit to Washington.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early January of this year, before 2020 became something like an open wound, I was on a flight back to Boston from Washington, D.C.
I was seated next to a man I did not know. He was, in my questionable estimation, maybe in his late twenties. He had blonde hair and wore square-framed, thick-rimmed glasses.
Wary of an unfamiliar, older man, I tried to case him; evidently I wasn’t subtle. He introduced himself, smiling, and made a point to acknowledge the potentially fraught dynamic. We struck up a conversation: As this column suggests, I am wont to talk to strangers.
In true Harvard tradition, I desperately evaded disclosing where I attended university, instead prodding him to speak more about himself. He told me that he was in politics, but identified himself as “one of the good guys.” He had recently found a job at a nonprofit that promoted ranked-choice voting, something I admitted I knew very little about.
For the remaining hour and a half of our flight, he pitched ranked-choice voting. It was oddly, exquisitely intimate — just the two of us, in this compressed, unexpected liminal space, talking about one issue with a Socratic, utter focus.
To be honest, he converted me. And now, months after that conversation, ranked-choice voting is on the ballot in Massachusetts. Ballot Question 2 proposes changing primary and general elections for federal and state level positions from a plurality system to a ranked-choice system.
In this model, instead of selecting only one candidate, voters rank their picks. If one candidate wins the majority of first-place votes, they win. If no candidate wins decisively, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated and the votes of those who ranked that candidate first are then transferred to their second choice. Candidates are eliminated until one has the majority of all votes.
This model has several benefits.
First, ranked-choice voting disincentives “throwaway vote” calculus. Rather than feel pressured to choose between pragmatism and their convictions — a position my airplane friend and I knew we would find ourselves in during the Democratic presidential primary — voters can vote their hearts with their top choice while practically cushioning with their second and third rankings.
The “throwaway vote” concept is part of a larger problem that the man on the airplane labeled electability gaming: a practice in which voters strategize their vote based on a candidate’s perceived chances. Electability gaming empirically undermines female candidates; Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Hillary Clinton were all subject to a concern about electability that extended beyond valid criticism and became a sexist dog whistle for likeability and appearance. In a ranked-choice system, voters who prefer but doubt the chances of a female candidate are able to put the more “electable” candidates on their ballot in addition to their female first choice.
Ranked-choice voting could also mitigate hyperpolarization. The pressure to be broadly appealing — to be people’s second and third choices — creates an impetus for candidates to reach out to opponents’ constituencies and eschew negative campaigning. For example, in Maine’s 2018 gubernatorial race — the first ranked-choice election in this country on such a large scale — Democratic opponents Betsy Sweet and Mark Eves made advertisements together, emphasizing the importance of a broad progressive platform that could bring voters together.
But the strongest case for ranked-choice voting is not that it offers interesting advantages. Rather, we must understand that the current plurality system is untenable and unsustainable.
Jake Auchincloss won the recent Democratic primary in the Massachusetts Fourth Congressional District. A Republican until relatively recently, Auchincloss infuriated progressives: He had previously defended students’ use of the Confederate flag, violated a pledge against taking fossil fuel money, and opposed cutting Newton’s police budget.
But in a field of nine candidates, Auchincloss squeaked by with just 23 percent of the vote. Had ranked-choice voting been in place, Jesse Mermell, the candidate endorsed by Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, likely would have won. Instead, the plurality model produced a victor who was opposed by the majority of his constituency.
In an even more drastic failure of plurality elections, 2.2 million Democrats wasted their votes in the 2020 presidential primary, when Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race just two days before Super Tuesday, after many voters had cast their ballots. With a ranked-choice system, those voters would have maintained some representation. Instead, they were effectively disenfranchised.
The man on the airplane and I spoke at length about dismal rates of voter turnout, especially among “our generation.” (I was still equivocating a fair amount about my age.) He admitted that the jury was still out on whether ranked-choice voting affects turnout.
Turnout concerns are part of a larger debate about the complexity of ranked-choice voting, something exacerbated by a pandemic my seatmate could not have anticipated. I asked him about the logistical difficulties of ranked-choice voting, unaware of the avalanche of voting complications on the horizon.
And we will need election reforms deeper than ranked-choice voting. Airplane man emphasized that voter suppression, gerrymandering, campaign finance laws, and other major obstacles hinder fair elections.
But 2020 is an inflection point for our democracy, a moment that demands radical change in the form of our democratic structures as much as in the content of our policies. We can’t patronize voters by assuming that they are incompetent rather than justifiably disatisfied; we can’t prioritize simplicity if it upholds a crumbling, blatantly undemocratic system. And most of all, when it comes to improving governance, we can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the better.
From the secret ballot to expanded absentee and mail-in voting, supposedly complicated or even dangerous election reforms have, over centuries, improved the accessibility, integrity, and efficacy of government. Now the next iteration of democracy is on the table, and Massachusetts voters have the chance to help pioneer it, to shape its contours for the country and even the world.
The man on the plane and I say: Take it.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow defended recent changes to the composition of the Board of Overseers — Harvard’s second-highest governing body — in an interview with The Crimson Friday.
The Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and the Board of Overseers announced earlier this month that they had approved a recommendation to limit the number of members nominated by petition to six of 30.
The recommendation came out of a report — which Bacow called “very thoughtful” — from a special committee tasked with evaluating the Board of Overseers and its election process.
The committee completed the report in July, a month before Harvard announced that over 40,000 alumni had elected three petition candidates backed by Harvard Forward to the Board of Overseers.
In response to criticism that the change indicates a lack of trust in alumni judgement, Bacow said the report “speaks for itself.”
“I think the report indicated that it was necessary for the Overseers to have subject matter expertise in different areas, and that the nominations process ensures that, that the nominations process as conducted by the Alumni Association was open to suggestions from the alumni, and that it was a rigorous process,” he said.
Bacow also touted the report’s finding that the “process for selecting overseers is among the most democratic of all governing boards in the United States.”
“The entire Board of Overseers is directly elected by the alumni,” he added. “There could be nothing more democratic than that.”
For years, activists have urged Harvard to divest from fossil fuels and the companies tied to the prison industry. Harvard Forward — a group pushing for divestment and student representation on the school’s governance boards — ran a slate of five candidates for the Board this past election cycle, and three were ultimately elected in August.
Activists celebrated Harvard Forward’s win as a victory for their cause, illustrating advocacy for change and a directive through the elected Overseers from the voting Harvard alumni body to divest.
But with that avenue of activism curtailed by the policy changes, Bacow maintained that the University has “multiple processes to solicit input and reaction from members of our community.”
“I think what is sometimes less visible to activists is the broader range of opinion that's expressed by alumni from across the institution,” Bacow said. “I certainly read all of my emails. So, I'm aware of the fact that Harvard does not speak with one voice and the alumni don't speak with one voice so it's important for us to be open to different points of view, and I think we are.”
Bacow said Harvard’s reputation as one of the best universities in the world was proof of its effective governance.
“We did not get here, arrive at this point, in spite of our governance processes,” he said. “Rather, Harvard has prospered in part because of those processes.”
Still, he acknowledged that the election processes for the governance boards should not be “static”and referenced “ongoing processes” of review and reform dating back to 2010, when the Corporation roughly doubled its membership and imposed term limits on its members.
“We will continue to look at ways to improve the governance of the University,” he said. “But I don't think our governance is fundamentally flawed given the quality of the institution that it has produced over almost four centuries.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite concerns that remote classes could force homebound students to learn material that is politically sensitive in their home countries, ten Harvard faculty who teach such courses said this week that those issues largely have not materialized.
Anticipating challenges for international students, Harvard’s Information Technology department published a web manual for faculty members in late August.
“A student is taking a class that engages with topics that are sensitive relative to the student’s learning environment,” the HUIT manual reads. “Such sensitivities can be exacerbated with respect to the geography and home environment where the student is learning from.”
The Wall Street Journal reported in August that professors at Princeton University, Amherst College, and Harvard Business School teaching remote courses with material considered sensitive by China planned to take measures to protect students in China and Hong Kong. In June, China passed a new national security law that severely curtails protest and free speech in Hong Kong.
Harvard Business School was considering introducing an amnesty policy at the time that would not penalize students for opting out of class discussions that could implicate students in legal woes, the Journal reported.
Within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, however, several faculty told The Crimson that they have not had to re-work any lesson plans, and that students have not reached out to them with concerns over material considered sensitive in their home country.
East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor Peter K. Bol, who co-teaches GENED 1136: “Power and Civilization: China” wrote in an email that he had faced no problems this semester despite having students in China and discussions around potentially sensitive topics.
China Studies professor William C. Kirby, Bol’s co-professor, added that the only challenge to the course would not come from China, but the Trump administration.
“The only potential political problems have come from the Trump administration, first with its limits on visas for international students and now with its proposed ban on WeChat, which I regularly (and happily) use to communicate with colleagues in China,” Kirby wrote.
The U.S. Commerce Department announced a plan to ban WeChat, a popular messaging service for Chinese nationals, from mobile app stores Sept. 18, though a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction against the ban Sept. 19.
More faculty staff have also shared similar experiences without problems surrounding students’ security concerns.
David E. Sanger ’82, a former Crimson editor who co-teaches GOV 1796: “Central Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press,” said he told students they should let teaching staff know about any security concerns with their participation in the class. No one has raised any concerns yet, he said.
Sanger added, however, that he would never censor his class material due to political pressure — but he would look, instead, to improve the security of communications.
“There’s no way we would change the content of our readings or our teaching in order to satisfy the mandates of a government,” he said. “That’s a key issue of academic freedom.”
Other countries identified by the HUIT web manual as having potential political concerns include Belarus, China, Iran, Iraq, Oman, Russia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and The United Arab Emirates.
Economics lecturer Maxim Boycko wrote in an email that, being from Russia, he understands the potential concerns, but no students have indicated that they needed accommodations in his courses.
“I might have been just lucky,” he wrote.
Russian Studies professor Terry D. Martin ’85, who teaches HIST 1981: “The End of the Russian Empire,” wrote that Russia’s current speech restrictions do not generally target historical material.
“They mostly leave academic historical scholarship alone as beneath their interest,” he wrote. “There are exceptions. If I were doing a class on WWII, I’d have to think about it.”
Three faculty who teach courses with material related to authoritarian governments in the Middle East such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iran — Government lecturer Payam Mohseni, Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures professor Ali S. Asani ’77, and History professor Rosie Bsheer — all wrote in emails that none of their students had faced security issues.
Bsheer wrote that although all the students in her course HIST 12J: “Reformers and Revolutionaries in the Arab World” are based in the United States, she still takes security concerns seriously due to the potential for political issues domestically.
“Given the relevance of the topic to events in the United States today, and the different forms of censorship that ordinary people here have experienced as a result of voicing their beliefs, it is my class policy not to record any of our synchronous meetings and to make sure that students are aware that doing so will result in disciplinary action,” Bsheer wrote.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton and HUIT spokesperson Tim Bailey declined to comment beyond the HUIT document.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a meeting hosted by the Harvard Program on U.S.-Japan Relations Monday, scholars discussed the Japanese legal system, examining its merits and applying its strengths to the justice system in the United States.
The event — titled “Learning From Japan’s Criminal Justice Success” — was moderated by Mark Ramseyer, Harvard Law School Professor of Japanese Legal Studies, and featured John Haley, Professor of Law Emeritus from Washington University School of Law and Visiting Professor of Law at the University of Washington.
Ramseyer credited Haley as the founder of his field.
“John Haley revolutionized the study of Japanese law in the U.S.” Ramseyer said. “He was the first true interdisciplinary scholar with astonishing originality.”
Haley said Japan had success in its criminal justice system — the numbers of reported incidences of homicides, rapes, injuries, and assault have remained relatively low since 1955, with some fluctuations earlier in the century.
Starting work with Japanese criminal studies in the 1970s, Haley found that the mentality on incarceration in Japan differed greatly from that in the U.S. Haley said Japan utilized a criminal justice system focused less on incarceration than it is on “accountability.”
“Less than 2 percent of all persons determined to be offenders in the courts are ever incarcerated,” Haley said.
Haley also described potential causes — beyond criminal justice strategies — for the low crime statistics in Japan. He pointed to specific societal norms in Japan, such as cultural homogeneity and the pressures of reputation. He said these cultural features likely lead to a more widely-shared perception of law and how citizens affect one another.
After the event, Haley wrote in an email that the U.S. should adopt similar ideals in its criminal justice system.
“The most significant lesson is that offender remorse and willingness to be accountable for the harms caused by a crime should be a basis for pardon. (Reoffending may be punished, however),” he wrote.
Haley’s presentation concluded by contrasting the American and Japanese legal systems, especially in terms of the use of incarceration as a punishment for crimes.
“The American system I thought of as the ‘night’ of criminal justice,” Haley said, noting that the Japanese system was the “day.” “We believe if a crime is committed, there must be a moral duty to punish and punish in relation to what crime was committed. I think that is morally wrong, and I think it is detrimental to society and the criminal justice system. But that puts me at odds with most Americans.”
The Harvard U.S.-Japan Program hosted the event as part of a speaker series. While the speaker series was not planned to respond to ongoing conversations about criminal justice in the United States, Christina Davis, the program’s director, wrote in an email that the content was relevant to current events.
“Certainly as the United States grapples with its own challenging problems related to criminal justice, we benefit from looking at how other societies have built institutions to address common goals for a just society,” Davis wrote.
During a question and answer session at the end of his lecture, Haley emphasized that the societal value of due punishment was the key policy difference between the U.S. and Japan, which influenced the gap in crime statistics between the two countries.
“Americans need to avoid our cultural emphasis on retribution,” he wrote in an email.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School teaching hospital Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center reported encouraging interim results Friday from an early clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed with pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson.
The early results — which were published in medRxiv Friday, but have yet to be peer-reviewed — indicate that a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine safely elicits antibody responses in nearly all participants across all age groups.
HMS professor Dan H. Barouch ’93, who serves as Director of Beth Israel’s Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, led the design effort for the vaccine. It uses a deactivated common cold virus as a viral vector to deliver coronavirus spike proteins to host cells, stimulating the body to elicit an immune response.
Barouch said the data shows the vaccine is “generally well tolerated,” noting that just a single shot provoked an immune response in “the vast majority” of study participants.
The “single shot” characteristic of the vaccine is a distinguishing feature of its design, according to Barouch.
“A single shot vaccine, if it proves to be safe and effective, would have substantial practical and logistic benefits in terms of mass immunization campaigns and global pandemic control,” he said.
Moreover, the vaccine does not require sub-zero freezing for stability and can remain stable at refrigerated temperatures for up to three months. Other vaccine candidates in late stage clinical trials must be frozen, requiring dry ice for distribution.
Still, despite hopeful preliminary findings, the research team will not know if their vaccine effectively defends against the coronavirus until the completion of phase three clinical trials, which will be led by Johnson & Johnson and the National Institutes of Health’s COVID-19 Prevention Trials Networks. The trials will enroll 60,000 participants from around the world.
“We don’t know yet that these antibody responses will actually protect anyone from getting COVID-19, or developing severe disease,” Kathryn Stephenson, Director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research Clinical Trials Unit at BIDMC, wrote in an email. “That’s why it’s so important that we do these phase 3 trials.”
Barouch said his team is “tremendously excited” about pushing ahead into the late stage clinical trials.
“The pre-clinical studies and the early phase clinical trials look promising and we look forward to the results of the definitive, pivotal phase three trial of this vaccine,” he said.

President Donald J. Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court Saturday may endanger Harvard’s chances of victory in the lawsuit against it by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, should the case proceed to the highest court in the land, higher education law experts say.
The future of race-based admissions practices nationwide may be at stake in the case, which is currently on appeal in the United States First Circuit Court after a District Court ruled last fall that Harvard College’s admissions practices do not intentionally discriminate against Asian American applicants.
The First Circuit heard oral arguments from Harvard and SFFA earlier this month; SFFA President Edward J. Blum said that no matter the outcome of the appeal, his organization was prepared to take the lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court.
Stetson University law professor Peter F. Lake ’81 said he believes that Barrett’s judicial profile as an “originalist” will naturally be at odds with established precedents in higher education law, including the validity of affirmative action.
“If she's a true originalist, she's going to have to contend with the fact that the level of scrutiny that American higher education now experiences in the hands of the federal government is anything but original to the U.S. Constitution,” Lake said. “I think there's a tension there that could be really interesting to watch her play out.”
While some legal experts agree it is too early to determine what specific stance an appointed Justice Barrett might take on affirmative action, several affirmed that her vote on the court could have critical implications for civil rights.
Indiana University law professor Kevin D. Brown said he believes that if Barrett becomes a decisive vote against affirmative action, the result will be a “critical loss” for American society.
“Affirmative action has really been the way that we've been able to desegregate the higher levels of our socio-economic system,” Brown said.
Jennifer A. Holmes, an assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, also said she cannot predict which way Barrett might rule on specific issues. But despite that uncertainty, Holmes said the fact that Barrett has historically advocated for “flexibility to the stare decisis doctrine” — or deviation from established precedent — is enough to raise concerns over Harvard’s chances alone.
“Having the perspective that stare decisis is flexible or is not a guiding legal tenet is just deeply concerning when the Supreme Court has enshrined so many rights for Black people, for marginalized groups, for all sorts of people in the U.S.,” Holmes said.
Brown said he believes that regardless of this year’s election results, Barrett will ultimately be appointed to the Supreme Court.
“She could very well be confirmed before the election, but even if she's not confirmed before the election, you still have that lame-duck period where there’s time to confirm her,” said Brown. “So, I would fully expect that she would be on the court certainly by the end of the year, but quite possibly as early as November 3.”
Correction: September 29, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Jennifer A. Holmes as saying the Supreme Court  "has been trying" rights. In fact, she said the Court "has enshrined" those rights.

With the Nov. 3 federal elections fast approaching, panelists at the Harvard Graduate School of Design discussed how integrating intentional design efforts can increase voter turnout and re-define civic engagement.
Moderated by Design School Dean Sarah M. Whiting, the event featured panelists including architect and founder of the MASS Design Group Michael Murphy and University Professor Danielle S. Allen. Their conversation centered on recommendations from the American Academy of Arts & Sciences’ report on increasing U.S. civic engagement, exploring how design efforts could facilitate the report’s goals.
“Design isn’t just what we do with a pen or computer these days, but is really an organization of space, of procedures, of people,” Whiting said. “Our training as designers gives us a chance to actually play a role in the design of a democracy.”
Allen — who co-authored the report — conceded that the report’s authors did not consult designers in its creation. But she noted that the design community is fundamental to reshaping the dynamic between voters and the polls.
“We have to think about the electoral process as a design challenge,” she said.
In addition to discussing the report’s recommendations, Allen, Murphy, and Whiting urged young designers to expand into civic sectors and use their skills to empower voters.
“It was a meaningful and informative, interesting conversation,” said Lucas Chu ’23, a student currently enrolled in one of Allen’s courses. “I think I didn’t really realize [voting] was a design framework.”
The panelists described the importance of celebrating civic engagement as an essential ritual — suggesting that voters host small parties, whether online or in small groups, to encourage turnout among their peers. They also discussed how to best design in-person voting around the coronavirus pandemic and the altered voting dynamic due to mail-in ballots.
“You look someone in the eye, you sign on a book, you go and cast your ballot, you come out, you get a sticker, you get something in return,” said Murphy. “There’s this relational commitment and this relational process where you’re giving something and taking something back. You’re participating and having proof that you participated.”
On November 3, the GSD will be using its main building, Gund Hall, as a safe, in-person voter site. Whiting and the GSD also expressed their support for the Harvard Votes Challenge, a student-led initiative run through the Institute of Politics that aims to increase voter turnout across the University.
“Encourage everyone to exercise the power of the vote,” Whiting said in an interview after the event. “Even if it’s very hard some days when you read the news to feel like each voice matters, it does.”

Twelve women who have accused Harvard faculty of sexual harassment or misconduct penned a letter to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay Friday requesting representation on a new committee being formed to review the FAS’s interim sexual harassment policy.
The U.S. Department of Education’s new Title IX regulations prompted the University and the FAS to revise their sexual harassment policies this summer. Both released interim policies that they said they intend to review over the next year; Gay announced Sept. 14 that she would form a committee “in the coming weeks” to do so.
The women wrote in Friday’s letter that Harvard’s existing procedures for investigating sexual harassment complaints had “failed” them. They said their insights from interacting with Harvard’s Title IX office and Office for Dispute Resolution should inform changes.
“In our experience, the current process is unfairly tilted toward the interests of the respondent over the complainant,” the women wrote. “The procedures were not developed to consider or sanction patterns of behavior over time or to handle groups of complainants; they divide survivors of serial predation by one faculty member; and they provide no adequate representation or support for complainants.”
“It is only by incorporating the experiences and insights of individuals for whom Harvard’s Title IX policy has failed that a better policy can be created, and that the process and outcome will be viewed as legitimate, effective, and inclusive,” they wrote.
The women requested that at least one seat on the committee be granted to a Harvard alumna with experience going through the Title IX process who can “speak freely about her experiences without fear of reprisal,” as well as one current student with such experience.
“These individuals have unique perspectives to contribute on how the Title IX process can function in light of power asymmetries, narrow professional circles in academic subfields, and the professional and personal risks involved in reporting,” they wrote.
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the letter, pointing to Gay’s announcement of the formation of the committee in September. Gay noted then that the “committee will establish channels for collecting input from the FAS community on this important issue.”
The letter’s signatories include women who have accused former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez, Anthropology professor emeritus Gary Urton, and Anthropology and African and African American Studies professor John L. Comaroff of sexual harassment and misconduct. In the last three years, several of the signatories have filed Title IX complaints, several are currently in investigatory proceedings, and several declined to file complaints after raising concerns about the ODR process.
Dominguez retired in 2018 after 18 women accused him of sexual harassment; Gay stripped him of his emeritus status and barred him from the FAS campus after a yearlong investigation.
The Crimson first reported in May that both Urton and Comaroff faced accusations that they had sexually harassed students. Gay placed Urton and Comaroff on paid administative leave in June and August, respectively.
Urton retired in August, the same month ODR found he had abused his power by propositioning then-graduate student Jade d'Alpoim Guedes to join him in a hotel room in 2012. He subsequently filed a retaliation complaint against Guedes for sharing ODR’s draft findings on Twitter, though he withdrew it roughly two weeks later.
The letter’s authors took issue with the policy language that allowed Urton to file the retaliation complaint.
The women wrote that the confidentiality clause of the existing ODR procedures, which notes that sharing information they learn during ODR proceedings opens up a complainant to a retaliation complaint, leaves the complainant “in the dark even about whether a sanction will be issued against her harasser.”
Anthropology Ph.D. student Margaret G. Czerwienski, who first came forward publicly about her Title IX complaint against Comaroff in an August Chronicle of Higher Education story, said she signed Friday’s letter because the current ODR procedures left her feeling pressured to drop her complaint.
Czerwienski said she believes the process creates a “major disparity” between faculty and students, both with regard to the information at their disposal and the risk they assume. Faculty can usually afford legal counsel while students cannot, something she hopes the committee will address. Since 2015, Harvard Law School students who file sexual harassment complaints are guaranteed access to an attorney, paid for by the Law School, during stages of their case.
Though the Title IX rules prohibit retaliation against a complainant, Czerwienski said that, in practice, students take on massive professional risk by pursuing the process because powerful tenured faculty can destroy a student’s career through informal networks.
“Many of the flaws in the odr process that I mentioned have the effect of discouraging students from engaging in the process and of burdening victims with additional, but unnecessary, exposures and risks,” Czerwienski added in a follow up message. “Without someone on the committee reminding Harvard officials to think of the special needs and vulnerabilities of students confronting the abuses of powerful professors, the process will likely continue to be flawed and to place students at undue risk.”
Suzanna E. Challen, a former Government Ph.D. student who accused Dominguez of harassment in 2018 but declined to file a formal complaint due to concerns with the investigatory process, wrote in an email that she signed Friday’s letter because the recent accusations against Anthropology faculty were “déjà vu.”
“President Bacow has done the minimum to address systemic gender discrimination, and that needs to change,” Challen wrote. “I hope this FAS committee formed by Dean Gay is part of bringing about that change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was still dark outside when Kwaku O. Adubofour ’24 trudged out of his dorm room in Eliot House at 5:20 a.m. Monday morning and headed across the Charles River. Wearing a blue surgeon mask, he arrived at the football field in time for a 6 a.m. team workout — his first as a Harvard football player.
Student athletes living on campus like Adubofour partook in their first team workouts on Monday in accordance with a phased approach rolled out by Harvard Athletics to reintroduce athletic activity to students on campus.
In Phase One, Harvard is permitting athletes to meet with their teammates and coaches for up to an hour of strength and conditioning training per day, during which they must wear a mask and keep at least six feet apart. Student athletes living off campus are not allowed to participate, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
“In partnership with the Ivy League and [Harvard University Health Services], a phased return to athletic activity plan has been developed to protect the health and well-being of our student-athletes, coaches, administrative staff, and Harvard community, in accordance with the NCAA Resocialization Plan of College Sport,” Dane wrote in an email. “Our phased reopening is not in preparation for competition, but is designed to provide a structure, monitored health and wellness opportunity for student-athletes.”
Teams that practiced on Monday did a combination of conditioning drills on the athletics fields and weight lifting exercises inside the Palmer Dixon Strength and Conditioning Center.
Athletes described having to maintain distance from their teammates as awkward, and having to wear a mask while exercising as uncomfortable. Still, they said they were grateful and excited for the opportunity to train and be together with their teammates.
Women’s water polo player Ella K. Prentice ’24 said she felt “really safe” while working out with her teammates Monday.
“We were wearing masks the whole time and were always six feet apart. For lifting we all have our own stations so we are all at our own rack and there’s a box of tape around the rack that was ours. And the weights we cleaned pretty frequently between every use,” she said. “There was a bucket of disinfectant wipes in our box and so I would go pick up my weights, lift, and then wipe them down and put them back.”
On Tuesday morning, Prentice and her four teammates on campus will use the Blodgett Pool, where she said they will each swim in their own lane.
Baseball player Jay T. Driver ’24 also described the procedures as meticulously organized.
“We had to wipe everything we touched down, like pencils and everything we use, and we did the hand sanitizer on the way in and the way out. So we definitely were keeping up with the cleaning.”
“It is a little tedious, but it was worth it,” he added. “We were willing to do whatever it takes to get back in there and be able to do stuff.”
Women’s tennis player Mihaela L. Marculescu ’23 said she and other athletes will get used to the new conditions.
“It definitely feels a little bit uncomfortable because you start sweating and it’s pretty hard to breathe. But it’s also like, those are the conditions, so we have to adapt. And I’m grateful and I think the others are too,” she said. “Because it could’ve been worse; we could have been just stuck in our rooms doing nothing.”
Baseball player Uday P. Narottam ’24 also said he and his teammates brought “a lot of energy” to the session despite the unusual circumstances.
“It was a little weird being socially distant while we work out. You can’t high five or anything,” he said. “We’re all still cheering each other on, yelling at each other when we can in between our sets. In between our reps, we’ll all clap super loudly.”
Despite waking up at 5 a.m., Adubofour said he felt energized after the workout.
“Even though I only slept a couple hours and had worked out I had a lot of energy after,” he said. “It just felt really nice to finally have the entire team in one spot. It was just really exciting.”
And while perhaps unusual, Adubofour added Monday’s workout was legitimate.
“It felt like it was Division I football,” he said.
If Phase One of athletic activity proceeds smoothly, Dane, the Harvard spokesperson, said Phase Two can begin as early as October 5. During the next phase, teams will be allowed to do sport-specific work for up to two hours per day.
Also on Monday, Harvard reopened the Malkin Athletic Center to all students on campus. Students can use the pool, weight room, or cardio room by signing up for a time slot in advance, which allows staff to disinfect the equipment in between usage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last spring, Amy M. Zhou ’21 went to sleep at 2 a.m., woke up at 6 a.m., went back to sleep at noon, and woke up at 4 p.m. each day. Classes had transitioned online, and Zhou had to accommodate Cambridge timetables from 14 time zones away.
Zhou, an Australian international student, said avoiding that hectic class schedule was her top priority this fall.
“I set very strict boundaries in terms of when classes could start and end, which were that classes would have to end before midnight, and then the earliest they could start was 7 a.m. And these are all in my time,” she said.
For smaller classes, Zhou asked professors if they could shift the course meeting times, though she said they refused. Accounting for these restrictions, Zhou said her boundaries immediately eliminated 60 percent of her course options this fall.
Zhou and other international students said professors’ lack of accommodation has both curtailed their course options and forced them to adopt unsustainable schedules that keep them up at all hours. Others said time differences have barred them from accessing office hours and extracurricular activities. Though there is no typical Harvard experience this fall, many international students say they are getting less out of their semester than their fellow undergraduates.
While Zhou said she could have petitioned for campus housing, she ultimately decided to study at home. She said the virtual semester forced her to weigh a better educational experience against time with family.
“If I were to live near Boston, or live on campus, or just live in the states in general, that is forgoing time that I can spend with family,” she said. “I actually considered taking a semester off because I wanted to value my family time, but I also did want to forgo the quality of my education.”
“It’s just this huge opportunity cost,” she added.
Arhan Kumar ’23, who is living at his home in New Delhi, said Harvard has not made good on its promises to accommodate international students.
“I think the way the time zones have been managed is absolutely deplorable,” he said. “ I feel cheated.”
Kumar said he could not take his preferred Gen Ed because the class took place at 5 a.m. his time, and the professor declined to make special arrangements for him. Even without that course, his schedule is grueling: On his best days, he has classes from 8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. On middling days, he has class from 6:30 p.m. until 3 a.m. And on his worst day, he has class from 12:15 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.
“After my classes, all I really want to do is sleep, which I can't,” he added. “So I do my work in suboptimal conditions until I really can't take it and then wake up the next day at a suboptimal time to continue working, and then go on to take my classes at a suboptimal time.”
Kumar said that he would “certainly” take a leave of absence if not for Harvard’s policy that it cannot guarantee students on-campus housing upon their return. He wrote to the administration asking that they make an exception to the policy for international students struggling with time zones, but did not receive his desired response.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane said the College may be unable to offer every student housing if large numbers of students seek to return to campus en masse.
“In the event there is excess demand for housing in academic year 21–22 or thereafter, Harvard will establish and share a process through which students may apply for undergraduate residential housing,” Dane wrote. “International first year students who took a gap year are guaranteed housing under, as announced.”
Dane wrote that the administration has urged faculty to be “flexible” with students. She added that administrators encouraged students to email their instructor or other course staff members if they are facing any urgent issues. If instructors fail to respond in a timely manner, students can also contact their resident deans.
Dane added that the College began surveying undergraduates Monday to gauge their ability to engage with their courses.
Some students said their professors have worked with them to create more sustainable course schedules. Beverly J. Fu ’24, who is living at home in Singapore, said she has found faculty “super accommodating.”
She said her earliest class is at 7:30 p.m. and her latest at 2:45 a.m. — though the latter lecture is recorded, so she can watch it asynchronously. She usually pushes through, however, and relies on sleeping from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the afternoon.
“I do think that this is a reasonable schedule, like staying up till 1:30 p.m. on average is not something that I wouldn't consider doing, even if I was on campus,” she said.
“One thing is office hours, I would say are very hard to attend sometimes,” she added. “For the afternoon office hours, that goes to like 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. in Singapore-slash-South Asian time zones, which can be difficult.”
Prabidhik Kc ’23 said his astrophysics and physics classes originally hosted office hours around 2 or 3 p.m., but shifted to a more convenient time.
“I asked if they could shift the time, and they were happy to change it and then yeah, so I at least can go to half of the office hours,” he said.
Beyond academics, a number of international students said they are struggling to maintain a lively commitment to their extracurricular activities.
“My extracurriculars are all but dead,” Kumar — who participates in several music organizations — said. “I'm forced because of my time zone to opt out of synchronously participating in my extracurriculars.”
“My life at home has been reduced to academic work,” he added.
Zhou said that, while she understands the challenges students’ varying time zones present, such issues have siloed her from undergraduate life.
“I can't attend a lot of the speaker and social events that either my house or clubs just the Harvard student board puts on,” Zhou said. “I think that makes it really easy for me, and other international students who are on this side of the world, to feel isolated.”
“At the same time, I realized this is difficult because we are a minority, and it can be difficult to try to accommodate everyone's requests,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will expand its coronavirus testing program to nearly 500 undergraduates living in areas adjacent to campus, according to a Monday email penned by Harvard University Health Services Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen.
“While the pilot is voluntary, the University is strongly encouraging you to participate,” Nguyen wrote in the email to off-campus undergraduates. “Doing so provides a greater opportunity for you to assist in efforts to keep Harvard healthy and better ensure the health and wellbeing of every member of our community.”
Under the current regimen, the University provides coronavirus tests to undergraduate students living on campus, who are required to take a coronavirus test every two to three days. The testing expansion would allow for 484 enrolled undergraduates living in the greater Cambridge area to take part in weekly COVID-19 screening tests until Nov. 22.
The University expanded the testing pilot as a precautionary measure as more off-campus and on-campus students begin to interact, according to Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Earlier this month, reports of large groups of students congregating — often maskless — by the Charles River drew stern criticism from Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair. In an email to on-campus students, O’Dair urged undergraduates to remain “vigilant” and to gather in small groups “consistent with public health guidelines.” Last week, HUHS emailed several undergraduates living off-campus asking them to report for testing and noting that the University was monitoring “recent cases among student athletes.”
Nguyen wrote that eligible off-campus students will have until Wednesday, Sept. 30 to indicate whether they plan to participate in the pilot screening program, after which they must complete a COVID-19 safety awareness training required by the state of Massachusetts and create an account with Color, a health testing company, to receive testing kits, alerts, and test results.
Students opting into the program will receive eight self-administered COVID-19 testing kits by mail. They can then drop off their samples at the HUHS clinic each week.
Testing serves as just one tenet of the College’s larger plan to curb the spread of coronavirus on campus. Undergraduates living in residence are also expected to comply with the “community compact” — a list of guidelines for living on campus.
Students found in defiance of the community compact guidelines report to the Community Council — an assembly of select students, faculty, and residential staff — which reviews violations of the College’s social distancing rules and doles out warnings to non-compliant students.
Though off-campus students are not subjected to community compact guidelines, Nguyen encouraged them to take advantage of the College’s COVID-19 testing resources to help maintain the health of Harvard affiliates.
“The pilot builds on the robust screening protocols we put in place for on-campus students and personnel in conjunction with the start of the fall semester,” Nguyen wrote. “With your participation in this pilot, you will help us in our ongoing work to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the health and wellbeing of our Harvard community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company returned 7.3 percent on its investments for fiscal year 2020, bringing the value of the University’s endowment to $41.9 billion, the largest sum in its history.
The returns were announced in a note from HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar to University affiliates Tuesday morning. The returns marked a slight increase from 2019, when the endowment returned 6.5 percent on its investments.
At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts speculated that the size of Harvard’s endowment could shrink in the event of an economic downturn. In April, Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister cited estimates that the endowment could be valued in the mid-30 billion range this year.
Those concerns did not come to fruition.
Still, administrators say that Harvard has faced increased expenses as a result of the pandemic. In an interview with The Crimson on Friday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said that Harvard has incurred “significant” COVID-related costs, including tens of millions of dollars in testing for University affiliates.
Hollister said the University’s revenue had likely declined in fiscal year 2020 — and would likely decline in fiscal year 2021 — in an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University publication, last week.

“We face extraordinary, in some ways unprecedented, challenges related to the pandemic and ones that extend beyond it, including the economy, politics, societal inequities, and pressures in higher education. Each of these forces could have an effect, in varying degrees, on the University’s financial outlook for the year,” Hollister said.
Bacow, University Provost Alan M. Garber '76, and University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp credited the University’s post-2008 recession planning for the strong returns in an email to University affiliates Tuesday morning.
“This good news is particularly welcome at a time when the University projects revenue losses and budget shortfalls due to the cancellation of many activities, as well as additional outlays related to management of the pandemic. Our ability to absorb those revenue losses and unanticipated costs is greatly strengthened by the substantial steps Harvard has taken since the financial crisis of 2008 to prepare for such contingencies,” they wrote.
Bacow, Garber and Lapp also announced that Harvard will make an additional $20 million available to its degree-granting schools.
“We hope these funds will help each School take measures to protect the health of our community, including testing, contact tracing, and facility modification, as it responds to the unique challenges that it faces as a consequence of the pandemic,” they wrote.
Bacow, Garber and Lapp wrote that nearly 700 eligible staff members elected to participate in the University’s 2020 Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program.
Other Ivy League schools also reported positive returns for the year. Yale’s endowment returned 6.8 percent to total $31.2 billion, and Dartmouth’s returned 7.6 percent to total $6 billion. MIT's returned 8.3 percent for the fiscal year, totalling $18.4 billion.
In light of the pandemic, activists have pressured the University to use its endowment to cover worker expenses.
The Harvard Corporation has since announced that Harvard will make 3 percent of all restricted funds in the endowment available for immediate use as part of a “special assessment” of the University’s finances.
Through the years, the size and use of Harvard's endowment has drawn scrutiny. Student groups have long advocated for the University to divest its endowment from a number of entities, including fossil fuels, the prison industry, and Puerto Rican debt.
The University recently announced that it will transition its endowment to become fossil-fuel neutral by 2050, a move that has received criticism from divestment activists.
Narvekar noted in his message that the University is in the process of restructuring its endowment management and shifting its portfolio as part of Harvard Management Company’s five-year plan.
“Our team remains confident that the changes being made to both the portfolio and the organization’s systems, structure, and culture will serve the university well and generate the long-term returns on which Harvard relies,” Narvekar wrote.
Narvekar wrote that further details on HMC’s portfolio performance will be available in the University’s financial report in October.

We used to live in simpler times, when flirting with a new cutie was as easy as forming a study group and making eyes at them over your Stat 110 problem set. But alas, wooing is a little more challenging when you have to stay six feet apart and you can’t really hear what they’re saying under their mask. So what’s a luvah to do? Don’t worry, we’ve got you. Read on for how to (safely) make that COVID-crush turn into a COVID-Connection.
Practice Your Smize
Flirting is all about the eyes, so if you’re lucky enough to be able to see your crush in real life, make sure you’re ready to be smiling with your eyes (“smizing”) like you’re on America’s Next Top Model. But seriously, let the person know you’re into them by communicating! It can be hard to read someone’s expression when you can’t see most of their face, but giving off other good body language like sustained eye contact, laughter, or generally just paying attention to what they’re saying can go a long way.
Picnic Like Your Life Depends On It
Seriously — it might. And if not now, when? Outdoor dates are already the cutest dates, so grab your HUDS meal and make for the river with your crush (and your masks!) Nothing says young love like eating cold chickpeas together. Bonus points if you find a spot a little more unusual than the river, because exploring together will make the memories all the stronger.
Go Virtual
If you can’t actually see your crush in real life, never fear. Zoom chats are about to be your next best friend. Slide into their ZMs and ask to study, or ask to date, or ask to get married, depending upon how big/requited the crush is. Just make sure it’s a private message! You can play it cool and ask to work on a pset together, or full send and just ask to hang out, in-person or online.
Online Dating
It’s a thing, it was a thing before, and it will continue to be a thing. Get swiping, messaging, and doing whatever makes you happy. Worst comes to worst, you won’t meet the love of your life, but might walk away with lots of pictures of people’s cute dogs. Best case? Let’s talk about that picnic (can you say charcuterie board?) one more time, and maybe you’ll get to meet someone’s puppy.
Sure, life is weird, everything is weird. The opportunities for a dance floor makeout or a meet cute anywhere but the laundry room have gone down, but dating doesn’t have to be over. So go find some quarantine cuties.
