This Review Contains Spoilers for “The Good Place” Season One.
It can be hard for a show to recover from a major twist, and it’s hard to think of a more earth-shattering twist than the one that “The Good Place” revealed in its Season One finale. The NBC comedy follows Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) and three other people who have died and gone to the “Good Place,” as well as Michael (Ted Danson), the seemingly-benevolent designer and guide of their particular neighborhood. Produced by Michael Schur, the creator of both “Parks and Recreation” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “The Good Place” stood out from the vast majority of broadcast television with its unique premise and delightful cast of characters.
However, the finale of Season One engendered as much anxiety as it did excitement. The last ten minutes of the episode turned all the events that preceded them on their head with the revelation that the whole world of the show was a lie, right down to the title. Eleanor and her friends had not been sent to the “Good Place” by mistake. Instead, they were quite correctly sent to the Bad Place. The entire first season had been a carefully concocted scenario designed to get the protagonists to torture each other, with everyone’s flaws and neuroses building upon the others.
The premiere of Season Two picks up right where Season One left off. Michael has wiped everyone’s memories and reset the entire scenario. While Eleanor is still very much the lead, Season Two continues building up the secondary characters. All four of the humans get relatively equal weight in this double episode premiere. Everyone has their own brand-new, diabolical torture: Tahani (Jameela Jamil), for instance, is called on her life-long bluff of humility, while the supremely indecisive Chidi (William Jackson Harper) is finally given a choice he can make, only to have it snatched away from him at the last second.
But by far one the best decision Schur and his creative team have made in resetting their show is to focus more on Michael as a character. He was given plenty of screentime in the show’s first season, and has always been one of the funniest and most charming aspects of the show. Given that audiences only ever saw him through other characters’ eyes, however, his true opinions and intentions were masked. Now that his angelic mask has slipped, we are able to see and understand so much more of him and his demonic assistants.
Sadly, with Michael playing a more prominent role, Janet (D’Arcy Carden), the omniscient guide to the “Good Place,” has been reset with the rest of the artificial paradise. This means her budding insane-yet-adorable marital bliss with Jason (Manny Jacinto) has been, at least temporarily, forgotten by both parties. She’s still a hilarious and weirdly relatable character, but so much of her personality was built on the tweaks Michael made during Season One, as well as her relationships with the other characters. With the reset, all these have been forgotten.
Schur and his writers have made a bold decision in terms of the direction of this season. The end of the premiere is yet another (unauthorized) reset. It seems unlikely that they will be able to pull this off more than a few more times, but the double header premiere, “Everything Is Great!,” certainly sets up a “Groundhog Day” approach to the show’s second season. Thus far, the showrunners have handled a strange and difficult concept expertly, but with every twist, reveal, and total reset, they are only making an already tough job tougher. For now, however, it seems wise just to trust the creators of “The Good Place,” and enjoy the ride.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We all know a bitcoin bro. Also called the tech bro or the brogrammer, they can be found trading bitcoin, or some other form of cryptocurrency, and providing regular—and often unsolicited—updates on how much money they’re making. They write long-winded Facebook statuses on entrepreneurship, the power of positivity, and motivation. They idolize Elon Musk, share countless posts about SpaceX, and drool over the prospect of colonizing Mars one day. They love virtual reality, augmented reality, any reality where the Scarlett Johansson-voiced artificial intelligence from “Her” is real. They are constantly forming startups that seek to “disrupt” an industry, or that seek to be “like Uber, but for [groceries/toothbrushes/lint rollers].”
And these are almost always men, working with colleagues or co-founders who are also men, who all pride themselves on being bros who just want to “bro down and crush some code.” Being a bitcoin bro isn’t just defined by your occupation or hobby; it’s a lifestyle, an image, an aesthetic. And this aesthetic is overwhelmingly characterized by a desire to exclude women. Beneath their inspirational TEDtalks and their grand ideas of creating a better future for humanity lies a deep-rooted disdain for women and subconscious belief in male superiority.
This sentiment was rendered most explicitly in the anti-diversity memo that circulated around Google, where a male Google employee claimed that women are underrepresented in tech because, “the abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes.” But this was by no means an isolated incident. Sexism is rampant in the tech industry, and it shows in the numbers. A whopping 27 percent of women cited toxic workplace culture as a primary reason for leaving their job in the tech industry. As a result, major companies such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Microsoft have massive gender disparities, with women making up less than 20 percent of employees in tech roles.
It’s not shocking why so many women are deterred from working in tech. UploadVR, a San Francisco-based virtual reality startup, is alleged to have regularly hired female strippers and prostitutes for company parties, sent out emails about looking for “submissive Asian women” on fundraising trips, and even have had a “kink room” in the office so that male employees could have sexual intercourse in the office. Meanwhile, women were expected to clean up after events because they were “mommies.” And when women speak up about these incidents, they are silenced. Elon Musk’s company Tesla responded to a female engineer who complained about catcalls and sexual harassment by firing her.
Bitcoin bros simply don’t value women or see them as their intellectual equals. Until he was called out by a Vice article, Elon Musk did not follow a single woman on Twitter. He has not retweeted a woman in his last 100 tweets, and the last woman he retweeted was his mother. Apparently there’s not a single woman in the world whose ideas he deems important. But while he doesn’t appreciate women for their brains, he certainly does appreciate women for their sex appeal—which is evident in the way that he transformed his first wife into a blonde trophy wife, and the way that he chases after pretty actresses like Amber Heard.
Across the industry, bitcoin bros systematically treat women as pretty sex objects rather than their professional peers. And the consequences of this devaluation of female intelligence are considerable. Studies have found that venture capitalists are four times more likely to fund all-male startups than those with even a single female founder. Even though startups created by women perform 63 percent better than those with all-male leadership, venture capitalists continue to deny women-led businesses the funding that they would need in order to succeed. Instead, male venture capitalists are more likely to use meetings with female entrepreneurs as opportunities to sleep with them.
And these prejudices also trickle into the products and services that the tech industry delivers. The tech industry prides itself on shaping the future of our society. But when bitcoin bros are in charge, what we end up with is a vision of a future where women are marginalized and subjugated.
Our subconscious biases invariably manifest themselves in the observations we make and the conclusions we reach, making even “objective” claims very much so subjective. This is even more so the case in the tech industry. Artificial intelligence is extremely prejudiced simply because their programmers are extremely prejudiced. Machine-learning software is trained on datasets, and programmers often unconsciously inject biases into their software.
As a result, AI software been found to associate images of shopping and washing with women and images of coaching and shooting with men, and they have also been found to associate female names with artistic terms, and male names with math and science terms. And unlike humans, algorithms are often unequipped to counteract learned biases. This is why Twitter was able to teach Microsoft’s AI chatbot to be a misogynistic and racist Nazi in less than a day. Robots mirror their programmers—and if programmers believe that women have nothing to contribute to society besides cooking and sex, then the robots they create will end up echoing and amplifying those beliefs.
Technology can play an crucial role in creating a better and more equitable future for society. But unless the tech industry stops being such a hostile and toxic environment for women, our future is going to end up looking exactly like our present.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From star-studded athletes to budding entrepreneurs to accomplished scholars, Harvard is brimming with nearly unlimited talent, but I’ve found that my amazing peers are also often full of self-deprecation and insecurity.
Recently, a friend recounted a social experiment she had performed. After a Harvard Student Agencies event, she was left with a box of Insomnia cookies. Instead of simply handing them out to the people studying in her dining hall, she formulated an idea: She would give people cookies on the condition that they answered her question, “What do you love the most about yourself?”
Some students could not give a straight answer. Balking, they would belittle themselves: Answers were murmured along the lines of “I don’t know, I haven’t done anything that great,” or, “I can’t think of anything, I just want a cookie.”
My friend was not surprised, and neither was I. At Harvard, people have invariably impressive achievements, but very few of them are proud to be who they are. As The Incredibles’ Syndrome famously prophesied, “When everyone’s super, no one is.” One never feels that the nagging “I-don’t-deserve-to-be-here” insecurity is ever fully dispelled because of the tremendousness of their peers. And such insecurity manifests itself in a vicious cycle of self-justificatory scapegoating: Athletes, minorities, and non-coastal students constantly hear the narrative that they are not as deserving an admit as others, and even the legacy student, the paragon of privilege, is mercilessly cut down in this zero-sum “belonging” game. But paradoxically, students spend so much energy convincing others of their worth that they stop believing their own words in the process.
Even though students are fixated with their external accomplishments at the expense of their own ego, this is not to say that students here are all cutthroat. Go to any dining hall past 10 p.m. on a weeknight, and you will hear a warm din of conversation as students huddle together talking through problem sets, sharing stacks of cookies from Brain Break. Collaboration is part of the culture here, but that collaboration too often is belied by competition; helping a peer with their homework is often perceived as a small intellectual victory, lorded over the peer through subtle patronizing and mocking gossip with other friends. Working together is common, but Harvard kids do not always play nice.
Many friendships I have observed are structured around this strange mix of support and competition. Many people I know care deeply about one another, carrying boxes for one another during move-in or staying up sleepless nights to listen to a friend distressed by a break-up. But these friendships also too often hide conceits; an incredulous look when a friend forgets how to integrate an equation or a condescending joke when a friend bungles the name of the latest Trump advisor to be fired often reflect a smug superiority. The high expectations of Harvard have made even intimate friendships crucibles of one-upmanship, that, at best, cause a culture of insecurity, and at worse, drive many to self-loathing and depression.
And, as my experimenting friend pointed out, these pernicious attitudes are quite contagious. One insecure person can cause those around them to start to doubt themselves too. “He is worried about his chances of getting into medical school—should I be worried too?” “She is only sleeping six hours a night—am I not working hard enough?” “They are comping three clubs—why am I only involved in one?” As is the case with mumps, Harvard has historical problems with infectious breakouts of self-doubt.
Luckily for us, students can combat the school’s anxiety-inducing culture in a straightforward manner. Simply, students have to start loving themselves. To my undergraduate audience, it helps to remember that each of you was accepted into this college because of your awe-inspiring abilities and character, and yes, that each of you deserves a spot here. There is nothing more you need to prove to anyone, regardless of the snide look the “section kid” gave you when you mispronounced “Habermas.” You do not need to participate in any extracurriculars to prove anything, or ever sleep less than eight hours. You do not need to singlehandedly vanquish that problem set that your friends asked you if you had finished. You do not need a prestigious job or a fancy fellowship. Some of my closest friends neither do extracurriculars, excel on their problem sets, sacrifice sleep for work, nor accrue LinkedIn-type accomplishments, yet, as with everyone else here, I am still astounded by their brilliance everyday.
While easier said than done, this initial recognition of deserving to be here is a good first step to propagating the self-confidence needed to reform our overly-competitive culture. And, if loving yourself isn’t working out for you, try to find other people that are loving themselves. You might find their confidence contagious.
Changing Harvard’s culture is not a hopeless goal. For every student mired in insecurity, there is another that has accepted themselves with brave confidence. For example, when my friend asked one person what they love about themselves, they replied, “Not letting Harvard get to me.” It is this attitude of proud defiance that can transform a culture and a school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My grandmother moved into an assisted living home last month. After 52 years living in an old two-story bed and breakfast, surrounded by knick-knacks and colored glass dishes, she stepped into her new 18-by-21 square foot room and looked around. The walls were white with pictures of bland pastel daisies. The tiled floor was pale yellow, and the stiff double bed faced a boxy TV monitor. The air sagged with cleaning products. Her eyes were fixed on the window.
“I’ve spent my life collecting pretty things,” she said. “And now I have none of them.”
What do we spend our lives collecting?
Playground friends, class president votes, extracurricular leadership positions, high grades, acceptance letters, resume boosters, Instagram likes, high-end internships, prestigious fellowships, networking relationships, salary digits, stock options, professional awards, vacation houses, fancy cars, growing dividends, successful children, precocious grandchildren, perfect memories—they may not collect dust like my grandma’s glassware, but we store up these pretty things all the same. We’re comfortable in the clutter; in fact, we crave it.
The German philosopher Walter Benjamin writes that we collect things for the feeling of renewal that accompanies our collecting. We don’t care about fancy dishes in themselves; what we really care about is the thrill of adding them to our collection—breathing new life into the sugar dish on a forgotten antique store shelf by giving it a place on our counter, next to the other resurrected things. And when all our time is spent pruning and polishing that collection, what we have becomes who we are. We collect not to bring new life to things, but to bring new life to ourselves. Winning the next prize or game or fellowship is how we feel good about ourselves—and how we feel like ourselves at all. Acquiring becomes our way of breathing.
What happens when we can no longer keep acquiring?
When we’re too old or tired or simply unable to continue probing antique stores or stock markets, we’ll lose the thrill of renewal by acquisition. We may not have to pack away our material possessions like my grandmother did, but our collections will nonetheless reach static equilibrium. We’ll no longer be able to look toward what we’ll have next; instead, we’ll have to find ourselves—find a way to breathe—with what we already have.
But do we ever really have our pretty things? Collecting assumes we own whatever we collect. We like to call money, houses, cars, trophies, or dishware our material “possessions,” but we really just borrow them for a little while. They collect dust on our shelves for at most a few decades, and then move on to the next collector when we’re gone.
Intangible pretty things are no different. Quoting “carpe diem,” we may prioritize memorable experiences over material possessions, thinking memories will never rust, collect dust, or take up too much space. But the problem is that all pretty things—concrete or conceptual—are slippery. We forget that after we’ve “seized the day,” we can never quite manage to hold onto it. Experiences almost immediately become memories, and memories fade. As we forget or misremember them, they are no more permanently our own than fancy dishes, bank accounts, or other pretty things.
When we one day walk into the 18-by-21 foot room with white walls and yellow tiled floors, all we’re really going to have is ourselves. And the kind of person we’re left with will depend on what we’ve spent our lives collecting. Pretty things are ephemeral—memories fade, money dwindles, prestige dampens, glassware breaks—but their effect on our character is permanent. Material possessions, skills, relationships, experiences, and memories color the way we think, perceive, feel, act, and believe. What we have is who we are because where our treasure is, there our heart will be also.
What do we spend our lives collecting? We should think about that. Our answer will tell us who we are—and who we will be once we can no longer keep collecting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2016, University President Drew G. Faust convened the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging with representative professors, staff, alumni, and undergraduates to evaluate and give recommendations on inclusivity concerns on campus. After almost a year of studying diversity issues across the University, the task force has issued a draft of its executive summary. It recommends a number of funding initiatives and assessment methods as well as the creation of a central administrator, who would oversee the offices and initiatives concerning diversity and inclusion across Harvard’s campus.
We applaud the University for producing this report and looking at issues of inclusion and belonging on this campus. We believe, however, that some of these suggestions could fall short of their objectives, especially in regards to the creation of a central diversity administrator. The appointment of a single administrator to look at these issues across the University would be myopic without involving greater student input. For example,  the administration could create a body of  student representatives from across all the schools to  aid in the search for an administrator.
Student input is crucial to ensure that the University truly understands student needs and adopts the right solutions. The central administrator should have the responsibility of meeting regularly with student groups, especially those representing individuals who have traditionally been marginalized, whether that be racially, socio-economically, or ideologically.
In addition, we urge the University to assemble a coalition of student representatives from across all the schools to work on these issues in close partnership with the central administrator. Adding more student voices ensures a well-represented sample of the varied experiences of our diverse student body. These students will give greater clarity for issues such as creating additional multicultural centers and an Ethnic Studies department. However, this group should work to create tangible action rather than just exist as a committee in name. A partnership with the central administrator will help ensure that the conclusions of the group are turned into action.

The first thing I noticed were her shoes: black loafers with tassels on top, the heel low in an informal way. The second thing I noticed was the way she smiled into her phone, lazily snacking on the bar nuts in front of her.
I met Lea at a cocktail bar in Madrid during my last week traveling and writing through Portugal and Spain. I had been alone for almost two months, and had developed a concerning but useful habit of eavesdropping on other people’s conversations. I’d overheard stories about marital strife, tween gossip, and workplace drama, and come to terms with my own inability to interpret a word of native Spanish. Nosiness became routine.
Lea had been on the phone with a friend, telling her about the sort-of-boyfriend coming into Madrid to see her the next day, and asking whether making a dinner reservation was too serious. The conversation with the friend seemed inconclusive, but when Lea hung up she immediately dialed a restaurant and requested a table for two. When the first restaurant didn’t have a terrace option available, she called a different spot. Lea knew what she wanted.
She moved the phone from her mouth and gestured to the bartender for a second drink. I watched out of the corner of my eye, passively taking in her actions as the bar buzzed around her. Lea, who at this point was still Girl At The Bar, had set off a slew of questions in my head, rapid-fire.
“Do you want some of these?”
Her voice cut through that unraveling spool of thoughts, suspending them frozen. As I’d begun to imagine this girl’s life, content to muse in silence, it had not occurred to me that we’d speak. But as she slid the bar nuts across the smooth wooden surface towards me, I was snapped out of my daydreams. I felt almost guilty. Like I’d been caught.
The ensuing conversation was comfortable, though. Real-life Lea was better than the persona I’d conjured in my head. She was born in Salzburg, raised in Vienna, and now lived in Madrid. She agreed with me that Madrid was underappreciated as a European city, and laughed lightly when I described how Americans only ever wanted to visit Barcelona. She traveled across Europe regularly for work. Lea’s favorite café in Madrid was Celicioso—the one on Calle Barquillo, not the other one. Lea’s favorite city to visit was Zurich. Everything Lea described seemed to glow around the edges. Lea was relaxed but enthusiastic, unintimidating but effortlessly cool, sarcastic but kind.
We talked for an hour and then went our separate ways, Lea to her apartment and I to my hostel.
Lea falls short of “exciting” when people ask me who I met in Europe. I mention the 60-year-old woman who had crossed the Atlantic to Portugal in a sailboat, or the recent college graduate hiking Europe’s major mountain ranges before beginning work in finance. Nothing about Lea feels particularly worth sharing, yet I think about our brief conversation almost daily.
I wonder how much of that is about Lea. After that night, Lea went back to her own life. The sort-of-boyfriend was arriving in Madrid the next day; the terrace reservation had been made; the table at her favorite café would be waiting. For me, Lea lingered. But she lingered as an idea–and has stayed an idea–for weeks and weeks since I sat at that bar.
It’s human nature to obsess over other people, but this type of enduring enchantment with such a small moment means something else. I saw a bit of myself in Lea—or, at least, a bit of who I want to be. Maybe it wasn’t Lea herself, or what she said in our conversation, but rather what I realized about myself since then that’s made an impact.
“Oh, Zurich in the fall is fantastic!”
“I was just thinking I needed to get to Greece again– you’ll love the history there.”
“Next time you’re in London, I have a spot for you.”
I want more of what Lea had—the ease with which she shared the world. I soaked up her poise, subtle enthusiasm, and understated confidence greedily.
I might be imagining it, but I feel that I even held myself differently walking out of the bar than when I’d walked in. In my through-the-keyhole peek into Lea’s life, I saw the upbeat and self-assured way I want to interact with the world around me.
My intense (borderline obsessive) experience at the bar was less about Lea than I initially thought. I was open to her, but in reality everything that happened was in my head. Let interesting people drift into your life and let them offer you their bar nuts, but don’t give them all the credit. Often what we see and value in other people is a reflection of what we realize about ourselves—who we want to be, which is much more important than any one conversation at a cocktail bar.

Brrrrring!!! The sound of the ID swipe machine outside the dhall chimes as Leverett House Checker Bonnie Lee Kimball welcomes Leverett House residents in for dinner. Trying to get into Lev on a Thursday evening during Community Dinner? If you’re not in Lev, then not on Bonnie’s watch. Everyone knows Bonnie, but few know anything beyond her friendly smile and distinctive blue hair. FM pulled up a seat at Bonnie’s checker desk to learn more about her.
FM: Your name is Bonnie, but why does your name tag say BonLee?
BK: My nametag says BonLee because I interacted with a student last year who had the same middle name as me, which is Lee. I told him that I never liked my name because people mispronounced it. So, the student said, “Why don’t we just take your first name and middle name and put them together and call you BonLee!” I loved it! I absolutely loved it!”
FM: Where are you from?
BK: I am from Somerville, Mass. We moved to Charlestown, the next town over, then we moved to Dorchester when I was 16. You see right there [on my hand] that’s the dot right there, the Dorchester Dot, the “Dot Dot.” The dot shows that I was a toughy in my neighborhood.
FM: What did you do before Harvard?
BK: This is actually not my type of work, but I have stayed here for 17 years. I was previously in administration for a couple of companies like the Boston Red Sox. Then my job folded and I needed to work because I had three kids. My son was dating a girl at the time that works here at Leverett House and she told me that there was a position open. I got hired in the dish room and worked my way up to here to be the Leverett House Checker. I love what I do, it makes me happy.
FM: Have you always been in Leverett House?
BK: Yes, I’ve never been anywhere else. Even if the pay was better, I would still stay in Leverett. They tried that once. They told me that they needed me to work someplace else and I just didn’t answer the phone calls I kept getting. I wanted to stay in Leverett.
FM: What’s the most interesting thing you’ve seen from this desk?
BK:  I’ve watched a lot of sweet moments sitting in this chair. A favorite one is when I watched Chief and Coach [the Leverett House Deans] share a kiss right over there (she points to the door). Oh another time, a girl came over to me and asked for some relationship advice. She told me she was seeing an older man, but didn’t think she had the time to devote to him, and he was falling in love with her. I told her that she should end it and wait, and she listened to me.
FM: How do you know if someone is in Lev or not in Lev?
BK: (Pointing to people as they enter) She’s Leverett. She’s Leverett. They’re Leverett. He’s not Leverett.
Bonnie swipes the Leverett resident’s ID cards, and hands them back with a smile.
FM: What is your absolute favorite memory from your time here?
BK: On December 5th or 6th of 2011, the Dean of Leverett came up to me and said, “I hear you are a fan of Lionel Richie.” I was like, “Yes I am.” He said, “Well, he’s over at Eliot House getting an award. Would you like to go and meet him?” I said yes, but that I had to work until 8 o’clock.
I get to the door and there’s a Harvard police officer and he says, “Are you Bonnie? Go right in.” Then I saw the Dean, and she said I had to go over and get an autograph. I didn’t think I had a shot at getting that.
When [Richie] was done with his speech, he went over to the other side of the room. I was like 20 people in back of him and I start belting out a song of his. He turned around, came up to me, put his arm around me, and joined in. Everyone got out of our way, we were taking all kinds of pictures. After, people enlarged the photos and put them behind my desk, calling me the next Mrs. Lionel Richie.
FM: Wow. That’s got to be your number one favorite memory.
BK: My number one is that I feel really happy when I’m here. I live alone and this is where I want to be until I retire.

“B B B B B…”
I’d really like to play ‘Happy Birthday’ on this xylophone. I can always play the song in the key of C, but the song starts on C… B… A… G. The song starts on a G and the lowest note on the xylophone is a C, so I would have to start the song A… B… C… D… E…  F… G… eight notes above where the G usually lies. But skipping around like that is too tricky and it wouldn’t sound quite right. The only solution is to play the song starting on the lowest note on the xylophone, C, which would make the song in the key of C… D… E… F. But the key of F has a B-flat in it. And this xylophone—this slobbered-all-over, rainbow-colored, banged-up-plastic, mallet-attached-on-a-string staple of any kindergarten classroom—does not. Just my luck.
“F F F F F…”

“This is your child’s handwriting homework booklet. We will be following a program called ‘Handwriting Without Tears’ in class and the children will be asked to complete a page at home that corresponds to the work we cover in class.” Sincerely, The Kindergarten Teachers.
Page after page of “My Alphabet Book” contains just that—line upon line replete with meticulous strings of letters, each one expertly chosen in a specific sequence like a well-thought-out 10-course meal. ‘L’, ‘F’, and ‘E’ were learned first, for example, because “they all start at the top and are easier to recognize.” At least according to The Kindergarten Teachers.
“L L L L L…”
Each letter is crafted in spidery, arthritic strokes that must have taken the author seconds each to draw. Beneath the wavering, penciled-in tracings of the more “difficult” letters, it is not uncommon to see the page streaked with pink-and-gray erasures where the upstroke of an ‘N’ had wandered too far to the right or one ‘W’ had thoughtlessly conjoined with another. For the direst transgressions—an ‘F’ that had failed to span completely the width of the paper’s dotted guidelines, just to name one—a dictatorial red pen smothers the pencil with ‘X’s that the teacher seems to have plagiarized from the ‘X’ page found only later in the book.
“D D D D D…”
The more exemplary pages—ones in which the ‘O’s go all the way around and the ‘U’s not quite so—have red stamps instead. “You’re a STAR!” shouts a particularly enthusiastic anthropomorphic star. “Good Job!” reads an apple with a face mysteriously similar to that of the star. “Good Writing,” however, appears most often.
“My Alphabet Book” is not “Good Writing.” It’s not “writing,” even. Each letter is written by a five-year-old who knows no better than to follow a well-worn template. Each letter is a literal carbon copy of the letter directly preceding it, and the letter before that one is printed as a template in the book. There is absolutely nothing in this book that gives even the faintest nod in the direction of how the “writer” is feeling that day, or whether or not he enjoyed his lunch, or how much he loves (or hates) practicing his handwriting.
Appropriately, the cover of “My Alphabet Book” contains a printed image of a scattered array of random letters vomited from between the front and back cover of a book.
“M M M M M…”
***
Howard E. Gardner ’65, cognitive psychologist and professor at the Graduate School of Education, agrees. “In kindergarten, unless you’re very precocious, you’re not going to be creating sonnets,” Gardner says as he flips through “My Alphabet Book.” “You understand that when people make marks on a page, the point is to either create meaning that you have or create meaning that you want to convey to somebody else.”
The only vestige of the creative mind that birthed “My Alphabet Book” into the world, no more frustrating and mysterious than a bunch of cave drawings, is a worthless set of virtual hieroglyphs. Indeed, Gardner says that “reading and writing are new human inventions, and it could easily be the case that 5,000 years ago, it didn’t exist. People made drawings, but it’s different from writing.”
I can’t help but fear that what I write today—this article included—will share its fate with “My Alphabet Book.” Perhaps someday some chrome-clad critic will squint her beady eyes over my articles and find them to be complete gibberish. Perhaps someday someone will write a new article about this one, questioning its inclusion under the term “writing” almost as much as my editors do at present. But unlike the lucky author of “My Alphabet Book,” I won’t be able to fall back on my being five years young as an excuse.
“Your own understanding is guiding what you’re doing from some kind of a model,” says Gardner, pointing at the templates provided on the page. “You do your best to write it in such a way that at least you can decode it. But optimally, it shouldn’t be just you.”
***
I will admit that there is one element of “My Alphabet Book” that contains some morsel of meaning. On the cover reads the author’s name written in clean, quick, deliberate snaps of a pencil.
What astonishes me is how smooth and practiced the letters in the name look compared to the rest of the letters in my alphabet book. How strange, that letters drawn individually with the sole purpose of perfecting and refining them pale in quality to those the author knew to be part of his name. It is only in a song, after all, that ‘G’, ‘C’ and ‘F’ make sense. It is only as a name that ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ are fully functional.
“by BeNJAMiN SENZER”
It is only in my name that the letters are truly “written.” But I guess I knew that fifteen years ago, too:
“This year in school, I would like to learn: How TO WRiTE.”

I have a foolproof method for making new friends. One flaw: it costs 206 bucks by today’s eBay prices. But I promise it works. Here’s some evidence:
Second semester sophomore year, our suite got a new roommate. I’ll make a token effort at anonymity and call him Charlie. He seemed like a good enough guy, but it’s hard to find your place among nine friends who’ve lived together since freshman year: Our relationship didn’t really extend past the requisite amount of small talk in the bathroom.
When Charlie moved in, he brought with him a TV and a Wii U. These sat unused until spring break when I, alone in the suite, switched them on in a fit of boredom. The icon for Super Smash Bros. 4 blinked at me from the Wii menu. I hit play on that bad boy so quickly I may have dented the controller.
I’m a human being with a heart and two working thumbs, so I’ve been playing Smash since I was six or so. At first, I didn’t have a console of my own, but I had a bunch of friends with GameCubes whose houses I spent more time at than my own. I say “friends,” but in hindsight, I don’t think I particularly cared for most of them. What was really important to me was that sweet, sweet Super Smash Bros. Melee action.
When I was 13, I got a Wii for Christmas. I immediately started saving the $60 necessary for Super Smash Bros. Brawl. That’s one of the things I miss as an “adult” with a job—how the months spent scraping cash together to get that glitzy little thing you want made you enjoy it so much more. When I finally got it, I played through the campaign in record time, sneaking down after my bedtime to finish the game in the dark on a muted TV.
That spring break, picking up a controller and slipping into Smash for the first time in two years just felt right. There’s something about how your hands mold over the control, pointer fingers fluttering over the dodge bumpers. One by one my roommates came back, and one by one they caught the controller I tossed them and joined me on the couch.
Your first game is always tense. There’s a lot of “wow, it’s been a while,” “I was really only good at Melee,” and “huh, Smash? Yeah, I played a little, I guess.” These are all varying degrees of dishonesty. Everyone just wants to save face in case they get crushed. There’s nothing worse than talking shit and then getting it shoved back down your throat.
When Charlie got back, we sheepishly paused our game. I explained that I had been bored and had booted up his system—without asking.
Charlie smiled, shrugged, and asked to jump into the next game. And he crushed us. I’m talking three-stocking three other people on Final Destination. We all laughed, and he admitted that his friends at home were pretty competitive, so he had practiced a lot. So we booted up another. And then another. And then some more until it got late and we got tired, but the next night we were back at it. And then Charlie was our friend.
This year we found ourselves with another new roommate, but this time without a Wii U. When I met our new roommate, it was in passing. “Hey, I’ve got an important question,” I said before leaving.
“Yeah?” he replied, apprehensive.
“Do you have a Wii U? We lost ours and we’re going through Smash withdrawal.”
He smiled. He didn’t, but he said he was in the same Smash-wanting boat that we were. We swapped mains, funny stories, and favorite titles in the series. (Unpopular opinion: Smash 4 is just the most fun for casual play. You need to let Melee go.)
Of course, we’re not friends yet. As I said, we didn’t actually have any Smash, so the conversation ended there. We’ve had one other chat since, about whether the Patriots were the worst or the best team in the NFL. (They’re the best.) I’d love to talk more, it’s just hard to think of excuses to spend time with a complete stranger who has their own social life completely outside your own.
I hope that by now I’ve convinced you that my method works, and that it could work for us again. So hit me up if you’ve got a spare $206 lying around. Don’t worry—I’m pretty sure that donating to friendship counts as charity. Your generosity is bound to get you a tax deduction.

Before last Saturday, I thought that making sustained eye contact with strangers would make me feel a lot like that time I accidentally walked into a business-casual Harvard College Consulting Group party wearing my worst secondhand wool sweater: uncomfortable and itching to get out after thirty seconds.
I was wrong. Gazing into the eyes of the other participants in what Facebook promised would be the World’s Biggest Eye Contact Experiment, I felt surprisingly at ease.
This staring match took place by the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Boston Common last Saturday. A sign invited passersby to find out “Where... The Human Connection [Has] Gone!” and to “Share One Minute of Eye Contact to Find Out!” Another sign commanded us to “Make a Human Connection With Your Eyes.”
I went in with a certain amount of trepidation. What would I Find Out? Where Has the Human Connection Gone?
On Saturday, I took the Red Line to the Common, empty-handed and a little nervous—only to find myself surrounded by smiling individuals with blankets, yoga mats, yoga blocks, and all of the other tools necessary to camp out for hours on slightly damp greenery. We arranged ourselves into an amorphous blob on the grass, waiting for strangers to sit down across from us—to face us and to share one minute of eye contact.
The event description on Facebook suggested that we “allow [ourselves] to be seen and calmly look into the eyes of the person in front of [us].” So 40 or so of us did sit, and were seen, and looked—with varying degrees of calmness—into other people’s eyes. Besides these terse instructions, we were free to structure our interactions however we wanted.
I had my first substantial interaction with a gray-haired woman who stood out because she looked more like your neighborhood soccer mom than the sun-kissed, youthful hippies I’d been expecting. I wish I could say that I chose her for the maternal twinkle in her eyes (they’re green—I can say this with some confidence), but it was really because she was sitting alone and toward the front of the crowd.
Her name was DeeDee and she was a grandmother of five. Her eye contact game was frighteningly strong. I locked gazes with her, sweating profusely in the blazing sun, and eventually—it felt like hours later—had to look away, my eyes burning from the end-of-summer brightness. It wasn’t a competition, but DeeDee had won.
Cowed by my defeat, I moved onto the next person. Participants didn’t seem to have much in common in terms of ethnicity or age, but we all shared a fervor for self-improvement.
I met Pia Moorland, who had come because she was “so used to looking at people’s faces” that she felt an old pro. Moorland is one of three thousand CODAs (children of deaf adults) in the United States. “It’s a culture in itself. You have one foot in one culture and one foot in another. You’re a member of the deaf world and the hearing world, and you’re always in the middle,” she told me.
After we had peered into the depths of each other’s souls for a minute, she told me I was “hard to read.” Her assessment has haunted me ever since: Am I an enigma, a modern-day Mona Lisa, or am I just your typical guarded, emotionless Harvard student? Food for thought.
I also learned some pro tips on how exactly to make eye contact. For example, you’ll soon realize that you can’t gaze into both eyes at the same time. Instead, you’ll have to choose one and focus on it. Nikoletta Kanakis, a tall young woman fresh from Burning Man, told me that the left eye is better, since “it’s closer to the heart.” She also informed me, in her calm, yoga teacher voice, that trying to look at both eyes is “like reading two pages at once—you just can’t do that.”
Making my way back to campus, I found that my eyes took forever to adjust to the harsh fluorescent lighting of the Red Line. But I was careful to avoid making eye contact with my fellow passengers: The rules are different down here, away from the sunshine and the smiling masses of the Common.

Rose, thorn, bud. A few minutes after 7 p.m., 15 women recount the highs and lows of their days at a gathering in the Women’s Center. With icebreakers out of the way, business commences: a conversation about the overlap of environmental justice and labor justice.
This is the Harvard College RAD Collective’s third meeting of the school year. The newly formed Reproductive Justice Action and Dialogue Collective is Harvard College’s only group dedicated to reproductive justice.
Many of RAD’s members first assembled in the Harvard College International Women’s Rights Collective, but eventually felt it wasn’t right to carry that title if they couldn’t devote equal time and energy to each of the many facets of international women’s rights. The organization revamped and changed its focus to reproductive justice.
With that rebranding, the group changed their titular focus from “reproductive rights” to “reproductive justice,” a kind of activism which aims to use social justice to empower women and create sustainable environments for families.
Reproductive justice, a term coined in 1994, adds historically underrepresented identities to the movement and focuses on human rights.
Lack of awareness about these issues on campus is RAD’s “thorn,” but it also drives their work. The group plans to promote reproductive justice at Harvard through informative meetings, presentations, and action-based events. RAD’s focus this year lies with direct action, beginning with events like a recent phone bank to call Senators and protest the Graham-Cassidy health care bill, which would have pulled funding from Planned Parenthood.
RAD’s “rose?” Activism. Lizzy K. Schick ’19, the group’s co-president, says that many students are hesitant about being politically active, something the group hopes to change. “It doesn’t have to be your whole thing at Harvard…Our events are for anybody who wants to get involved,” Schick says.
The group’s mission is to develop increased opportunities for involvement and redefine advocacy on campus. This translates to incorporating the arts and seminar-style “teach ins-in” with more standard advocacy.
“We’re trying to approach the same issue from a variety of different angles,” Zoe A. Kibbelaar ’18, a RAD member, says.
The only requirement to join RAD is curiosity. Some members had never heard the term “reproductive justice” until discovering the organization. There is no comp process—the group’s activities remain open to all. RAD’s “bud,” after all, is the ideas that they hope new members will bring.

“I live under tremendous pressure trying to free my country from Yankee imperialism,” Pedro Albizu Campos, Class of 1921, wrote in a 1931 letter to his college friend Lewis Gannett.
Campos was destined to become a nationalist and revolutionary for his home country of Puerto Rico. But before Campos became a central figure in the fight for Puerto Rican independence, he was a student at Harvard—one of the first from Puerto Rico ever to graduate from Harvard Law School.
The U.S. invaded and colonized Puerto Rico in 1898. Campos, who spoke eight languages, left his home country for Cambridge in 1913 as a translator. At Harvard, he also wrote for the Christian Science Monitor. In 1914, Campos left Harvard to fight in World War I for the 375th Infantry Regiment. In 1921, he returned to campus as a law student.
During his time in law school, Campos became president of the Cosmopolitan Club, a club designed to facilitate conversation between American students and foreign ones. A 1908 article in The Crimson said the club filled a “long-felt want,” as “the average foreigner” at Harvard was not usually encouraged to “approach his American classmates, whose ideas and ideals he [could not] altogether understand.”
Promptly after graduating from Harvard Law School, Campos moved back to his hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Impassioned by his time at Harvard, Campos used his law degree to defend the working class. In 1924, Campos joined the Nationalist Party (PNP). Soon after, the man who had felt “tremendous pressure” to liberate Puerto Rico was acting as the party’s president.
After returning to Puerto Rico, Campos reconnected with Gannett—their friendship is well-documented in the Harvard University Archives. In what is now a fragmented letter, Gannett wrote of U.S.-Puerto Rico relations, “Dear Pete: Do you have any friends up here to whom you occasionally write [your] side of the stories we read about so frequently in the newspaper? If you ever do, I’d like to see a carbon. For I feel very much [out] of touch, and puzzled.”
Gannett wrote that he had “only the warmest and most affectionate memories” of Campos. The revolutionary recalled the “warmth, sincerity, and love that pervaded the extraordinary gatherings at the Gannet hearth.”
Campos’s involvement in the Puerto Rican independence struggle picked up speed in the early 1930’s. A Crimson article from 1950 said the revolutionary “had never been an active alumnus” of Harvard. He had missed his 25th Law School Reunion in 1941 because he was serving a sentence in Atlanta Penitentiary. At the time, Campos’s “insurrectionary activity” piqued the interest of Crimson reporters because he had just been arrested for his alleged involvement in an assassination attempt on President Truman.
Four years later, Campos was making headlines in Cambridge once again, after four Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire on the House of Representatives chamber in Washington. Campos said it was an act of “sublime heroism.” A few days later, Campos and several other Puerto Rican revolutionaries were detained.
During Campos’s time in prison, Gannett worked with the ACLU and friends of Campos, including Filiberto Vázquez and Ruth M. Reynolds, to pardon him from imprisonment.
Despite their best efforts, a 1955 letter to Gannett from Reynolds states that “during the past 21 months [Campos] has been held in solitary confinement, having been returned to prison without an indictment after four Nationalists [Campos not among them] fired upon the United States House of Representatives.” He reported that Campos was incapable of digesting his prison rations or standing up without crutches, and his health only continued to decline. He was pardoned by Governor Marin in 1964 and died a few months later.
Although Campos was severely ill during his final days, he remained a spirit for Puerto Rican independence and human rights even after death. He lived by nationalistic ideals and rejected what he saw as false universalism. In his own words: “I am not one of those that say: ‘I am not nationalistic because I am an internationalist, because I love humanity.’ That man who says that he loves humanity is killing his Puerto Rican brother. Charity begins at home. The one who loves his own people, loves his neighbor. The one who does not love his own people, does not love his neighbor. He is an hypocrite.”

On a sunny July day, a construction crew working on the 1999 renovation of the Holden Chapel made a discovery—the basement walls were lined with human remains. As the crew sifted through century-old drywall, they turned up chunks of skeleton, according to a 1999 Crimson article. Alongside the mangled bones, the group resurfaced one of the more macabre chapters of Harvard’s early history: these bodies had been hidden, not by some sinister killer, but by the University’s very own employees, students, and faculty.
Harvard’s corpse legacy began in late 18th century, when the newly opened Medical School began hiring grave diggers—not to bury bodies, but to exhume them. According to a 2015 history of the so-called “resurrection men” in Synthesis, an undergraduate history of science journal, the diggers snuck into Boston’s burial grounds in search of new graves, stealthily dug up some of the most “fresh” residents, and refilled the graves to avoid arousing suspicion.
Harvard turned to these drastic measures because, as techniques improved, the demand for dissectable cadavers had grown until it could no longer be satisfied legally. Although Massachusetts had less restrictive laws than most states, allowing for human body dissection once every four years, Harvard Medical School was lucky to legally receive one or two cadavers a year––hardly enough for the burgeoning institution where “a single body [was] made to do duty for a whole course of lectures,” according to a 1788 issue of the Boston Gazette.
As the lack of clinical material limited instructional experiences, class sizes, and opportunities for up-close dissection, the quality and quantity of doctors in the United States waned. The inexperience of the dwindling new medical graduates caused public outrage, prompting medical schools to change their curricula to emphasize hands-on study of anatomy. This shift to the “Paris method,” in which students learn by dissecting cadavers first-hand, further stimulated the demand for human corpses.
Harvard Medical School dealt with this shortage by employing “resurrection men,” but several faculty members and students went a step further: they raided graveyards and dug up dead bodies themselves.
Around 1770, Joseph Warren founded an illicit secret society called the “Spunker Club,” also known as the “Anatomical Club.” His older brother, John Warren—the founder of Harvard Medical School—was also a member. Some of the club’s most notable members included a William Eustis, the future governor of Massachusetts, and Samuel Adams’ son.
Although this macabre organization was dedicated to grave-robbing in the name of learning, some of its morbidly curious members saw the painstaking process of body-snatching as art. Stealing a body required at least three participants––two to exhume the corpse and one to drive the getaway car. The surrounding area had to look undisturbed, so thieves often used large pieces of cloth to catch any flyaway dirt.
Spunker Club members reportedly took great pride in their technique. In a 1775 letter, John Warren described a grave robbery “done with so little decency and caution” that “it need scarcely be said it could not have been the work of any of our friends of the [Spunker] Club,” according to a 2012 article in the Journal of Social Archaeology.
As “resurrection men” and body-snatching enthusiasts continued to ransack Boston graveyards, civil indignation incited the Act to Protect the Sepulchers of the Dead in 1815, making disturbance of buried bodies illegal and prompting a citywide patrol of graveyards and burial grounds.
This legislature forced Harvard Medical School to “import” the cadavers from New York instead, where body snatchers were “emptying at least six hundred or seven hundred graves annually,” according to an article in the Boston Gazette.
After the Massachusetts Medical Society published a plea in 1829 claiming that medical students had no other choice but to pursue their studies “in defiance of the law of the land,” the school’s need for illegally-obtained cadavers waned. Massachusetts passed the Anatomy Act of 1831, which allowed for dissection of the unclaimed bodies of the indigent, insane and imprisoned.
Although the demand for dissection material was partially satisfied by the new influx of legally obtained bodies, it was hardly eliminated.
In 1842, Harvard Medical School employed Ephraim Littlefield, a janitor who also supplied the school with cadavers for 25 dollars per body—roughly 760 dollars in 2017, according to economic data aggregator Measuringworth.com. It remains unclear whether Littlefield robbed the graves himself or was merely a middleman.
Littlefield was also tasked with disposing of the human remains left over from the dissections. He dumped them in the basement of Holden Chapel, which was used by the Medical School until the mid-nineteenth century, which is where the construction workers found them 150 years later.
Examination of the remains revealed that they belonged to at least 11 males and females, with most bones so cut up as to make identification impossible.
In a 1999 article in The Crimson, associated professor of anthropology Professor Carole A.S. Mandryk noted that “Some of the bones have metal pieces sticking out of them, as if someone was trying to construct a skeleton.”

UPDATED: September 28, 2017 at 5:37 p.m.
Sitting handcuffed in the back of a police wagon, Anouska Bhattacharyya heard the chatter of her colleagues. “They were saying, ‘Oh, that was your research? That was so interesting,’” she recalls with a laugh. “We are all such nerds.”
Bhattacharyya, a lecturer in History and Literature and an assistant coordinator in General Education, was one of 29 people arrested in an act of civil disobedience at Harvard two weeks ago. In protest of President Donald Trump’s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which protects thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation, faculty from six Boston-area colleges joined arms and chanted in the middle of Massachusetts Ave. until they were arrested by Cambridge police.
“There was the sense that somehow in Harvard Yard, we were protected,” Bhattacharyya says. “When we walked out of the gates and across the road, and it was just us with our arms linked. There was a world witnessing it, and it was on us to stand up.”
Campus activism has a rich and well-documented history in the United States and beyond. From the Vietnam War to Black Lives Matter, its iconography has become familiar to us: impassioned students, handmade signs, marches across manicured college greens, sit-ins, walkouts, and curmudgeonly backlash against the youth in revolt.
The faculty-organized civil disobedience at Harvard expanded the recognizable imagery of campus protest. Memorial Church Minister Jonathan L. Walton was handcuffed while dressed in a black doctoral robe. Several of the other people arrested wore suits and ties. Earlier that day, many of them had lectured at the podiums of elite academic institutions. It was, effectively, a protest that brought the denizens of the ivory tower into the streets.
“We can’t just sit back and follow our students who already carry the lion’s share of the burden of organizing and protesting and marching,” Kirsten A. Weld, an associate professor of Social Sciences, says. Weld and Walter Johnson, a professor of history and African and African American Studies, planned the action. “We have to take up some of that burden ourselves.”
CRITICAL MASS
In the week leading up to the protest, Weld and Johnson decided they would need 10 volunteers to get arrested. “When we first put the idea of taking arrests on the table, it was difficult to find people who were willing to participate,” Weld says. A day before the action, between 75 and 100 professors from nearby universities had gathered in Robinson Hall to brainstorm ways they could stand with DACA students. “That was a little bit frustrating at first, not that people are wrong for not wanting to participate… But I knew it wasn’t going to work if we couldn’t get 10 people.”
Sarah S. Richardson, a professor of History of Science and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality who was also arrested, was at first concerned about finding backup child care for her one-year-old. Kevin M. Bruyneel, who teaches political science at Babson College, is a green card holder from Canada who wondered if the arrest would interfere with his path to U.S. citizenship. Many of the people arrested, including Weld, are assistant professors or lecturers who do not enjoy the job security of tenured faculty members.
Ahmed Ragab, who teaches at the Divinity School, had worried that the protest would conflict with his naturalization ceremony. The timing worked out: Ragab and his wife were sworn in as U.S. citizens at Faneuil Hall, drove back to to their home in Cambridge, and changed into comfortable shoes. “Then she went to pick up our daughter and I got arrested,” he says.
GEARING UP
Many of those on the fence were persuaded by the meticulous planning that went into the action. Weld arranged legal representation for protesters ahead of time and coordinated extensively with Cambridge Police Department in anticipation of the action. “There weren’t a lot of question marks,” she says. “People knew what to expect.”
The organizers even devised a system for socializing court costs, which otherwise would have been about $150 per person: Tenured professors would pay more, while lecturers and assistant professors would pay less. Every detail seemed to be accounted for, down to the $40 arrestees were told to bring for paying bail.
At 4 p.m. on Thursday, the plan was set in motion. About 300 Boston-area educators flooded through Johnson Gate, decked out in logos of nearby universities like Babson, Tufts, and MIT. Professors serving as demonstration marshals wore neon green vests and roamed about the scene. Dozens of students walked out of class to join the rally. The turnout skyrocketed beyond what any organizers or participants had anticipated.
Robin M. Bernstein, chair of the Program of Studies in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, had shown up to Harvard Yard wearing clothes she would feel comfortable wearing for “a day or two or three,” but she wasn’t quite sure that she was ready for arrest.
“I had never been arrested before for any reason, and frankly, I was scared to be arrested,” Bernstein says. Her reluctance dissipated when she heard the speeches at the protest. “I felt like this was a very important moment of resistance, and I very much wanted to be a part of it.”
Addressing a crowd of hundreds in the area between Massachusetts Hall and Harvard Hall, several professors and one undocumented student called on the Harvard community to act against the Trump administration’s decision. Ragab, having just become a U.S. citizen, spoke of the responsibilities that come with privilege. Then, the volunteers made their way to the street.
Bhattacharyya had been “gearing up to face down cars” as she approached Massachusetts Ave., so she was surprised to see that the Cambridge police had closed the street for them. “What was overwhelming was all the empty space in front of me,” she says. “We have so much privilege that the Cambridge police blocked off traffic.”
René Carrasco, a History and Literature lecturer, said he had never been to a protest that was so “well-coordinated with the cops.” It was “performative,” he said, but in a way, that was the whole point. “It was a way to show solidarity with my students and the community at large.”
Carrasco grew up in Chula Vista, Calif., a city with a sizeable immigrant population just seven minutes from the border. “I felt particularly interested in doing something like this because I’m Mexican, and this issue is personal,” he says. “It’s my students, and it’s also my best friends, neighbors, family.”
Holding a banner that read “NO BAN ON STOLEN LAND,” the professors formed a human chain across the width of the road. They chanted, with hundreds of spectators, “Education not deportation.” The crowd whooped and cheered as law enforcement began making arrests.
‘WHITE-GLOVED’
Several professors remarked on the “professionalism” and “courtesy” of the police officers who took them into custody. Some said it seemed that the police were “going through the motions” of arrest. One called the police’s treatment “white-gloved.”
“We were treated more leniently than expected, which is a function of our privilege and cultural capital as professors at fancy universities,” Weld said.
The decision to cooperate with police in an immigration rights action is a notable one, even in a liberal hub like Cambridge. Cambridge has been a sanctuary city since 1985, and Harvard University Department Police Chief Francis D. Riley has clarified that the University’s police force is not involved with the enforcement of federal immigration laws. But the entanglement of policing and immigration still looms. In August 2017, Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79—who recently criticized Trump’s decision to repeal DACA—filed legislation that would allow state and local police to detain people in coordination with Immigration Customs Enforcement.
Cambridge Police Department Communications Director Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email to The Crimson that the police aimed to provide “security and protection to protesters, bystanders, and the public” as well as to “public and private property.” They also provided “tactical resources” and “traffic resources,” he wrote.
“I think there is, on some level, an issue with cooperating in certain ways with the institutions that we know help to oppress and harm many of the communities we’re trying to stand up for,” says Emily K. Pope-Obeda, a History and Literature lecturer who teaches a course on the policing of migration. Pope-Obeda said police presence was an issue on which professors “did not see completely eye to eye,” but ultimately the urgency of standing with students overrode all else.
Many of those arrested felt similarly. Optics mattered—Carrasco, in his role as a media contact for the action, informed news outlets of the exact time that arrests would begin—and therefore numbers were important. Several professors wouldn’t have volunteered to be arrested if organizers hadn’t crafted detailed plans ahead of time. Without exhaustive coordination with law enforcement, the human chain that stretched along the crosswalk might have been half the size that it was.
It was, as Weld put it, a protest designed so that “people who don’t usually do this kind of thing” could feel comfortable participating. “This was not an adversarial ‘people vs. police’ situation,” she says. “That’s a different kind of tactic for a different situation. Our audience was really the press, our students, and other faculty members in the area and nationally to say that the time of signing petitions and hoping for the best is over.”
Echoing Weld, Johnson emphasizes that organizers sought to “create a situation which would get as many people to participate as possible.” Academics are “not a population that’s particularly noted for acting out and getting arrested,” he adds.
Video footage from the event shows police binding protesters’ hands in front of them, rather than behind. In one clip, Walton, handcuffed and still wearing his academic robe, raises his arms for a pat-down.  “Watch your head,” a police officer says to another professor as he ushers him into the wagon.
INSIDE THE CELL
No matter how thoroughly they had prepared, many of those arrested still found themselves unsettled by the experience: the feeling of being handcuffed and shepherded about, the confines of a police wagon, the spareness of a jail cell.
Caroline Light, who teaches in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, found the situation “destabilizing.”
“You’re made to feel like you’ve done something deeply wrong,” Light said. The feeling was new to her: “As a middle-aged white woman, I’m not looked at with suspicion by law enforcement. In fact, I’m looked at as somebody to be protected and cared for.”
While filling out paperwork, posing for a mugshot, and giving her fingerprints, Bhattacharyya found echoes of her own scholarship. She’s currently researching the “bureaucracy of empire” and the history of fingerprinting and identification in 19th-century India. “It was interesting to suddenly be faced with the contemporary bureaucracy of the criminal justice system, to think about how I as a body fit into that,” Bhattacharya says. “And the privilege of my body within that system.”
The professors were held at the Cambridge Police Department headquarters near Central Square. They were segregated by gender and detained in groups of four. Each jail cell had a bench, a metal toilet, and no semblance of privacy.
“It was not an experience of suffering,” Weld says. The police started processing right away, and it seemed likely that the professors would be released in a few hours. “But it was still jail. Every time you’re moved from one part to another, you notice there are officers stationed in strategic points to make sure you do what you’re supposed to do.”
Bhattacharyya was one of the first to be processed. When she was released after two hours of detention, she was greeted by History and Literature staffers who were waiting with water and food. She and her fellow protesters were arraigned the following week: The charges of disturbing the peace were dropped, and the district attorney’s office did not ask them to pay court costs.
“It was a further reminder that we had been able to organize something that was very symbolic but was also awash with our privilege,” she says.
Wielding the privilege of elite academia, it seems, was the point of the entire action. Twitter boomed with pictures and videos of the human chain on Massachusetts Ave. The protest earned splashy headlines at several news outlets, from the Boston Globe to Breitbart.
“I felt, for the first time in maybe 10 years, that I actually got to practice everything I’m constantly trying to teach,” Bhattacharyya says. “I got to physically embody the kind of—not just scholar—but citizen that my students might think about being.”

CORRECTION: September 28, 2017
A previous version of this article misstated the date of a meeting of between 75 and 100 professors from nearby universities in Robinson Hall. The meeting took place a day before the arrests, not more than a week before.

Sections
The trials began with small-scale tests on rats and rabbits. Each day, for a period of five days, researchers pumped immature female rabbits full of the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone. On the fifth day, the scientists allowed the rabits to copulate, then removed their fallopian tubes and examined them for signs of egg fertilization. For years, Massachusetts scientists worked diligently on hundreds of caged rabbits in a basement lab on a shoestring budget, searching for the perfect compound.
On June 23, 1960, a decade after the tests began, the hormonal birth control pill hit the market. The idea was simple: Take a little white pill once a day, avoid accidental pregnancy. The implications were revolutionary.
Women could work without fear of becoming pregnant. Sex before marriage became less risky. Sex after marriage became less fraught. Feminist historians herald this day as the beginning of the sexual revolution—but the story of the birth control pill is also one of conflicting ideologies and medical exploitation. The Harvard-educated scientists who formulated the pill relied on invasive tests and shaky medical consent.
The men who pioneered the pill got their start at Harvard. Gregory G. Pincus was an assistant professor at Harvard who would go on to research the mysteries of conception at his own lab. Although his methods were controversial, Pincus was willing to do whatever it took to advance his research.
John C. Rock, class of 1915, was a Harvard professor who spent his career attempting to understand fertility, hoping to combat what he saw as the main social ill of the day: overpopulation. Together, Rock and Pincus pioneered the development of the hormonal birth control pill through a series of clinical trials. After moving on from the laboratory tests, they ran a series of experiments on women in a Massachusetts asylum and poor neighborhoods in Puerto Rico.
By 1965, 6.5 million American women were taking it daily, making it the most popular form of birth control on the market. Today, the pill is used by over 100 million around the globe.
Though revolutionary, the final product came at the expense of the women involved in these trials. The Harvard doctors sometimes tested the birth control pill without patient consent, raising questions about research practices at Harvard and beyond.
Gregory G. Pincus, former assistant professor of General Physiology at Harvard, was in it for the science.
Despite being one of the key figures behind the pill, he was ambivalent about its applications. “I am against women having sexual freedom,” Pincus said in a 1967 interview. “But I hasten to add that I am also opposed to sexual freedom among men.” He created the pill, more or less, because it would answer a scientific question, not a social one.
After earning his bachelor’s degree in biology at Cornell in 1924, Pincus enrolled in the Ph.D. program at Harvard . There, he was mentored by a biologist named William J. Crozier who would change the way Pincus thought about science. Crozier and his followers believed something revolutionary: Animal processes had a chemical basis. Even complex phenomena like reproduction could be understood through reactions and equations. Pincus took this to heart, calling many of his later critics unscientific “mystics.”
After earning his doctorate, Pincus was hired as an assistant professor at Harvard. He made a name for himself studying reproduction in rabbits, understanding for the first time how hormones interacted with the developing egg. Eventually, he coaxed rabbit eggs to develop into embryos without fertilization. All he needed to know was the chemistry.
But press coverage of Pincus’s frankenbunny was overwhelmingly negative. A piece in Collier’s portrayed Pincus as a nefarious mad scientist with “dark penetrating eyes narrowed to slits.” The New York Times ran with a headline that read in part “Huxley Fantasy Made Real by Harvard Biologists,” referencing the dark reproductive science of “Brave New World.”
Harvard, mindful of public relations, took note: In 1937, Pincus learned he would not receive tenure. According to historian James Reed, Pincus was seen “as a self-advertising Jew who published too soon and talked too much.”
Because of his single-minded determination to get results and his own experience with anti-Semitism, Pincus became known for supporting scientists he thought were talented, regardless of other considerations. He never understood why a scientist like himself could be fired for reasons other than their merit.
In 1944, Pincus co-founded the Worcester Institute for Experimental Biology. After years of struggling with university politics, Pincus could create an island of pure science.
Pincus got his start in Worcester right as  chemists discovered that Mexican wild yams contained compounds similar to hormones in humans, spurring an explosion in drug development. Previously, hormonal research was limited by costs; researchers had to use compounds painstakingly extracted from animals. After the discovery, hormones could be mass produced on the cheap.
This new technology kickstarted a massive global race to find the next wonder drug. There were fortunes to be made.
With artificial hormones at his fingertips for the first time, Pincus escalated research at his newly-founded Institute, working closely with the G.D. Searle pharmaceutical company. Pincus also bought shares of Searle, creating extra incentive for discovery.
The competition was fierce. When medical trials began, Pincus would seek out experimental subjects with expediency in mind—not ethics.
The mad scientist met his match in affable physician and Harvard professor John C. Rock. Unlike Pincus, Rock was deeply interested in the social implications of his science. By his own account, Rock was not a “research man.” “All I know,” he wrote to a colleague in 1948, “are some of the problems I want answered.”
He never pursued science for its own sake. He chose obstetrics and gynecology for the field’s relationship to social experiences like human sexuality, marriage, and love, as well as his Catholic faith. (Gynecology also involved relatively few years of training, another plus.)
After graduating from Harvard Medical School in 1918, he continued to work at Harvard, serving as a Clinical Professor of Gynecology for more than three decades. In 1923, Rock revived the Massachusetts General Hospital’s infertility clinic. The following year, he started a new infertility clinic at what was then the Free Hospital for Women (now part of the Boston Hospital for Women and Brigham and Women’s).
The Free Hospital, a yellow French estate house in Brookline, offered Rock a special advantage: Because it was a teaching hospital, Harvard-associated physicians had increased access to patients there.
Eventually, Rock began testing combinations of synthetic hormones on his low-income patients, a strategy he and Pincus would return to again and again in later research.
Rock had encountered artificial versions of estrogen and progesterone—the hormones that maintain the lining of the uterus—through his work on a national committee. He believed that the compounds might “develop” his infertile patient’s dysfunctional reproductive systems. The dosages were dangerously high—many orders of magnitude above what women take today. However, they appeared to have the desired effect: 13 of the 80 previously infertile patients became pregnant after the tests ended. His colleagues called this phenomenon “the Rock Rebound.”
Though they had been in some correspondence with each other starting in the 1930s, Pincus and Rock reconnected at a scientific conference in 1952. It was there that Rock discovered Pincus’s new anti-ovulation trials in rabbits used the same drug that he had used to spur fertility.
The following year, the two researchers would begin a much larger trial on 60 patients from the Free Hospital and outlying clinics with the goal of determining the effect of progesterone on the menstrual cycle. Many of the women who did not become pregnant via rebound were disappointed by the compound’s misleading side effects, which mimicked the symptoms of pregnancy. Half of the women dropped the trial.
Unhappy with the results, Pincus learned an important lesson: He would need to take more drastic and less ethical steps to achieve the degree of experimental control needed to understand the compound’s anti-ovulatory effect.
Meanwhile, Rock had set his sights on the overpopulation issue. Over the following years, the goal of curbing population growth—especially among people he saw as inferior—would become a way of reconciling his contraception work with his Catholicism, and a rationalization for working on nonconsenting subjects. “People like to have babies. And this is particularly so among primitive peoples.” Rock said in a WGBH interview a decade later.
By the mid-1950s, the two Harvard professors had joined forces, and their research was starting to show promise. All they needed was a patron.
After her husband died on January 19, 1947, Katharine D. McCormick came into $35 million. A lifelong feminist and birth control advocate, she spent the money on what Margaret Sanger, famous feminist and Planned Parenthood founder, explained to her as “the greatest need of the whole [Planned Parenthood] movement”—“a simple, cheap, contraceptive.” Feminists had dreamed of a birth control pill a woman could take without a man’s knowledge, and Rock and Pincus were their best chance yet.
After testing hundreds of steroid combinations on lab animals, the G.D. Searle pharmaceutical company identified a promising candidate drug. Combining this with McCormick’s funds, the Harvard scientists were ready to execute large scale trials. But before they began, Pincus quietly performed additional experiments of his own.
Too many women had dropped out of John Rock’s early Free Hospital trials in Boston, and Pincus was unsatisfied with the results. McCormick, now his main funder, expressed frustration in a letter to Sanger, saying she wanted a “‘cage’ of ovulating females to experiment with.”
Lucky for Pincus, Harvard had a longstanding arrangement with the nearby Worcester State Hospital that could provide a solution. Through a Harvard foundation previously established by McCormick’s funding, some of Pincus’s Harvard colleagues had been conducting experiments on mentally ill patients there for years, according to scholarship by historian Jonathan Eig.
In 1954, under the guise of learning about the pill’s “possible tranquilizing effect,” Pincus launched a new trial. He recruited 16 female patients at the Worcester State Hospital, fed them birth control pill prototypes, then sliced into their uteruses in an effort to understand the drug’s effect on ovulation. When he was done, he published his findings.
Many were critical of his methodology. After the results of the experiment were published in “Lancet,” one doctor wrote to the editors: “This use as guinea pigs of chronic psychotic patients who are not able to give or withhold valid permission in physiological research of this type must be as repugnant to many of your readers as it is to me.”
But the criticism didn’t faze Pincus: He continued to experiment on psychotic patients at the Worcester State Hospital. In a 1956 experiment, scientists under Pincus’s direction performed testicular biopsies on 20 schizophrenic men without anaesthesia. According to letters and a draft of a scientific paper reviewed by The Crimson at the Library of Congress, Pincus was interested in the men’s “castration anxiety.”
Pincus refused to accept negative feedback throughout the trials, even when it was close to home. At one point, he quietly sent the drug to female family members. When one relative complained of serious side effects, Pincus offered to send her a different experimental concoction. She politely declined.
As the side effects of the pill became more clear, Pincus failed to acknowledge their gravity. He told the New York Times many years later, “These side-effects are largely psychogenic. Most of them happen because women expect them.” Pincus would repeat this message over and over again in the years to come.
When he exported his methods to Puerto Rico a few short years later, even his collaborators grew unsettled by his carelessness. During the large-scale clinical trials, the G.D. Searle Corporation medical director sent a cautionary note to Pincus’s partner, John Rock: “We here have long been disturbed by the casualness with which materials pass from Pincus’s animals to your patients.”
But the development of birth control—and other wonder drugs—happened during a relatively unregulated period of scientific history.  The Nuremberg Code of 1947, which established the importance of informed consent, was not legally binding. The Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments of 1962 and the Belmont Report of 1979, which required proof of drug safety and “respect, beneficence, and justice” throughout all human trials, had not yet been written.
American researchers had no formal obligation to obtain informed consent.
In the 1950s, Puerto Rico was the perfect place to test a contraceptive drug. Its laws were more liberal than those of the continental US, and there was already an established clinical network throughout the island. It was also the target of racial fear—its poor, Hispanic population worried many American overpopulation alarmists.
Eugenicist sentiment led to remarkably liberal reproductive regulation. Far ahead of the mainland US, Puerto Rico established family planning clinics in 1935, and authorized the teaching and practice of contraception in 1937.
But explicitly eugenicist legislation also codified forced sterilization. By 1955, 16.5 percent of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized. In a 1988 study of women who had been sterilized at the time, 16 percent reported that they had not made the decision for themselves.
Many on the island justified these practices. “The tragedy of the situation is that the more intelligent classes voluntarily restrict their birth rate, while the most vicious, most ignorant, and most helpless and hopeless part of the population multiplies with tremendous rapidity,” the governor of Puerto Rico wrote to Margaret Sanger in 1933.
In stark contrast, all contraceptive information and materials—including condoms, diaphragms, spermicides and jellies—were banned in parts of the mainland U.S. until the ’70s. Rock and Pincus had managed to run a few small experiments in Massachusetts by framing grants and reports around infertility and the menstrual cycle, but they would have a harder time justifying a large-scale contraceptive study on the continent. If they wanted to go big, they’d have to leave home.
As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico was the simplest alternative. “Because of its semi-colonial status with the U.S., the ability to test on these women’s bodies seemed like these territories are an extension of us,” Gabriela Soto Laveaga, a professor of the history of science at Harvard, says.
Funded by population control enthusiasts, enticed by lax contraceptive regulation, and welcomed by an established clinical network, Rock and Pincus decided to export the final stages of their research to Puerto Rico.
They started small. Celso-Ramon Garcia, their colleague at the Worcester Foundation, recruited 20 female University of Puerto Rico medical students into an initial study in 1955.
This study had problems from the beginning: More than half of the participants dropped out, infuriating Rock, Pincus, and their staff. “If any medical student exhibited irresponsibility of this sort, I would hold it against her when considering grades,” one researcher wrote to Pincus.
The high dropout rate should not have been surprising: The trial was not easy by any means. According to the papers of Rock and Pincus, the methods involved considerable time and occasional pain, not to mention common side effects including blood clots, bleeding, and nausea. Every day, participants were made to take their temperature and a vaginal smear. Each month, their cervixes were dilated and tissue from their uteruses were collected. In some cases, women underwent laparotomies, a large incision meant to expose the abdominal cavity, so that researchers could observe their ovaries in real time.
Data obtained, the scientists left the medical students and prepared for the first official field trial of what would become the birth control pill. They created a prototype drug formulation—all they needed were subjects.
The researchers chose the Rio Piedras neighborhood of San Juan, where a housing development had been built for neighboring farm laborers. “As the families selected were landless, they were to some extent social problems,” one collaborator wrote in his notes. Poverty and immobility made the women living there perfect subjects for a controlled trial.
According to Laveaga, this strategic selection process was common at the time. “The regulations were more lax, but also you had this belief that some people could be experimented on: the ‘feeble-minded,’ people of color, the poor,” she says.
Once the researchers had chosen the neighborhood, a memo from Pincus to Rock indicates that they recruited 265 “sufficiently intelligent” women for whom “pregnancy would be acceptable, or at worst inconvenient.”
The study did not involve financial compensation, but they never had trouble convincing women to sign up. “We always had more people wanting to participate in our studies than we had drugs to supply,” Adaline P. Satterthwaite, a field doctor, said in an interview conducted in the ’70s by a historian at the Schlesinger Library.
Though many elements of the trials were exploitative, most historians agree that the women participated in the trials to gain access to reversible contraception.
“It’s easy to say poor women did not really know what was going on,” Laveaga says. She cites similar experiments, such as IUD trials in Costa Rica, where women lined up to participate. “This is not a black and white situation.”
But, as in the earlier trials, researchers had trouble convincing women to remain on the pill. Participation was arduous: For three months, subjects were made to take one tablet a day for the majority of their menstrual cycle and undergo regular testing. According to letters, social workers and doctors, including Pincus and Rock’s in-country collaborator Edie Rice-Wray, visited the subjects often, collecting vaginal smears on glass slides, recording side effects, and distributing tablets.
According to Pincus and Rock’s paper, 22 percent of women dropped out due to side effects, which remained severe.
There were other setbacks as well: An article appeared in the Puerto Rican newspaper “El Imparcial” decrying the tests as a neo-Malthusian campaign to sterilize women, a few women sold their pills on the black market, and there was constant opposition from the Catholic Church.
Yet the scientists forged ahead. In 1959, after additional trials in Puerto Rico, Haiti, and Mexico, Searle appealed to the FDA to make Enovid a contraceptive drug. The FDA approved its contraceptive use the following year.
After collecting the data, Pincus and Rock packed their bags and returned to Massachusetts, where birth control quickly became widely available.
It was a different story in Puerto Rico. The original price of Enovid—50 cents a pill, or $11 a month—was far too expensive for the publicly-housed laborers who had participated in the trials to afford. After months of enduring vaginal smears and more invasive procedures, most of the participants were left high and dry––denied both compensation and the drug they had helped create.
Indeed, in Puerto Rico, the benefits of the pill still aren’t fully felt. In 2002, the most recent year for estimates on contraceptive use on the island, 46 percent of women between 18-44 reported they were sterilized. Only 19 percent used oral contraceptives. As of 2008, 65.5 percent of pregnancies on the island were unintended.
Almost 60 years later, the dream of a magic little pill, the dream that drove so many poor women to sign up for an experimental drug, remains out of reach.
Ten years after its first release, the birth control pill made headlines again during the Nelson Pill Hearings, a Capitol Hill investigation into the pill’s safety. When feminist activists noticed that no women were being invited to testify, they interrupted the proceedings and testified from their seats. “Why isn’t there a pill for men?” activist Alice Wolfson shouted. “Why are 10 million women being used as guinea pigs?”
Neither the physicians nor the protesters mentioned the Puerto Rican trials.
The trials were also omitted from HMS anesthesiologist Henry K. Beecher’s famous and damning 1966 indictment of the research practices of the day, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Beecher called out experimentation that privileged the wellbeing of “patients in general” over the patients undergoing the experimentation itself. Beecher questioned whether data obtained unethically should be published, “even with stern editorial comment.” The article vilified many of Harvard’s recent scientific advances and rocked the research world.
Since that time, far more stringent medical standards have emerged. Institutional Review Boards were established at universities around the country, in hopes that these kinds of studies would not happen again.
Still, medical history is often swept clean, praising progress without remembering those who suffered to create it. For the most part, the popular narrative of the pill is one of celebration. When a 2009 Harvard Gazette story discussed Harvard’s role in creating the birth control pill, they did so without referencing the Puerto Rican trials or the asylum testing. Pincus and Rock are largely remembered for their contributions to women’s reproductive empowerment, without reference to their troubling methods.
“Our obligation as regular citizens is to be informed, to know the history, and to ask the questions,” Laveaga says. “If we have a baseline of knowledge, it’s easier to contend, not forget, make it public, and acknowledge when mistakes have been made.”

Ivy-lined Houghton Library seems an unlikely place to explore mind-altering substances—but the Library’s latest exhibit, “Altered States: Sex, Drugs, and Transcendance,” does just that.
Housing displays with titles such as “Cocaine,” “Orgy Town,” and “Marijuana Girl,” the exhibition showcases a portion of the world’s largest collection of drug-related literary paraphernalia, given to Harvard by the family of the late Julio Mario Santo Domingo Jr. five years ago.
The entire Ludlow-Santo Domingo—or LSD—collection contains over 50,000 items documenting popular culture in the 1960s and 1970s. The Houghton exhibition, which is on display until Dec. 16, focuses particularly on drugs, sex, and social movements during that era.
“People will, I think, really associate Houghton with antiquarian books and beautiful illuminated manuscripts,” said Leslie A. Morris, Houghton’s curator of modern books and manuscripts. “They don’t associate us with Timothy Leary and underground comics and rolling papers and more popular culture materials.”
Morris said she hopes that students and faculty will use the exhibition in their teaching and research. Over the last decade, Morris said she has seen an increase in courses focused on popular culture, some of which had made use of the collection before the exhibition.
According to Morris, the library has worked extensively to make the LSD collection more accessible by cataloguing its contents in Hollis—when the collection was first presented to Harvard, there was no cohesive record of its contents.
“It is a way to kind of heighten awareness and to say both to the Harvard community and to those outside of Harvard, ‘Here’s what we have, here’s what we’re collecting. Please come and use it,” Morris said. “Because there’s no point collecting it if people don’t know that they can come and use it.”
Morris said the exhibition has been well-attended by Harvard affiliates and tourists alike.
“I find it funny, it’s curious,” said John Munteanu, a tourist visiting from Romania, adding that he was pleasantly surprised by the more edgy contents of the exhibition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stepping to the tune of a wheezing red accordion, Seyed S. S. Saravi walked into Boston Logan Airport Wednesday afternoon and ended an eight month-long journey from Iran to a Harvard Medical School laboratory.
Saravi’s life-long dream of researching at Harvard almost ended in January after President Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran. Saravi, 31, began planning a move to Cambridge roughly two years ago; he was supposed to start work in mid-February 2017.
Saravi’s previously-approved visa was immediately suspended after Trump’s order. He spent the next several months working to reinstate his visa and to obtain a visa for his wife, Khatareh.
“The order impacted all of my life,” he said Wednesday.
At the airport, Medical School Professor Thomas M. Michel ’77, who heads the lab Saravi will join—and who brought the accordion—embraced his newest employee in silence for almost a minute. Then he stepped back and gripped Saravi’s shoulder with one hand.
“Long flight,” he said.
“Yes, it takes two years,” Saravi quipped. He added in a low voice, “All worth it.”
Saravi, who will study the effects of diabetes on the heart, is one of four Iranian scientists slated to conduct research at Harvard who were barred from the country by Trump’s order. The other three—Samira Asgari and sisters Marzieh and Amene Asgari, who are not related to Samira—flew into the United States in February.
Since January, Trump’s ban faced multiple legal challenges from judges around the country and underwent several revisions. Trump announced the most recent iteration of the order last Sunday, issuing a presidential proclamation that bans or restricts travel from eight countries: Chad, Venezuela, North Korea, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.
On Wednesday, Saravi, reading from a prepared statement typed out on his phone, said he thinks immigration restrictions restrict scientific progress.
“Patients in Iran and patients in the United States suffer from the same diseases, and I hope that scientists and doctors in both of our countries—Iran and the United States—can work together to advance our knowledge and discover new cures,” he said.
Khatareh, who arrived with Saravi Wednesday, stood behind her husband, nodding.
Hours before the couple debarked, Michel gathered roughly a dozen friends and colleagues to await Saravi by the international arrivals gate. Some brought handmade posters, one of which bore a painstakingly re-drawn graph from one of Saravi’s published scientific papers.
“Science transcends borders,” it read, in letters the color of the Iranian flag.
Others brought instruments: two accordions and a guitar. For roughly half an hour, Michel and two friends entertained the crowd with music, sometimes taking requests, sometimes playing Iranian folk songs.
At one point, Michel held up his red Weltmeister accordion and declared it his “protest accordion,” named “Rosie” for Rosie the Riveter.
“I think that this is a good day for science,” Michel said. “And I think it’s an indication of the power of the press, the legal system, and the support of politicians in Washington, who can take an unfair edict, resist it, and prevail.”
The moment Saravi and his wife crossed through Boston Logan’s international arrivals gate, Michel and reporters swarmed to greet them. For several minutes, Saravi stumbled over his words, saying he was “too excited” and emotional to answer questions.
But after prodding from Michel—whom Saravi said was “like a dad”—the 31-year-old composed himself.
“Bans and restrictions make humans stronger,” Saravi said. “Now I am really stronger than before because I have passed many limitations, many restrictions.”
“The hardness of this is the coat of glory,” he added.
Saravi will start work next week.

A new rock climbing wall opened at the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center on Sept. 10, replacing a smaller wall formerly located in Lowell House.
The new Harvard Climbing Wall consists of two converted squash courts in the QRAC basement, offering participants an expanded and revitalized climbing space. The facility consists of climbing routes accessed without a rope and a crash pad that surrounds the wall to cushion falls.
Earlier this year, Harvard began construction on Lowell House as part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s more than $1 billion project to renovate the undergraduate residences, closing the Houses's climbing wall. Students began petitioning to find a new location for the climbing wall in September 2015 after the project to renovate Lowell was first announced.
Students praised installation of the new climbing wall, and said that it more closely resembles professional facilities that climbers can find around Cambridge
“The wall in Lowell was basically a bunch of chunks of plywood on the wall that had some holes screwed into them, this one is a professionally built wall,” said Jack Deschler ’19, a manager of the climbing wall.
Because the space is larger, climbers can more easily avoid each others fall zones, according to Deschler.
“It’s much safer,” added Elijah S. Frydman ’20, another manager of the wall. “There’s places to chill and not be in the way.”
Although the new wall is located near the Quad and away from the center of campus, students say attendance numbers in the gym have increased since its relocation.
“The number of unique climbers from last spring semester has already been equaled in this semester,” Deschler said.
The longer walk has not deterred Isabel F. Slavinsky ’20, a resident of Lowell House and member of the climbing team. She added that she enjoys the camaraderie that she has found with other students who climb.
“The walk is fine,” Slavinsky said. “What I particularly like about climbing at Harvard is that the community is so great, and so supportive of one another.”
Students staff the climbing wall several nights a week for all Harvard affiliates to use. It also serves as a hub for the College’s climbing team and mountaineering club. The club climbing team holds practice in the facility three nights a week.
Beverly H. Brown ’20, a member of the climbing team and wall staff member, said that she thinks the new wall is an improvement over the previous version.
“It’s a really fun environment for groups of people to come and hang out, and you can all climb at once,” Brown said.

The Rotary Club of Downtown Boston held its first annual sock drive Wednesday for Friends of Boston’s Homeless, an organization that supports shelters in the city’s South End.
The event was held at the Cambridge office of Revolution Capital, a financial services firm. Amy Witherbee, a member of the Rotary Club who co-founded the business, spearheaded the foot-focused drive.
“We cannot raise $50,000 to build new classrooms, but what we can do is get socks,” Witherbee said, noting that the Downtown Boston chapter was one of the younger Rotary organizations.
Witherbee said she got the idea to do a sock drive after seeing a social media post on the Friends of Boston’s Homeless’ page explaining how shelters are in need of sock donations.
“Nobody donates socks, as you could imagine, so we decided to spend this year asking our members and our guests and everybody else to bring socks to everything,” she said.
Mallory McCoy, a new member of Downtown Boston Rotary, said she thought the sock drive exemplified the Rotary Club’s motto of “Service above Self.”
“I think that’s just another great example of how Rotary events tend to look towards what’s needed in the community that’s not being fulfilled, in a way that people can fill it.”
According to Witherbee, The Downtown Boston Rotary intends to hold additional events for the sock drive throughout the year.
“It sounds funny,” Witherbee said. “We’re devoting [this year] to socks, but yes! It’s a fun thing, and we’ll do some contests, you know just sort of as many socks as we can this year.”

Hundreds gathered to honor the life of S. Allen Counter, founding director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, at Memorial Church Wednesday afternoon.
Counter died of cancer in July at age 73. An explorer and neurobiologist, he grew up in the segregated South and joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School in 1972.
At the service, colleagues remembered Counter for his longtime leadership in improving campus-wide race relations, his mentorship to Harvard students and alumni, and his explorations of Greenland and beyond.
University President Drew G. Faust called Counter a “true citizen of the University” and praised his work in the Harvard Foundation’s portraiture project, which aims to diversify the artwork in University buildings.
“There is no single way to be part of the Harvard community, but Allen’s way—collaborative, inventive, celebratory, holding our institutions to the very highest standards of what it can be and must be—that’s an example for all of us,” Faust said.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said that Counter took a “calm and respectful” approach in engaging students in dialogue and was “incredibly supportive” in providing advice during Khurana’s first year as Dean.
“For those of us who were Allen’s colleagues, losing Allen means losing a wise elder,” Khurana said. “For our students who knew him as a teacher and a leader of Harvard Foundation, it feels like losing a mentor.”
While Counter’s scientific research focused on neurophysiology, his interest in ethnography took him all over the world and led to groundbreaking discoveries. In South America, for example, Counter was the first to contact native groups in the rainforests of Suriname and the Andean mountains, bringing their existence to light through his books.
In Greenland, his research of widespread hearing loss in the native Inuit population led him to discover the long-lost descendents of North Pole pioneers Matthew A. Henson and Robert E. Peary. In 1987, Counter arranged for the descendents of Henson and Peary to visit the United States for the first time and meet their American relatives. Henson’s great-grandson attended Wednesday’s memorial service, Sean T. Brady ’89 said in his remarks at Counter’s service.
Harvard Foundation intern Devontae A. Freeland ’19 said Counter’s mentorship helped him to come of age. He described how Counter called each student by “Mr.” and “Ms.,” a sign of respect that Counter sought to spread throughout Harvard.
“Though you might only 18, 19, or 20, though you may be wealthy legacy students or young black boys, or the first group of women students at the College, Dr. Counter showed us all respect,” Freeland said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvey R. Levin—the founder of celebrity gossip website TMZ—discussed the future of privacy in an age where people share much of their personal lives online with former U.S. Representative Jason E. Chaffetz at the Institute of Politics Wednesday.
Chaffetz, a fellow at the IOP this semester, said he believes technologies like drones and cameras with facial recognition capabilities may be putting Americans’ privacy increasingly at risk.
But Levin, a lawyer-turned-journalist, disagreed with Chaffetz, adding that he is more concerned about using “traditional” technologies like phone records to invade personal privacy.
“I think there are still traditional technologies that is more troublesome to me than drone technology and things like that,” Levin said. “If these drones are flying around and see something that’s in plain view, that’s kind of always been the law that if something is in plain view, it’s fair game.”
In his work at TMZ, Levin said he is careful to uphold certain standards when reporting on celebrities’ private lives.
“There are all sorts of rules that I have. I have rules as a businessman, which I am,” he said. “There are things that just aren’t worth it to me.”
Towards the end of the event, one audience member asked Levin whether he and his website are “pro-Trump.” Levin has said he and President Donald Trump have known each other for more than a decade, and the two had a controversial hour-long meeting earlier this year.
On Wednesday, Levin denied his allegiance to Trump, instead arguing that he plays “devil’s advocate” to add balance to news coverage of the White House.
“We’re not pro-Trump. If anybody watches the show, they want him run out of town,” he said. “What I don’t want in the room is one voice, and there is one voice people hate him, so I play devil’s advocate not so much to be pro-Trump but to try and balance, and there’s a difference between the two.”
Levin advised young people to take risks early in their careers and to adopt an entrepreneurial spirit. He said he started TMZ after noticing an opportunity in the entertainment industry to publish stories online immediately after verifying their veracity.
“Find a hole in a market you’re interested in, if everybody is doing things one way that is the opportunity to find a different way,” he said, “If I can give you guys anything it’s this: the way to become really successful is to look at an area you’re interested in and try and figure out ‘is there something that nobody’s doing that’s gonna make this popular?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard considers the example of small liberal arts colleges that have banned membership in Greek organizations, University President Drew G. Faust is also looking at schools that have sought to regulate—and not disband—the groups.
Faust said in an interview Wednesday that she has had conversations with current and former administrators at Yale and Princeton, two schools that have sought to create closer ties with social groups rather than penalize membership in them. She made those comments as she weighs an interim recommendation from a faculty committee that Harvard forbid membership in “fraternities, sororities, and similar organizations”—including co-ed groups—entirely.
That interim recommendation would strengthen an existing set of penalties on members of single-gender groups that bar members in the Class of 2021 from athletic team captaincies and from receiving College endorsement for post-graduate fellowships. Ultimately, Faust will decide whether to keep the current policy or ban membership entirely after the committee delivers its final report this week.
In the interview Wednesday, Faust said she was still making up her mind about the proposed ban.
“I’ll wait and see what the final proposal to me is and reflect on what they ask of me and decide at that time,” Faust said. “I want to see the full rationale and hear discussions that once again will be taking place at the Faculty meeting next week.”
The committee’s interim recommendation drew from the examples of Amherst, Williams, and Bowdoin Colleges, all of which banned membership in fraternities and sororities. While Faust said she has been considering those schools, including reading a book on Williams College’s move to eliminate fraternities this summer, she only mentioned Yale and Princeton by name in a Crimson op-ed Wednesday decrying the “discriminatory and exclusionary” groups.
“Confronted with strikingly similar organizations, Princeton, Yale, and others found the institutional will to act. It is past time for us to do the same,” Faust wrote.
While she was serving as the president of Princeton, Shirley M. Tilghman—now a member of Harvard’s Corporation—helped push the administration there to embrace "eating clubs," co-ed social groups that serve as dining halls and social centers for many Princeton students. A task force report recommendation during her presidency made strides toward making admittance into the final club-esque groups less exclusionary.
Faust said she has “talked to [Tilghman] a lot about what went on at Princeton,” adding, “She’s given me a lot of thoughtful comments and advice.”
Faust also said she has discussed social life at Yale with the school’s president Peter Salovey. Last year, a Yale College Council task force recommended that the university formalize ties with Greek organizations—an approach that contrasted with Harvard's. Yale’s Dean of Student Engagement Burgwell Howard added that he sees “an opportunity to work with our Greek organizations” in an interview with the Yale Daily News.
But Faust is not looking to model Harvard’s approach on other schools.
“I’ve turned to [other schools] for thoughts and looking for parallels, but I think we’re our own place and I don’t think we want to model ourselves against anybody else, because there are just different circumstances and different factors that are in play,” Faust said.
In her op-ed, Faust warned against the specter of a “fraternity/sorority campus” and a “shadow social environment” emerging at Harvard—and wrote that the College has a duty to act.
“We must not abdicate our obligation to take the next step in the long, historic, and ongoing movement toward ensuring that all students are full citizens of our University, that none are denied its opportunities solely because of accident of birth,” she wrote.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will discuss the possibility of a ban on social group membership at its monthly meeting on Oct. 3. The Faculty will also discuss a motion from former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 to entirely nullify the College’s efforts at penalizing or banning membership in off-campus social organizations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Square property owner is suing to block a proposed medical marijuana dispensary in the area, arguing that because marijuana is still illegal under federal law, the proposed Winthrop St. dispensary should not be allowed to open.
Raj K. Dhanda, who owns Crimson Galeria, filed the complaint in federal court earlier this month against Healthy Pharms Inc., a Georgetown, Mass.-based nonprofit marijuana distributor seeking to open a dispensary on Winthrop St. In the complaint, Dhanda argues that his businesses have been “substantially injured by a conspiracy to sell marijuana” and should be compensated for these losses.
In February, the Cambridge City Council modified the zoning regulations for medical marijuana dispensaries to permit potentially “five or six” new dispensaries in the city. The regulations require that dispensaries comply with state and local law, but do not, however, mention federal law.
On Feb. 28, the Cambridge Planning Board voted to permit Healthy Pharms to operate a dispensary within The Red House restaurant at 98 Winthrop St. Nathaniel L. Averill, CEO of Healthy Pharms, said at the time that the dispensary would be discreet and secure, so that only patients medically licensed to use marijuana would have access, according to the Boston Globe.
Valerio Romano, an attorney for Healthy Pharms, said that the dispensary looks forward to coming to the Square with the support of the Harvard Square Business Association.
But Dhanda seeks to stop the dispensary from opening as planned, arguing in the lawsuit that “amongst other matters, marijuana businesses make bad neighbors, which include without limitation, emitting pungent odors, attracting undesirable visitors, increasing criminal activity, driving down property values, and limiting the rental of premises.”
The lawsuit also alleges that local and state offices—including the Mass. Department of Public Health, the Mass. Attorney General, and the city of Cambridge—are “facilitating and encouraging violations of the federal drug laws by licensing and permitting marijuana businesses.”
Scott A. Schlager, one of Dhanda’s lead attorneys, wrote in an emailed statement that the case highlights the tensions between state and federal law regarding marijuana distribution.
“While this is a case of first impression in Massachusetts, at least four cases in other states that have legalized marijuana, including Colorado and Oregon, have raised similar legal claims to protect the property rights of abutters significantly impacted by marijuana dispensaries,” he wrote.
Still, Marc C. McGovern, vice mayor of Cambridge, said that he does not believe the Healthy Pharms outlet would violate any current city regulations.
“Medical marijuana is legal in Massachusetts, and the city has zoning,” McGovern said. “To the best of my knowledge, this dispensary would comply with this zoning.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, urged Dhanda in a June email exchange to withdraw his lawsuit “for the good of Harvard Square and for the good of our community.”
“There is overwhelming support from our political, civic and business leaders for a medical marihuana dispensary in Harvard Square,” Jillson wrote to Dhanda. “There is also overwhelming support from the residents of this community who voted 73% in favor, including residents of Winthrop Street who attended the public meetings and were quite satisfied.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard sophomores have started a student group dedicated to raising awareness about and effecting political change in the American South.
The new group, called Southerners Organizing Urgent Transformation Through Harvard College, is a “social, cultural, and political student organization concerned with the intersectional enactment of justice in the Southern United States and its communities”, according to an informational email sent on Tuesday by the group’s founder and executive chair Trevor W. Ladner ’20.  The club, which uses the acronym SOUTTH, is recruiting members in order to gain recognition from the College as an official student organization.
SOUTTH’s initiatives will include hosting conversations with Southern activists and political figures, sponsoring the work of other organizations like the College Democrats, and publishing political statements. The group will focus specifically on the “areas of economic justice, environmental justice, healthcare, immigrant rights, LGBTQ rights, racial justice, religious rights, and women’s rights”, according to Ladner’s email.
Last spring, Ladner began brainstorming for SOUTTH with fellow sophomore Nicholas T. Wyville ’20, who will serve as the organization’s political chair. The students, who hail from Mississippi and Alabama, respectively, said they were inspired to form the club by their experiences as Harvard students from the South.
Ladner says he is determined to remedy a lack of representation of “Southern perspectives” at Harvard, which he believes has left many of his peers uninformed on issues affecting the South.
Wyville analyzed data from a 2017 Crimson feature and found that very few Harvard seniors plan to live in the South after graduating, a trend he says results in “brain drain” and a lack of improvement in the area.
Therefore, a major of objective of SOUTTH is to “convince people who do have liberal views of justice...and who do have a certain leverage going to academic institutions like Harvard to use that power and knowledge to create progress in [the South],” Ladner said.
Though SOUTTH will be a decidedly “left-of-center” political organization, its founders say they also want to create a social space for students from the South. They plan to host parties and pregames as well as arrange celebrations for holidays such as Mardi Gras.
SOUTTH is not yet officially recognized, but Ladner and Wyville said they are hopeful the Undergraduate Council’s Rules Committee will approve the group because of its student interest and mission. As of last Wednesday, 33 students had filled out the club’s interest form, according to Ladner and Wyville.
SOUTTH is looking for students to fill three remaining positions on its executive board, as well as general members. The group’s first meeting will be next week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After sweeping its weekend’s opponents, Yale and Lafayette, by a combined 8-2 score line, No. 14 Harvard (6-2) traveled to Worcester, Mass., for a mid-week face off against Holy Cross (5-4). Despite the team’s recent run of success, senior midfielder and co-captain Hannah Wellington stressed the importance of continuing to approach each game one at a time.
“One thing we always talk about as a team is taking every game as it comes,” Wellington said.
“We always want to focus on ourselves and tell ourselves that this is the next game; this is the next problem that we are going to overcome as a team.”
After a blistering start, the Crimson eventually overcame the Crusaders 7-0 to continue its hot start to the season.
Harvard head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden noted his team’s relience on a collective effort to secure the decisive victory.
“One aspect which has been working well has been our ability to rotate people in,” van Herwaarden said. “When we do that, we aren’t compromising ourselves at any part of the field. That’s great to see.”
Harvard’s offensive onslaught began at the sound of the whistle.
After firing off seven shots in the first eight minutes of play, the Crimson was finally able to find the back of the net.
In the ninth minute, sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen played a pass to Wellington, whose shot beat the Holy Cross goalkeeper for the opening goal.
Following a lull in the action, Wellington found herself playing the scorer role yet again.
The co-captain received a pass from sophomore forward Maddie Earle in the 22nd minute to score her second goal of the day. After assisting on the first goal of the game, van Vlijmen found herself on the score sheet once more, this time in the 24th minute, as the Dutch midfielder scored from the top of the circle to extend Harvard’s lead to 3-0.
The string of Crimson scoring did not end there, as the team managed to add on another goal before the close of the half.
In the 34th minute, freshman Tessel Huibregsten rushed up the field and played a cross to junior forward Kathleen Young, who tapped the ball in for the score. With the goal, Young extended her scoring streak to six games. She currently leads the team with 17 points on the year.
The second half was more of the same for Harvard, as the team fired off three shots in the first six minutes of action.
Entering the 42nd minute, Young managed to corral a rebound in front of the net and put it away for her second goal of the game.
Two minutes later, Earle collected a pass from co-captain Ellie Cookson and managed to slot it into the net to extend the Crimson’s lead to 6-0. Freshman forward Mimi Tarrant added to the momentum, scoring Harvard’s seventh and final goal in the 65th minute, as she managed to score off of her own rebound.
While the game was a showcase of the Crimson’s offensive potential, the defense also put forth an impressive performance.
While Harvard’s offense took 33 shots in the contest, the defense limited Holy Cross to just three, with only two of those being on goal. In another strong showing, senior goal keeper Olivia Startup notched her second shutout and improved to 5-0 in her starts on the  season.
“I think it was a great team performance,” van Herwaarden said. “We are on a nice streak at the moment, which I think allows us to play a bit more freely. We had some confidence in our passes. Once we scored the first goal, we were just hungry for even more.”
Coming off of Wednesday night’s victory, the Crimson will look to an upcoming home game against Penn.  In its second Ivy League match up of the season, Harvard will attempt to carry the season’s early success into its showdown against the Quakers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to be an idealistic young man.
I used to think that Harvard students would come to football games if you made them more fun. That deep within every student was the same innate desire to see players batter each other for glory. That getting A’s in college was easy. That Santa Claus was real. That Yale was a good school.
I get reminded of my insolence every Saturday as I sit among the concrete sea of empty seats. Last weekend’s tailgate, that happened to be more populated by students during the game than the game itself, further solidified my opinion that most Ivy League kids simply do not care about football.
But for the three that do,  my picks:
URI AT BROWN
I don’t know which is more surprising: the fact that URI beat Harvard or that Rhode Island has enough colleges to actually have a state rivalry, which apparently this is. The two will meet for the 102nd time to play for the “Governor’s Cup,” which in Rhode Island I guess is a shot glass.
With a 1-3 record, URI is in the midst of their best start to a season in four years. No, I am not kidding. The team sent a good(ish) Central Michigan squad to overtime in its season opener and beat Harvard two weeks ago. We’ll call the latter a fluke.
Harvard had a fluke of its own Saturday when Brown forgot to field its actual quarterback. When the 2016 playcaller, Thomas “Golden Arm” Linta, finally did take the helm of the Bears’ sinking ship late in the third quarter, he was beautiful in every sense of the word. The man threw for 232 yards, three touchdowns, and ran in another all in the span of 15 minutes. That’s 10 more yards than Harvard threw all game. You’d have to go to Brown to not start him this week, which luckily for the Bears, their coach didn’t.
Pick: Brown 35, URI 24
DARTMOUTH AT PENN
The only thing that could possibly save Dartmouth from the impending loss this weekend is a stray bullet hitting Penn wideout Justin Watson in the knee. Even so, the kid would probably just wrap it up and still drop 30 points on the Big Green.
Both are undefeated this season, but Penn just scored 65 points last week against Lehigh, the most in a single game for the team since 1946. Dartmouth merely went to OT against a competitive Holy Cross team. Dartmouth is good, just not Justin-Watson-without-a-bullet-in-his-leg good.
Pick: Penn 46, Dartmouth 31.
HARVARD AT GEORGETOWN
This game will be hosted in Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in D.C., which seats 45,000 people. For reference, Georgetown games are typically attended by about 3,000 people. My Hebrew Bible lecture Friday morning will be less empty. On the net, I think this is for the best. The larger the arena, the harder it will be to hear the band, which means everyone wins.
Harvard’s defense was stellar in its last game against Brown, and I don’t see that changing. The Crimson’s offense thrived under the direction of senior quarterback Joe Viviano and will probably do so again.
Georgetown lost to Marist. Stick to basketball.
Pick: Harvard 34, Georgetown 14
COLUMBIA AT PRINCETON
Both teams are undefeated, but neither has had a particularly tough schedule. Princeton beat Lafayette, 38-17, which seems alright until you realize that Lafayette is so bad that anything less than a 40-point victory is a moral loss. Speaking of moral losses, Columbia beat Wagner by only three points. Neither team looks particularly exceptional.
One of the Transformers movies was filmed at Princeton, which I feel delegitimizes the institution from the outset. As for the football team, their quarterback might just be a Transformer. Chad “Rain Maker” Kanoff has completed over thirty passes in both of the season’s games. Columbia’s weak defense won’t be able to stop him.
Pick: Princeton 21, Columbia 7.
COLGATE AT CORNELL
Legend has it that on Dragon Day, Cornell students parade around a giant dragon and then light it on fire. No one is really sure why but some speculate it’s to celebrate graduation with a physical representation of their job prospects with a Cornell degree. The only dumpster fire more impressive than a melting dragon on a crisp March morning is the school’s football program.
In the season’s first two games, Cornell didn’t come within 25 points of either opponent. Which is weird because you’d think that as a student-athlete living in the Ithaca, N.Y., you’d have nothing to do but practice. Guess not.Colgate exposes the cavities in the Cornell defense.
Pick: Colgate 31, Cornell 14
YALE AT FORDHAM
Traveling to the Bronx for a football game might be disconcerting for any regular team, but then again Yale is no regular team.
Hailing from the trashcan of New Haven they call home, it turns out the Yale football players will be statistically safer in one of New York’s most crime-ridden neighborhoods than their classmates holed away in Yale’s libraries. Will the decreased probability of being shot have an effect on the way Yale plays? That remains to be seen. Yale does come into the match up sporting a 2-0 season record. Its  sophomore quarterback has hung more than 45 points on both opponents thus far and Fordham hasn’t scored that many points once. The only thing easier than this pick was getting into Yale.
Pick: Yale 54, Fordham 21

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On any given day, a pedestrian walking down Cowperthwaite Street will likely hear the sweet voice of Luke Combs pouring out of the fourth-story windows of Leverett House’s G Tower. While Combs is an unknown artist to the majority of the Harvard student body, for a squad of Southern football players, the rising North Carolinian country music star is a reminder of where they are from.
Nearly half of the Crimson’s starting defense spends its off days in the towers. Linebackers Chase Guillory, Alex White, Peter Graves, and captain Luke Hutton room with safety Tanner Lee, defensive end Scott Evans, defensive tackle Stuart Johnson, and the lone offensive player, Jack Stansell.
While it’s not rare for athletes to block together, particularly athletes from the same sport, what is rare is the relationship that this group has developed, the leadership that they’ve acquired, and the mentality they share. For most of the group, it begins with faith.
“Coming from a Christian household myself, having those guys to lean on, having our weekly meetings, devotion groups,” White said. “You know, this place can be tough. Having external sources to lean on and get through these things, it’s huge.”
White, Hutton, and Stansell lead what the team calls Iron Man, a Bible study for the Christian members of the team. They’re also involved members of Harvard’s Christian Impact and Athletes in Action groups on campus. Through both, the group has established a strong community of faith among the teammates.
Accountability for these athletes is more than just spiritual, especially for those that compete on opposite sides of the ball.
“I’m the only offensive player, and when we get home from practice, I’m usually hearing it from those guys, especially if they have a good day at the end of practice,” Stansell said. “They’re always giving me crap like, ‘Why weren’t y’all able to get a touchdown on that particular play?’”
Calling themselves the “Southern Gents,” the blocking group ultimately began with simple geography and culture. All of the seniors, except for Graves and Evans, hail from a Southern state.
“We’ve just bonded together since day one,” Stansell said. “Tanner [Lee] and I played against each other in high school, so we knew one another coming from Alabama. I met Alex [White] on my official visit. The other guys were just right there with us from day one. We went to get meals together the first few days of freshman preseason, and we’ve been there ever since.”
Besides religion and geography, group members share an impressive list of accomplishments. Together, they competed in 17 sports and achieved 10 captaincies. The group contains a valedictorian, a Mr. Teen Fiesta, a DECA vice president, an NHS president, a three-term class president, and a representative on an honor council.
The story doesn’t end there, though. Since arriving at Harvard, the players have continued an upward trajectory. Hutton is the team’s captain, and several other players have earned starting roles. Two blockmates concentrate in biomedical engineering, two in economics, and the rest in bioengineering, applied math, statistics, and government.
“Of course we goof around whenever we’re home, and we crank out p-sets together because [many] of us study biomedical engineering,” Guillory said. “But when we come out [to the field], it’s like that chemistry that was developed off the field transpires onto the field.”
The natural brotherhood that has resulted from the group’s religious relationships and proximity to each other is very tangible in the defensive numbers the Crimson have put up this season. The starting 11 has allowed 17 points in the season’s first two games and proved especially effective against Brown. In that game, the Bears did not earn a first down until the second quarter. The offense did not score until the fourth.
In the first two games of the season, the Harvard football team has made 145 tackles. This single blocking group in Leverett can claim responsibility for over a fourth of them.
“They have great personal qualities,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “They’re guys that are certainly talented, but they become really outstanding players because they love the game so much, they work hard at it, and they never lose an opportunity to find a way to improve. It’s really a great group of kids.
Sitting across the table from this group in the Leverett dining hall would give you a startlingly similar view to that of the quarterback playing Harvard. Nearly every person is a starter in his respective position.
“We’re a very tight-knit group,” White said. “Bringing that aspect to college and to a college football team has been huge because it truly is a family out here. Having a tight-knit blocking group like that is so huge and instrumental for getting through everything.”

Dear Mankiw,
Before coming to Harvard, we freshmen had already heard about you as the illustrious professor of economics who was so good at lecturing that he only had to lead class four times a semester. We struggled over your textbooks in high school while trying to fathom why the Phillips curve even existed. We even read your insightful article in the New York Times, where you came to the magnificent conclusion that you were happy to pay $2500 for Hamilton tickets, and lamented the fact that others couldn’t.
But let’s stop and relax for a moment. Maybe we’ve been too hard on you. After all, it was Harcourt Bruce that enticed you into writing the textbooks that would eventually be a nationwide phenomena. It’s not like you set out to gain royalties worth more than $140 million. And now that you're giving some of that to charity, we guess you’re not as bad of a person as we first thought.
When you read this letter, we hope you can rest a bit easier at night knowing that you still have your fans out there, even though you might not be able to buy as many Broadway tickets as before.
Sincerely,
Your Freshman Fans
