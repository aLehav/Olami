After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard expands its efforts to construct buildings in Allston, so too does it try to construct relationships with Allston residents. To aid these efforts, Harvard has partnered with the city of Boston since 2008 to build the Harvard-Allston Partnership Fund, providing grants for community programming that benefits Allston residents. The fund recently reached a milestone, having allotted $1 million in grants to local nonprofits over the last decade.
At a Wednesday event celebrating HAPF’s milestone, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh praised University President Drew G. Faust for her dedication to strengthening Harvard’s relationship with Allston. He then stated that he would hold President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow to the same standards as he did Faust. As he enters the presidency this summer, Bacow should heed Walsh’s comments about being cognizant of Harvard’s relationship with Allston. He should be equally or even more supportive as Faust was in fostering a mutually beneficial and respectful partnership with the neighborhood that Harvard is entering.
We are gratified by the sentiment behind HAPF. Harvard should support the Allston community and show the residents of Allston that it is fully committed to helping them and their community in whatever way that it can. Giving funds to local nonprofits is an excellent way to display this sentiment. Nevertheless, this is not the only benefit of the program.
Nonprofits local to Allston understand the community better than any Harvard administrator or student ever could. Indeed, one of the many advantages of smaller, more local nonprofits is that they are closer to the community they serve. Another advantage is that they are more flexible and can adapt to the particular needs of any specific neighborhood—in this case Allston—better. Yet another is that they often have passionate community members involved in their work that volunteer significant amounts of time.
Giving funds to these small, local nonprofit organizations in Allston thus makes the most sense, as it will probably have the most long-lasting positive impact on the community—economic and otherwise.
For Allston residents, however, these funds are not an additional boon to a local economy, but rather a reprieve from the negative effects of gentrification.
It is almost impossible to stop an expanding university from radically changing a neighborhood such as Allston, and land values are bound to increase. Allston’s residents—in particular its poorer ones—may be especially prone to these effects as compared to residents of other Boston neighborhoods or Cambridge.
Seen as one of the last havens of affordable living that lies within the confines of the greater Boston area, 90 percent of Allston residents rent (as opposed to own) the place where they live. This constitutes one of the lowest home ownership rates in Boston, meaning Allston residents are especially susceptible to being displaced from their homes as a result of rising land values that cause increased rent.
While the sources of gentrification can be difficult to ascertain, there are some clear trends that have contributed to the phenomenon in Allston. Some of the gentrification can be attributed to Harvard’s ongoing development of the area and the anticipation of a new Harvard campus, even if that development has not yet been completed. Yet another part of Allston’s gentrification can be explained by rising land prices in downtown Boston pushing up rent prices in areas elsewhere that were previously not considered as “desirable."
Furthermore, a 2015 law that disproportionately taxes multi-family homes—often seen as one of the main ways to achieve economic stability in as a working-class family in Boston—targets lower-income families and makes them more susceptible to rising rents and displacement. Unfortunately, this law also has led to a general 13 percent increase in property tax assessments in Allston, which inevitably leads to rising rents and the further pricing out of many residents.
These factors have culminated in Allston-Brighton rents increasing by 8 percent in 2016. This is especially concerning, given that, in the same year, the average Boston rent decreased for the first time in years.
Generally, gentrification must be examined in the context of other factors. Its benefits, such as increased property tax revenue and more well-funded public schools, must also be taken into account. Neither its benefits or costs should be overemphasized. In the past, we have supported actions that we believed would cause gentrification, simply by virtue of the fact that, at times, the unavoidable costs that stem from it are not enough to halt a particular course of action.
In the case of Allston, however, we believe previous circumstances increasing land values and endangering its reputation as an affordable place to live within the city limits of Boston warrants the University to be especially cautious. University administrators in charge of the expansion therefore must make sure not to cause further gentrification within Allston that could have long-lasting negative impacts on its residents. We have previously opined that gentrification is a problem within Cambridge, but, for the reasons discussed above, this trend could be far worse in Allston.
Without caution, Harvard’s unfinished new campus could harm the residents of Allston for years to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I, along with many, watched Dave Chappelle’s comedy specials “Equanimity & The Bird Revolution” the first moment I could on New Year’s Eve. Chappelle had already lightly tarred his reputation as a good lefty in the last Netflix specials for making transphobic jokes and praising Bill Cosby for his comedic legacy. He did not fail to disappoint in this series, as he criticized American liberalism with American liberalism—stating that the progress of the BGLTQ movement can be in some ways attributable to white privilege, that #metoo focused too dangerously on accusation to avoid backlash, and that Presdient Donald Trump may be good for America as a catalyst of political engagement. He then encouraged comedians to “speak recklessly,” which seemed like two interesting words to place in the book of great Democratic quotes if such a book exists.
In those two hours, Chappelle seemed to symbolize the figure that liberal Americans neither wanted nor needed but certainly lacked—a careless loyalist, who convinced few besides himself of his loyalty to progressivism. His sin: He seemed to understand too well liberalism’s contradictions.Unsurprisingly, liberals on college campuses, especially elite ones like Harvard, live in liberal bubbles. We are held to the same triggers. Our complicated codes of pleasantries work so that in a polarized political landscape, we can miraculously communicate with facades of diversity without encountering an opinion that truly upsets us. This common experience describes an inevitable liberal utopia occurring when its constituents are too immature to be bitter, too comfortable to be ungenerous, and too invested in their perceived greatness to be jealous.
Our classifications of ourselves fall along equally simplistic lines. Liberals support universal healthcare, minimum wages, and anti-racism. Liberal politics seemed to be motivated by a motto driven by stated values of empathy, moral elasticity, and fairness: to do the least harm to those most vulnerable in society. Liberal culture, such as political correctness and trigger warnings, seemed a natural extension of this philosophy. It surrounded an analogous call—to protect socially those most vulnerable through the strict guarding of language.But this call seems to break down repeatedly in the very effort to apply it—especially in an era of polarization such as ours, where media outlets profit from our anger, the spread of news is virulent, and the capital bar of exposure to other people’s informed or uninformed opinions has never been lower. The reason seems to be an intolerance for negativity, though we are surrounded by political negativity in our daily lives through presidential ignorance, quotidian chauvinism, and angrier extremes. This intolerance does not allow us to treat others with the empathy they deserve as our countrymen. But furthermore, it lends itself to our own division.
Earlier this year, psychology professor Steven Pinker was thrust into the spotlight by Twitter users for sympathizing with the alt-right after a clip of a panel Pinker participated in went viral. Pinker’s full thesis was the opposite—he had been attempting to highlight the alt-right’s blind spots while explaining a possible route for radicalization. However, his initial characterization of the alt-right’s membership as “highly literate, highly intelligent,” and “internet-savvy,” completely overshadowed for some liberal audiences a thesis intended for healthy, self-preserving, critical examination.
The Crimson published a piece on Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz’s supposed defense of Trump in response to accusations of collusion. Dershowitz’s position was surprisingly moderate: that to frame the opinions of half of our electorate into sources of contempt, signals of undiagnosed psychological abnormality, and fuel for unfounded accusations of collusion, is simply avoiding too much. Dershowitz in the piece was, if anything, an ardent Trump denouncer, stating he voted for Clinton and “goes out of [his] way to condemn [Trump’s] policies.”
When Ashleigh Banfield, a CNN news anchor, spoke against Aziz Ansari’s sexual assault accuser in an open letter, Katie Way—a 22-year-old writer who initially broke the story—wrote, “[That] burgundy lipstick bad highlights second-wave feminist has-been … DISGUSTS me” in a decidedly unfeminist manner.
Even the most visible of liberal public figures have their words distorted, their interiorities assumed, and their motivations bastardized by the very groups they attempt to support. We lose sight of our greater goal, which is the re-establishment of a healthy country. We instead reserve our energies for petty defenses against the nuances of our own agenda.Language is the gatekeeper of ideas. As words such as slurs must be banned for this reason, we cannot guard our language to the point that we imagine what is nonexistent, ban leaders who should be celebrated, and delegitimize ourselves through the intentional misrepresentation of valid ideas.
I advocate, as always, for an expansion of language and therefore of thought, empathy, and humanism: a political environment where people of all sides can listen to others without rudimentary mocking; where it is plausible for a group to be wrong yet logical; where we can include discouraged citizens back into our electorate, and create, once again, a forgiving middle-ground. The future of American liberalism may depend on such an expansion, as the worst action a group can take is to alienate its own constituents.
And though not all may agree on each moment of Chappelle’s delivery, he may have stated the simplest ideological bases we should all agree on as Americans, sounding more radical than he should have: “I don’t understand all the choices that people make. But I do understand that life is hard, and those choices do not disqualify [anyone] from a life of dignity, happiness, and safety.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez was my freshman seminar professor. He taught me about the complex history of Mexico, a history that I was desperate to finally learn in an academic setting. I was captivated by the idea of learning about the political practices of my native country from a leading expert in Latin American politics.
A Chronicle of Higher Education article from earlier this semester detailed Dominguez’s sexual harassment of a junior colleague in the 1980s. Seventeen more women have courageously decided to speak up over the past year. Harvard took some action against Dominguez in 1983, but they should have done more. He should have never been entrusted to teach again—especially not a freshman seminar, a course that is intentionally supposed to foster an intimate relationship among professors and incoming students.
While the administration at the time failed to implement proper repercussions for Dominguez, this institution should have been more proactive and conscious during the years that followed. They should not have waited until more women came forward before thinking about the severe consequences of their inaction. Moving forward, Harvard must do better for victims of sexual harassment and be stricter with the perpetrators—including prominent professors within their faculty.
Dominguez should have never been allowed to become my professor. Harvard allowed us to look up to him by remaining silent, putting freshman students particularly in a vulnerable position.
Halfway through the fall semester last year, I found out about the 1983 incident through an old Crimson article while looking Dominguez up online. Understandably, my classmates and I had no idea how to respond or how to interact with him moving forward given the complicated power dynamics of the situation. We were invited into his home for coffee, alone with him over weekly breakfasts, and behind closed doors with him during his office hours. Harvard fostered an environment that potentially placed incoming students in danger.
Harvard not only allowed for this to happen, but encouraged us to actively engage with a man that posed a potential threat. While we had grown to respect him as a result of the seminar program’s intentionally personal structure, Harvard was wrong in allowing freshmen to get close to a professor who they knew to have a history of sexual harassment.
In Harvard’s efforts to reach out to former students, they failed to personally reach out to any of the freshmen that partook in his freshman seminar. I am glad Harvard take some action against him and that undergraduate students are continuing to organize for better administrative responses to cases of sexual harassment. However, several months later, there has been very little administrative reform or concrete action items.
Additionally, it is worth addressing the implications that Dominguez’s actions can have on future efforts to increase the number of Latinx faculty in the Government department and how an inadequate response is to the detriment of the Latinx community.
As a Latino and potential Government concentrator, I am disappointed that the University has cost itself more Latinx representation in a department that desperately needs our perspective. Students spoke about Dominguez's effect on the lack of expertise and representation of Latin American studies in the Government department in 1983—deterring prominent faculty and students alike from staying at Harvard. More than three decades later, nearly nothing has changed.
According to a report by the Office of the Senior Vice Provost, only seven percent of government faculty at the University is a tenured “underrepresented minority.” The exact number of Latinx people is likely too minute to be given its own category.
The importance of Latinx representation in the Government Department cannot be understated. Over half of the students in my freshman seminar were Latinx, a testament to the clear desire for incoming students to be taught by professors who look like them. However, we should have had more than one Latinx professor to choose from.
Harvard should have closed its doors on Jorge Dominguez three decades ago, and his actions should not have deterred them from opening the door for future Latinx professors to enter fields in which such experts are vastly underrepresented. Additionally, just because Dominguez has retired does not mean that Harvard is off the hook. They must be held accountable to ensure the safety of their students and employees.
We assumed that Harvard would never allow for a perpetrator of sexual harassment to continue to teach. We assumed wrongly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard recently planted five trees outside of the Smith Campus Center—replacing four trees that were removed in 2016—as part of the ongoing renovation of the center, slated to open in Fall 2018.
When the trees were cut down in 2016 to make way for construction, many Cantabrigians said they were upset to see them go.
Elena Saporta, a landscape architect on the board of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said she was glad to see the trees replanted, recalling how upset she was when they were originally removed.
“I was totally shocked. I remember going by the site and seeing sort of day-glow red and orange spray paint where the trunks had been, and that was just a very poignant reminder of what had happened,” Saporta said.
Charles M. Sullivan, executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission, said changes to the plaza were, including the tree removal, were controversial.
“The community was quite upset when the proposal was made to make the plaza smaller and also to remove the trees,” he said. “Trees have a sort of a built-in constituency in Cambridge, and these were familiar to a lot of people.”
The newly planted trees outside the Smith Campus Center are skyline honey locusts, London planes, and yellowwood, species chosen because they are well-suited for New England’s climate and have long lifespans, according to Harvard’s Director of Common Spaces Julie Crites.
Crites wrote in an emailed statement that the trees are part of a larger plan to revitalize the space.
“The new trees, along with the plazas, new chess tables, seating, and common spaces, are part of the University’s effort to create an outdoor space that’s welcoming and inviting,” she wrote.
Crites added that the new trees will be carefully maintained to maximize their lifespans.
“The new plantings also include the introduction of structural soils and state-of-the-art irrigation and aeration systems, which will greatly enhance the long-term viability of the newly installed trees,” Crites wrote.
Throughout the process of removal and replanting, planners used focus groups and surveys to learn about public perceptions of the project, and worked with the Cambridge city government, Cambridge Historical Commission, and Harvard Square Neighborhood Association to negotiate details of the project.
“The trees were only a small part of the whole review, which involved construction of the student activities center on Holyoke Street and the construction of the glass box that’s being completed now that extended into the Forbes Plaza space, and the restoration of the exterior of the entire building,” Sullivan said.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, wrote in an email she was “delighted” to see the trees return.
“Clearly, these new trees will provide shade, color and beauty,” Jillson wrote. “Our expectations have been exceeded and we look forward to warm afternoons under their shade and crisp fall days enjoying their color.”
Cambridge Vice Mayor Jan Devereux, who previously said she was disappointed to see the trees go, said she was excited to see that the replacements were not “little matchstick trees."
“I am really impressed at how big they are,” Devereux said. “They had said they would replace them, but typically when mature trees are removed for development and new trees are replanted, the new ones aren’t as big. They made an unusually big effort.”
Despite the replanting, Sullivan said it is too soon to tell whether the new trees will live up to their predecessors.
“In general, replacement trees are never going to be as satisfying as the ones they replaced, because they’re necessarily small and not mature,” Sullivan said, although he added he had not yet seen the new trees. “Certainly at this time of year they haven’t fully leafed out, so it’s kind of premature to make a judgement.”
The new additions are just five of 45 total trees that Harvard plans to plant around the Campus Center, which remains on track to open this fall.

Clad in a rainbow fur jacket, Harvard Graduate School of Education student Mo Kwok  braved the wind and rain to perform during Arts First in Allston April 29.
Arts First, which lasted from April 26-29, is an annual showcase celebrating student art, which this year, for the first time in its 26-year-long history, expanded into Allston.
On Sunday, students had the option of trekking across the river to participate in events like a mural unveiling at the Ed Portal, a concert featuring Harvard students at The Grove, and a performance of “Antigone” at Harvard Stadium.
Muralist Paul Deo collaborated with Allston and Harvard students for months on the mural, which he named, “We Are One.”
Deo wrote in a March email to the students that the mural would depict, “a futuristic Allston blossoming in positive community utilizing green sustainable technologies.”
Deo wrote he believed that these concepts could “inspire,” “impact,” and “uplift” Allstonians. He hoped to convey the message that “we can survive together as one family” by using “the native beliefs and practices based on and grounded on the teachings learned from the natural world” and “the latest in green sustainable technologies.”
Ben Roy ’20, who produced “Antigone,” said the cast decided to hold the play in Harvard Stadium because it was “the closest thing we have at Harvard to an ancient amphitheater.”
“We wanted to have an area that would allow as many people to come as possible, and also to give that sense of age or time that an old amphitheater would bring,” Roy said.
Roy said he was “pleased” with the audience turnout. He noted that the stadium was close to the Harvard T station, and attendees had quick access to the bus shuttles and parking lots.
“I think there was enough excitement and hype around the event,” Roy said. “I think the only thing you could say reduced turnout would have been the cold.”
Isabella Shaw ’21 said it was “really unique” to see the show in the stadium, which usually houses sports games instead of arts performances.
“This was the only event I was able to go to for Arts First in Allston, but I’m definitely glad I was able to make it to at least one event,” Shaw said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 6, 10:24 p.m.
Several College students gathered in an “emergency Harvard LGBT community action meeting” Friday afternoon to discuss the Office of Student Life’s alleged “refusal to sanction” Harvard College Faith and Action, according to emails sent over College email lists last week.
Roughly 20 undergraduates attended the meeting, which was organized by Matthew Keating ’20, Becina J. Ganther ’20, and Henry “Hank” R. Sparks ’21 and took place in the Phillips Brooks House, according to the organizers.
“The purpose of the meeting was essentially to gather as many stakeholders and interested members of the LGBTQ community at Harvard to discuss this issue,” Keating said. “It was really a way of making sure everyone who’s been working on this issue is not operating in silos.”
The College announced in late February it had placed HCFA on a year-long “administrative probation” after the group’s Sept. 2017 move to ask a woman in a same-sex relationship to resign from her leadership position within the organization.
Currently, it appears the OSL’s probation will have little immediate practical effect; HCFA will not lose the ability to book rooms or recruit students. After the announced probation, the student group has used Yenching Auditorium—a Harvard-operated venue—to host its weekly worship event, Doxa. At this year’s Visitas event for admitted students, HCFA hosted a meet-and-greet event and operated a booth at the Visitas Activities Fair.
According to the organizers of Friday’s meeting, attendees emphasized the need for the College to take stronger disciplinary action against HCFA.
“The major takeaway from the meeting was that, by and large, the community is really outraged about this issue, and I think the group touched upon several issues about why this is complicated,” Sparks said. “I think the biggest takeaway that had the most consensus was that this was a clear act of discrimination against a member of the LGBTQ community and that it merits a response.”
Sparks added that, in the near term, the group of students plans to put together an email campaign to pressure the OSL to place sanctions on HCFA to match the penalties of groups on non-administrative "probation."
“So right now, we’re thinking about launching an email campaign for students and for any other stakeholders that want to get involved, such as alumni, to lobby the Office of Student Life to follow the regulations that they’ve outlined in the handbook for student organizations that are on probation,” Sparks said.
According to the Harvard College Handbook for Students, student organizations can be placed on probation for failing to meet the “registration deadline,” turn in any “registration documents,” or pay off “debts with outside vendors.”
“During the probationary period, the [student group] will be unable to reserve space on campus, advertise for events, use the Harvard name, and/or participate in the visiting program or fall activity fairs,” the handbook reads.
Former HCFA presidents Scott Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18 said college administrators told them HCFA was under a new type of probation.
In an interview last month, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana described the College’s approach to punishing HCFA as “an educational approach.”
“The Office of Student Life is closely working with HCFA leadership to ensure that they’re in compliance with all College policies,” he said. “We are following the same approach that we do with all student organizations when there are concerns about whether they are in violation with our policies.”
Some undergraduates previously organized an email campaign in March to urge the College to enforce stricter penalties on HCFA. Days after the email campaign, a small group of students met with Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis to discuss the OSL’s plans to penalize the group.
Keating, Ganther, and Sparks said that in the short-term, they are focusing their advocacy on immediate disciplinary action.
“Right now we’re really just focused on the probation issue,” Ganther said. “I think that in order to come up with the long-term goals will take a lot more discussion with members of the community, members of faith communities, members of queer and trans communities, and a lot more time thinking about what it is that we actually want to do in the future.”
“We’re also thinking about the fact that Harvard as an institution is a school that a lot of other schools sometimes look to,” she added. “We don’t want to set precedent for any other part of the University or other school out there that discrimination is okay.”
Sparks and the other organizers said they appreciated the points attendees raised at the meeting Friday.
“I think it was a very successful meeting,” Sparks said. “I think a lot of people came and very respectfully engaged with each other about what they think should be done right and now and what sort of space HCFA should be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 35 female faculty at the Graduate School of Design have signed onto a statement in support of student activism in response to a spreadsheet accusing men at the school of engaging in sexual and racial misconduct.
The “Shitty Architecture Men” spreadsheet was an anonymous, publicly available list that named 18 GSD affiliates as perpetrators of misconduct towards school affiliates and others in the architecture world more broadly. The accused range from studio instructors to lecturers to top leaders at the school, including current Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi and former chair of the school’s Department of Architecture Iñaki Ábalos.
The spreadsheet also named over 100 architects and academics affiliated with other universities and firms. It is now “temporarily closed,” according to a message posted by the list’s administrators.
In response to the list, individual students and student organizations at the GSD hung banners denouncing sexual misconduct in the school’s main workspace last month and wrote a letter to the school urging administrators to take “concrete” action to prevent sexual misconduct. They have continued to hold meetings with school leaders to discuss harassment at the school and in the field at large.
Since the start of student activism around the issue, the school “made plans” to hire a diversity and inclusion officer, according to an email Mostafavi sent to Design School affiliates in April.
Design School Executive Dean Patricia Roberts first sent the statement by female faculty to GSD students, faculty, and staff on April 23. After a number of female faculty wanted to sign the list, an updated version was sent out May 3.
Female faculty praised students’ efforts in their statement—which they first circulated April 23—and emphasized their support for an issue they said also affects their lives.
“As members of the GSD we, the women faculty, are united in support of the student body in denouncing discrimination, harassment and aggressions against any member of our community,” the statement reads. “We will not tolerate it, we will not stand silent.”
“We do so by acknowledging that we too have suffered and still do from this culture in our own daily encounters, both here and in the broader design community,” the statement continues.
Toshiko Mori, a professor of practice in architecture at the Design School,  said female senior and junior faculty members collaborated in writing the statement and circulating it to all female faculty at the GSD.
“It is not really about any accusations or specific issues on the list, but it was very important for us that we help create an environment where students and everybody else feel safe,” Mori said.
Toni L. Griffin, a professor in practice of urban planning, wrote in an email Sunday that faculty “must play” a role in “producing long term change” within the school and the field.
“I helped put together and sign the letter because as leaders within our school and discipline, I felt it was important that we support our students and acknowledge the role we too, as women faculty, must play in advancing an accepting and inclusive environment for all students, faculty and staff through strategies that ultimately produce long term change,” Griffin wrote.
Jennifer R. Bonner, an assistant professor of architecture at the school, said she decided to sign the statement after being “frustrated” at the “Shitty Architecture Men” spreadsheet.
“I had reviewed it and got pretty frustrated after seeing two hundred odd men's names on it, many my colleagues at the GSD,” Bonner said. “I am very proud of our students who have really taken the lead and taken charge in demanding action and so for me, this is the very minimum we could do in support of our student body who is really leading the charge.”
Bonner also said the “Shitty Architecture Men” spreadsheet did not come as a surprise to her, since she had previously heard stories of misconduct by men listed on the sheet.
“A lot of the names on the list are people we have heard things about in the past,” Bonner said. “It was shocking just to see it all collected in one place.”
Lily Song, a lecturer in urban planning and design, said she signed the statement because she wanted ensure students knew that incidents they have may have experienced with male professors and administrators at the school were not “isolated.”
“I also wanted them to know that those are not isolated incidents that students suffer but that women faculty are also dismissed and disrespected and denigrated regularly in subtle but also very overt ways,” Song said.
A Design School spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
Diane E. Davis, chair of the department of urban planning and design, wrote in an email Sunday that she was “empowered” by the faculty statement and hopes to continue working on improving conditions at the GSD and the design field.
“Just the mere act of coming together as women faculty to discuss the possibility of articulating a response, and our subsequent collective efforts have been very empowering,” Davis wrote. “I very much look forward to further efforts to deepen the school’s commitment to alleviating gender improprieties, among other pressing concerns about the work and practice environment which deeply affect us all.”

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana spoke out against certain social group members’ recent efforts to combat Harvard’s controversial sanctions in an interview April 27.
Asked whether he is concerned by the movement to oppose the penalties, Khurana said he thinks “people should respect a private institution’s ability to organize itself around its mission.”
“At Harvard, we have a very specific mission of educating citizens and citizen leaders for our diverse and interconnected society,” Khurana said. “We do not believe that it is effective to basically institutionalize segregation.”
“Separate is not equal,” he added.
Harvard announced penalties on members of unrecognized single-gender social groups in May 2016, sparking roughly two years of administrative, campus, and national debate over the policy’s validity. The College’s sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
Across the past few months, graduate and undergraduate members of single-gender social groups have mobilized to lobby members of Congress in favor of the PROSPER Act. The act, a piece of legislation meant as an update to the Higher Education Act, contains a provision that could force the University to choose between its sanctions and millions of dollars in research funding.
Though the PROSPER Act in its current form likely does not affect Harvard, some social group affiliates hope to change the wording of an amendment to the act to render the legislation applicable to Harvard. The Cambridge Coalition—a group of Greek organizations and final clubs including the Porcellian Club—has retained the D.C. law firm Arnold & Porter to coordinate this lobbying effort on the Hill.
Khurana said in the interview he believes “deference should be given to educators” in being able to pursue their universities’ core missions. He also noted students, when choosing which school to attend, have the ability to examine that school’s policies before matriculating.
“There are many excellent colleges and universities in this country, and for students who may want to join different types of organizations with different philosophies, there’s a wonderful set of institutions,” he said.
Harvard administrators are aware of threat the PROSPER Act amendment may pose to the sanctions. University President Drew G. Faust recently penned a letter to Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican and proponent of the amendment, laying out her concerns with the legislation.
"I worry that the language included in the PROSPER Act represents an effort by Congress to regulate student life and the shape and character of private institutions in a way that threatens to undermine that diversity of choice and experience," Faust wrote in the letter.
Khurana said he has not been in communication with the members of final clubs who are lobbying around the PROSPER Act.
“I’m not in communication or regular communication, but I welcome any type of dialogue,” Khurana said.
Khurana said he and other College staff, however, have met with leaders of national sororities “at the request of the students” in the sororities.
When asked what he believes to be the driving force behind some social group affiliates’ decision to lobby against the sanctions, Khurana said he did not wish to comment.
“I would never try to question anybody’s motivations,” he said.

UPDATED: May 11, 2018 at 2:13 a.m.
Yascha Mounk, one of Harvard’s rising stars, predicted the rise of populism well before the 2016 election. Mounk, a political theory lecturer in the Government department who pursued his Ph.D. in Government at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, went from a heretic to an academic celebrity virtually overnight.
During his time in graduate school, scholars were minimally worried about the stability of democracy in wealthy and established nations.
“The assumption about democracy was that it was only unstable in poor countries,” Mounk said.
In 2013, The New York Times rejected a piece he wrote about the threats to Western democracies. They said it was well-written, but not a serious enough topic, according to Mounk.
In the wake of the 2016 election, as concerns about populism gained greater traction, scholars began to take Mounk’s ideas more seriously.
His most recent book, “The People vs. Democracy,” was published this year. It discusses the threats of populism to Western democracies and calls readers to action by suggesting next steps, such as “inclusive patriotism.”
Professor of Political Philosophy Michael J. Sandel, who served as Mounk’s chief dissertation advisor, said that Mounk’s most recent book is “an invaluable contribution to the debate about what ails democracy, and what we can do about it.”
Mounk was born in Munich in 1982 after his family fled Poland just decades earlier. As a child, he moved frequently—seven times before attending the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate—due to his mother’s job as an orchestra conductor.
“For various reasons I never really felt at home in Germany. I never loved living there that much, so I always had the idea of going to study abroad,” Mounk said.
Mounk initially planned to study history at Cambridge, but, throughout his studies, he was drawn to timeless political questions.
“I realized that I really loved reading Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, and Machiavelli,” Mounk said. “I wanted to grapple with the kinds of questions they asked, so I transitioned into the study of political philosophy and political theory.”
Mounk’s first book, “Stranger in My Own Country,” is an introspective account of the treatment of Jews in modern Germany.
Growing up in a country with a recent memory of dictatorship informed Mounk’s perspective regarding the fragility of democracy.
Mounk said he looked up to German Chancellor Willy Brandt as he processed his own experiences of alienation as a German Jew.
“Brandt fought against the Nazi Regime and came back to Germany to help the country face up to the parts of its past that Germany was still trying to forget in the '50s and '60s,” Mounk said.
Haunted by the consequences of authoritarianism in his home country, Mounk’s work casts a critical eye on the security of Western democracies.
In recent years, Mounk’s focus has broadened. His interest in the threats to liberal democracy date back to his time as a graduate student at Harvard, when he approached Professor of Comparative Politics Steven Levitsky with his theories about how Western democracy was in crisis.
“Mounk had a crazy set of ideas, but they were really smart,” Levitsky said. “It was a really brilliant take on why there was reason to worry about the state of democracy in the countries in which it had been taken for granted for a long time.”
Unlike many scholars, Mounk saw warning signs long before the election of Donald Trump.
“After Donald Trump was elected president, lots of people, including myself, started running around worrying about how democracy in the West was in crisis,” Levitsky said. “But Yascha was in my office, telling me about this crisis way before Donald Trump was elected, even before he was a candidate.”
When Mounk approached Levitsky as a graduate student, Levitsky did not believe that democracy was in crisis in the West. Since then, however, Levitsky’s perspective has changed. His 2018 book “How Democracies Die,” a New York Times bestseller co-written by Professor of Government Daniel Ziblatt, chronicles the stages by which modern democracies fail.
Levitsky and Ziblatt’s “How Democracies Die” and Mounk’s “The People vs. Democracy” share many similarities in theory, according to Levitsky. The goal of both books is to forefront the threats to democracy in political discourse.
“We wrote these books because we are worried about Western democracy, and we are worried about the American republic,” Levitsky said. “We have long, and I include myself in this, taken the stability of American democracy for granted.”
Kennedy School Professor of Political Leadership and Democratic Values Jane J. Mansbridge said she agrees with much of Mounk’s recent book, but would focus more on “the causes of polarization in the United States.” She cited increased homogeneity of political parties after the Civil Rights Act and the structure of inequality as examples.
Over the years, Mounk has collaborated with academics globally.
Roberto S. Foa, a lecturer in political science at the University of Melbourne, co-wrote an article entitled “The Signs of Deconsolidation” with Mounk, which was the precursor to “The People vs. Democracy.” Foa said Mounk is an impressive and hard-hitting scholar.
“Yascha is an intellectual powerhouse—full of energy, enthusiasm and ideas. I rarely have met anyone with such a pure passion for debate,” Foa said.
Even in his free time, Mounk said he cherishes discussing lofty questions and ideas over dinner and drinks with friends.
“The thing I most enjoy in life is good conversation,” Mounk said.
In addition to writing, Mounk said he loves teaching.
“What I love most about it is helping incredibly smart kids develop their ideas and develop their voice,” Mounk said.
Sharon Yang ’18, who took expository writing with Mounk and later two of his higher level Government classes, said she appreciated his focus.
“It was really clear to me that my writing in Expos improved throughout the course of the semester, and that was a big part of why I wanted to continue taking classes with him,” Yang, a former Crimson news editor, said. “He’s also a really nice, accessible, and down-to-earth guy. That really came through when he held meetings to talk in person about revisions to our papers.”
Samuel H. “Sammy” Koppelman ’18 a former student of Mounk’s, became his research assistant for “The People vs. Democracy” book project. Koppelman, a formal Crimson editorial editor, said Mounk had a great influence on his growth as a government student.
“The environment that Yascha fosters in his classes is one of openness, warmth, and intellectual curiosity,” Koppelman said.
Koppelman said Mounk is committed to his students.
“As successful as Yascha is, and as much attention as he is getting, his north star always seems to be his students,” Koppelman said. “He always asks for student perspectives and tries to understand our challenges. That’s all you can ask for in a professor.”
Despite the pessimistic nature of his theories, Mounk said he is determined to fight for democracies as we know them. As an academic, Mounk is interested not only in describing the current state of affairs, but also in offering prescriptions for action.
“I don’t want to just describe the world. I also want to give people some tools for thinking about what they can do to defend our democracies,” Mounk said.
His latest projects range from articulating a contemporary system of political values to informing the transition to a multi-ethnic society.
One way in which Mounk hopes to effect change is through reaching a popular audience.
Mounk hosts the podcast series, “The Good Fight,” on which he invites prominent scholars to discuss strategies to combat authoritarian populism.
Foa said he was optimistic that Mounk could accomplish any goal.
“As long as I've known him he has only ever gone from strength to strength, and I would expect that to continue,” Foa said.
Koppelman said he felt impassioned to protect democracies after working with Mounk.
“I can’t help but agree with his vision and do everything I can for the rest of my life to prove him wrong,” Koppelman said.
Regardless of Mounk’s future successes, however, his advocates say he has already made an impact on thought surrounding Western democracies.
“Political theorists like Yascha have an important role to play in helping make sense of the world in which we live," Sandel said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 11, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated Yascha Mounk was a graduate student at Harvard Kennedy School. In fact, Mounk earned his Ph.D. from the Government department of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
This is the fourth installment in a five-part series analyzing The Crimson's survey of the more than 1,000 members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard's flagship faculty. Read the first installment here, the second installment here, the third installment here, and the fifth installment here.
Roughly 30 percent of surveyed members of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences say they know at least one person in their department who has experienced sexual harassment or assault at the University.
The Crimson’s faculty survey also revealed that a majority of respondents believe their respective departments foster an environment in which affiliates feel comfortable coming forward about instances of sexual misconduct. A majority of respondents also said they “agree” or “strongly agree” with the University’s response to allegations of sexual harassment made against Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez.
The Crimson conducted a survey of Harvard’s flagship faculty over the course of two weeks in mid-April 2018. The results paint a picture of how the more than 1,000 members of FAS think about key University policies, life at Harvard, the national political climate, and pressing issues of sexual harassment both on campus and nationwide.
The 54-question survey garnered roughly 500 responses, representing more than 40 percent of the Faculty, though not all respondents answered each question. The anonymous survey, emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from April 17 to April 30. The Crimson adjusted the data reported in this story by respondents’ ladder status and divisional affiliation (see below for methodology).
Reports of sexual harassment at Harvard have risen in the past few years.
The Office of Dispute Resolution, which investigates allegations of sexual misconduct, saw a 65 percent increase in formal complaints from the 2015-2016 academic year to the 2016-2017 academic year. ODR also reported an increase in complaints late last year in the wake of the #MeToo movement, a social media campaign asking women to post stories of sexual harassment and assault using the hashtag #MeToo.
When asked whether they they know someone in their department who has experienced sexual harassment at Harvard, 28 percent of survey respondents answered “Yes,” while 13 percent of respondents indicated “prefer not to say.” The remainder answered “No.”
The survey also asked respondents whether they agreed with the assertion that their departments create “an environment where students, faculty, and staff feel comfortable coming forward about instances of sexual misconduct.”
Across all of FAS, the majority of respondents—55 percent—indicated they “agree” or “strongly agree” with the statement. Twenty-one percent indicate they “disagree” or “strongly disagree” and 24 percent reported feeling “neutral.”
Answers varied slightly by department.
A strong majority—66 percent—of respondents who identified themselves as belonging to the Arts and Humanities division indicated they “agree” or “strongly agree” with the statement, while 17 percent selected “neutral.” Around half of respondents who identified themselves as affiliated with the Social Sciences division (53 percent) or Sciences division (50 percent) also indicated they “agree” or “strongly agree.”
Compared to the other three divisions, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences saw the lowest percentage of affiliated respondents indicate they “agree” or “strongly agree”—42 percent.
SEAS also saw the highest percentage—32 percent—of affiliated respondents indicate they “disagree” or “strongly disagree” with the idea their respective departments foster environments in which affiliates feel comfortable speaking up about sexual misconduct.
Sixteen percent of Arts and Humanities respondents also selected “disagree” or “strongly disagree,” while the Social Sciences and Sciences divisions saw 27 percent and 15 percent of respondents do so, respectively.
Younger respondents were more likely to select the “strongly disagree” option. Fifty-eight percent of respondents who strongly disagreed with the statement indicated their ages fall between 25 and 35 years, while 33 percent identified themselves as between 36 and 45 years old. The remaining 9 percent of respondents who strongly disagreed indicated their ages fall between 56 and 65.
Near the start of the 2018 spring semester, allegations of sexual misconduct perpetrated by Government professor Dominguez garnered national attention and prompted criticism of the University’s set procedures for investigating incidents of sexual harassment.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in February and March that at least 18 women are accusing Dominguez of repeated acts of sexual harassment across nearly four decades. After the allegations became public, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced that FAS would conduct a “full and fair” review into the accusations and that Dominguez was being placed on paid “administrative leave.” Shortly after Smith’s announcement, Dominguez, who is currently on sabbatical this semester, announced he will retire at the end of the school year and immediately stepped down from his administrative positions.
The Crimson’s survey asked faculty how they felt about the Harvard’s approach towards the allegations against Dominguez. The majority of survey respondents—58 percent—reported they “agreed” or “strongly agreed” with the University’s actions. Nineteen percent indicated they “disagreed” or “strongly disagreed.”
The Crimson reported in April that FAS has filed a Title IX complaint against Dominguez. Once a formal complaint is filed with the Title IX office—which deals with the federal policy that prohibits sex and gender-based discrimination including sexual harassment—ODR investigates the allegations laid out in that complaint.
But several of the women accusing Dominguez of harassment have said that Harvard is “ill-equipped” to adequately investigate Dominguez. The women have pointed to a variety of factors including what they call a lack of resources and a previous failure to recognize Dominguez’s decades of alleged harassment.
Survey respondents were evenly split in their opinions of the Title IX office and the ODR.
Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported they “agree” or “strongly agree” that the Title IX Office and the Office of Dispute Resolution are adequately equipped to deal with issues of sex and gender-based discrimination on campus. Thirty-one percent indicated they “disagree” or “strongly disagree” with that idea. Thirty-two percent reported feeling “neutral.”
Faculty respondents affiliated with the Sciences were most likely to believe resources allocated to the Title IX Office and ODR are sufficient; 52 percent reported they “agree” or “strongly agree” with that assertion while 21 percent reported they “disagree” or strongly disagree.”
By contrast, respondents hailing from SEAS were least likely to report feeling confident in the offices’ ability to investigate sex and gender-based discrimination; 14 percent indicated they “agree” or “strongly agree” while 55 percent reported they “disagree” or “strongly disagree.”
The Harvard Crimson collected electronic responses through the Qualtrics survey platform from April 17 to April 30, 2018.  A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,173 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced from Harvard directory information and departmental websites.
Of those faculty who received emails, 516 accessed the link to the survey.  A total of 498 participants answered at least one question, and 296 participants completed every question in the survey.  To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device.  This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University—information regarding gender, minority background, divisional affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents who identified themselves as ladder faculty, 34.5 percent were women and 16.2 percent were minorities. Based on data in the 2017 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 29.9 percent and 21.9 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
The Crimson previously reported that, in May 2015, 28.9 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty. By contrast, 42 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty with known divisional affiliations who were sent links to the survey, 317—or 28.5 percent—are affiliated with the Arts and Humanities, 341—or 30.6 percent—with the Social Sciences,  316—or 28.4 percent—with the Sciences, and 140—or 12.6 percent—with SEAS.  In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 39.9 percent reported an affiliation with the Arts and Humanities, 27.8 with the Social Sciences, 28.26 percent with the Sciences, and 7 percent with SEAS.
The Crimson reweighted all responses by ladder status and divisional affiliation—the two demographic categories which saw the most significant areas of response discrepancy. These reweightings did not produce any changes greater than plus or minus 2.5 percent from the unadjusted percentages.
Separately adjusting by gender or minority background yielded no changes greater than plus or minus 0.7 percent to the unadjusted percentages. Therefore, The Crimson did not reweight responses by these two categories.  The data reported in the main body of the story thus does not include any reweightings for gender or minority background.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, Dartmouth softball handily swept Brown to finish 16-5 in conference play. In doing so, the Big Green clinched home field advantage in the Ivy League Championship Series and will host Harvard next weekend in a best-of-three set.
“We’re excited,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “I’m expecting some really great games. I thought both teams played really hard in the regular season series. I’m expecting our team to come out on fire and ready to go, so it’ll be a great series.”
Despite finishing with the better league record, Dartmouth is outmatched by Harvard offensively, and both teams are relatively even in the circle. The Crimson was top-three in the Ivy League in batting average, OBP, and slugging percentage, while the Big Green’s lineup was largely mediocre by conference standards. Dartmouth’s slight pitching advantage comes from its depth—none of its three hurlers posted an ERA above 4.00, and accordingly it led the Ancient Eight in ERA, hits allowed, and walks allowed. If Harvard can ride juniors Katie Duncan and Sarah Smith for the two or three-game set, it will be in a good spot.
“I do think their pitchers are pretty strong if you’re just looking at stats,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “So I think that’s a pretty tough challenge. They have a lot of the top pitching in the Ivy League, but as well I think they have a lot of fire as a team and are going to come out really strong. They don’t really let other teams push them over, so I think that’s going to be the biggest challenge, really fighting to win against how they approach the game.”
JUNIORS PAVING THE WAY
The Crimson’s 2018 lineup is anchored by junior infielders Erin Lockhart, Rhianna Rich, and Meagan Lantz. Lockhart led the team with five home runs and compiled a .369 OBP despite a .202 batting average. Rich paced the league in triples and runs scored while hitting .455 with a 1.174 OPS. Lantz recovered from an ACL injury that kept her off the field last season to hit .376 with a .966 OPS.
This trio was also very active on the basepaths, stealing a combined 30 bags. Lantz led the way with 16, good for second best in the conference. Overall, Harvard swiped 44 bases, also the second-best mark in the Ancient Eight.
Co-captain Maddy Kaplan is a year ahead of the team’s junior core, but she likewise powered the team offensively from the second spot in the lineup. The right fielder closed out her regular season career by hitting .393 with a .948 OPS, racking up 10 doubles and a team-leading 29 RBIs.
 The Crimson’s pitching staff was likewise anchored by juniors. Southpaw Katie Duncan was second in the Ivy League in innings pitched with 130, led the conference with three saves, and compiled a 14-8 record with a 2.75 ERA. Right-hander Sarah Smith was even better from a run prevention standpoint, finishing the year with a 2.13 ERA and a .226 opponents’ batting average.
POWER HITTING, POWER PITCHING
Harvard’s junior leadership is countered by the Big Green’s quartet of power hitters and formidable pitching staff.
Of Dartmouth’s 29 home runs before the conclusion of play on Sunday, 25 were hit by juniors Taylor Ward and Morgan Martinelli, sophomore Micah Schroder, and freshman Schae Nelson. Each had a slugging percentage over .500. The four also drove in 90 of the team’s 134 runs.
Though that group of four kept the Big Green in games offensively, Dartmouth mainly relied on shutting down opposing lineups. Its pitchers were a force to be reckoned with in 2018, as they compiled a 3.12 ERA and a .257 opponents’ batting average ahead of the season finale against Brown.
Senior right-hander Breanna Ethridge was the ace of the staff, compiling a 2.79 ERA and punching out 106 batters in 108 innings of work. Ethridge started 21 games as the Big Green opted for a small three-pitcher rotation, with freshmen Shelby Wilkison and Heather Turner making the rest of the team’s appearances in the circle.
A BIT OF HISTORY
The past two seasons, the Crimson earned a spot in the championship series only to bow out to Princeton both times. Each of those Harvard teams were relatively young, and this year’s iteration will now look to utilize that playoff experience. The Crimson hosted the series in 2016 and lost in three, and it traveled to Princeton last year and was eliminated as the Tigers took the first two contests.
Dartmouth returns to the conference final for the first time since 2015, when it won the series over Penn. The Big Green has just one other championship, which it won the year previous in 2014. Each time, Dartmouth defeated the Quakers to advance to the next round of NCAA playoff competition.
In their regular season meetings on April 21 and 22, Harvard emerged victorious over the Big Green by winning the first two contests. The Crimson prevailed in a marathon in the opener, as Duncan pitched all 11 innings and Lockhart hit a solo homer. Harvard comfortably won game two as Smith took a no-hitter into the fifth, and Dartmouth came back to salvage the Sunday game.
Each team closed out its regular season against Brown, as the Crimson dropped its last series by losing two games to the Bears and the Big Green just wrapped up a sweep.
“We have to earn it these next two weeks and really buckle down and focus on the things we need to work on, and although we did lose two games this weekend I think it’s an opportunity for us to grow and learn how we can be better for the championship,” Rich said.
Allard and her team repeatedly preach the importance of grit, teamwork, and trusting the process, and all three will be crucial heading into playoff softball.
“I think it’ll be really key to stick together as a team and support one another, pick each other up when we need to and come out really with high energy and just [play] for each other and [fight] to keep our season going,” Lantz said.
