After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week’s aptly named episode places great significance on the number two. The plot diverges into two seemingly unrelated scavenging parties: Abraham and Eugene; and Rosita, Daryl, and Denise. At one point, Daryl and company must decide between the convenient yet exposed path by the railroad or the safer woodland path that is “twice” as long.
This lethargic reintroduction into the Alexandria lifestyle emphasizes its monotony and cyclical nature. Parallel, redundant scenes of characters repeating the same routines of guard shifts and kitchen inventory depict the slow passage of time. Now that these characters have set into a normal routine, the episode is neither soulful nor sickening, only dull. For the first half of “Twice as Far,” viewers explore side characters they never knew were capable of depth. It is not until the episode’s jarring midpoint twist that the preceding mundane events begin to make sense. Like many of its predecessors, this episode disarmingly transforms into a parable of regret and the consequences of inaction. Daryl ruminates on his decision not to kill Dwight, who stole his crossbow and bike last season in spite of Daryl’s kindness. Every decision, whether good or bad, is followed by an unforeseen consequence.
This week’s significant character arcs are reserved for Eugene and Denise. Eugene continually attempts to assert his confidence and skills as a survivor in light of his past reliance on others. Unable to forgive Eugene’s past transgressions, Abraham emasculates him while Eugene mocks Abraham’s obsolescence as a killing machine: a classic clash of male egos.  An insecure Abraham, feeling capable only of killing and having sex, hopes to address this deficiency by connecting to Sasha.
Meanwhile, Denise leads Rosita and Daryl on a hunt for pharmaceutical drugs and, eventually, Orange Crush. Frustratingly, she places herself into danger in order to prove to herself that she can make a difference. We learn that she regrets not connecting more with her brother, Dennis, and that she does not want to lose Tara as well. After deciding to take the short railroad path back home, she expresses the importance of action in a motivational speech. It is as predictably touching and hamfisted as any other lesson “The Walking Dead” might preach...until an arrow flies through her right eye.
Dwight and the Saviors return in this jarringly sick midpoint turn, rescuing the audience from what would have been another heavy-handed morality tale episode. A magnificent jolt in the viewing experience, Denise’s sudden death evokes incredulity because no one could have seen it coming. The Saviors bring Eugene as a prisoner, converging the episode’s parallel plot lines. From this point forward, the showdown spirals downward into the season’s recurring savagery, as a captive Eugene literally munches on Dwight’s gonads to create a diversion. Miscellaneous bad guys die while Dwight escapes, and all that is left is Denise’s corpse with an arrow in her eye. This redemptive sequence shifts the episode from its previously drab, stuffy tone into one of both urgency and exasperation. The Saviors turn Denise into a martyr: Of all the characters to die, it had to be the pure, undeserving, and unassuming doctor who finally found the courage to take action. The death itself might have been more affecting were it not drowned out by the exceedingly dreary “Chapel” by Nicole Dollanganger, which might have worked better in “The Hunger Games.” Fittingly, Denise is buried with the “Dennis” keychain she found at the pharmacy, touchingly laying both her and her past to rest.
At the end of the episode, the parallel scenes of monotony in Alexandria repeat, now altered. The marked absence of major characters such as Carol signals a break in the cycle incited by Denise’s death. These characters, stuck in a rut of inaction at the beginning, now understand that merely waiting around in Alexandria is no way to live or get the plot moving. Instead of giving regret time to sink in, they commit to living by disruption—one of the show’s stylistic trademarks. Carol’s departure, likely as a consequence of witnessing the internally destructive nature of Daryl’s regret, may finally take viewers to Negan in the season’s final two episodes. So far, however, our promised villain has been all bark and little bite.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I study Econ. What about you?” he says while cutting the whipped cream-soaked “Veritaffle.”
You clear your throat and say, “Visual and Environmental Studies.”
A moment of silence. “You mean environmental science?”
“No, Visual and Environmental Studies,” you sigh, deciding to give up as the guy at the other end of the table clearly still has no idea what you are talking about. “It’s basically visual arts. I’m a film student.”
As a minority group on campus, film students at Harvard not only need to explain to their friends the name of their concentration and the beauty of the Carpenter Center but also have a very different work schedule. If you want to learn about the life of a Harvard film student or become one yourself, here’s a typical day in the life:
1. 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.: Preparing for Shooting
Most people think the quintessential quality of a film student is visual imagination, but it is in fact heavy lifting ability—camera, sound bag, boom pull, lights, and tripod do not get to the set by themselves. You carry them all the way from your dorm, set them up, and realize you forgot the SD card for your camera. You run back to your dorm, take the SD card, and get back to the set 10 minutes after 9 a.m., the scheduled time for shoot. But it’s all right, because as usual, all your crew are late. One of them can’t find the way, another has problems parking, and the last one simply doesn’t pick up the phone.
2. 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.: Shooting
At 11 o’clock, all your crew are on set, and you start to shoot. The actors can’t remember their lines, and their movements are stiff. You shoot take after take, but they just keep getting worse. You pretend you are delighted by their improvement so that they don’t get pissed off. After 10 takes, you give up and decide to go with the first one. Following a lunch break, you start to shoot the second scene. The sound equipment gets into the frame. Reshoot. The boom pull gets into the frame. Reshoot. You realize you have to miss your 3 p.m. class and also have to beg the actors to stay longer than planned. They reluctantly agree. Suddenly, the sun comes out, and the lighting looks amazing, and the actors are giving unbelievable performances. You can’t believe your eyes. You get a great scene.
3. 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.: Other Things
This includes working on your assignments for other classes, replying to emails, procrastinating, and realizing you have missed dinner hours.
4. 8:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.: Editing
While most people are not aware of it, Sever does have a basement, and it contains several editing rooms. There’s no windows and little light, so it is fairly depressing. You stay up late choosing the shots from the day that you are satisfied with and sync the sound for these clips. It seems to be a simple task, but when you get out, it’s already 2 a.m. You are very sleepy and have to walk all the way from the Yard to your room, but still you feel a bit of pride because your whole day’s work has led to one short but really great shot.
Moral of the story: Film students have a hard life. Support them; talk to them; show your care for them. If you feel like donating money to improve their lives, please contact the writer of this article directly.

The internet is no stranger to the concept of face-swapping: A quick Google search reveals several years worth of adults with babies’ faces, men with women’s faces, and—well, some swaps that defy description. The mildly unsettling meme has recently achieved a whole new level of prominence, however, via a new SnapChat filter. The filter identifies and then swaps two faces, meaning that anyone with a phone and a friend can create a face swap within a minute or so.
Unsurprisingly, the filter has turned out to be incredibly addictive and popular. What exactly makes face swaps so fascinating, though? (Bustle, Popsugar, Buzzfeed, and Teen Vogue did not all release articles on, say, the introduction of the puppy filter.) To begin with, the swaps can be compellingly horrifying. People face-swapping with dolls can take you on a creepy trip to the uncanny valley, while the filter’s occasional malfunctions can produce borderline demonic images: If the camera interprets a non-face section of screen as a face, you might end up with a disembodied pair of teeth floating around the ceiling or a blurry Frankenstein mess. There’s something sadistically satisfying about turning your own face into something that looks like it might be from the depths of hell.
The filter also allows its users to play with gender in interesting ways. Putting a made-up, delicately structured face on a muscular, bulky torso makes for a hilarious contrast; on a deeper level, however, the filter allows for a kind of effort-free cross-dressing. When a man and woman face-swap with one another, they each get to satisfy their curiosity as to what they might look like as a member of the opposite gender.
And the point of this curiosity has to do with self-definition. When you change your features entirely or take them out of context and impose them on someone else, you learn something about your own identity—what you are, what you are not. Maybe you only realize that you have exceptionally large and fluttery eyes when you realize how stunning they look on another woman. Maybe you never realized how comfortable you feel with male features when they’re imposed on you directly. Or, of course, maybe you suddenly see your true midterm-week self perfectly expressed in a blur of mouths and nightmares.

In 1984, the Irish Republican Army planted a long-delay time bomb in the Grand Hotel in Brighton, England in an attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Jonathan Lee tells the story of the weeks leading up to the bombing from the perspective of three fictional characters: Dan, Freya, and Moose. Dan is an Irish youth trying to make himself useful as he weathers the frustrating British presence in Ireland, while Freya and her father Moose work in the Grand Hotel and lead typical middle-class lives. “High Dive” uses these ordinary voices to poignantly illustrate the development of an uncommon event with historical consequences—the ultimate tragedy of the novel lying not in the political aftermath of the disaster but in the mundane lives that the episode destroys.
The novel opens with Dan’s initiation into the Irish Republican Army (IRA) six years prior to the bombing, making it clear from the start that in his life, survival is not taken for granted, and violence and death are not uncommon. Dan lives with his elderly mother, whom he does not let answer the home phone under the pretense that he needs the line for his work as an independent electrician, when in truth he is sparing her the knowledge of the threats they are receiving. The British occupation of Ireland leads Dan to lament, “What do you do when the people making the rules aren’t interested in fairness? When they choose who to protect based on religion, race, history?” Lee describes vivid events from Dan’s life leading up to his involvement in the bombing of the Grand Hotel, showing the anger and pain of the oppressed Irish and the violence suffered on both sides of the conflict.
In stark contrast to Dan’s world, Freya Finch lives by the beach and is spending the summer after her high school graduation working as a receptionist at the Grand Hotel, trying to figure out her future plans. As Lee masterfully transports the reader from the intense scene in Ireland to the sunny shores of Brighton, we see that Freya’s father, Moose, is the deputy manager of the Grand, working hard in preparation for Margaret Thatcher’s arrival in hopes of receiving a promotion so that he can provide for a better life for Freya. While Dan deceives his mother about the phone threats, Freya deceives her father about a boyfriend. The father and daughter lead lives more stable than Dan’s but are by no means wealthy, and the joys and troubles of all three characters prove to be relatable and endearing.
Lee writes with a touching understanding of youth. Although living in radically different situations, Freya and Dan nevertheless share many similarities. Both are uncertain about their futures and what their purpose in society might be. Furthermore, neither she nor Dan has  particularly strong political convictions. Both youths are tentatively searching for their identities and building their personal opinions on bigger issues. Dan is forced to take a stand, immersing himself in the IRA because “[v]olunteering offered him a purpose. He nurtured it. He was reluctant to see the bulk and heft of his own opinions whittled down into something more subtle. He’d seen, among many other volunteers, that subtlety tended to sit side by side with doubt.” Freya, however, has more room for doubt, and she finds that she “hated this feeling, the sensation of trying and failing to get her arms around something big. The way political opinions seemed always to be expressed with a total sureness of tone. The way that sureness was at odds with every true thought she’d ever had.” Through her well-rounded portrayal of Dan and Freya, Lee takes care to offer a sympathetic representation of both sides of the terrorist act: Both Freya and Dan are ignorant in a way that is not a product of hate, but of the innocence—and even idealism—of youth.
Although the event that the novel is based on may seem complicated and dark, Lee describes it in a voice that is mostly light-hearted, engaging, and witty. The everyday happenings in the Grand Hotel are comedic. Moose recalls “the man six weeks ago who’d offered to pay extra for yellow bed sheets” and “The American steel magnate’s wife who’d wondered if Moose could ‘reduce the ocean noise.’” Freya Finch ponders at one point if, “in some distant language, her surname meant vomit or saucepan.” Lee’s writing is creative and filled with clever, surprising humor.
But the more beautiful and humorous the world Lee builds, the more painful the ending becomes, as that world eventually becomes ruined. Lee develops this tragedy by devoting a greater portion of the novel to Freya and Moose and their ordinary existences than to Dan: Their lives, though insignificant in the course of history, are filled with potential and dreams of the future. Lee builds their bantering family dynamic, making them lovable and real to the reader. As Marina, another member of the hotel staff points out, “[S]ometimes the before is more interesting than the after, no? Heading towards the impact. What is beautiful about a dive? It isn’t the splash, is it?” Perhaps the most moving line in the novel is delivered at the very end, as Moose surveys the aftermath of the bombing and helplessly realizes, “Someone had considered this fair.”
In a moment of meta-observation, Dan notes, “You choose the parts of the story to tell. It’s the only way you can make it yours.” The author’s voice seems to bleed through in this statement. Lee is clearly aware of the bias inherently present in accounts of historical events. “High Dive” tells the story of a political act of terrorism from the eyes of closely involved but unimportant people. Their worries are not grand or politically momentous but instead mostly revolve around the lives of their loved ones. Despite such modest intentions, they come to be part of a much larger effect—swept up inevitably in the greater plot of history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 26, 2016, at 12:00 p.m.
WORCESTER, Mass. — New year, same story.
Jimmy Vesey, Kyle Criscuolo, and the seniors of the Harvard men’s hockey team have written quite the novel over the course of their Crimson tenures. After all, Harvard’s eldest class not only doubled its freshman-sophomore year win total over the last two seasons; it spearheaded the resurgence of a struggling program in the process.
But now that the ending is in the books, it appears as though the authors may have left a bit to be desired. 
For the second year in a row, the Crimson’s NCAA tournament run came to an abrupt halt by way of a 4-1 defeat in the opening round—this time at the hands of local foe Boston College.
“I think we thought we were going to have a better ending this year,” Criscuolo said.
Instead, the ending mirrored last year’s tournament exit against Nebraska-Omaha. The No. 10/9 Crimson (19-11-4, 12-6-4 ECAC) dug itself a first-period hole at the DCU Center, giving up one goal amid a crowded crease and another late in the period on a power play.
Sophomore Alex Tuch opened the scoring 7:59 into the period, but not before he went crashing into Harvard netminder Merrick Madsen, knocking the goaltender partway into his goal. But with Crimson defenseman Desmond Bergin jawing with Tuch down low, the right winger received the benefit of the doubt from the officials, and poked home a loose puck to put his side in front. 
Freshman Miles Wood set up the Eagles’ second goal on their only power play of the night, stemming from a hooking call against freshman Lewis Zerter-Gossage. After Bergin cut out a Wood pass on a 2-on-1, the rookie regained possession, circled all the way around the net to the top of the slot, and threw a shot towards goal that junior Austin Cangelosi tipped home at 18:58.
“He’s like a horse out there,” Cangelosi said about Wood. “You get him the puck, and he starts skating really fast, and he uses his big body, and there he took one of his hard shots to the net.”
Harvard had yet to win a game all year when trailing after the first period. Pair that with the fact that the Eagles had won 11 of their last 12 meetings with the Crimson, and BC getting the first goal of the second period made the end result feel like a foregone conclusion.
While Tuch had to grind for his first goal, he produced a beauty for his second. Blowing past senior defenseman Brayden Jaw along the left wing, Tuch took an end-to-end feed from junior Scott Savage and picked the top right corner against Madsen at 1:59 in the second to put No. 6/5 BC (27-7-5, 15-2-5 Hockey East) up, 3-0.
Harvard jumped on the comeback trail midway through the second, as freshman Jake Horton fed Seb Lloyd low in the slot, and the sophomore lifted a shot past the glove of BC goaltender Thatcher Demko to pull the Crimson within two.
The goal got Harvard into a bit of a rhythm, and Vesey—despite logging only one shot on goal through the first two periods—nearly pulled the Crimson within one, missing just wide of the left post moments later.
“I thought he was pretty dominant tonight when he had the puck,” BC coach Jerry York said. “He was a dominant player. We held our own at best with him. Clearly, when he has the puck, he’s really dangerous, and Thatcher [Demko] made some good saves off of him. But he’s an outstanding, outstanding player.”
“They might have kept me to one shot [through the first two periods], but I had a couple more attempts,” Vesey said. “They were hard on me and my line all night. We went against [Ian] McCoshen every shift, but they had a good game and blocked a lot of shots.” 
Behind the efforts of McCoshen, freshman Casey Fitzgerald, and Demko, the latter of whom stopped 32 of the 33 shots he saw on the night, the Eagles held the Crimson scoreless the rest of the way.
That includes on a Harvard 6-on-4 with 4:18 remaining. After Ryan Fitzgerald, BC’s leading scorer, went off for hooking with his team up two, Donato elected to pull Madsen to get six forwards on the ice. But the Crimson failed to solve Demko in the final minutes, and Cangelosi buried an empty-netter with 2:27 remaining to send the Eagles soaring into the Northeast Regional championship game.
“When it’s all said and done, some great players made some great plays for them,” Donato said. “We had an answer and tried to create some chances of our own…. [But] to get it back to one at the end of the first or even early in the second would’ve been a big emotional hurdle for us at the time.”
Freshman Ryan Donato and Criscuolo each nearly cleared that hurdle in the first period, but both came up inches short in their attempts to cut into the BC lead. With the Eagles up, 1-0, Donato dangled his way to the goalmouth but his backhander by Demko’s left post would not go. Then after the deficit grew to two, Criscuolo hit a post by the cage in the final minute of the frame.
Harvard outshot the Eagles, 33-25, for the game—a bit of an 180 from the teams’ last meeting on Feb. 1 where BC won that battle, 33-23, in the opening round of the Beanpot. But despite being outshot, the Eagles made better use of their chances, and as a result, they’re within one game of winning their sixth consecutive regional played in Worcester.
As expected, the Crimson was without 6’7” blue-liner Wiley Sherman, who missed Harvard’s final three postseason games with an upper body injury suffered against RPI in the ECAC quarterfinals. Sherman was seen after the game wearing a cast on his left arm.
Top-pair defenseman Desmond Bergin was also a gametime decision after being limited this week in practice while battling an illness.
“We weren’t able to get him on the ice over the last few days, so he was a question mark,” Ted Donato said. “We even dressed an extra guy for warm-ups.” 
Bergin did get the start on Friday, but the Crimson’s banged up blue line ultimately met its match. While sophomore Thomas Aiken and freshmen Adam Baughman and Viktor Dombrovskiy held their own for the most part, defensive mainstays Clay Anderson and Jaw were burned on the Eagles’ second and third goals, respectively.
The loss brings the collegiate careers of Vesey, Criscuolo, and the Crimson’s other five seniors to a close, marking the end of an era in Cambridge.
“Any time you play, you want to leave the jersey in a better place, and we made a great effort to do that,” said Vesey, sitting to the right of Criscuolo in the postgame press conference as the two struggled to hold back tears.
“Harvard hockey isn’t going anywhere,” he added. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see a national championship anytime soon.”
Boston College will play Minnesota Duluth in the regional title game here Saturday night at 9 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, Mass. — Less than five miles separate the No. 10/9 Harvard men’s hockey team’s home at the Bright-Landry Center from its crosstown rival’s rink in Chestnut Hill. But in the biggest game of the season, the distance between the two teams seemed much larger.
After two first-period goals from No. 6/5 Boston College—including one in the waning minutes of the frame—the Crimson was unable to stage a comeback to retake control of the game. Despite a mid-second-period goal from sophomore Seb Lloyd, the Eagles held on by a score of 4-1 to knock the Crimson out of the NCAA tournament and officially end Harvard’s season.
“They’re a very well-coached team with some great players,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91 said. “They made the plays they needed to to win the game.”
The loss marks the second straight year in which the Crimson (19-11-4, 12-6-4 ECAC) has bowed out in the first round of the NCAA tournament. In both contests, Harvard found itself down 2-0 after the first 20 minutes had elapsed, and down 4-1 when the final buzzer sounded.
A TALE OF TWO SCRUMS
With the game scoreless just under eight minutes into the contest, a loose puck and subsequent scrum in front of the net would open the scoring for the Eagles (27-7-5, 15-2-5 Hockey East) and dictate that the Crimson would have to come from behind to extend its season. 
With sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen slipping into the back of his net, sophomore Alex Tuch was able to poke the puck across the goal line to get BC on the scoreboard. The referees would go under the hood twice before officially putting Tuch’s goal on the scoresheet.
“The good thing about the NCAA is that all plays [like that] go to review,” Donato said. “It wasn’t like they didn’t get a chance to look at it.... It’s our job to respond.”
Later that period, with the score still 1-0, a loose puck floated in front of BC’s junior goaltender, Thatcher Demko. But Crimson players charging towards the net were unable to nudge the puck in before Demko managed to get on top of it and freeze it. The equalizing goal would go unrealized, a missed opportunity made more costly after Boston College got on the man advantage shortly thereafter and extended its lead with 1:02 left in the first period.
A TOUGH TIME WITH TOUGH TEAMS
Entering the contest, Harvard was 0-6-1 against teams that as of Friday were above the Crimson in the PairWise rankings. Harvard couldn’t erase the goose-egg from the first column in its tilt with the Eagles, who, as of Saturday morning, rank eight spots ahead of the Crimson.
In four of the team’s previous six losses against higher-ranked opponents, the squad only was bested by a single goal. In one of these games—its January matchup with No. 12/11 Boston University, currently eighth in the PairWise—Harvard even had a two-goal lead with five minutes remaining, only to see its lead turn into a one-goal deficit when the clock hit triple zeros. 
In this particular game, the puzzle Harvard couldn’t solve was Demko. The Hobey Baker finalist stopped all but one of the 33 shots he faced on the night, improving upon his .936 save percentage.
“He’s elevated the team a lot this year,” Boston College coach Jerry York said. “When you get to NCAAs, you’re expecting him to play well. He’s become a real leader for us, and I thought he made some outstanding saves tonight.”
While the Crimson only lost four of the 26 games it played against weaker opponents per the PairWise, its inability to rise to the occasion in games against tougher opponents was the undoing of the Crimson not only in the NCAA tournament, but in the Beanpot and the ECAC tournament.
THE UNDOING OF THE DEFENSE
After the Harvard defense helped propel the squad to the title game in the ECAC Tournament, the unit struggled in slowing down the Eagles’ attack on Friday night, allowing several odd-man rushes on the night. While the Crimson actually outshot BC, the Eagles generated more scoring chances, many of which Madsen stopped to prevent the game from getting out of hand quickly. 
Part of the reason for the letdown was that the blue line entered the game banged up. Senior Desmond Bergin did not skate in the days leading up to the game, while sophomore Wiley Sherman did not dress for the Crimson due to an upper body injury. Freshman Viktor Dombrovskiy, fellow classmate Adam Baughman, and sophomore Thomas Aiken—a trio that made up half of the team’s defensive lineup—only had 30 games under their belts before Friday’s contest.
“[Boston College] scored the power play goal when we had a few opportunities earlier in the power play to clear it,” Donato said. “When it’s all said and done, some great players made some great plays for them.”
