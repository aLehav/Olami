After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We, the undersigned faculty, write to protest the University’s decisions to overturn Michelle Jones’s admission to the Ph.D. program in History and to rescind a fellowship offer to Chelsea Manning at the Kennedy School. With both decisions, Harvard has prioritized political expediency over scholarly values. Rather than stand on principle and procedure, Harvard has undermined the pursuit of its core academic mission by acting out of fear of negative publicity.
From what we have been able to glean from the public record, the decisions in these cases have been made not by following standardized procedure, but by reacting in an ad hoc manner to a climate of anxiety and intimidation. With Michelle Jones, the administration took the highly unusual step of overturning the History Department’s decision to admit Jones to its doctoral program. In doing so, it not only violated departmental autonomy in evaluating and admitting students, it disregarded the labor and expertise of its faculty. Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators appear to have arrived at this decision not because they questioned the Department’s judgment of Jones’s scholarly merits, but out of concern over a potential backlash for admitting a formerly incarcerated student to the University. This comes at a time when mass incarceration and criminal justice reform are of utmost scholarly importance in a number of academic disciplines, including history.
In the case of Chelsea Manning, there was more overt intimidation by the federal government. Central Intelligence Agency director Mike Pompeo cancelled an appearance at Harvard and former deputy director Mike Morell resigned his own visiting fellowship, both in protest at what the two men described as the honoring of a “traitor.” The same day, Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf rescinded Manning’s offer while retaining former Trump administration press secretary Sean Spicer, notorious for his mendacity and attacks on the press, and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, captured on film assaulting a female reporter, as visiting fellows.
Each of these cases posed the question of how to address the lasting stigma following Jones and Manning due to their convictions on charges of murder and espionage, respectively. In each case, the administration appears to have allowed the fear of public opinion and political interference to determine its actions. But we are educators committed to the open, critical exchange of ideas. Rather than allowing these women to come to campus and speak for themselves, the administration accepted as true the account of events provided by the prosecuting attorneys and acted at their behest.
Universities should set an example to follow. Instead of bowing to pressure, they should have the courage to take principled stances, especially when it is politically impractical to do so. This is particularly the case for institutions like Harvard that have the standing and resources to withstand public and political backlash.
Ironically, the administration’s choice to play it safe has only augmented the public outcry. Nathan J. Heller ’06, a former Crimson editor, argued in the New Yorker that, in rejecting Jones and Manning, Harvard has shown itself to be more in the “image business” than the “ideas business.” James Forman, a Yale law professor, went further, arguing that Harvard’s stance on Jones aligns it with a societal mainstream that pays mere lip service to rehabilitation. “Mass incarceration and its never-ending human toll will be with us,” Forman wrote in the New York Times, until we choose a just society over “permanent civic death.” “N.Y.U.’s acceptance of Michelle Jones is an example of an institution leading the way toward a more forgiving nation,” he continued, while “Harvard’s rejection of her shows just how far we still have to go.”
These sentiments are echoed within the University. A group of History Ph.D. students who would have been Jones’s peers condemned, in The New York Times, the University’s “hypocrisy and cowardice” in “reinforc[ing] the institutional barriers and social stigmas that sustain mass incarceration in the United States and that disproportionately affect communities of color.” Such reactions speak to how starkly these decisions contradict Harvard’s own expressed support for socially vulnerable populations, be they minorities, Dreamers, the poor, or the formerly incarcerated.
These are contentious and fearful times. At times such as these, our institution must adhere to its research and teaching mission and stand by its own stated values of intellectual excellence, equal opportunity, open debate, and non-discrimination. Accordingly, we ask that the administration immediately do the following:
First, cooperate with the faculties of the various divisions to add “criminal history” to the University’s existing non-discrimination policies, including those governing financial aid.
Second, support Harvard faculty interested in prison education.  This could involve giving faculty teaching credit for participating in programs such as the one that Emerson College conducts at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Concord, or supporting faculty in an initiative to offer for-credit courses in nearby prisons.
Finally, invite Chelsea Manning to a public forum to discuss her work and advocacy for LGBTQ rights.
These steps will go some distance towards ensuring that, in the future, our University does not allow a misguided and moralistic notion of indelible stigma—or a fear of media controversy—to divert us from our core values.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The most terrifying aspect of Donald Trump’s persona is his unpredictability. Those who support him are attracted to and impressed by it, while his opponents fear the consequences of his volatile words and actions. During his campaign, off-the-wall speeches and offensive policy proposals were the height of his capriciousness. As President, his words and actions yield actual consequences.
To non-Trump supporters, his volatility was always frightening. His voters, by contrast, felt relieved to hear from a candidate who was so frank and forward. An article headlined “Why So Many Americans Hate Politics” in the Washington Post explains that the population’s widespread disdain for our governing bodies stems from feeling deceived or “shut out” from politics. Canned speeches and interactions with the public serve no purpose other than to deceptively and condescendingly campaign, benefitting no one but the politician in question.
Trump’s appeal to mild-mannered Midwesterners doesn’t make sense at first. Voters in the region value honesty and humility, and Trump sports neither of these characteristics. He frequently boasts about past business deals and exaggerates personal accomplishments. His campaign rallies emboldened raucous and rowdy behavior. He encouraged violence towards non-supporters, absorbed praise from the crowd, and spoke in a near-constant shout. His brash persona should offend the sensibilities of most people, especially those in the excessively polite Midwest.
Nevertheless, these supporters willingly eschewed their values for the sake of a candidate, and now a President, who ostensibly offers a contrast to the poise most politicians possess—his sentences fail to finish, his thoughts jumble, and his speeches frequently contain mistruths. Trump’s vocabulary is less expansive than that of recent presidents and notable candidates, and his grammar bests only George W. Bush’s. Yet, the simplicity of his speech also makes him comprehensible and trustworthy. His casual language and unfiltered statements subconsciously assure voters that they’re hearing the whole and honest truth. Under the perception that politicians’ words must be false when calculated and eloquent, Trump supporters take solace in their champion’s crude language.
But as they delight in the discomfort Trump’s words impart on others, they fail to realize that aligning themselves with Trump doesn’t ensure his reciprocation. A now-notorious cartoon out of The New Yorker captures this phenomenon perfectly, as a flock of sheep admire a billboard featuring a threatening, Trumpian wolf dressed as a politician. One remarks admiringly that he “tells it like it is.”
Trump also builds credibility with his supporters by confidently throwing around phrases such as “many people have said this” or “everyone knows that,” which instantly incite both insecurity in his listeners and trust in him. Why didn’t I know this? How does he? And most importantly, why hadn’t anyone told me this before?
Nevertheless, Trump’s rhetoric works so well partially because of the prejudices present in the region. His status as an older white man automatically grants him more leeway in his behavior than women or people of color—such as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, whose choice to wear a tan suit in 2014 drew harsher criticism from Republicans than Trump’s lewd language ever has.
Additionally, part of Trump’s success in the Midwest stems from sheer flattery. Even in the states without economic turmoil or the loss of manufacturing jobs, Trump promised an uprising. Removed from the glamour of the east and west coasts, Trump’s campaign allowed rural populations to convince themselves of hardship they had never experienced, and that in the past eight years this hardship had particularly worsened. Things had been bad, or, to use Trump’s vernacular, “very, very bad,” but he would make it better.
Despite the massive failures and embarrassments embodying the first nine months of the Trump presidency, much of his 2016 constituency remains unmoved. They are still as unconvinced by facts as they were during the election, instead finding it easier to trust one man’s words than the warnings of political pundits, the media, scientists, academics, past presidents, and the majority of the country. These people will likely remain in the dark until Trump’s reckless governance touches them personally. Many of his supporters may be lucky enough to avoid this unnerving prospect, but others, particularly in poor, rural areas of the Midwest, may fall victim to the man they elected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the New York Times and the Marshall Project reported that Harvard University rescinded Michelle Jones’s acceptance into a History Ph.D. program. Jones was released from prison last August, where she served 20 years for the murder of her four-year old son. While incarcerated, Jones attained a bachelor’s degree, became a certified paralegal, audited graduate-level courses, and published and presented via videoconference her own scholarly research on American history.
We condemn the decision to rescind Jones’s acceptance. Though Michelle Jones perpetrated a lurid and reprehensible crime, she has served her time, reclaimed her life, and should have been helped along her impressive trajectory by Harvard. Reforming people is a key goal of the United States prison system, and Jones is clearly a  strong example of successful rehabilitation.
Moreover, the decision calls into question Harvard’s core educational and institutional values. Harvard purports to be accessible to all students and scholars regardless of their background—as reflected in the College’s need-based financial aid program and its increased recruitment of minority students, among other initiatives. If Harvard is truly searching for the brightest minds, a criminal record should not preclude enrollment at the University, whatever the potential media backlash.
Jones’s scholarship and dedication to research should be valued more than her past, which she atoned for while in prison. As Professor Alison Frank Johnson, the director of graduate studies for the History department, stated, “Michelle was sentenced in a courtroom to serve X years, but we [Harvard] decided—unilaterally—that it should be X years plus no Harvard.” Harvard is not a member of the judiciary branch, and thus it is not Harvard’s place to determine whether Jones has rightfully expiated her past. Harvard should seek to be a bastion of redemptive justice, rather than overstep its boundaries as an academic institution by making paternalistic decisions.
We are also concerned about the role that Harvard’s culture of elitism may have played in this decision. According to Professor John Stauffer, an American Studies professor who flagged Jones’s acceptance, one of the considerations in the decision to rescind her acceptance was whether she could adjust well to Harvard. Stauffer said, “if this candidate [Jones] is admitted to Harvard, where everyone is an elite among elites, that adjustment could be too much.”
We vehemently reject the notion that Harvard should strive to be a bastion of elitism, especially considering that this elitism is rooted in a history of classism, sexism, and white supremacy in which people from low-income backgrounds, women, and people of color were deemed unfit for a Harvard education. It is not lost upon us that Jones is a black woman who spent part of her adolescence in group homes and foster care, thus lacking the privileges that some assume the stereotypical Harvard elite should have. Rather, Harvard should encourage scholarship from people of all backgrounds, including those who don’t fit into a particular archetype of what an academic should be. There is no ‘correct’ background for intellect.
As an institution of higher education, Harvard’s top priority should be the promotion of scholarship and the education of its students. There is no doubt that Harvard does have a reputation to maintain. But, it has built this reputation by educating and producing groundbreaking scholars and world leaders, not by stifling potential academic growth in order to save face. A student’s acceptance should not be contingent on the potential backlash. Rather, it should be based on the student’s merit alone. It is ludicrous and cowardly for Harvard to diminish Jones’ academic accomplishments in an attempt to avoid negative attention.
Ultimately, Harvard’s loss is N.Y.U.’s gain. We look forward to the scholarship Jones will continue to produce—N.Y.U. is lucky to have her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 19, 2017 at 11:40 p.m.
Harvard Management Company returned 8.1 percent on its investments in fiscal year 2017, a “disappointing” performance the firm’s freshman CEO called “a symptom of deep structural problems at HMC.”
The returns—which brought the value of the endowment to $37.1 billion—are the worst of almost 20 institutional investors who have released their figures for fiscal year 2017. The figures released Tuesday are the first under HMC’s CEO N.P. Narvekar, whom Harvard hired last year in an attempt to rehabilitate the University’s beleaguered investment arm. HMC has struggled in recent years, losing almost 2 billion in endowment value and continually pulling in behind its peer investors.
In a letter announcing the returns, Narvekar—who previously oversaw Columbia’s investments — did not mince words about this year's comparatively lackluster returns, promising to “reposition” the firm over the coming years.
“Our performance is disappointing and not where it needs to be,” he wrote. “The endowment’s returns are a symptom of deep structural problems at HMC and the resultant significant issues in the portfolio.”
“It is an unfortunate truth that the issues that have impacted HMC and its performance in the past will continue to negatively impact returns in the near term and will require time to overcome,” he added.  
Harvard’s endowment—the largest university endowment in the world—is used to fund a number of operating costs and ensure that Harvard has funding for the foreseeable future. About a third of the University’s annual operating budget is drawn from the endowment, though its schools are dependent to different degrees—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, for example, received about half its funding from the endowment last year.
The returns for fiscal year 2017, though a marked increase on the negative 2 percent Harvard returned the year prior, continue to lag behind those of its peers. In addition to Dartmouth, MIT and the University of California system reported 14.3 percent and 15.1 percent, respectively. Grinnell College, a small private school in Iowa, netted 18.8 percent on its investments for the year.
Narvekar, the Management Company’s fourth CEO in a decade, has sought to make sweeping changes at HMC to improve the endowment’s performance since his appointment in December. After a quiet review process during his first month at the helm of the firm, he made a striking announcement: by the end of the calendar year, he would lay off more than 100 the firm’s employees and shift to a more “generalist” investment model.
HMC had long retained an unusually large internal staff of around 230 people. It invested its money through a mix of internal and external managers in a “hybrid model” that came under increasing scrutiny as the firm failed to keep pace with the performances at Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and the other peer schools.
HMC’s trailing performance has worried University President Drew G. Faust, who last year warned the low returns would “constrain” budgets across the University for years to come. That rang true last year when the Graduate of Arts and Sciences, citing HMC’s low returns, cut the number of graduate students it accepts by 4.4 percent. Then, graduate students and professors learned they would receive smaller pay increases that were outpaced by the rate of inflation. Harvard also faces a number of financial challenges amid potential decreases in federal research funding.
Still, Paul J. Finnegan ’75, the chair of HMC’s Board of Directors and the University’s treasurer, praised Narvekar’s leadership, writing that he is “making excellent progress in reorganizing HMC to ultimately improve investment performance.”
“The HMC Board of Directors is fully supportive of these efforts and the time required to reposition HMC so that it can perform up to our collective expectations,” Finnegan wrote. “We are confident Narv has the right strategy that will deliver in the years ahead.”
In some ways, the underwhelming performance was part of Narvekar’s longer-term plan, a financial bloodletting that he’s betting will improve the firm.
In the past year, HMC has sought to offload some of its natural resources assets, which returned negative 10.2 percent in fiscal year 2016.  Over the summer, the Wall Street Journal reported that the firm had sold some of its natural resources assets at a marked-down price in an effort to rid Harvard’s portfolio of the struggling investments .
Those markdowns impacted the performance of the endowment for fiscal year 2017, Narvekar said.
“The HMC Board of Directors took some markdowns on value prior to my arrival, and we have taken more markdowns in fiscal year 2017, which meaningfully impacted our results,” Narvekar wrote. “At this stage, however, while most assets remain attractive, a few have significant challenges.”
He added, though, that “markdowns do not imply sales,” and that also HMC sold certain assets above their valuations during the fiscal year. Additionally, if the University decides an asset may be profitable in the future, it will hold onto those assets.
Charles A. Skorina, a financial headhunter, said Narvekar was smart to dump natural resources assets that were no longer viable as soon as possible—even if he had to do so at a lower price.
“There’s no good time to take a loss, but there are less bad times than others,” Skorina said. “If you’re going to release bad news, do it early in your tenure. And if you’ve got other things in the portfolio like public equities that’ve done well, then it looks less bad than it would’ve a year down the road.”
The natural resources team at HMC is one of the few that will remain in-house, and, according to Narvekar, is outfitted with new team members who will “reposition” the portfolio over the course of the next few years.
Narvekar took his position at Harvard with the hope of implementing a number of changes and restoring Harvard’s perch atop the world of educational investors. And while the changes may take years before they fully set-in, Narvekar has moved quickly, detailing in his letter Tuesday the progress of his plans.
He announced in January that he would slash the firm’s internal staff nearly in half, laying off about 100 people by the end of the calendar year. HMC would also outsource the majority of its assets to external managers by the end of the fiscal year.
As of June 30, many of those changes have already been implemented, Narvekar wrote in his letter Tuesday.
“In a perfect world, we would have moved through these changes over a much longer period,” he wrote. “However, given the time needed for these changes to impact results, the HMC Board of Directors and I strongly believe that HMC will be in a far better position by moving quickly. We have done so.”
HMC’s relative value and equity teams have been shut down completely and outsourced. The credit team, though currently operating in-house, is expected to spin-off from the firm in the nearby future, as is the highly-successful real estate team. Consistent with his announcement in January, Narvekar wrote that HMC “is working to execute a mutually beneficial agreement” with the teams that will spin off from the firm.
Narvekar wrote in his letter that leadership turnover at HMC has complicated the turn to external managers and depressed the firm’s returns over the past few years.
“When I departed Columbia, ten of our team members had worked together for eight years or more, with most of us in excess of ten years,” he wrote. “By contrast, HMC has experienced several leaderships changes during a relatively short period of time. I believe the strong long-term performance of several endowments with consistent senior teams is not a coincidence.”
He also took aim at the firm’s internal culture, which has been described by employees at the firm as “lazy,” “fat,” and “stupid” in a review conducted by the consulting firm McKinsey and Company.
“Besides the obvious need to strive for excellence and to conduct ourselves with integrity, we seek to build an organization that is highly collaborative and less hierarchical than previously structured,” Narvekar wrote.
Narvekar wrote that the firm will continue to move towards a “generalist” investment model, where portfolio managers collaborate to work for the health of the overall endowment. To encourage this, the firm has revised its compensation framework to tie the interests of its managers to the interests of the entire firm. For fiscal year 2018, compensation will be tied directly to the performance of the entire endowment.
HMC will also work to identify an appropriate level of risk for the University—a process Narvekar wrote may take years. He again warned that comparing Harvard’s investment strategy to other universities’ is “not productive,” and argued the practice “contributed meaningfully to the challenges experienced by leading endowments during the financial crisis.”
Despite the years of difficulties, Narvekar is optimistic about the future of the firm.
“As a fourteen-year leader of a highly successful endowment, it is my firm conviction that a talented and skilled team supported and guided by the right organizational and investment culture, and properly incentivized, will overcome legacy issues and produce strong long-term results,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard graduate student who obtained a restraining order against his dissertation adviser has been expelled for violating his academic probation—though a lower court initially ordered Harvard to reinstate him.
The conflict between the two began in June 2016, when Gustavo German—then a graduate student in stem cell and regenerative biology—was detained in the middle of the night for an unwanted mental evaluation by request of his adviser, stem cell researcher Lee L. Rubin. Rubin said he was concerned for German, who had stopped showing up to the lab. German, though, alleged that the forced mental exam was an act of revenge—retaliation for raising concerns about research misconduct in Rubin’s lab.
Two months later, a court handed down two orders requiring Rubin to stay at least 100 feet away from German while also providing German adequate access to the Rubin lab. The restraining order, which Harvard quickly challenged, effectively barred Rubin from his own research facility.
According to court documents, German was expected to continue work on his dissertation, though under a different adviser, during the spring 2017 semester. But German took issue with his interim dissertation adviser as well, accusing her in a December 2016 email of “harassing conduct” and informing her that he would not continue to work with her. German could not be reached for comment.
Throughout the semester, according to court filings, German refused to attend multiple meetings with his dissertation advisory committee, instead asserting that the Massachusetts Superior Court now had control over his academic progress. Harvard subsequently placed German on academic probation, and on May 16, expelled him.
Following German’s expulsion, Harvard again intervened on behalf of Rubin in court, asking that the court rescind German’s access to University laboratory facilities. But on July 7, the court denied Harvard’s request—and ruled that the University must fully reinstate German as a graduate student.
The court further ordered that Rubin continue to serve as German’s adviser until another acceptable adviser was chosen, that German be invited to “periodic general lab meetings,” and that Harvard vacate the terms of German’s academic probation.
Harvard appealed that decision, and filed a motion to stay the court’s order.
In an order issued in late July, the appeals court sided with Harvard, granting a stay—effectively halting the enforcement of the previous court’s order—and questioning the legality of the lower court’s ruling that German be reinstated.
“By ordering that Harvard reinstate the plaintiff as a graduate student and asserting control over the terms of his academic progress, the judge intruded into the sensitive and complicated area of student-university relations,” Sookyoung Shin, an appeals court justice, wrote. “Harvard was entitled to sanction him accordingly.”
German has appealed Shin’s order, and court proceedings will likely continue through the fall semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University of Washington-Seattle Professor Saadia M. Pekkanen addressed the recent militarization of Japan’s space program and its implications for the United States and East Asia at event at the Weatherhead Center on Tuesday.
The event, which was co-sponsored by the Weatherhead Center’s National Security Program and Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, was the second event held on U.S.-Japan relations this semester. Pekkanen urged audience members to consider the current state of Japan’s space capabilities, the tendency of national security experts to overlook Japan, and the historical trends leading to Japan’s military expansion.
She emphasized that although Japan’s space budget is estimated to be about 5 percent of the United States’, its technology to explore space is very advanced.
“Japan has come a very, very long way since 1955. Japan, like a lot of the U.S.’s allies, could have relied on the U.S. for access to space. It chose not to do that,” Pekkanen said. “I would put Japan squarely among the world’s top five space powers.”
She also cited Japan’s use of artificial intelligence in rockets as an example of its sophistication in the national security arena.
Pekkanen addressed reasons as to why some national security experts have failed to recognize the strength of Japan’s space program, including a longtime Japanese policy of only using space technology for “peaceful purposes.”
“There’s been a lack of consensus about Japan’s military capabilities and many claims about Japan’s culture of antimilitarism,” she said.
According to Pekkanen, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has overseen the convergence of space research and military technology in both the public and private sectors. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Japan’s equivalent of NASA,  recently moved under Abe’s direct purview.
Shannon M. Kearney, a senior at Wellesley College studying Japan’s space program, said she thought Pekkanen addressed the space race in Asia from a unique angle.
“She had a lot of energy. I’ve never really thought a lot about Japan’s space program from a military perspective,” Kearney said.
Yuki Yasuda, who works for the Japanese Ministry of Defense, said that he was interested in Pekkanen’s discussion of Japan’s response to recent North Korean missile launches.
“I found the talk interesting... especially as Japan changes from an anti-militarized policy to a more aggressive or positive approach. There’s been a change of tide,” Yasuda said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than a year of renovations to the Smith Campus Center, a mixture of closed roads, pervasive dust, and the constant din of construction has posed challenges to neighboring businesses—even prompting a recently-closed locale to sue Harvard.
The renovations, which began in early 2016 and are scheduled to finish in 2018, have caused road closures and disruptions on both neighboring streets, Dunster and Holyoke. In addition to the businesses forced to move or close at the start of the project to allow for the renovations—including Al’s Harvard Square Cafe, Clover Food Lab, and b.good—remaining business have faced their own hurdles.
Several business owners in the area complain that the project has discouraged customers from visiting their stores.
En Boca, a Mediterranean-inspired tapas restaurant on Holyoke St., closed its doors on June 3, just eight months after opening due to the construction. In late August, Classic Restaurant Concepts, the corporation behind En Boca, filed a lawsuit against Harvard for “breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, nuisance” and other violations related to the renovation process.
A sign posted on the restaurant’s door since its closure blames construction for the sudden close.
“Unfortunately, despite the glowing reviews, press accolades and customers who made us their new favorite restaurant, we were plagued by the ongoing construction on the street,” the sign reads. “There was no end in sight. Closing was the only viable option.”
Other businesses, including Oggi Gourmet—which is located inside the Smith Center on the Mount Auburn St. side and has remained open during renovations—and the Andover Shop on Holyoke St. have also faced significant drops in business.
Lawrence D. Mahoney, a long-time salesman at the Andover Shop, a formalwear shop on Holyoke St., said the drop in foot traffic has been a problem for sales. He said that in addition to contacting the mitigation office with complaints, he has also offered up solutions, all of which have “fallen on deaf ears.”
“The mitigation office has done an atrocious job of mitigating,” Mahoney said. “I call and I get a very limp response that they’re going to do something. I mean their job is to be proactive and to act on the behalf of the aggrieved and all of the businesses have been aggrieved by this construction project.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that construction has certainly been challenging for neighboring businesses.
“As we expected all along, it certainly has an impact,” Jillson said. “But this is a project that needed to be done and almost all of our members on Dunster St. and Holyoke St. knew in advance how challenging it would be and I believe they were prepared for that.”
Still, En Boca’s lawsuit charges that Harvard was not transparent in presenting the scope of the project. Although the University was clear from the outset that construction would continue through 2018, the lawsuit claims the University did not inform Classic Restaurant Concepts the renovations would include the closure of Holyoke St. until one month after their lease was signed.
“Harvard encouraged this investment all the while omitting to disclose this fundamental and material fact,” the lawsuit reads. “At no time prior to executing the lease did Harvard disclose to Classic Restaurant Concepts that Holyoke Street would be closed for any period of time or that it could be used as a staging area for the renovation of the Smith Center,” it later reads.
A Harvard spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing University policy.
Jillson credited Harvard with providing a mitigation officer at the start of the Smith Center project to deal with potential issues. She said her organization has called the officer several times on behalf of its member business such as Mike’s Pastry, the Hourly Oyster House, Oggi, and the Andover Shop.
“Despite the noise and the interruptions and the road closures and all of the vehicles and the difficulty with parking, the mitigation officer has been incredibly attentive and responsive, and for that we’re really grateful,” Jillson said.
Once reopened, the first two floors of the Smith Campus Center will be open to the public and will include food options.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pilot program that allows Harvard University IDs to be used as MBTA CharlieCards has drawn praise from members of the Class of 2021.
This year’s pilot came after an earlier trial in the spring of 2015 in which 100 students received pre-loaded dual-function cards. Prior to that program, UC members encountered resistance from administrators concerned with the potential integration cost and security concerns around student data.
According to Michael D. Connor, Director of Communications for Campus Services, freshmen must register their IDs online with the MBTA before adding monetary value.
Thomas J. Burr ’21 said the process of adding money to the card was both “easy” and “effective.”
“It’s just really simple,” he said. “You always got your Harvard ID on you, so if you just make a quick trip to the subway station, you don’t need to grab two cards. It just makes your life easier.”
Burr added that he hopes other classes will have the ability to integrate their IDs. “Probably all years should have it. It’s very handy,” he said.
Conner wrote in an email that the program is still “only a pilot for the freshmen class," and that he expects the MBTA to provide data on usage in the coming months.
The dual-function ID cards are one of a number of initiatives to encourage travel into the greater Boston area. In the fall of 2015, with a $30,000 budget, the Freshman Dean's Office launched “Into the Hub,” a program that plans regular social events in Boston for freshmen.
Looking ahead, Jonathan Castillo ’21 said he hopes the ID will be able to hold more features.
“I think it’s a cool idea. It makes it simpler. It makes it easier,” he said. “It would actually be really helpful if you could have a lot of stuff on that card."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirty-six members of the Class of 2018 declared their candidacy for senior class marshal, the Harvard Alumni Association announced on Tuesday.
The Senior Class Committee serves as the representatives of their class, plan the Class Day exercises for May, solicit donations from their classmates for the annual Senior Gift fund, and plan a series of social events for their class. The two candidates that receive the most votes will become the first and second marshal, respectively, and all seniors are eligible to vote.
Last September, 33 candidates jockeyed for marshal positions in the Class of 2017 representing a number roughly equal to the current candidate pool, but marking a decline from previous years. Prior election cycles had seen around 50 seniors competing for marshal positions.
This year, the candidates hail from all of the undergraduate Houses, with the exception of Dunster. Cabot has the most candidates at six, and several of the marshal candidates also serve as chairs of their House Committee. Some of the candidates have also served on the Undergraduate Council.
In addition to the first and second marshals, seniors will elect six program marshals from the same pool of candidates. The six highest vote earners from the final round, after the first and second marshals, will become the program marshals.
The Harvard Alumni Association will conduct a first round of voting for senior class marshals on September 25, with a final round on September 27. Both rounds of voting will close at 11:59 p.m.
The candidates ranked in the top 16 will move on to the final round. The results of the election, along with the appointment of gift marshals—who oversee donations to the Senior Gift fund—will be announced to the Class of 2018 on September 29.
Other members of the senior class committee, including gift marshals, will be appointed following interview processes.
The Senior Gift funds a variety of College initiatives, such as athletics, financial aid, and House life. In previous years, student donors have had the ability to choose whether their money will be placed into an unrestricted fund for the College or will be directly contributed to financial aid programs.
The following seniors have applied to run for the first, second, and program marshal positions on the Senior Class Committee:
Berkeley Brown (Lowell)
Anthony X. Chen (Cabot)
Katherine J. Cohen (Winthrop), a former Crimson Blog chair
Flavia Cuervo (Lowell)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vann R. Newkirk II, a staff writer for The Atlantic, criticized the American media's coverage of race in the United States at a Kennedy School event Tuesday afternoon.
At the hour-long event moderated by Director of the Shorenstein Center Nicco Mele, Newkirk discussed how the media did not properly cover a violent rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville earlier this summer.
"We like to say things that make us feel good about calling out the affect of racism without doing anything about the actual muscle of racism," he said.
Newkirk was also critical of the media’s role in the election of Trump, an argument previously made by other speakers at the JFK Forum. He said that journalists should have more closely covered demographics beyond the white working class.
“I didn’t see stories about the towns that got destroyed by floods and had to go out and vote in two weeks," he said. "So, for me it’s the media’s job to win back trust.”
Newkirk graded the media’s coverage of racial issues “a big fat F.”
Other topics Newkirk discussed included the difficulties black journalists face to address systemic racism and how young journalists provide cautious optimism for the future of the media.
Khalil G. Muhammad, a professor of history, race, and public policy at the Kennedy School who attended the talk, was pleased with Newkirk’s visit.
“I think having a journalist who is challenging the industry to recognize its poor performance in addressing both the history and contemporary realities of racism in America is essential to [Harvard] being part of the solution,” he said.
Another audience member, Lily de la Fuente, also gave the presentation positive reviews.
“I think it was a great forum to discuss race and how it’s portrayed in the media, and to hear the different viewpoints of people working around campus,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 20, 2017 at 4:20 p.m.
Several University officials received emailed bomb threats Wednesday afternoon, though the Harvard University Police Department says they are not credible and no buildings have been evacuated.
In an advisory emailed to Harvard affiliates around 3:30 p.m., Steven G. Catalano, a spokesperson for HUPD, wrote that the threats are not believed to pose a threat to the University.
Other local colleges also received similar threats around the same time. According to Robert Z. Molloy, Deputy Chief of the Boston University Police Department, BU received bomb threats Wednesday over text message. “We are under no concern right now, and we know that it is a hoax threat,” Molloy said.
As HUPD investigates, Catalano warned Harvard staff to “be vigilant” and report suspicious activity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

On Saturday, Harvard football played at Rhode Island. The most significant outcome had nothing to do with the final score.
Midway through the second quarter, Rams wide receiver Marven Beauvais grabbed a catch near the sideline. Freshman cornerback Ben Abercrombie flew in for the hit, fell to the ground, and remained immobile.
Silence descended at Meade Stadium as medical personnel hustled Abercrombie off the field and to a nearby hospital. Later, team officials stated that the freshman had suffered a serious cervical injury and undergone surgery.
My sole purpose in describing the incident is to underscore the seriousness. After Abercrombie left the field, Crimson coach Tim Murphy asked his players whether they wanted to continue the game or drive home. As a team, Harvard football is processing complicated feelings—and probably will for the rest of the season.
I don’t have any further analysis here. It felt remiss to write a column without mentioning Abercrombie’s injury. It felt equally remiss to use the injury as part of a larger point. All I have to offer is the fervent hope that Abercrombie recovers well and swiftly. Please keep him in your thoughts.
Emotionally, the Crimson faces an enormous challenge—gearing up for the rest of the season. Before Saturday, Harvard hadn’t dropped a season opener since 2011. The Crimson had scored at least 10 points in its last 71 games. Meanwhile, the Rams had snatched all of four victories in the last four seasons.
On Saturday, though, history toppled to the ground like a tower of cards. Harvard simply looked lost.
Then again, so did I. Last Friday, I previewed the Rhode Island contest and predicted a blowout. “Mayweather-McGregor looks like an even match compared to this one,” I wrote. Nice.
Partly, I underestimated the athleticism of the Rams. Wide receivers Aaron Parker (sophomore) and Khayri Denny (junior) cut past cornerbacks. The Rhode Island defensive line won the line of scrimmage despite Rams coach Jim Fleming complaining that Harvard linemen are so large that they “block out the sun.”
I also mistook the Crimson, however. I expected a steel-curtain defense. Indeed, Harvard boasts veteran talent, and the team showed flashes of dominance, especially in a scoreless second half.
Still, Rhode Island averaged a comfortable 6.3 yards per play and converted on 50 percent of third downs.
The Crimson offense hardly fared better. Three of Harvard’s first five possessions ended in three-and-outs. In the first quarter, the Crimson enjoyed first-and-goal from the four only to settle for a field goal. In the fourth quarter, Harvard moved to the seven-yard-line before fumbling.
Senior quarterback Joe Viviano had a mixed outing. He completed over 50 percent of his passes (17-for-32) and didn’t throw an interception. But hee didn’t throw a touchdown, either, and his longest heave sailed 23 yards. At the end of last season, the most pressing question surrounded Viviano’s performance and whether Murphy trusted him enough to dial up difficult throws. That uncertainty remains, at least for another week.
Sports fans tend to see calamity in minor events. As soon as a raindrop falls, someone predicts a monsoon. Remember when Aaron Rodgers was “washed up” last year? Or when the Patriots’ dynasty was supposed to end in 2014 (and then 2015…and then 2016…and before this weekend)? Perceived turning points rarely are turning points. Fans just overanalyze.
Sportswriters, unfortunately, share this habit. With nine games on the horizon, it’s important not to make apocalyptic predictions. Cassandra was right, but you probably won’t.
The Harvard defense, for one, should whip into shape. That unit has too much experience to disintegrate. All starting defensive backs have seen major game action. So have all starting linebackers.
On Saturday, the Crimson racked up 80 yards of penalties, many in timely situations. Murphy doesn’t tolerate such frequent miscues. In practice this week, you can bet that coaches are drilling players on mental discipline, over and over again.
Offensively, Harvard retains all-star talent, even if few players popped against the Rams. It takes a well-trained army of men to tackle 5’7” junior wide receiver Adam Scott in the open field. And fellow classmate and wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley can catch anything within a five-yard radius. Further running back Charlie Booker came into his own against Rhode Island. The junior bowled over several defenders en route to 139 yards on 13 carries.
After 60 minutes of competition, the only conclusion we can draw is that the Crimson won’t go undefeated this year. Let’s wait until next Saturday to say more.
