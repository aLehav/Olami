After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some films can conjure images so lurid and so hypnotic that they simulate the feeling of dreaming. “Night of the Kings,” written and directed by Philippe Lacôte, is one of those films. Lacôte creates a hermetically enclosed world, stuffed full with haunting, ethereal visuals. This feature marks the second film from Lacôte, whose debut “Run” (2014) was the first film from Côte d’Ivoire to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival.
“Night of the Kings” takes place in the infamous La MACA prison in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, where an organized gang of prisoners call all the shots, accruing resources and organizing the living quarters. The film unfolds over 24 hours as a new prisoner, Roman (Koné Bakary), is selected by inmate leader Blackbeard (Steve Tientcheu) to be the “storyteller” for a mysterious ritual in that night’s Blood Moon. Standing alone before hordes of frenzied prisoners in the red moonlight, Roman eventually realizes that he must stall his story until dawn for a chance to escape the ritual with his life. Lacôte also interweaves multiple subplots, including the mystical story of the outlaw Zama King, which Roman narrates during the Blood Moon ritual, and the existential politics of a power vacuum when it’s revealed that Blackbeard is terminally ill.
Lacôte’s film explores masculinity in an all-male society and the stratification of roles in a criminal organization. But what sets “Night of the Kings” apart from the canon of prison dramas is its commitment to depict the power of storytelling. Roman’s tale of Zama King is an effective use of the story-within-a-story technique: It allows Lacôte to comment on the nature of film as a medium to tell stories. The fantastical fable of Zama King is a substitute for film, and the prisoners wrapped up in the story are proxies for the audience. It’s a reminder that storytelling has the power to captivate, the power to spark fantasies, and in Roman’s case, perhaps even the power to save one’s life.
Just as Roman’s story captivates hundreds of prisoners, it also enthralls the audience of “Night of the Kings.” Lacôte creates a unique, immersive world with the story of Zama King, so steeped in obscure ancient history and rituals that it feels like a rude awakening when the audience is brought back to La MACA. The prisoners sing and chant with a spiritual conviction as Roman’s story unfolds, and, often, a group of them act out the story in a trance-like choreographed dance.
These mesmerizing sequences are animated by cinematographer Tobie Marier-Robitaille’s decision to shoot most of the film on a handheld camera, snaking through the narrow corridors of La MACA, and set free to sprawl around its concrete courtyards in the ghoulish red moonlight. While many of the daytime prison sequences look grey and desaturated, Marier-Robitaille makes a remarkable contrast at night, lighting faces to a ghostly effect with the delicate, soft glow of lamps.
However, “Night of the Kings” feels too short. Some films are comfortable filling three and a half hours — take Martin Scorsese’s introspective mobster swan song “The Irishman.” Others find their fit at just 30 minutes, such as Pedro Almodóvar’s “The Human Voice,” which was also screened at this year’s NYFF. But 93 minutes is simply insufficient for “Night of the Kings”; too many plot points are rushed or unresolved, which is disappointing considering how well Lacôte had juggled them throughout the film.
Nevertheless, “Night of the Kings” is a beautiful, original film. It reminds one why they go to the movies in the first place — to dream, to escape, and to aspire. Lacôte’s film will screen virtually at the New York Film Festival until Sept. 29.

Academy Award winning writer-director Sofia Coppola makes an intriguing change of pace with her latest film, “On the Rocks,” which feels more like one of Woody Allen’s detective-rom-com hybrids from the ’80s and ’90s than it does "The Virgin Suicides" or "Lost in Translation." But it’s also a change of pace that really works. “On the Rocks” (produced by A24 and distributed by Apple TV+) works to mend a long-impaired relationship between Laura (Rashida Jones) and her father Felix (Bill Murray), endearing audiences with its layered characters and bubbling charm.
Coppola’s film unfolds in the cushion of an affluent Manhattan apartment, as Laura begins to suspect that her husband Dean (Marlon Wayans) is having an affair with his new business assistant, Fiona (Jessica Henwick). Laura feels increasingly alienated from Dean. She also begins to lose touch with her work as a writer, instead spending much of her day caring for the needs of their two daughters.
The film takes a turn towards the upbeat when Laura calls her father Felix, an aged but charming womanizer, for advice. Felix suggests that the two begin sleuthing together to get to the root of Laura’s suspicions, and before we know it, the game is afoot. But somewhere amidst all the adrenaline, the two begin working on the insecurities that caused the father-daughter relationship to drift in the first place. Sometimes, “On the Rocks” serves as a banal but therapeutic reminder to foster relationships — because simple time and attention can go a long way in invigorating trust and affection.
Bill Murray eats up the screen in his second feature-length collaboration with Coppola following “Lost in Translation” with his most effervescent performance in years. As Felix, Murray saunters around the screen with a wry confidence and carries the weight of the film with a magnanimous presence, from convincing a policeman to give his car a push-start instead of a speeding ticket to landing all of his jokes with a sly wink to the camera.
Coppola also reunites with cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd (“The Beguiled”), who uses backlighting throughout the film to create misty, dreamlike outlines and shadows. But Coppola’s trademark visual style — the desaturated color grading and moody lighting that worked well in films like “Lost in Translation” — feels out of place in such a charming film. It could be that the dream-like haze is meant to paint a fuzzy picture of nostalgia, and that effect certainly works at times, but the visual style feels too derivative of “Lost in Translation” to take on an identity of its own in “On the Rocks.”
"On the Rocks" is not meant to be a thought piece on human relationships, but many of the film’s conflicts can be boiled down to Freud’s theory of the superego. Felix represents the id and can be swayed by instant gratification. He says that it’s human nature for a man to make a decision based on sexual impulses. But Felix knows that he is impulsive. His id is not subconscious, but rather an excuse — a mask he wears to shield the regret he feels for his past infidelities. As the film goes on, and the id narrative inevitably collapses on itself, the conversation shifts into the Superego as the two discuss the morality of relationships — is monogamy a human construct? Is it merely a by-product of evolution for men to break that contract, and women to seek to honor it? Or is it a moral responsibility that both parties should sign on?
While “On the Rocks” doesn’t exactly break the theological bank with its ideas, Coppola offers enough wit, charm, and a standout Bill Murray performance, to make a solid, enjoyable film.
“On the Rocks” premiered at the New York Film Festival, and will begin its limited theatrical run in Cambridge, Mass. at Landmark’s Kendall Square Cinema on October 2. It will be available on Apple TV+ starting Friday, October 23.

Take a guess at the highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation: “Titanic,” “Frozen,” “Avengers: Infinity War”? Nope — the title actually goes to 1939’s “Gone with the Wind,” the film bemoaning the loss of the pre-Civil War South with no shortage of problematic character portrayals. While it’s a bit of an affront to consider Scarlett O’Hara’s petulant four-hour drama America’s most celebrated cinematic creation in the past eight decades, “Gone with the Wind” wasn’t just any movie back then: As one of the first and only Technicolor films ever made, there weren’t many other options playing in theaters (making for quite a few repetitive first dates).
Today, Netflix’s 183 million subscribers have access to a catalog with thousands of movies and TV shows, along with personalized libraries of recommendations. Having evolved from a rent-by-mail DVD service to a ubiquitous streaming platform that doubles as a euphemism for sex, Netflix has proven itself capable of preserving the cinematic experience in the midst of a pandemic when IMAX screens and surround sound systems could not. With companies from Hulu to HBO to newer additions like Apple quickly catching on to the market, and offering the newest content for anywhere from $4.99 to $14.99 a month, what exactly are those enticing little add-on words — “plus,” “max,” “blue,” “now” — promising us?
In fact, streaming’s popularity first stemmed from its status as a much simpler, less expensive alternative to cable. In that sense, perhaps it democratizes the landscape of visual media, offering not only an extensive library of classics, but also high-quality original shows like HBO’s “Chernobyl,” Hulu’s “Normal People,” or Amazon Prime’s “Fleabag” to a far greater audience than ever before. With more flexibility (and deeper pockets) for creative experimentation than traditional Hollywood film studios, Netflix has even managed to convince big-name directors like Martin Scorsese and actors like Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler to sign on to its original projects, legitimizing itself as an institution of film and television far into the future.
Still, the new world of entertainment brought on by streaming comes alongside some qualifications. With more hours of algorithm-tailored content than it would be possible to consume in a human lifetime, watching TV can feel like a constant game of catch-up. There’s a paralyzing number of choices between not only what to watch, but between exactly which services to subscribe to (while the existence of combination bundles, like Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN all for $12.99 makes it even more overwhelming). Looking past the economic considerations of whether the live-action “Mulan” is worth $30 on top of your Disney Plus subscription (spoiler alert: it’s not), streaming offers significant changes to the way we consume media.
When entire seasons of a show drop at once, gone are the loyal TV and movie fan bases of the 2000s, built from the collective excitement of having to wait a week for a new episode. Despite constant additions of new content, attempts at recreating old magic or extending its lifetime often fall flat: Though “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” was actually much more fun (and original) than the title would suggest, that’s still a bit of a low bar — and it comes nowhere close to the lively, creative energy of Disney Channel ten years ago.
One could argue that the culture of “binging” shows makes it more difficult to direct invested, long-term emotional attention towards any singular one, and that even as the “Up Next” button gives us more opportunities to find content we like, we don’t have the time to fully immerse ourselves in it. Such vast libraries also beg the question of whether art deserves to be treated and consumed like this — if there is a reason why museums have glass panels and spacious galleries, why Van Gogh’s “Night Cafe” isn’t crushed up against some toddler’s coloring book, then how can it be acceptable for Netflix to suggest “La La Land” and “The Kissing Booth” side by side under the same genre?
Perhaps the most apt metaphor for all of this streaming business is the Ben and Jerry’s ice cream flavor “Netflix and Chill’d”: a familiar peanut-butter base featuring interesting occasional surprises of fudge brownie and pretzel bits that you wouldn’t find in your run-of-the-mill ice cream brand. And when it does get a little too sweet, or a little too rich, just remember to take it slow and savor each bite, lest we be overwhelmed by all the different flavors.

On the morning of September 27, Armenians around the world awoke to the horrifying news that the Azerbaijani Armed Forces had attacked Artsakh, a de-facto Armenian state that has declared itself independent of Azerbaijan — breaking the 1994 cease-fire agreement between the two sides. Many in the region had feared this attack since the fighting in July, when the Azerbaijani Armed Forces had targeted civilian and military forces alike, including a PPE factory, in Armenia’s Tavush region. The recent offensives on Artsakh have targeted civilian centers too, including the capital, Stepanakert, where the population has been forced to evacuate to shelters for safety. Today, fighting continues not only in Artsakh, but in Armenia proper as well, where Azerbaijani military forces opened fire on the Vardenis region.
While Azerbaijan has referred to the operation as a “counterattack” to Armenian “provoking,” it is abundantly clear that it premeditated the operation and has done so in collaboration with Turkey. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, stated on Sunday that Azerbaijan has his country’s full support. Turkey has provided not only artillery and military aid to Azerbaijan, but has also recruited Syrian mercenaries to aid its military forces, a recruitment process that began around a month ago. In the days before the attack, Azerbaijan also called on army reservists for inspection and training, and confiscated several private vehicles for military use — actions further suggesting that it premeditated these attacks with support from the Turkish government.
Armenia, a country of 3 million, and Artsakh, a state of 150,000 with an Armenian ethnic majority, are withstanding attacks from Azerbaijan and Turkey whose populations sum to nearly 95 million — a 30:1 ratio. Artsakh’s Defense Minister Jalal Harutyunyan said of the attacks: “Their plans have been clear to us for a long time, the essence of which can be expressed in the following way: to depopulate Artsakh and Armenia of Armenians.”
The current events taking place are all too familiar to Armenians, a people of great resilience and perseverance, whose thousand-year history is fraught with changing regimes, persecution, and genocide. In 1915, our ancestors suffered a genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, carried out under the guise of World War I as a distraction to the world — much like what Azerbaijan is doing today with its planned attack during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Armenian people suffered through pogroms and attacks in Azerbaijan committed by Azeris in both the early and late twentieth century.
In the sphere of geopolitics, history has not been favorable to Armenia either — the U.S. considers Turkey a key NATO ally and has delivered $100 million in security aid to oil-rich (and corrupt) Azerbaijan. This political and financial backing has enabled Azerbaijan to carry out its expansionist agenda without fear of consequence or accountability.
The result of these atrocities committed by Turkey and Azerbaijan was the formation of the global Armenian diaspora, whose population of 8 million is almost three times that of the Republic of Armenia. One microcosm of the diaspora is the Harvard Armenian Students Association, a collective of undergraduates and graduate students, faculty and staff hailing from the U.S. and U.A.E., all the way to Argentina and even Armenia itself. Despite the odds, we have managed to sustain our communities in our home countries and have found it imperative to once again create a new community together in Cambridge. Armenian heritage, and sadly our tragic past, are the unifying factors among us — and, as a community, we will not stand for yet another tragedy to define our country.
As the fighting escalates and the number of civilian and military casualties increase, we join Armenians worldwide to call on the international community for support. An outbreak of large-scale war in the South Caucasus could have unpredictable consequences, threatening international security and stability.
Unfortunately, yet again, the Armenian community’s struggles are met with silence from Western media outlets and coordinated pro-Azerbaijani social media campaigns. It has become evident over the years that when it comes to conflict in South West Asian/North African regions, we cannot rely on coverage by American broadcasting outlets; the responsibility falls on us to educate ourselves and seek accurate information. The consistent attribution of violence to both Armenia and Azerbaijan at the hands of Western media outlets demeans and undermines the greater context of Armenia’s current and historic struggles against both Azerbaijan and Turkey, which Armenians have fought honorably to overcome.
We call on the Harvard community to break the silence. We ask you to recognize the dangerous nature of international indifferences towards crimes against humanity, and ask you to not allow history to repeat itself. We want to thank those who have already spoken up, such as Law School Professor Adrian C. Vermeule ’90, setting a precedent we hope will be upheld by our colleagues and faculty at Harvard. In a war waged against our freedom, independence, and very existence, we ask you to amplify our voices; we ask for solidarity.
We also implore you to take action. We implore you to please contact your state representatives and ask that they promote an end to this violence and condemn the attacks made by Azerbaijan and Turkey these past days. The Armenian Assembly of America and Armenian National Committee of America have made forms to do so easily and quickly. Take action, break the silence, and help be the difference between peace and war.

“I find it wholesome to be alone,” writes Henry David Thoreau in his “Solitude” chapter of “Walden.” “To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating … I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.”
When I first read this part of Walden a few months back, I did feel some sympathy with Thoreau’s transcendentalist creed. I liked being left alone with my thoughts, hated negotiating the nuance of teenage social interaction, and grew tired of daily navigations through throngs of humanity. Then came quarantine.
Rarely have any of us felt as alone as we have over these past few months. We’ve gone from spending our days in a collegiate bubble, ricocheting like pinballs from one chance social interaction to another, to childhood homes, empty dorms, haphazard apartments. Our chief companion isn’t the stimulating solitude of Walden’s woods, but instead a dull, permeating loneliness that mingles with the stress and uncertainty we feel.
So it doesn’t come as much of a surprise that a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey has found unprecedented rates of mental health concerns in young adults. 74.9 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds reported having at least one symptom of anxiety, depression, or similar mental health disorders. That’s three-quarters of us nationwide.
But of all the people affected by this pandemic, why us young adults in particular? Why aren’t the mental health effects nearly as disproportionate in working parents, or high-risk populations? Sure, we have stress, confusion, lost opportunities; but everybody else does, too. What seems to separate our demographic group from the others, then, is the unique role total immersion in our peer group plays in this stage of life – and consequently, the outsized contrast of the loneliness that’s ensued.
The loneliness we’re experiencing strays far from Thoreau’s reflective solitude — upsetting the delicate balance of all the little interactions in our brains. Brains are busy and complex environments — societies of neurons, microcosms of our social world. Just as our now-virtual lives are a constant feedback loop of emails, classes, and Google docs, our brain cells depend on a constant flow of messages — taking in information and hurling it from one place to another.
In the worlds of our brains, neurons, nerve cells, are the major players. They have a compact cell body stuffed with the nucleus and organelles that keep the cell alive. But unlike the typical round cell you might have studied in basic biology, neurons have tree branch-like dendrites and one long, tentacle-like axon coming out of their cell bodies. These dendrites and axons arrange themselves tip to tail with neighboring neurons — each axon facing the dendrite of another cell, though not touching it. They create a sort of web inside the brain, enabling the neurons to perform their key function: receiving, processing, and sending signals to their neighboring cells.
When you receive an inside or outside stimulus, like hunger or a stubbed toe, sensory neurons send an electrical signal — a little spark — rocketing through bundles of nerve fibers and into your brain to be processed. Except, since axons and dendrites don’t touch, the electrical spark can’t travel across the gap between them, called a synapse. Think of it as an inter-neuronal conversation, millions happening every moment. At each synapse, axons release chemicals called neurotransmitters, tiny molecules with complex sets of functions, when the electrical spark hits their terminal. A dendrite then receives those molecules and fires an electrical signal into its own neuron to continue the process.
But, just as we color everything we say with a slightly different tone depending on the message we want to convey, different neurotransmitters each characterize their own emotional response. Serotonin, for example, has been associated with increased happiness and well-being, with the general contentment you feel when you look outside and see the blue skies and birds flying high. That’s why common antidepressants, like Prozac and Zoloft, work by preventing neurons from reabsorbing extra serotonin molecules, increasing the amount available in each synapse. Another neurotransmitter, dopamine, powers the reward we feel when we get something we crave or love — like when you manage to finally win Uno, or even just eat a giant ice cream cone.
Consequently, low levels of these neurotransmitters have been strongly linked with depression and anxiety. Because our brains, just like us, depend on a balance. We know that when you pull the rug out from under our feet — disrupt homeostasis, in scientific speak — with something like a global pandemic, we lose a huge swath of routines we knew and loved. We find ourselves faced with a painful imbalance.Those inter-neuronal conversations, those synapses, don’t have enough serotonin or dopamine to project the world as they knew it. We feel lost, unmotivated, sad; alone.
I guess, then, that Thoreau’s argument on solitude misses a key element of this whole pandemic-quarantine affair. “Walden” was a choice, not the rebound from an outside stimulus. The reflective solitude Thoreau describes is an addition, not a subtraction; he had his mother and the occasional guest over to his abode, barely denting the status quo. Meanwhile, we’ve been cast deeply out of homeostasis with no say in the matter, reshaping and reorganizing the very way our brains function. And as young adults, first experiencing what life is like when we’re able to choose it, this sudden loneliness throws us especially out of whack. No wonder the CDC survey found what it did.
So, where to go from here? Let’s take a lesson from the brain, and from biology in general. More than anything else, the human body and brain adapt, tinkering with and redeploying pathways all over until we can find the closest thing to homeostasis again. If “Walden” redefined solitude, then we can redefine loneliness ourselves, here, now. It’s an imbalance; it’s a shock; it’s the breaking down and patching together of the microenvironment we knew; but there’s no reason we can’t learn something from that.

Administrators in the Dean of Students Office are optimistic that undergraduates living on campus will finish the semester safely, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said in an interview Wednesday.
O’Dair said she is confident that freshmen — the majority of whom reside on campus, along with select upperclassmen — will continue to heed campus policies regarding the coronavirus during the next two and a half months. She added that the possibility of bringing back seniors in the spring gives weight to that responsibility, though she acknowledged that Harvard has yet to make definite plans for the spring semester.
When the University announced that freshmen would form the majority of students returning for the fall, administrators said that — public health permitting – it would welcome seniors in the spring.
“We need for this to be a shared responsibility, and I think we have created an environment where students have done an excellent job of understanding their role in all this,” O’Dair said Wednesday. “In particular, for first year students to know that the work they're doing well hopefully bring back seniors and other students in the spring.”
As of Thursday, just nine of the 21,669 coronavirus tests Harvard has conducted on undergraduates returned positive results. Undergraduates living in residence get tested three times each week. The University also announced on Monday that roughly 500 students living near campus will be able to avail themselves of University testing through Nov. 22.
O’Dair also addressed a Sept. 10 email she sent to students on campus, where she issued a stern reminder about both residential social distancing guidelines and the consequences of flouting them. The email followed reports of large student gatherings by the Charles River near some of the Houses — a clear violation of social distancing policy set out in the Community Compact.
In the interview, she described the email as “proactive” rather than reactive, and added that she believes students are doing well in abiding by the College’s policies.
“I sent that message really in a general way, because it’s always a good reminder early on, especially to be vigilant about it in this time,” she said. “It was just another reminder that, for large gatherings, there is a higher risk to people who attend. Large gatherings lead to transmission.”
Restrictions on student gatherings are just one tenet of the community compact, a list of residential guidelines students living on campus agreed to follow. As of Sept. 9, the College permitted outdoor gatherings of ten or fewer participants but continues to bar indoor gatherings.
Other restrictions limit the number of students occupying dorm rooms and render common spaces like dining halls and communal study spaces defunct. O’Dair explained that as the semester progresses — and the weather turns colder — students on campus can expect to see more “study space” opening up.
“We worked all summer with many constituents across campus with our colleagues in health services for guidance on public health,” O’Dair said. “We worked with facility staff and all of our residential staff to think about their roles. Our housing office did a great job of thinking through capacities and what sort of housing students should be in and developing the community compact.”
O’Dair added that she recognizes that Harvard’s campus return plan is “conservative.” She said campus life will continue to follow that “cautious and conservative” approach.
DSO administrators also reflected on how the fall setup took shape. That process — which began to take shape in late spring — involved coordination between the DSO and various parts of the University to develop housing plans and the Community Compact, according to O’Dair.
“We were working with facilities staff and were working with all of our residential staff to think about roles,” she said. “We’ve worked with our housing office, which did a great job of thinking through capacities and what sort of housing students should be in and can be in.
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 added that the reimagining of the residential system this semester was a “joint community effort” that revolved around being “welcoming” to students both on and off campus.
“To have students be able to come back I think was something we really did value. We successfully moved everyone in residence, we have people who are attending classes and being able to engage in the academic environment, and have the support they need,” Brandt said.
“But I think it's also thinking about how we welcome the students who are learning from afar and learning remotely, and making sure that they're part of the conversation as much as we can," she added.

Harvard Law School professor Richard J. Lazarus offered new insights into climate law in a Harvard Kennedy School webinar on his new book, “The Rule of Five: Making Climate History at the Supreme Court,” Thursday.
Kennedy School professor Joseph E. Aldy — who served as a Special Assistant to the President for Energy and Environment during the Obama administration — hosted the event, the latest installment of the Regulatory Policy Program webinar series. The series aims to invite policy experts who are leaders in conversations about the effectiveness of regulatory policy and who cross disciplines.
Lazarus, who has argued before the Supreme Court on 14 occasions, spent the talk outlining the arc of his book. He said he kept two goals in mind while writing: to show the general public both sides of Supreme Court advocacy and to explain challenges that stand in the way of environmental litigation.
He recounted the difficult road to victory in what he describes as the most consequential Supreme Court decision in environmental law: Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, a 2007 case which Lazarus called “environmental law’s Brown v. Board of Education.”
The Massachusetts decision, which predated the 2008 election of President Barack Obama by just a year, laid the groundwork for the Obama administration’s efforts to address climate change through new regulations. Realizing the regulatory authority afforded by the Massachusetts decision, the Obama administration asserted that they were “all in” on climate change, according to Lazarus, ultimately leading the United States to join the Paris Climate Agreement.
Initially, Lazarus foresaw the story ending neatly — but he said the didn't foresee an unexpected final plot twist: the election of President Donald J. Trump, who withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2017. Still, he said he believed it was necessary to avoid substantial discussion of Trump in the book because he wanted readers to focus on the story of the Massachusetts case on its own.
“I did not want this book to become another Trump book — to be wed to the latest event of the moment,” Lazarus said.
Aldy complimented Lazarus’s ability to make a complex case accessible to a broad audience in the new book.
“Within environmental law, he’s got to be the number one expert in the world at helping understand environmental law and the Supreme Court,” Aldy said.
“Climate change is really complicated. The people like a good story,” he added.

Government professor Kosuke Imai will take over as the official head of Government 50: “Data” in order to “ensure that the course can proceed without further disruption,” divisional Dean of Social Science Lawrence D. Bobo and Government department Chair Jeffry A. Frieden announced in a letter to students Thursday.
Gov 50 Preceptor David D. Kane will continue leading optional lectures, despite Imai's installation as the new course head. The announcement comes after students alleged that Kane authored racist blog posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” on his website EphBlog, prompting students to call for his removal in a petition that garnered nearly 700 signatures from Harvard students, alumni, and organizations.
One post from “Field” on the blog was signed “Dave Kane ’88.” Kane, a 1988 graduate of Williams College, created the blog in 2003 for Williams affiliates.
Frieden and Bobo wrote in their Thursday letter that the addition of a senior faculty member in a course with a preceptor is common.
“It is often the case that courses taught by Preceptors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are overseen by more senior faculty,” Frieden and Bobo wrote. “Consistent with this practice, Professor Imai will serve as the head of Gov 50.”
Kane will resume lecturing on Oct. 13, though his lectures will be optional under the new arrangement, Frieden and Bobo wrote. Students will be able to continue attending smaller sessions with their respective teaching fellows instead of Kane’s lectures for the remainder of the semester. Teaching fellows will be in charge of grading, with oversight from Imai.
Kane temporarily stopped lecturing beginning Tuesday in a joint agreement with Gov 50 course staff, according to a Sunday email from course staff. The staff’s message came one day after several teaching fellows proposed meeting with students privately in lieu of attending Kane’s lectures to encourage the administration to identify a replacement for Kane. In an email to concentrators Sunday, Frieden called the teaching fellows’ proposal “completely inappropriate” and “unprofessional” given their positions.
Imai, who also serves as coordinator of the Methods field in the Government department, addressed Gov 50 students in a separate letter Thursday.
“My goal is to make sure that the recent controversy surrounding Government 50 instruction does not dampen your interest in quantitative social science,” Imai wrote.
“Like Professor Frieden, I am committed to supporting your academic continuity and am confident we can deliver a truly excellent learning experience in Government 50 for the remainder of the fall term,” he added. “However, the choice to continue in this course is entirely yours.”
Imai reminded students that the Registrar’s Office has extended the Add/Drop deadline for Gov 50 for two weeks, to Oct. 19, and has waived the Add/Drop fee for transferring from Gov 50 into Government 51: “Data Analysis and Politics.”
Imai wrote that he does not endorse Kane’s controversial decision to invite Charles A. Murray ’65 to speak in the course’s optional lecture series.
“For the record, let me say that I share the dismay many of you feel about the invitation issued to Charles Murray as part of this course,” Imai wrote. “I do not believe that his claims have any scientific validity or educational value.”
Imai wrote that the talk is optional and that the teaching staff arranged for Sociology professor Jocelyn Viterna to give an alternative talk, which he “heartily” encouraged students to attend instead.
Bobo and Frieden acknowledged the difficulty facing Gov 50 students and staff, and wrote that their priorities are to fulfill their educational obligations while respecting academic freedom.
“It is clear that this has been very difficult for many of you, and we are sorry for the distress and disruption it has caused in what is already a challenging semester and unsettling time in the world,” Bobo and Frieden wrote.
“We wish to thank you for your forbearance as we seek, first and foremost, to fulfill our educational obligations to you as members of the Harvard community and students in this class while also respecting core institutional values regarding academic freedom,” they added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have found connections between disrupted workplace relationships and emerging mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a recent study.
The study — which was conducted by HSPH’s Sustainability and Health Initiative for NetPositive Enterprise program — may help guide employers and policy makers in boosting employee well-being while working remotely.
Dorota M. Węziak-Białowolska, a SHINE research scientist, wrote in an email that researchers reached out to a cohort of 4,556 residents of North Carolina, out of which 1,271 individuals agreed to participate in a survey to provide data on their work conditions. Among the participants, 65 percent were employed at the time in industries like agriculture, manufacturing, finance, and healthcare.
The group's data charts the wellbeing of employees across 17 industries during the pandemic. The survey, which was administered in May, included questions covering topics beyond “what we typically think about health or wellness,” according to SHINE director Eileen McNeely.
“We think of work as a platform for well-being, a source of meaning and purpose and financial security and social connectedness,” McNeely said. “And so we’re very focused on, you know, how work changes our experience of life and our well-being and our quality of life.”
For example, survey respondents answered questions about how the pandemic impacted their employment status, how much their weekly household incomes changed during the course of the pandemic, and whether or not work demands interfered with their personal and family demands.
The results showed that increased social isolation and disconnect from co-workers correlated with increased self-reported mental health issues. Sixty percent of respondents said their social relations worsened, 56 percent reported a decline in a sense of control, and 56 percent reported increased anxiety.
McNeely pointed out, however, that there were some positive findings from the survey, with at least 25 percent of participants reporting that they feel “they have been learning new things in this age of COVID.”
“So when things change up, the game changes up, and we have to bring new skills to bear,” McNeely said. “That could be something as simple as Zoom meetings, as everyone’s gotten very smart about how to conduct them.”
McNeely also said many survey respondents benefited from more positive relationships with their employers and management during the pandemic.
“There’s a large percentage of folks who say that their management has shown more empathy and care than before COVID,” McNeely said. “That sense of support from management is important because we know from our other studies that management’s caring and empathy, and trust in management, is a great driver of well-being.”
The group will follow up the ongoing study with another survey administered to participants in the fall, according to McNeely. The researchers hope to track how employees’ experiences have continued to shift in the ensuing months of the pandemic.
McNeely said she was initially startled by the magnitude of reported increases in emerging mental health issues. She added that she hopes the study will help shape future conversations about the pandemic around “how to build a social community that has been disrupted.”
“Mental health, in general, is one of those issues that we have to really shine a light on,” McNeely said. “Well-being isn’t like a ‘nice-to-have,’ it’s a must have, and it’s really integral to a functioning society.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President of the Human Rights Campaign Alphonso David shared his thoughts on BGLTQ activism, the future of gay rights, and the 2020 election in a conversation with Harvard Kennedy School professor Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 Thursday.
David highlighted the importance of viewing BGLTQ issues through an intersectional lens and noted the importance of the upcoming presidential election to the future of BGLTQ people in the United States.
“The stakes could not be higher,” he said of the election.
David drew a sharp contrast between the policies advanced by President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., noting Vice President Michael R. Pence’s consistent opposition to gay rights and the current administration’s opposition to the Equality Act, which would guarantee anti-discrimination protections to the BGLTQ community. He also referenced the Trump administration’s support for so-called religious freedom exemptions that would permit anti-gay discrimination on religious grounds.
David said the Supreme Court has often lagged behind public opinion on controversial topics, including on the issue of marriage equality. He argued that because of this, he views federal legislative protection through the Equality Act as necessary to ensuring the rights and dignity of BGLTQ people.
To advance those goals, David recommended listeners pursue three courses of action.
“The first thing I would say is volunteer to call in, or text in, to those priority states,” he said, urging listeners to participate in phone-banking events in swing states like Wisconsin and Arizona.
He urged those watching to download the HRC’s Team app, which allows users to see whether or not their contacts have voted, and stressed the necessity of increasing voter turnout among those who support BGLTQ rights.
In addition to delving into current events, David also told personal stories during Thursday's event. In response to a student question about speaking with people less informed about BGLTQ issues, he explained that acceptance often requires slow and patient work, recounting the length and complexity of his own coming-out conversation with his parents.
“It was a conversation about philosophy, religion, fear of death, dignity, all of those things merged into one,” he said.
David pointed listeners to the HRC website’s resource bank, which contains information on topics ranging from the importance of using the appropriate pronouns to the specific states where discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation is prohibited by law.
“This is the beginning of LGBTQ history month,” McCarthy said, adding that forum attendees should take this month “to learn something about LGBTQ history.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clark University professors Valerie Sperling and Robert G. Boatright discussed their research on the role of masculinity and misogyny in the United States’ 2016 elections in a lecture hosted by Harvard’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies Thursday.
Sperling and Boatright said many 2016 political campaigns relied on traditional gender stereotypes to frame their candidacies and undermine those of others. Davis Center associate Rochelle G. Ruthchild moderated the live-streamed discussion, entitled “What Studying Putin’s Russia Can Teach Us about the United States: Masculinity, Misogyny, and U.S. Elections in the Trump Era.”
Sperling and Boatright argued that Democrats and Republicans alike underestimated U.S. President Donald Trump’s first campaign, that female Republicans running for office faced an impossible choice in deciding whether to back Trump, and that many 2016 presidential candidates worked to turn the race into a contest of masculinity. They also compared political masculinity in the United States to tactics Russian President Vladimir Putin has employed.
Sperling and Boatright claimed that Trump’s campaign seriously hindered the chances of Republican women winning congressional seats compared to men. Sperling pointed to the 2016 New Hampshire senatorial race, in which incumbent Senator Kelly A. Ayotte (R-N.H.) lost her seat to her opponent Maggie C. Hassan (D-N.H.).
“It is as if, because she was a woman, she was expected to hold a standard higher than men,” Sperling said of Ayotte.
Sperling said in an interview after the event that she hoped audience members took away a broader understanding of how gender stereotypes affect political campaigns and elections.
“I would like audience members to walk away with a gender lens that they will then apply to everything political that they see,” Sperling said. “In other words, to be aware of when they’re viewing a political candidate or a political contest through the lens of masculinity or through the lens of homophobia when ads and pronouncements are playing on gender norms and gender expectations.”
In the interview, Sperling also said masculinity is a pervasive bipartisan political tool. She pointed to Tuesday’s presidential debate and said she thought both Trump and Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. performed masculinity.
Boatright said following the event that female Republican candidates in 2020 are again facing difficulties positioning themselves relative to Trump.
“Republican women get held to a different standard than men when they talk about Trump,” Boatright said.
He cited incumbent Senator Susan M. Collins (R-Maine) as an example, saying she has “no way to separate herself effectively from Donald Trump.”
Sperling and Boatright used the event to promote their newly published book, “Trumping Politics as Usual: Masculinity, Misogyny, and the 2016 Elections.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Office of International Education announced Friday morning that it would cancel study abroad programming for the Spring 2021 semester.
The decision comes in light of continued concerns over student health and safety, persistent travel restrictions, and countries’ evolving entry requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual study abroad programming will not be available as “for-credit options” for Harvard College students, OIE's notice added.
However, the announcement does not apply to homebound international students enrolled in their local universities.
Camila L. Nardozzi, director of the OIE, called Friday's decision “excruciatingly disappointing.”
“We’ve been watching the public health situation for months and months, since the start of all of this,” Nardozzi said. “Unfortunately, things worldwide haven’t progressed in the way that I think, globally, we would have hoped they would.”
Nardozzi said her office’s decision came as a result of extensive discussions with Harvard’s Office of Global Support Services, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and the Office of Undergraduate Education.
As the OIE monitored the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, staff largely anticipated the eventual decision to cancel study-abroad programming. That choice “was made for us,” Nardozzi noted.
The announcement came a day after the deadline by which many students had to submit applications for international universities, leaving them frustrated.
Kyle D. O’Connor ’22, who is on a leave of absence for the fall semester, had submitted applications to schools in Scotland, England, and Australia, hoping to study abroad for the spring semester.
“I’ve wanted to study abroad ever since I started. It’s been a dream of mine,” O’Connor said.
For O’Connor, the OIE’s decision came as a surprise. He said he had already solicited letters of recommendation, paid the fees that came with requesting and sending his transcripts, and sat down for hours with OIE staff.
“So, this comes as quite a shock, especially when they did it,” O’Connor said. “I think it was a hasty decision; it was too early of a decision to make.”
In response to student concerns, Nardozzi reiterated that Harvard's decision to cancel was not taken lightly and was made in accordance with guidelines laid out by Garber’s office on Aug. 20 that restricted University-sponsored domestic or international travel.
“While some may consider that either too strict or too conservative, one thing that we do know is that the virus is transmitted much more through travel,” Nardozzi said. “And so, one way that Harvard can do its part and help minimize transmission is by, you know, minimizing or prohibiting international travel.”
The Center for Disease Control has marked nearly every country in the world at a “Level 3 Travel Advisory: COVID-19 Risk is High Status.” CDC guidance still advises that traveling “increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19.” The agency recommends staying at home as the safest way to protect from virus transmission.
Garber’s Aug. 20 message echoed the CDC’s recommendations and underscored Harvard’s commitment to “slowing the spread” of the virus.
In a typical semester, roughly 100 to 120 students participate in study abroad programming. Nardozzi said she hopes that figure will not change post-pandemic.
“International experiences, such as semester and summer study abroad, are incredibly important to students’ academic development, personal development, and academic development,” Nardozzi said. “And until those experiences are cancelled, those experiences should continue to be discussed.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton and Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott, declined to comment on the cancellation.

Sections
Who knew six months ago we would need this quiz? Forget about the traditional Harvard greeting (name, year, concentration, then networking). Instead, hand someone this quiz or study it intently to size up people on your own with a glance. Your classmates probably don’t wear masks on Zoom, but you can practice near Widener steps or in your hometown where there are bound to be remote learners.
1. What level of protection is adequate for a walk?
A) Hazmat suit
B) Bougie Reebok masks
C) Mask in my pocket
D) Mask with nose clip so my glasses don’t fog up
E) No mask, baby! (btw, we are judging you if this is your answer)
2. How do you feel about going to the grocery store?
A) I refuse to leave my house
B) I get delivery
C) I can people-watch, yay!
D) I can mask-watch (so many kewl designs)
E) It is a necessary evil
3. Describe your mask style.
A) A safety device that covers my nose and mouth
B) Barely there
C) An extension of my personality
D) A cry for attention
E) A mask? What? (again, judging you...)
4. Other than protection from COVID, what benefit of wearing masks do you appreciate the most?
A) That’s a big “other”
B) No one knows what I look like underneath
C) Warmth
D) An excuse to craft
E) Style
5. Choose a mask to wear on a socially distanced picnic: 
A) N-95
B) Disposable blue paper mask
C) Bandana
D) Homemade mask
E) Scarf (I haven’t purchased/made masks yet!)
The Results
Mostly A’s:
Congratulations, you’re premed (I mean, this probably means you're an MCB or Hist Sci concentrator with a Global Health secondary)! N-95 Masks are your go-to, and while they should be saved for doctors, well, you will be one one day! They filter out 95 percent of the particles breathed in (sounds just like your grade on that last midterm).
Mostly B’s: 
You are an Economics or Government concentrator! You use and dispose of masks akin to how humans are treated under capitalism (snake!). Maybe try wearing a reusable mask occasionally (or you know, every day) to do your part for the environment.
Mostly C’s: 
You must be a Social Studies concentrator! It is all you can do to not explain to everyone you meet how your protective bandana reminds you of the cowboys protecting themselves from dust or linking public health rules to Foucault’s panopticon theory.
Mostly D’s: 
You’re an Engineering major! I mean, you must be, since you likely whipped out your sewing machine in early March and made masks for your extended family. Maybe you bioengineers can invent a mask as effective as N-95 for the common folk, or at least one that reduces maskne.
Mostly E’s: 
You must be a Humanities student! Please put down that book about the 1918 flu pandemic, leave your ivory tower and go purchase a real mask so that you are alive to save humanity one day.
