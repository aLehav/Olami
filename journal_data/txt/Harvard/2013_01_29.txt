After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps America's love affair with reality television—and schadenfreude—has reached a new low.
Last month, the cable channel Oxygen came under fire for one of its shows in development. Titled "All My Babies' Mamas," the show follows rapper Shawty Lo and his ten "baby mamas," with whom he has a total of 11 children.
Each of the baby mamas has a reductive nickname, such as Ecreia, who is referred to as "The First Lady" since she has control over Shawty's finances, and Liana, who gets called the "Baby Mama from Hell" since she's not super chill about sharing the father of her kids with nine other women.
Shawty Lo, whose real name is Carlos Walker, offers the following explanation for how he came to father 11 kids out of wedlock: "I had a lot of girls. They was in love and I probably was too with them, so you know, it just happened."
A website for the production company behind the show was hacked in December and a 13-minute preview was leaked online. The video incited author Sabrina Lamb to start a petition against the show for its offensive representation of African-Americans. Over 37,000 signatures later, Oxygen announced they were canceling the show earlier this week.
Walker told TMZ that he is determined to get the show on the air and that other networks are interested in the special. As for the allegations  that "All My Babies' Mamas" is demeaning to African-Americans, Walker says, "I take pride in having been actively present in all my children's lives—and I understand my family doesn't represent the typical American family, but it's my family and it works for us."
But here's the problem with that defense: judging from the preview, "All My Babies' Mamas" doesn't represent Shawty Lo's life so much as openly smirk at it.
The preview features choice moments such as Ashlin, Walker's latest 19-year-old girlfriend, and Ecreia fighting for the privilege of managing Walker's finances.  At another point, as Ashlin plays cards with a few of Walker's kids, an on-screen caption points to her that says, "Ashlin, NOT one of the kids"—an inclusion that mocks both Ashlin's age and Walker's willingness to date her.
The issue isn't whether "All My Babies' Mamas" is offensive—it is, to pretty much everyone. But this is what reality television has become. And if you draw the line at Shawty Lo, it's harder to defend shows such as "The Biggest Loser," which now features child contestants, or "Fat Girl Revenge," a show about formerly fat women who take revenge on people who made fun of them while they were fat. It's hard to expect reality television to be unoffensive when shock and schadenfreude are the entire point. The car-wreck appeal of reality TV is as strong as ever, and without a serious overhaul of the way we watch, shows like these are here to stay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long and relaxing winter break spent swimming by the beaches of my native Florida, I returned to campus a few days early to take a lifeguard certification course. And so about a week ago, early in the morning, I found myself bundled up in just about every shirt I own and ready to trek over to Blodgett Pool. As the wind licked at my arms and the frost nipped at my heels, I walked and walked and discovered that the pool must actually be located on the Connecticut side of the state line.
I also discovered that the time has come for me to buy some long-sleeve shirts. Regardless of how many are worn, t-shirts are simply not quite warm enough for the winter.
Mildly frostbitten, I finally arrived at the pool and changed into my bathing suit. The other lifeguard trainees and I were greeted by our instructor, who cut right to the chase. He said the first thing we’ll practice is our jumps. After that, we’ll do rescues, and then underwater knife fighting. He mentioned the last bit is not Red Cross material, but that it can be just as important, depending on the situation.
I glanced around at the other students, all of us not yet wet behind the ears, and they were looking around too, waiting for someone to laugh first. No one did. Our instructor, we figured out, was completely serious. And although he declined to be more specific on the details of underwater knife fighting, he assured us that such skills come in handy unexpectedly. He also assured us that knife practice would be useful fending off sharks and that he has relied on knives many times during his swims and tours of duty.
We never did learn to knife fight underwater. Next Wintersession, I am told.
Now you may be wondering what the point of this lengthy introduction could possibly be. After all, I have no idea when in my suburban lifetime I will ever need to know how to fight with a knife underwater. But then it dawned on me that I took a class last year on presidential elections, and there is a greater chance of me knife fighting in the Atlantic than running a presidential campaign. (I know this, you see, because I took a statistics course.)
I took the elections class because I could; I wanted to learn more about presidential politics and had the opportunity to do so. I took a cooking course, too, despite the fact that the administration did not allow me to count it toward my economics concentration. The amount of time it takes to cook an egg, I was told, did not affect my fundamental understanding of supply and demand. Nevertheless, my Freshman Seminar on U.S. elections and the Science of Cooking were two of the most rewarding classes I have taken.
This week, classes start up again, and there are plenty of required courses that need to be taken between now and graduation. We all have our concentrations and secondary fields and citations to take care of. But there are also those coveted free slots, those elective opportunities to take classes on neo-Babylonian inscriptions or Buddhism in Japan or the history of rap or just about anything else. For most of us, knowledge about Babylon has little post-college application or career relevance. Yet the classes that promise nothing more than an interesting semester usually turn out to be the best ones. When else will you have the opportunity to learn about electronic dance music in an academic setting?
Sure, I spent some of my winter break learning how to lifeguard. My fellow students and I learned how to pull victims out of the water, how to perform CPR, and how to prevent fires in the pool. Alas, we never made it to the knife fighting part of the curriculum. Next year, though, when the time comes to sign up for Wintersession activities, the first one I’ll look for is underwater knife fighting. Because if not then, when?
Unfortunately, I can’t learn about ancient Babylon this semester. I have some concentration requirements to take care of.

Support for entitlement programs does not necessarily entail ignorance of fiscal responsibility. In an editorial this past Friday, the Crimson Staff declared their “disappoint[ment] with the president’s wholesale commitment to entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.” Evidently, this “wholesale commitment” evidenced how the president was “conveniently ignor[ing]” the country’s economic difficulties and impending fiscal cliff. But the Obama administration’s commitment to sustainable entitlement reform in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has already set in motion a roadmap for the leading driver of entitlement costs to steadily decrease.
The New York Times’ Nate R. Silver recently performed a detailed breakdown of the major contributors to federal and local government spending and noticed that “all of the major categories of government spending have been increasing relative to inflation. But essentially all of the increase in spending relative to economic growth…has come from entitlement programs, and about half of that has come from health care entitlements specifically.”
Although healthcare entitlement costs are rising, their rise is slowing. Economist Peter R. Orszag, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, commented last year on how the United States is experiencing “a very marked slowdown in the growth of health-care costs.” In his article, Orszag cites the projections of two Harvard economics professors, David M. Cutler and Jeffrey B. Liebman. Their data shows that “relative to the projections issued three years earlier, today’s forecasts suggest health savings of $3,500 per family of four by 2017.” This is because “health-system leaders are anticipating two significant shifts over the next eight years: away from fee-for-service payments and toward clinical-decision support.”
The Affordable Care Act bolstered these shifts. Instead of simply shifting costs to individuals, the ACA provided a starting point for the government to regulate the relationship between health payments and the quality of care. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine notes that the ACA will “significantly reduce Medicare spending over the next decade.” However, the ACA only scratched the surface. If we really want to take control of entitlement spending, we should expand on the ACA’s provisions for quality control to make them concretely enforced throughout the entire private healthcare system.
For example, the ACA set certain administrative rules for Medicare, including requirements for the digitization and standardization of health records. By requiring private health payers and providers to simplify their administrative systems as well, the government can reduce up to 14 percent of excessive healthcare spending. The NEJM study observes that having “a task force consisting of payers, providers, and vendors set binding compliance targets, monitor use rates, and have broad authority to implement additional measures” could “achieve system-wide savings of $30 billion a year.”
The Obama administration has already put the government on track to control the leading driver of entitlement spending—and it can be controlled further, if Congress cooperates. But Silver’s analysis also reveals that the deficit problem has other causes. Defense programs are second only to entitlements in spurring federal spending growth.
Former Congressman Barney Frank explored this phenomenon recently, discussing how he “[has] been greatly frustrated…by the extent to which establishment opinion focuses on ‘entitlements’…as a major cause of the deficit” and how this “ignores the extremely large contribution made to this problem by military expenditures that are far beyond any rational assessment of our national security.”
In particular, Frank points out the United States’ excessive defensive support for many European and Asian allies as well as the continuing balance-sheet burden caused by nation-building in Afghanistan. He determines that our security interests can be protected while slowly phasing in cuts that would decrease defense spending to 20 percent below the current year’s amount. Even if only half of his proposed cuts are feasible, they could play a major role in reducing the deficit.
Last Friday’s Crimson editorial oversimplified the issues involved in the deficit reduction debate, answering the question of fiscal responsibility with an ambiguous desire to reform entitlement programs. The Obama administration has already played a vast role in resolving those questions by sustainably modernizing healthcare entitlements. The Affordable Care Act has helped decrease healthcare costs, which are the leading driver of entitlement spending. By innovating further, the government can ensure this trend continues in the private sector. And if politicians dare to look outside of entitlements, the government can be even more effective in controlling costs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today 180 million people around the globe are infected with Hepatitis C. In the United States, 3.2 million are infected with the virus—1.6 percent of the American population. Compare this to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS today, and you will see that the difference is colossal: 34 million people are infected with HIV/AIDS globally and 1.2 million people domestically. More people are dying today of Hepatitis C than of HIV/AIDS, a fact that is widely unknown.
While the numbers for HIV/AIDS are still high, they have dropped dramatically since the 1980s and ’90s. Due to an uprising of powerful activists groups and community advocacy, HIV/AIDS was brought to the forefront of political and social issues. Meanwhile, Hepatitis C is on the opposite side of the spectrum. It has lacked a community of concerned individuals and has consequently had very little attention since 1989, when it was first discovered. Advocacy for Hepatitis C is practically dismal, especially compared to HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis B. Funding for Hepatitis C research and resources is virtually negligible. This is due to the fact that Hepatitis C is not only an unspoken topic, but it is also an incredibly complex topic.
Hepatitis C is a slow-progressing, sometimes deadly blood-borne virus that attacks the liver. Of all people with the Hepatitis C virus, up to 85 percent will develop chronic hepatitis. Of this 85 percent, 70 percent will develop chronic liver disease, nearly 20 percent will develop cirrhosis, an incurable disease that results in scarring of the liver, and up to five percent will die of cirrhosis or liver cancer.
What many people are not aware of is that there is now a cure for Hepatitis C. A person with Hepatitis C can be free of the virus within 24 weeks if he or she follows a prescribed treatment plan. However, the virus is asymptomatic, which means that people who are infected are not aware of their status unless they are tested—and Hepatitis C testing is not a commonplace or encouraged procedure among medical institutions. The virus is also most commonly transmitted through injection drugs, contributing to the fact that Hepatitis C is most prevalent among poor, urban, and marginalized populations (especially drug users), many of whom are incapable of or not receptive to seeking out treatment.
This is for reasons such as a lack of motivation, a lack of peer, social, and community support, failure to recognize the long-lasting impact of not seeking treatment, lack of education about the illness, the attached stigmatization of infection, and an under-recognition of the condition (especially due to the fact that one could live 20 years without experiencing any symptoms). In addition, retention rates for those who actually seek treatment are incredibly low because the side effects are highly physically, financially, and emotionally debilitating.
Research has found that Hepatitis C is also most prevalent among the baby-boomer generation, the generation that lived through the “Summer of Love,” when experimentation with Schedule I drugs was especially high. Today, individuals who lived during that era have an HCV prevalence rate of more than double the national average. Targeting this generation is our best bet at drastically dampening the epidemic.
However, the “hippie” generation should not be our only focus. New statistics have shown that Hepatitis C is on the rise among American youth. In Massachusetts alone, HCV prevalence has risen from 65 cases per 100,000 between the ages of 15 and 24 in 2002 to 113 cases per 100,000 in 2009. This has been caused by to an increase in injection drug usage among America’s youth.
What the fight against Hepatitis C needs is both attention and money, and a lot of it. Specifically, it needs funding for programs such as the Division for Viral Hepatitis of the Centers for Disease Control, needle exchange sites, surveillance programs that value both casework and harm-reduction approaches, Hepatitis C education in communities and secondary schools, research funding for the development of a Hepatitis C vaccination, and more. But these needs cannot be met, let alone be requested, until our communities are educated and aware of the gravity and urgency of this issue. The time to act is now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid doomsday prophesies about their imminent extinction, public universities have shown surprising initiative and business savvy in staying afloat by joining the popular new trend in online education. A number of public universities across the country, including Arizona State University, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Arkansas, are planning on converting certain introductory courses into massive open online courses, meaning they will be free to anyone anywhere in the world with an internet connection. Until recently, the development of online education platforms has been mainly the domain of elite private institutions such as Harvard, which partnered with MIT last May to launch the free online education platform edX, offering participants a taste of a premier education without the official degree. The new MOOC2Degree program currently being pioneered by public universities goes one step further by encouraging participants to register for full, paid degrees after completing the free introductory courses.
Unlike Harvard, whose experiment in online education has been characterized by rhetoric of educational accessibility, the introduction MOOC courses seems to be driven at least in part by a need for new sources of revenue. Free introductory courses are advantageous for universities because they are prime bait for enrollment MOOC2Degree programs, which are the universities’ real focus. Yet even if the goals of Harvard’s edX and the MOOC2Degree program are not entirely aligned, impact of the two programs is effectively the same: Free education is made available to students who could not access it before. MOOC2Degree also has the added benefit of allowing students to preview a field for free before pursuing additional coursework, and it seems to be doing so with resounding success: Between 72 and 84 percent of students who successfully complete the introductory courses reportedly go on to take additional coursework. For these reasons, MOOC courses and the MOOC2Degree program should be regarded as a uniformly positive development in digital education.
While online education can never replace the full educational experience of a degree earned on a college campus, any initiative that opens educational opportunities to more people is necessarily a commendable one. And if the MOOC2Degree program becomes a source of significant revenue for financially strapped universities, this is all the more reason to applaud its success.
Of course, one might fear that there is the risk of these free introductory courses providing false advertisement for a degree program that is comparatively worse, conferring a meaningless diploma for a fee. Indeed, universities connected with for-profit companies notoriously have low graduation rates, low employment rates, and high student debt rates. But simply packaging already extant online programs into the MOOC2Degree is unlikely to do any harm. Credit will only be awarded to those who complete the program successfully, while those who fail to do so will not lose any money on introductory courses. We must applaud any sensible business strategy that helps universities and students alike.
A current complaint of many online students is the lack of accreditation they receive for completing online courses, even those offered by prestigious universities like Stanford and Harvard, whose online courses are not certified with degrees. With the MOOC2Degree program, public universities are forging an additional and much-needed pathway to achievement for the underserved students for whom they were originally created.

The Cambridge City Council continued to debate a ban on large sugar-sweetened beverages sold in the city at their meeting on Monday night. Councillors disagreed on the appropriate balance betweeen promoting public health and preserving indvidual freedoms.
Councillors Marjorie C. Decker, Minka Y. vanBeuzekom, and Mayor Henrietta J. Davis endorsed the proposal to limit the size of sugar-sweetened beverages—including sodas—sold in the city, but the proposal was met with concern from Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72.
Reeves said that he was conflicted about how to weigh Cantabrigians’ public health against his libertarian ideals.
“I’m on both of those sides, so it will be interesting going forward,” Reeves said.
In response, Decker said she believed that public health concerns must outweigh minor infractions on civil liberties. “The government imposes the number of seconds in which you can walk across the street,” she said in response to Reeves. “We as a society try to create norms that are healthy.”
Decker also noted that she had spoken with several leaders in the business community and only encountered one member who was concerned that the ban would affect profits. Davis said that there will be more consultations with the Cambridge business community before an official proposal is drafted.
At the meeting, the Council also commemorated the end of the first phase of a two-year campaign against domestic violence. The meeting began with a ceremonial flourish as Decker, the chair of the Community Health Committee, recognized three organizations which had helped implement the first phase of the Council’s effort.
During what they called “21 Days of Questions,” volunteers from the Cambridge Community Learning Center, the Community Engagement Team, and Transition House—a shelter for battered women—stopped people on the street and asked them to jot down questions they had about domestic violence.
“This is just the beginning,” Decker said. The organizations plan to follow “21 Days of Questions” with “365 Days of Actions,” a year-long phase in which they will disseminate key questions back to the public via the web and the media.
The goal of the campaign is to engage the Cambridge community in raising awareness for issues of domestic violence.
Finally, all eight councillors in attendance approved the landmark designation for the St. Francis of Assisi Church, the third-oldest church in the city. They also unanimously agreed to strike down the zoning provision stating that any cafeteria on the ground floor of a commercial space must be opened to the public at least 20 hours a week. With this decision, the Council allowed biotechnology company Biogen Idec to open a café exclusively for its employees in its new Kendall Square building.

Donald F. Hornig ’40 advised presidents, led Brown University through turbulent years of protest, and helped to design and then detonate the first atomic bomb. But his former colleagues at Harvard remember him as someone who helped to form generations of scientists and fostered a spirit of collaboration.
“Some professors have huge egos, and they really want to be remembered for the discoveries they made,” Harvard School of Public Health professor Joseph D. Brain said. “But I think Don was really unusual—perhaps because he’d already accomplished so much [and] that he came without ego and without agenda.”
Hornig died Jan. 21 at a nursing home in Providence, R.I. He was 92 years old.
Hornig was only in his twenties and a newly-minted Ph.D. in chemistry when his boss at the Underwater Explosives Laboratory at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute offered him an invitation to join a team of scientists working on a top-secret government project.
Upon his acceptance, Hornig unknowingly walked into the history books. The team was based at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the project was the now-famed Manhattan Project, where Hornig designed the explosive lens used to detonate the first atomic bomb in the summer of 1945. He was the last team member to inspect the bomb before pulling the trigger.
Until his death, Hornig maintained that the bomb had saved lives.
After the project disbanded, Hornig began a more traditional career in academia, teaching at Princeton and then at Brown. But his academic ambitions were derailed in 1963 when his Harvard classmate President John F. Kennedy ’40 asked him to serve as presidential science adviser. Hornig stayed in the post until 1969.
Hornig was in the midst of completing a six-year term on the Harvard Board of Overseers in 1970 when Brown University asked him to be its next president. His six year tenure from 1970 to 1976 was marked by much controversy, including student protests over the Vietnam War and university budget cuts.
Shortly after resigning at Brown, Hornig returned to Harvard as a professor and adviser, and later served as chair of the Department of Environmental Health and Physiology from 1988 to 1990.
After more than a half-decade of scrutiny at Brown, Harvard was a relief for Hornig, Brain said. Hornig was able to think creatively and collaboratively, and ultimately founded the Interdisciplinary Programs in Health, bringing the top minds in science to work on interdisciplinary public and environmental health issues.
“It was very telling to me that he came back to the School of Public Health and really saw public health and environmental health as a place where he really wanted to leave his mark as he approached the end of his career after all the opportunities and experiences he had,” said Douglas W. Dockery, chair of the Department of Environmental Health and Physiology at HSPH.
Hornig was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships. He was also one of the youngest members ever elected to the National Academy of Sciences.
Hornig is survived by his wife Lilli, a Harvard-trained chemist and also a member of the Los Alamos team. After working to develop the bomb, she became a member of the Brown faculty and championed women’s rights.

The Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs announced Tuesday that Gary S. Samore, White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism under President Barack Obama, has been tapped to lead the center as its executive director.
“Gary Samore is an outstanding choice for the Belfer Center executive director position,” said Samore’s predecessor, Army Brigadier General Kevin Ryan. “He has exceptional academic credentials and experience in leading research institutions and of course he is a distinguished alumnus of the Belfer Center.”
Samore worked briefly at the Belfer Center after graduating with a Ph.D. in government from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1984. Since then, he has held a variety of research and governmental posts and has worked for both the Clinton and Obama administrations.
“Gary Samore is the very model of a Belfer Center professional,” Center Director Graham T. Allison ’62 said in a press release. “We count ourselves fortunate that one of the nation’s leaders in both thought and action on the core issues of the Center’s agenda will bring his rich experience to our community.”
In the Obama White House, Samore advised the president on matters concerning arms control, WMD proliferation, and terrorism.  His position under President Obama came after he played a key role in negotiating the end of North Korea’s nuclear program as President Bill Clinton’s Special Assistant and Senior Director for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls at the National Security Council.
Samore continued his negotiation efforts under President Obama, helping to contract the New START arms control agreement with Russia. His Obama-era resume also includes efforts to battle terrorism and quash Iranian nuclear ambitions.
When he arrives in Cambridge, Samore’s obligations will be more academic in nature. Along with co-chairing the Iran Nuclear Negotiations Working Group and managing and advising the Belfer Center’s research plans, he will also conduct his own research.
After Samore assumes his position, Ryan will preside over new programs on defense and intelligence at the Belfer Center. Ryan expressed optimism about the prospect of Samore’s return.
“We’re excited to have him back,” Ryan said.

Harvard University President Drew G. Faust attended the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week, sharing her thoughts on the future of higher education and women in economic leadership with high-profile leaders and thinkers from around the world.
During what Harvard’s Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Christine M. Heenan called “three very tightly packed days,” Faust sat on two panels and met with University alumni.
Faust, who is the first woman to serve as president of Harvard, used her time during the discussion “Women in Economic Decision-Making” primarily to reflect on how she has come to perceive her role as the University’s first female leader.
“I don’t want to serve with an asterisk next to my name, as if I got a special identity or special category,” she said. “Instead, I wanted to be the president of Harvard who happened also to be a woman.”
Faust said that after being appointed University president, she received letters from women around the world inspired by her accomplishments. This attention, she said, led her to think about how to use her platform at Harvard to bolster the education of women worldwide.
When Faust travels, she said she makes a point to “always go to girls’ schools and meet with young women and talk to them about their aspirations.”
The “Women in Economic Decision-Making” panel also included other prominent women from around the world, including Christine M. O. Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, the chief operating officer of Facebook. This was the second consecutive year that the WEF has held a plenary session focused on women.
The second panel in which Faust participated was a discussion on the future of higher education.
In one of several media interviews given by Faust in Davos, she told Indian broadcasting network New Delhi Television that education was an important topic for the conference because of its connection to economic success.
“I think education has enormous prominence in the minds of people here at Davos and in the minds of leaders around the world, because knowledge is the currency of the 21st century,” she said.
While abroad, Faust also co-hosted a reception for Harvard alumni with Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 and attended meetings with the Global University Leaders Forum, a network of the WEF that includes academic leaders from around the world.
Last week marked the fourth time that Faust has taken part in the conference, which she also attended in 2008, 2010, and 2012.

Among crowded classrooms and stacks of syllabi, professors outlining their collaboration policies have become a common theme of opening lectures.
Before shopping period began on Monday, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris reminded faculty members that they are required to include an explanation of their collaboration policies on course syllabi, Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement.
The start of the semester arrived less than a week after Harvard administrators announced that they had concluded their investigation of the Government 1310 cheating scandal and reached verdicts for the approximately 125 students involved.
On Monday, students who shopped Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation” heard an explicit explanation of what was and was not acceptable collaboration. Assistant government professor Dustin Tingley said he followed the administration’s recommendation to detail his policy precisely on the syllabus and then briefly went over the protocol in class.
“I certainly gave it front and center attention, and I think that’s attention it deserves, just so that there is clarity between faculty and students on the rules of the class,” Tingley said.
Adam M. Butensky ’13 said that students in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology 90: “Classic Experiments in Developmental Biology” had a discussion with professor Douglas A. Melton about collaboration during the first lecture.
Butensky noted other classes he had shopped did not bring up their policies in lecture, even though all instructors were required to include it in their syllabi.
For his class Linguistics 107: “Introduction to Indo-European,” professor Jay H. Jasanoff dedicated a paragraph of the syllabus to his policy, which states that students may collaborate on homework assignments but not on take-home exams.
“[A collaboration policy is] obviously important, and it’s more important because there has been this cheating scandal,” said Jasanoff, who drew attention to his rules during the first lecture. “It’s good to spell it out explicitly.”
Though Caroline Light, the professor of United States in the World 26: “Sex and the Citizen: Race, Gender, and Belonging in the United States,” did not devote class time to explain her policy, she made her statement a prominent feature on the course’s iSite and syllabus. She also encouraged her students to spend time reading the policy.
“Hopefully that will signal to students that I take these things very seriously,” Light said.
Light’s policy describes the importance of students’ understanding the definition of plagiarism and encourages them to ask for help if they are ever in doubt of their citations.
Tingley said the new emphasis on collaboration speaks to the dedication of professors to their students.
“I think a lot of faculty really care about the best teaching practices, and I think this just highlights our commitment to that,” Tingley said.

Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino will announce a proposal to bring edX—the rapidly growing online education venture started by Harvard and MIT last spring—to the Boston community, according to a draft of his State of the City address, which he is slated to deliver on Tuesday night.
 
Envisioned as BostonX, the initiative will be launched first in neighborhood community centers and will then expand to high school classrooms and public libraries, the Boston Globe first reported early Tuesday morning. 
Part of the plan includes expanding the program, currently structured around online courses for individuals, to facilitate a community-based group learning experience.
BostonX locations will host virtual and in-person meetings with affiliated university or community college faculty, staff, and graduate students. They will also provide training on how to use the edX system, career counseling, and job transitioning programs.
 
EdX already has a large presence in the Greater Boston area. Since being launched by Harvard and MIT, the program has expanded to include courses from Wellesley College. Bunker Hill Community College and MassBay Community College have also partnered with edX to use its educational materials.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 30, 2013, at 2:30 a.m.
The National Football League Players Association has issued Harvard Medical School a $100 million grant to establish a 10-year research initiative aimed at finding solutions to players’ health problems.
“We are excited about the contributions this extraordinary partnership will make to NFL players, the community, and the knowledge base of medicine,” Ross D. Zafonte, head of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the Medical School, said in a statement.
Zafonte and Lee M. Nadler, dean for clinical and translational research at the Medical School, will lead the initiative, entitled Harvard Integrated Program to Protect and Improve the Health of NFLPA Members.
More than one dozen lawsuits have been filed by former NFL players against the league, claiming that the NFL withheld information about the potential negative health consequences of playing in the league.
These lawsuits—in addition to the multiple widely publicized suicides of former and active NFL players—have drawn unprecedented public attention to the possible long-term health repercussions of playing in the NFL. These can include brain damage, heart problems, and diabetes, according to the program’s overview.
Alvaro Pascual-Leone, professor of neurology and associate director of the initiative, said that NFL players face physical and public stresses that call for focused research on their health.
“At the end of the day, you have unique individuals going through a very unique life,” he said.
Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier said in a statement that the expansive program announced Tuesday will enlist a variety of doctors and scientists from the Medical School, Harvard-affiliated hospitals, and other schools across the University.
“We are committed to going beyond our walls,” he said. “We will reach out to other institutions when necessary in order to access the resources needed to solve the most pressing medical issues identified by the NFLPA.”
Central to the initiative is a study of 1,000 retired football players that will produce a “biological profile of illness” for each player. Scientists will use the results of that unprecedented project to design methods to prevent and diagnose health problems. The researchers will also seek to design new methods of treating concussion-related brain damage, develop a technique to regrow ACL tissue, and produce more comprehensive images of heart function.
According to William P. Meehan ’58, director of the Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention and associate director of the initiative, some parts of the project are ready to be launched immediately while others will require more development before being implemented.
“This is a long-term commitment,” he said. “A gargantuan task.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 30, 2013, at 3:10 a.m.
Yet another election season is poised to begin in the Commonwealth Wednesday as Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 is expected to appoint an interim Senator to replace John F. Kerry, who resigned from his post Tuesday after easily winning Senate confirmation to become the next Secretary of State.
While multiple individuals, including former Patrick chief of staff William Cowan and Victoria R. Kennedy, the wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, have been rumored as front runners for the appointment, Patrick has gone out of his way to suggest that he will appoint either a woman or a person of color to the post. Former Congressman Barnett “Barney” Frank ’61-’62 also has expressed interest in the post.
As in 2010, when he appointed Paul G. Kirk, Jr. ’60 to the seat vacated after the death of Senator Kennedy on the condition that Kirk not run in the special election, Patrick has said that he is looking for a “wise steward of the interest of the people of the Commonwealth while we wait for the people to elect a Senator.”
With the April 30 primaries preceding the approaching June 25 special election, two Democrats are gearing up for the race. In December, Fifth Congressional Representative Edward J. Markey, who has served in Congress since 1976, threw his hat into the ring. And Eighth District Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School who has served the South Boston area on Capitol Hill since 2001, is expected to declare his candidacy on Thursday, the Boston Globe reported on Tuesday.
Markey has emerged as the frontrunner after racking up endorsements from many influential Massachusetts Democrats, including Kerry and Victoria R. Kennedy. Still, Lynch’s connections to labor are a potential game changer. A former president of the Iron Workers Local 7 union, he is considered the favorite to earn the endorsement of the AFL-CIO if it chooses to endorse a candidate in the primary.
“[Lynch] has an awful lot of long-term commitments and friendships in labor,” Mass. AFL-CIO president Steven A. Tolman told the Globe. “We grew up with him.”
On the Republican side, former Senator Scott Brown, who lost his seat last November to Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, has long been expected to run, but has not yet announced a decision. While many politically connected experts expect Brown to declare his candidacy after Patrick announces his appointment, others are less sure.
“If he was inclined to run I think that would be clear right now, but there haven’t been any signals,” said Republican strategist Todd Domke. “And that’s definitely discouraging to Republicans.”
Strategists have said that if Brown were to decide not to run, it would almost certainly be in an effort to extend his political shelf life.
“I think this is a case where he realizes that if he runs now and loses, that really his career is probably over,” said Joseph D. Malone ’78, a former Massachusetts treasurer and one-time Republican congressional candidate. “He might be deciding between running now, when the Republican label on a federal level is hurting him, or running later, when he can look at corruption in the State House and run against that.”
If Brown decides against entering the special election, former Governor William F. Weld ’66 would be a likely GOP candidate. Weld, who hinted that he would like to see Brown replace Kerry, has extensive experience in Massachusetts politics. In addition to serving as governor for six years, he ran for Senate in 1996 and has remained influential in state Republican politics.
“[Weld] is still pretty popular and has run for Senate before,” Domke told the Boston Globe this weekend. “With his quirky sense of humor, candor, and unpredictability, he’d be a fun candidate.”
The history of Senate special elections in Massachusetts is both rich and brief. Until 2004, the governor held the power to appoint a senator to serve out the remainder of a vacated term. That year, at the urging of Senator Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts State Legislature changed the law so that Republican Governor Mitt Romney would not be able to appoint a Republican senator in the event that Kerry was elected president.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With co-captain Christian Webster impersonating Reggie Miller and freshman guard Siyani Chambers making acrobatic layups, there’s understandable euphoria surrounding the Crimson’s athletic backcourt. Chambers, Webster and sophomore Wesley Saunders—a six-foot five athletic combo guard—notched 54 of the Crimson’s 82 points in Saturday’s contest against Dartmouth. Junior sharpshooter Laurent Rivard, another six-foot five wing who plays behind the arc, is a tremendous shooter who adds to the potency of the group.
The Crimson are second in the nation overall in three-point shooting percentage and play a Gregg Popovich-type offense with shooters everywhere. This forces defenders to come out on shooters, allowing Saunders and Chambers to use their length and speed to get past defenders to the hoop. If the defense crashes on the driving man, he can swing a pass to one of the team’s four combo guards, each shooting over 36 percent from three. If the defender doesn’t leave his man, that leaves Saunders or Chambers against a big, a matchup coach Tommy Amaker would take any day.
 
However, Saturday’s most important players may have been lost in the shuffle. Sophomore forwards Jonah Travis and Steve Moundou-Missi quietly made the comeback possible. While the quartet of guards each average more than 30 minutes a game, Moundou-Missi and Travis form a platoon at center. On Saturday, they combined for 21 points, 12 rebounds, two steals, and only two missed shots on 12 attempts. To put this in perspective, Travis scored one less point on nine 2-pointers than the rest of the team did on its combined three-point tries (5 for 21 on the day).
 
Of course, without Chambers’ play or Webster’s clutch threes we’d be wondering why Harvard has a 1-1 record against the league’s worst team of 2011. But the same could be said of Travis’s 10 first-half points or Moundou-Missi’s and-one with 90 seconds left in overtime.  The sophomore big men kept the game close despite the Crimson’s absymal shooting numbers (one shot made in 10 attempts outside the paint).
 
Moundou-Missi and Travis provide even more on defense: size. Saunders, Webster, and Chambers are all quick and lengthy on-ball defenders that allow the Crimson to pressure opposing guards into turnovers, but this trio puts the team at a height disadvantage. When Rivard plays alongside those three, that leaves the Crimson on-court squad with only one player listed above six-five. Thus, it’s imperative that the team protects the bucket inside. In years past, Kyle Casey and Keith Wright anchored the middle for the Crimson; this year, the onus falls on Travis and Moundou-Missi to protect the paint.
Although undersized for their positions, the sophomore big men fight hard and were key Saturday in deterring guards from charging into the paint. Sure, the Dartmouth guards recorded 29 points, but let’s look inside these numbers. They needed a combined 25 shots and 11 free throws to get there—not terribly efficient. The opposing trio also combined for two made layups all game, evidence of a good job protecting the paint. Furthermore, six of the 29 points came on threes and six more on end-of-game free throws, shots that Travis and Moundou-Missi can’t affect.
 
In addition to anchoring the defense, Travis and Moundou-Missi fulfill another job for the Crimson. In the Crimson’s offense, the bigs need to be mobile when the team gets out and running. Both players use their quickness to outmaneuver larger, slower bigs (see Travis’ 19 points and five steals against a big St. Mary’s frontcourt or 14 points and two steals against Boston College). Harvard is at its best when the big men get out on quick outlets and allow Chambers to get running
 
Chambers has received plenty of well-deserved praise in the absence of departed senior Brandyn Curry.  This is not totally unexpected, though, as the freshman is a former Minnesota Mr. Basketball.  On the other hand, finding replacements for Keith Wright and Kyle Casey has been a pleasant surprise. The duo of Moundou-Missi and Travis has flourished this year, combining for 16.1 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 2 steals per game. Their impact was felt in a big way Saturday, and for the Crimson to achieve their postseason goals, it will need to be once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than two minutes to go in regulation, it was safe to say that Christian Webster was not having the game of his life.
The senior guard was a lackluster one for six from long range that afternoon, and the Crimson had found itself facing a double-digit deficit against Dartmouth, a squad that Harvard had a much easier time handling just two weeks ago in a 75-65 victory.
But the tide turned just when it seemed that all hope was lost. Down by 10, Webster rolled off a series off three long-range buckets in the final minutes of regulation to spur a late comeback victory for the Crimson. 
“I haven’t been a part of something like that since the Brown game a couple of years ago,” the co-captain said, referencing Harvard’s comeback from a 22-point halftime deficit in the 2010-2011 season. “It was just ridiculous. I’m at a loss for words.”
The Crimson had trailed Dartmouth for all but the first minute of play, as the team quickly found itself down 12-4.
“They were playing their best ball for every facet of the game,” Webster said. “They were beating us on the backboard, their big guys were driving, getting easy shots [off]. Our shots weren’t falling, obviously. We were just missing shots, and they were making shots.”
A poor shooting performance from some of its key players left Harvard down 29-20 at the end of the first half. The start of the second seemed no different, as the Crimson failed to keep pace with its opponent and fell behind by as many as 13.
Webster himself came up empty-handed for most of regulation. An early three-point jumper followed by a free throw in the eighth minute of play were Webster’s only points of the contest, and he was scoreless the rest of the game heading into the final minutes of play. 
When the team needed its captain most, Webster stepped up. 
Since being named co-captain earlier this season, the senior has proven integral to the Crimson’s success thus far. Webster has been as much a leader on the court as he has been off it, averaging  32 minutes of playing time and over eight points per contest.
This occasion was no different, as the Crimson saw its co-captain step up and lead the comeback charge. Following a turnover and a Dartmouth timeout, Webster hit his first trey off an assist by freshman Siyani Chambers, cutting the Crimson’s deficit to seven with 1:33 to go.
“Like a lot of shooters and scorers, if they make one, all of the sudden they’re calm, they’re confident,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s exactly what happened.”
But despite two free throws by Laurent Rivard and a layup by Chambers, the Crimson still sat six points down with 0:47 to go. Webster stepped up again and hit another three-point jumper off an assist by sophomore Wesley Saunders with 0:41 left, bringing Harvard within a single possession of tying the game. 
A pair of Big Green free throws seemingly pulled Dartmouth out of reach. That did not last long, though. Webster’s third bucket from downtown, this time with 0:32 to go, brought the Crimson within two and the packed Lavieties’ crowd to its feet.
“Christian’s shots were amazing, for him to hit those threes,” Amaker said. “It was obvious that we did some incredible things down the stretch there to gain momentum, the confidence to push through, and to close.”
The co-captain’s three buckets sparked Harvard’s comeback run, and a layup by Chambers tied the game in regulation. After the break, the Crimson hit the ground running, pulling away by as many as seven before finally closing with an 82-77 victory.
“It was impressive, how they dug it out,” Amaker said.
The win helped Harvard preserve its perfect 2-0 start to conference play. If not for Harvard's clutch, crunch-time play, Dartmouth would have set a poor precedent for visiting Ancient Eight opponents.
“We had to do things right, and things that we practiced,” Amaker said. “And our kids believed in it. We were confident that we would pull through. I’m very pleased for our team, and [it was] a sensational win for our program.”

Despite all its pluses and perks, shopping period does present Harvard students with one potential problem: buyer's remorse. While students filing into course book mainstays like Ec10 and LS1b pretty much know what to expect from the semester, nothing screams caveat emptor quite like the words "New Course" (and the telltale lack of a Q score) next to a class name. But new courses aren't all bad. Sometimes, when we're lucky, they can even offer us a chance to snag a gem of a class before word gets out and the whole shebang is lotteried the following year. So, for those daring students who are eager to plunge into the great unknown (or who couldn't get into Maria Tatar's fairy tales class), here are five new courses that we at Flyby think you might want to check out.
Culture and Belief 56: "The Culture of Capitalism"
 
Occupy Wall Street is so last season. Rediscover what made capitalism cool (or at least culturally significant) in the first place with a look at works as diverse as those of Adam Smith, Benjamin Franklin, Charlie Chaplin, and Ayn Rand.
English 90ad: "American Detective Fiction: Seminar"
 
Britain may have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and, alas, Benedict Cumberbatch), but America has the likes of Edgar Allan Poe, Raymond Chandler, and Chester Himes, whose works are all likely to be investigated in this course that seeks "to develop an understanding of detective fiction" and "to explore the relationship between reading and investigating by considering how stories turn us into literary detectives."
 
History 79j: "The Oldest Profession? A Global History of Sex Work, 1750-the Present"
 
If the title alone isn't enough to pique your interest, perhaps course subjects like patriotic prostitutes, sex tourism, and venereal diseases will.
History of Science 125: "'Moneyball' Nation: Science and the Making of Modern America"
 
If Brad Pitt's Moneyball was your favorite film of 2011, perhaps this will be your favorite course of 2013. By looking at the increasing popularity of both formal clinical trials and the "Moneyball" technique in baseball, this course makes math fun and explores "how and why Americans have come to believe mathematics solves complicated problems, even in seemingly unrelated moral, political, and social domains." Unfortunately, Jonah Hill does not TF.
Societies of the World 49: "The Worlds of Business in Modern China"
 
Everyone knows that everyone says the Chinese economy is taking over the world. Perhaps this class can help you prepare for it (and knock out a Gen Ed credit along the way) with topics that range from the age of tea and the opium trade to "How Microsoft Conquered China." Our sources tell us this one may be crowded.

Despite grumblings from students weary of HUDS' offerings, there may be some among us endowed with a rare appreciation for the tantalizing triumph of tomato basil ravioli soup. "Surely the Science Center burritos warrant a Michelin three star rating!" they say. For these believers, the recent accolades Crimson cuisine has attracted from gourmands comes as a sweet reprieve from the surrounding claims of inedibility.
 
"Food and Wine," a magazine devoted to cutting-edge cuisine, has included Harvard in its list of the best "Universities for Food Lovers." In an entry entitled "Gastronauts in Training," the magazine praises the Gen Ed course Science of the Physical Universe 27: "Science of Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter." (The class jets in avant-garde chefs from around the world to explain the physics and chemistry behind their state-of-the-art dishes.)
 
But that's not all. In fact, Harvard food seems to be on a roll with butter. In November, The Daily Meal ranked it 12th in its list of the "52 Best Colleges for Food in America."
 However, we at Flyby don’t quite see the foodie's paradise that "Food and Wine" describes. While students in Science of Cooking may indeed whip up some incredible "haute cuisine," the food served up in Harvard dining halls is just hot at best. We don’t see any of Ferran Adrià's legendary culinary foam appearing on the menu anytime soon. And the only soft matter in the servery is the sweet potato casserole.
 
Nevertheless, bon appétit. May tonight's red velvet fro yo satisfy your every foodie dream!

Congressman Stephen F. Lynch, who has represented the South Boston area since winning office in a 2001 special election, will launch a campaign for the Senate seat vacated Tuesday by new Secretary of State John F. Kerry, the Boston Globe is reporting.
The Globe report cited a source close to Lynch who confirmed that the Congressman has reserved an event space from the Local 7 ironworkers union. The location is fitting for Lynch, a former president of the Local 7 and a candidate who will rely on his ties to organized labor.
Although Congressman Edward J. Markey, of the Fifth District, has polled better than Lynch and has earned many important endorsements, including those of Kerry and Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Lynch's relationship with labor has the potential to be game changing. Steven Tolman, the president of the influential AFL-CIO union, estimated to the Globe last week that Lynch already has the support of about half of the union’s members. According to Tolman, A candidate wins the AFL-CIO endorsement if he or she has the support of two-thirds of the membership.
While the union has not yet decided if it will endorse a Democrat in the primary, which is set to occur six weeks before the June 25 special election, it is certain that Lynch would be the favorite for the nod. "He has an awful lot of long-term commitments and friendships in labor," Tolman told the Globe. "We grew up with him."
Still, it may be an uphill battle for Lynch, whose conservative positions on social issues differentiate him not only from Markey, but also from many Massachusetts liberal democrats.
A member of the House Financial Services committee, Lynch is a graduate of the Wentworth Institute of Technology, the Boston College Law School, and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
