After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday, April 13 at 7 p.m., avid readers and family members filled the Grolier Poetry Book Shop to listen to four poets — Jennifer Franklin, Jennifer Jean, Dzvinia Orlowsky, and Anne Elizabeth Pluto. Beyond poets, these four women are also editors, teachers, and translators. Although their creations differ in style and deliverance, a common message lies within each of their poetry collections. Each poet grapples with loss, pain, and the inheritance of suffering.
A sense of determination and the assertion that poetry can save the world vibrated through the air as speaker Fred Marchant introduced each poet individually. He read excerpts from the four poets’ works that he loved, weaving together a powerful narrative of resilience before the reading even began.
Jennifer Franklin, a New York-based poet and the Program Director at the Hudson Valley Writers’ Center, opened the night with a reading from her new poetry collection, “If Some God Shakes Your House.” Franklin read several prose poems and sonnets that radiated courage and human connection as the speaker tried to find truth in the midst of tragedy. She read a series of poems titled “As Antigone” after Sophocles’ character Antigone, whose human predicament and fervent defense of the truth is paralleled in Franklin’s collection. With a soft voice and a slow rhythm, Franklin delivered eight poems that explored themes of death, love, motherhood, and her experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Second to speak was Jennifer Jean, who currently lives in Massachusetts but grew up in California’s San Fernando Valley. She is the founder of Free2Write, a series of poetry workshops for those suffering from trauma inclduing sexual abuse, exploitation, and human trafficking. Jean’s collection “Voz” is a work of ekphrastic poetry — a literary and vivid description of a work of art that is so expressive the reader can imagine it in detail. Instead of using visual art, Jean puts music at the center of her poems to create an immersive audio experience, drawing inspiration from the Eagles rock band, an album cover of Bob Seger’s and the Silver Bullet Band “Against The Wind”, and the song “We Will Rock You” by Queen.
“The kinds of poems in this book act not as a playlist, but a soundtrack for my life,” Jean said.
She wants each of her poems to feel as though life is occurring with a soundtrack going in the background.
In between poems, Jean took a moment to thank the Grolier family and the audience for allowing her to share her voice, a sentiment shared by the four poets.
“What happens when you open up your voices? You’re vulnerable. But what’s interesting, being here in this room — and I believe what was called in the beginning a sacred space — it just feels okay,” she said, smiling.
Jean’s poems touch upon themes of courage, family, and the awareness of what humanity chooses to create. She delivered her free verse poems in a strong and powerful voice, contrasting the quiet yet hopeful atmosphere Franklin had previously created. At moments, the audience erupted in laughter at her repeated, sarcastic use of the phrase “fuck you.”
As the night progressed, the last two poets — Dzvinia Orlowsky and Anne Elizabeth Pluto — spoke about the history of war in Ukraine. A sense of melancholy overtook the shop as it became increasingly clear that the suffering experienced in the past still exists today, wreaking havoc on people’s lives. Before Orlowsky began her reading, she reminisced on her first book signing in 1994 in the Grolier Poetry Book Shop, three years after Ukraine had declared their independence.
“So fast forward. My son obviously is older and is moving to Boston by the end of the summer. And my daughter is here in the audience and I don’t have her on my hip. And Ukraine is still fighting for its independence,” Orlwosky said.
Marchant pointed out the necessity of Orlowsky and Pluto’s writing, which highlights the hope that lies within darkness.
“What characterizes Dzvinia Orlowsky's poetry is her willingness, her artistic willingness, to stay with that image or narrative long enough until the heart is touched,” Marchant said. “Anne Pluto’s poetry is a conjuring of the dead, a conjuring of them to life.”
Orlowsky and Pluto’s unique poetic styles exposed political injustices and addressed Putin’s damaging effect on society. With a similar emotional delivery, both poets conveyed the struggle of dealing with the intergenerational transmission of trauma.
After Pluto finished her last poem, a work from her collection “The Deepest Part of Dark,” the audience applauded. Within a single hour, the four poets’ inspiring reflections seemed to leave the audience with a willingness to find their own voices, and the assurance that their words could one day touch others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Harvard University Administration,
On April 3, Harvard University Police Department officers stormed the dorm room of four Black students at approximately 4:15 a.m. in response to an unfounded phone call. We are writing this letter because we strongly believe that the University’s response to the swatting incident reflects a deep investment in protecting a false institutional image over a sincere commitment to the well-being of the Black students targeted and the Black community as a whole.
The swatting incident served as a harsh reminder of the persistent struggles Black students face within an institution that has historically upheld white supremacy and the oppression of Black people both nationally and globally. The ill-intent behind the swatting call makes poignant the ways racism both informs and amplifies the numerous adversarial situations that Black students are met with the moment they step foot on campus.
We assert that Black students should not have to live in fear of the police force being used as a weapon against them. We condemn the University’s failure to, at large, protect its Black community’s emotional and physical wellbeing in the aftermath of such trauma.
We demand that the University take action to repair the manifestations of the inaction and to ensure that the victims of the phone call are served justice, the safety of Black Harvard students is maintained, and that in future incidents, the mistakes from this situation are not repeated.
Moving forward, we call on Harvard University leadership and administration to take the following actions to support the targeted students and the broader Black student community at large:
1) We demand that University leaders issue a comprehensive, institution-wide statement across all schools addressing the swatting incident and explicitly name the significant racial impact on both the targeted Black students and the larger Black community.
2) We demand that University and HUPD officials fulfill their obligation to deliver justice for the targeted students and conduct a thorough investigation that centers their humanity rather than institutional interests.
3) We demand that Harvard University improves transparency and promotes accountability in its campus policing and HUPD operations by granting access to police reports and regular updates on ongoing investigations to those directly involved.
4) We demand that the University implement proactive mental health responses to incidents of racial trauma.
5) We demand that Harvard hold an in-person, University-wide town hall for students to speak directly to leadership, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow, President-elect Claudine Gay, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and other top leaders to discuss Harvard’s handling of issues of racial policing and HUPD protocol.
Black students at Harvard University demand urgent action. We request an immediate meeting with the University administration and a written response to our demands by April 23, the start date of Visitas.
If this request is not met, the undersigned Black student organizations of Harvard University will stage a demonstration during Visitas. We will not wait for justice and will take all necessary measures to ensure that the University is held accountable for its inaction in addressing the ongoing racial trauma and injustices inflicted on Black students.
Brian A. Cromwell Jr. ’23 is an Economics concentrator in Kirkland House and the co-Chair of the Harvard Undergraduate Black Community Leaders. Ebony Joy Johnson is a second-year Master in Divinity Studies student at the Harvard Divinity School and the President of the Harvard Black Graduate Student Alliance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent years have seen an undeniable decline in relative enrollment in humanities majors in colleges around the country. The causes of this trend are multiple, but a tempting explanation is students’ increasing desire for a practical, pre-professional education that prepares for the world beyond.
Intuitively, medical schools seem to offer just this type of education. Medicine is a technical, knowledge intensive field that requires specific skills. The attendant style of education is similarly narrow.
This model of medical education was established after the 1910 publication of the Flexner Report, a 364 page-long landmark report that transformed medical education in the United States and Canada. Following the report’s recommendations, medical schools across the country adopted a “two plus two” model. For two years, students learn basic science in a classroom setting. Then, they spend the next two years rotating through clinical experiences. The resulting model is one that has dominated medical education for years.
Surprisingly, though, some medical schools, including Harvard Medical School, have recently eschewed this style of education. In 2015, HMS reformed its curriculum. Called “Pathways,” the new model of education at HMS shortened the initial classroom experience from twenty four to fourteen months. Instead of lectures and rote memorization, this initial “pre-clerkship” phase now teaches students how to think rigorously. Important medical knowledge is taught through videos and readings assigned outside of class, while class time involves groups of four to five students working together to solve difficult problems.
To learn more about this disruption of conventional medical education, I spoke to Elizabeth L. Roux ’19, an M.D. candidate at HMS.
“I think HMS teaches you [...] how to think,” she told me. “When I was applying, they made a big deal about that, where they were like, ‘We’re going to teach you how to clinically reason, and we’re going to less so teach you how to pass your board exams. We’re not going to teach to the test.’”
Of course, no amount of critical thinking exercises or classroom reforms are going to take away the element of specialized, intensive information absorption that is required for medical school. While it’s exciting to learn this material, Roux told me, “There’s a disinterest in it, because it doesn’t feel directly correlated to clinical care.”
“It’s hard to understand how important it is to learn that unless you’re interacting with patients a lot,” Roux said.
Perhaps as a way to preemptively address this complaint, HMS emphasizes patient exposure in its curriculum. During the pre-clerkship phase, HMS students spend every other Wednesday morning working at a primary-care office, giving them reason to value their more information-heavy classes. After pre-clerkship, HMS further facilitates these interactions with the Principal Clinical Experience phase. For 12 months, students participate in clinical rotations that expose them to a variety of medical fields.
“I think HMS really values having clinical experience pretty early on, so we get to see patients during our first week of school,” said Roux. “It’s very grounding, and perspective building, to get to have that clinical exposure up close.”
This mission of broad intellectual formation, as opposed to tedious absorption of information, has its parallel at the College. If you’re an undergraduate interested in working at Goldman Sachs after graduation, Harvard won’t allow you to major in finance as other schools might. Instead, curricular requirements at the College force finance-oriented students into a variety of fields, many of which may have nothing to do with their career aspirations.
Yet do students at the College graduate having learned “how to think” in the same way, per Roux’s assessment, that students at HMS do?
Two years ago, Harvard revamped its General Education program.  Now, students must take one class in each of four categories: Aesthetics and Culture; Histories, Societies, Individuals; Science and Technology in Society; and Ethics and Civics.
Many of these classes are incredibly valuable. The two I’ve taken — “Justice” with Government professor Michael J. Sandel and “Evolving Morality: From Primordial Soup to Superintelligent Machines” with Psychology professor Joshua D. Greene — have been some of the most engaging and thought-provoking classes I’ve taken at Harvard thus far. Yet I’d be lying if I said they didn’t fall at the bottom of my class priority list each of those semesters.
Though many of these Gen Ed courses aim to offer accessible exposure to urgent problems and enduring questions, they often end up instead serving as padding classes that require relatively little work. The General Education program — the center of the College’s effort to provide a broad liberal arts education — has degenerated into an opportunity for students to take easy classes to boost their grade point average.
If the College wants to fulfill its mission of providing an intellectually transformative experience beyond narrow professional learning, it cannot be afraid to completely reform its curriculum á la HMS. The “cornerstone” of the Harvard College curriculum (as the Gen Ed program is officially presented) should not be experienced by undergraduates in the form of four lecture-based gems. Instead, each of these courses must truly encourage students to think critically and engage with the material.
How does the HMS curriculum accomplish this? It does so in three ways: shifting lecture-style information absorption outside of class time, emphasizing work in smaller groups, and relying on student motivation. The College should adopt all three of these approaches.
With its previous curriculum, HMS faculty noticed a failure in lecture style teaching. In a 2015 interview with Harvard Magazine, Richard Schwartzstein, a pulmonologist and professor at HMS, said that part of the inspiration for changing the HMS curriculum was a sense among faculty that students resisted the lecture format, choosing to memorize material by watching videos of the lecture at double speed rather than engaging critically and thoughtfully with the subject.
His account sounds eerily descriptive of many of the courses I’m taking right now. Instead of resigning to the belief that some information-dense courses must be taught through a lecture format, the College should follow the lead of HMS and work to move this memorization component outside of the classroom — a “flipped” approach to learning that some students have already begun to advocate for.
Secondly, when in class, HMS ensures everyone participates actively by prioritizing collaboration between small groups. Usually, teams of four to six students will work together to solve difficult problems and present their findings to the rest of the class. This emphasis on small group work forces students to actively engage with the content rather than nod off in the back of the lecture hall.
The College should follow suit. This could mean limiting the size of Gen Ed courses, as Columbia does with its Core Curriculum requirements. It could also mean prioritizing group or section-style exercises in class instead of lecturing.
Thirdly, HMS relies on student motivation. The shift to the new Pathways curriculum would have amounted to nothing if students didn’t have the motivation and intellectual curiosity to take advantage of the opportunities offered by professors and courses.
Likewise, any new curriculum that the College offers will be useless if we continue to game it for our own short term benefit. As others have pointed out, we need to find for ourselves the intrinsic value of learning. This means leaving our comfort zones and making the effort to take classes we find genuinely interesting  rather than those that historically have required little work.
HMS should not necessarily be the model of a proper undergraduate education. Its situation is a unique one. The practice of medicine is an information-heavy and memorization-intense one; at the same time, it’s also inherently practical, personal, and outward-facing. It requires a unique style of education to adequately prepare students for work in such a field.
Yet there is still much we at the College can learn from medical education. Many of the problems HMS faced in the past are those that the College faces today. The College, both its administrators and its students, should not forget that secluded Longwood campus and the lessons it has to offer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a 1966 booklet called “College Admissions and the Public Interest,” B. Alden Thresher, the first ever director of admissions at MIT, laid out two approaches to higher education: the “poetic” and the “utilitarian.” While “utilitarian” students were “impelled by practical considerations,” their “poetic” counterparts took “innate pleasure” in learning.
Well, Harvard poets are now few and far between: As of 2022, more than forty percent of working seniors go into either consulting or finance. That number jumps to 58 percent when you add in the technology sector. By comparison, employment in the nonprofit or public service sector sits below four percent.
Many articles have bemoaned this trend of students “selling out,” but few have taken the time to quantitatively assess its origin. In this piece, I’m trying to do precisely that. I’m not intending to denigrate anyone’s career choices; I’m hoping to present a nonjudgmental sociological explanation.
As Harvard transitioned from a patrician school to a seemingly meritocratic one, students increasingly began to view their degrees as financial investments, attempting to maximize return while limiting downside risk. It is this new, pecuniary approach to one’s college education that is to blame for the vertiginous increase in consultants and bankers.
When Thresher was writing in the 1960s, Harvard was mostly white and rich. The school has, thankfully, diversified over time, and many point to this newfound diversity as causing the stark rise in students pursuing consulting and finance.
Students that don’t come from familial wealth may be “disinclined to smell the flowers along the way and to take some chances,” said former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
But I think this change is more attributable to the culture of Harvard than to a demographic shift — for a few reasons.
First, as I’ve written, Harvard is still not particularly socioeconomically diverse: Only one-fifth of students come from the bottom 60 percent of the income spectrum. Even if each of these low-income students at Harvard in the 2000s and 2010s went into finance and consulting, that wouldn’t account for all the seniors choosing these career paths.
Second, using data from The Crimson’s senior survey, I looked at whether parental income was correlated with career choice. As you can see, low-income students are comparatively much more likely to go into technology over finance. But the aggregate rate of selling out is about the same — around 60 percent — for all income brackets.
Finally, there’s a tendency to overstate the role of money in students’ careers and ignore the culprit of prestige. The majority of Harvard students graduate debt-free — even English concentrators reported earning a median of six figures ten years after graduation. Meanwhile, a whopping 18 percent of Harvard graduates in 2011 applied to Teach For America, likely due in part to the program’s status and exclusivity.
Although economic diversification may not be to blame for higher levels of selling out, changing admissions over the past 60 years have played an important role. While Harvard hasn’t gotten much more economically diverse, the school’s newfound commitment to meritocracy has set off a rat race that ends at the doors of McKinsey.
Starting in the mid-20th century, Harvard shifted from a finishing school for patricians, to an embodiment of meritocracy — at least in brand.
With today’s roughly 1 in 30 chance of a Harvard acceptance, the hustle starts early. A manic, frantic generation of kids spend fewer hours with friends and more time doing schoolwork, extracurriculars, and volunteering, trying to get into the colleges of their dreams.
But getting into college isn’t the end.
“They’ve been through a highly competitive series of tests and applications, and they want to succeed,” English and Comparative Literature professor James T. Engell ’73 said about Harvard students. “But then they look around and they look at what the measures of success are.”
Having worked so hard to earn their spot here, students begin to chase their next marker of success. Although current undergraduates are still wealthy, their wealth is no longer a guarantee of success in an economy that increasingly values skills over connections.
New York Times writer and former Crimson columnist Ross G. Douthat ’02 describes this trend: “In today’s meritocracy, the family fortune must be reconstituted in every generation. Even if you could live off your parents’ wealth, the ethos of the meritocracy holds that you shouldn’t.”
But something is lost in all this busyness. An undergraduate degree, as Classics professor Richard F. Thomas told me, “is to prepare you to live an examined and meaningful life.” The constant chase of more success seems neither examined nor meaningful.
By the time students get to Harvard, then, academics are often the least of their concerns. Instead, some view college as “a stepping stone rather than an end in itself,” as Engell put it.
“If you go way back in time, when I was here, 1963 to ’67, people were much less focused on their eventual careers,” former Freshman Dean Dingman told me.
Engell concurred: “It’s not that people didn’t think about that 50 years ago — of course they thought about it — but there was not, I think, the near obsession, or in some cases the obsession, with it.”
The clearest example of Harvard’s careerist turn is its extracurriculars. Instead of being a way to “chill” or “get away from the academic stressors,” as Dingman says clubs used to be, student organizations — such as Harvard College Consulting Group and Harvard Financial Analysts Club — increasingly function as pre-professional outlets.
These efforts often come at the expense of classwork, converting even the most poetic student into a utilitarian careerist.
Research shows a long-term, national decline in hours devoted to schoolwork per week by college students. Here, too, Harvard seniors reported spending almost as much time collectively on extracurriculars, athletics, and employment as they spend on their classes. This stands in stark contrast to students’ old priorities.
During Engell’s college years, he said, “it seems to me that the centerpiece for many students — not all — of their experience at Harvard-Radcliffe was the four courses they were taking each term.”
Now, students are “more conservative in course choices,” according to Dingman. Risk-averse careerism has seeped into the choice of classes themselves. Many students now concentrate in fields like Economics or Computer Science to increase their job prospects. Their grades, too, have assumed an outsized importance due to increasingly competitive graduate school applications, according to Engell.
I’ve seen it: My pre-law friend dropped out of a class after receiving a B+ on an essay, for fear of rejection from law school.
This culture of pre-professionalism and risk aversion isn’t just an abstract pall hanging over campus. It’s also embodied by the constant physical presence of recruiters, who promise the job security that students are craving.
The administration is arguably culpable in this process; students have complained that Harvard prioritizes industry jobs at the expense of the public service and nonprofit sector.
Classics professor Thomas joked that “Goldman rents out the faculty club and has people there and has nice hors d’oeuvres and so on, whereas if you’re interested in public service, OCS will maybe have some Goldfish for you to munch on.”
“That difference in worlds and difference in messaging is colossal,” he added.
To Thomas’ point, the Office of Career Services is certainly not at fault for the culture created by recruitment-hungry companies. Ironically, though, the office was recently renamed the Mignone Center for Career Success after a large donation that came in part from an investment management firm partner.
Every part of the recruitment infrastructure is meant to minimize risk. Interviews have moved earlier and earlier, and sophomores now often finish the academic year having already signed an offer for their senior summer. Students can relax knowing that they’ve precommitted, eliminating any career uncertainty.
After all of this — getting into Harvard, joining pre-professional clubs, and doing the recruitment dance — even getting an offer isn’t the end. As Ezra Klein, another New York Times columnist, has argued, it’s precisely the temporary and noncommittal nature of these jobs that makes them attractive to students unsure of their preferred career trajectory.
A case in point: Even though the percentage of Harvard graduates who go into consulting has increased sevenfold since 1969, the amount of students who pursue consulting as a permanent career has stayed relatively stable. The search for success continues.
In transitioning from aristocracy to meritocracy, the ideal of a liberal arts education as a moral and intellectual pursuit was lost along the way. In its stead was left a breathless professionalism, one that instrumentalizes everything in its path for pecuniary gain.
But glimmers of change are starting to appear. Enrollments in humanities classes are still high, even if humanities majors are down. Also, Emanuel Contomanolis, the director of the newly-renamed Mignone Center, wrote to me in an email that Harvard students are increasingly interested in environmentally conscious roles in finance, and consulting for public interest and nonprofits rather than for large private firms.
So, while careerism has arguably put the classroom in the coffin at Harvard, perhaps we can find ways to keep up Thresher’s poetic tradition — even as we continue to sell out.

Orlando Patterson is a Sociology professor who studies race, freedom, and slavery. He served as a special adviser for Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley from 1972 to 1979 and has written several novels.
FM: You were born in Jamaica in 1940 and spent much of your upbringing in the town of May Pen. What was it like to grow up in Jamaica in that time? 
OP: It was a poor little country town in a British colony at the end of an empire. And, it was not a prosperous town. It was surrounded by sugar plantations. In fact, it was the focal point, the market town for all the plantations and farms, little peasant farms around, which came alive at the weekend when the peasants came in to sell their stuff and then died on Saturday nights.
So that was my rather dreary beginnings, looking back.
FM: You described this picture of Jamaica, but do you recall one memory from your boyhood that you treasure? 
OP: There was an extraordinary degree of freedom, which I had as a child growing up.
When you’re growing up in basically a rural area, especially in a poor country, kids are largely on their own. They go to school, come home, and then, I meet my parents and then I’m off. I go visit my friends, I roam around the bush, I go to the river.
The idea of a little kid going by themselves to the river would horrify the typical American parent. I mean, “What?” There are no lifeguards or anything, this is a river. This is my favorite spot, actually going to the river. And so there’s the kind of extreme freedom that you had as a child, which can be dangerous, but if you survive it, it can also be a good thing. It only builds independence.
I had a kind of mischievous sort of childhood. I would raid the mango trees of wealthier people who had these very fancy mangoes, not the common mangoes. Kind of a Huckleberry Finn sort of background.
The schooling was extremely limited. My school was just one lawn shed in which the classes were separated by an easel with a big blackboard. And each class size would have been about between 60 and 70 kids divided by an aisle.
Looking back, I don’t know how they got any teaching done, quite frankly.
But one way in which the teachers kept order was every teacher had a strap, a leather strap, and they were very liberal in whacking the kids if they talked too much.
FM: You have written extensively about the influence of cricket in Jamaica and other former British colonies. How would you describe cricket’s cultural and political significance? 
OP: It was very powerful.
Jamaica, we also were very much involved with cricket more so then when I was growing up, than the situation now, where the sporting world in Jamaica, the focus has shifted from cricket to sprinting. Jamaica has become a world class country in sprinting. That wasn’t the case when I was growing up.
Jamaica is one of the few countries in which the preeminent sporting events are athletes running. All the schools compete and so on. The whole country turns up. It’s similar to the Super Bowl.
When I was growing up, I wanted to be a great cricketer. That was every schoolboy’s dream. Not so anymore. Now, every schoolboy wants to be Usain Bolt.
FM: Have you ever picked up a bat? 
OP: Oh, everybody played.
Of course, it depends on what you call a bat. We had to make our own bat because cricket gear is very expensive. You made your own bat. You’d cut it out of wood or sometimes we use the ball of the coconut tree or dry ball. You knitted your own cricket ball.
You played obsessively during the holidays, on weekends. At school when you get a break, recess, you head for the little pitch, which is just a dust strip.
FM: Do you see any similarities between your students at Harvard and what you were like as an undergraduate? 
OP: No, not much.
When I went to college, at the University of the West Indies, it was a young university then, it was only about 10 years old.
It was based on the British system, so we went around in gowns. Undergraduates had to wear red gowns to lectures.
We were politically extremely engaged in a way in which students here are not. I mean, we were coming of age as the West Indies was coming of age. So, I like to point out that I graduated in 1962, which is the same year that Jamaica graduated to independence.
It is a very intense movement, historically — a great deal of expectation about becoming free politically, but also being able to determine our own economic, social and cultural destiny. And we were among the earliest generation of university students. When I went to college, less than 1 percent of the population went to college.
FM: You graduated from the University of the West Indies in 1962 with a degree in economics. By 1965, you earned your Ph.D. in sociology from the London School of Economics where you wrote your thesis “Sociology of Slavery.” What motivated this interest in researching slavery academically? 
OP: That came naturally. Growing up, as I mentioned, I was surrounded by sugarcane plantations. My little town was the center of the plantation system.
Plantation culture was all around you. And the sugar plantation was the scene of the great tragedy of slavery. Jamaica was a slave society for hundreds of years from when Columbus discovered it in 1492 and started to enslave the Indians, right through the coming of African slavery, to the British conquest of the island in 1655, and then large-scale slavery.
Most of our history was in condition of slavery.
FM: In your 1982 book “Slavery and Social Death,” you mention that what distinguishes slavery from other oppressive systems is this idea of social death: the denial of humanity and participation in society. You also mention that it exists to some extent today, so where do we see remnants of social death today? 
OP: I should clear one thing up. There is a movement among some Black intellectuals, Afro-pessimism, they call themselves, who have taken up the idea argue that it exists today. I don’t hold that view. I think this is too extreme a view. I think that there are consequences of slavery, which persist today.
Segregation, I see as, in many ways, one of the most important consequences of slavery. What is essential to the idea of social death is that the slave did not belong to the society, has no place in the society. It’s just incredible that America should still have such a high level of segregation. The idea of not living with the Blacks, even in spite of all the many changes, still exists. And I see that going straight back to the notion of natal alienation, the fact that the slave does not belong.
FM: One quote in particular from your book “Freedom in the Making of Western Culture” stands out to me: “I had gone in search of a man-killing wolf called slavery; to my dismay I kept finding the tracks of a lamb called freedom,” you write. What influenced this shift from an investigation of social death to one of freedom? 
OP: Freedom is not, as almost all philosophers seem to think, and famously in Locke’s view, written in the hearts of men.
This is a mutual construction, I think. But, no group of people are more obsessed with their freedom than slaveholders. And no group of people are more desirous of their freedom than slaves.
FM: As much as you have work that is purely academic, you also have written a few fiction novels, namely “The Children of Sisyphus,” “An Absence of Ruins,” and “Die the Long Day.” How does your approach to fiction writing differ from your academic process? 
OP: I was always involved with exploring the world, both as a sociologist, but also, I felt that there are limits of social science that I couldn’t really express in a sociological treatise or an economics model, which I thought I could best explore through fiction, understanding the world.
Something major happened while I was at college. It was a critical period in the growth of the Rastafarian movement in Jamaica.
They were going back to Africa. They sang about it, but they believed it, and they believed the Emperor would come and take them back. A large number of them gathered in Kingston on the shores of the slums there, under a man called Claudius Henry, who was a kind of millenarian leader, and are waiting for the ship to come with the Emperor.
So as an undergraduate studying sociology with anthropologists, I had to get involved with this.
So I was down there waiting with them for the Emperor. And my original idea is that I do a sociological treatise on this, but I said, “Nah, there’s no way I could capture that in a dry sociological text.” So, I turned to fiction.
FM: You served as a special adviser for Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley from 1972 to 1979. What is something people get wrong about working in public service? 
OP: They were trying to introduce a democratic socialist revolution. It didn’t quite work, and it scared the hell out of the Americas. I don’t know how they let me back into the country cause I used to go back and forth. They were suspicious of what I was up to because I’d go between Harvard and Jamaica.
Manley and Castro fell in love, I mean, they loved each other. They’re both very charismatic. There are only 90 miles away from Cuba to Jamaica, so they said, “What the hell, let’s get together.” They just adored each other. And that just scared the hell out of the CIA. And so we had a hard time, a pretty hard time. I don’t know all the details. But you know, a lot of the violence that emerged is part of the kind of underhand things which were done to destabilize the country.
It is a strange kind of existence, but was fascinating. I got things done. Not everything succeeded, and the overall plan to take the country towards a democratic socialist system collapsed for economic reasons.
I am now involved again, this time with a major project — total transformation of the education system of Jamaica.
FM: What motivates you to work in public service? 
OP: That’s why I got into academia. I didn’t get into academia just for the scholarship, although I love scholarship, and I have written a lot of pure scholarship in my work on freedom. But, my work was motivated by the need to understand Jamaica, Jamaican society, its problems, its violence, its economy.
FM: What is one thing you’ve always wanted to study that is totally unrelated to your field? 
OP: At one point in my life, I agonized between whether I should go into literature and fiction or sociology. Three of my first four books were novels, and they were quite successful.
The thing about sociology is that it covers the same subjects as fiction. You are writing about people, but you are thinking about relationships in a more generalized way when you are doing sociology and fiction is extremely individualized: it’s character-based and so on. It’s two kinds of modes of thinking, which is very hard to bring together.
I had to make a choice.
I don’t say I have great regret, but I do wonder sometimes what might’ve been. Eliot said, “What might’ve been is an abstraction,” so forget it.
FM: If you could choose one song to encapsulate your life so far, what would it be? 
OP: There’s a famous Bob Marley song about the “Three Little Birds.”
The only time I’ve been to the gardens to see a baseball game, whenever the pressure is on and the Red Sox seem to be losing, the entire Boston audience — which is not the most liberal in the world — would break out into this: “Don’t worry about a thing ’cuz everything will be all right.” What the heck?
I love it because I played a lot with birds when I was growing up.
I’d see in my window these little birds.
They’re very cute and they’re relatively tame, but you could never catch them. So, I love that song because it reminds me so much of growing up but it is very powerful.
My favorite politically-tuned song was “By the Rivers of Babylon.” That’s the song I hear myself singing a lot.
It’s a famous Rastafarian song, and it was a big hit in Jamaica for a long time.
It’s a very powerful sign adopted by the Rastas from a hymn I think. It reflects their own sadness, their own sense of exile, their own sense of wanting to go somewhere, Zion. But, at the same time, knowing that you know they’re fixed here in Jamaica.
It so captures the unwanted, the despair, the hope, and the tragedy of being poor in a poor country.
So those are the two. One is full of hope. One is also about hope, but despair.
FM: Of all the places you have lived and studied, which is your favorite? 
OP: Cambridge, Mass.
It’s the best balance. It’s a great little town.
FM: Who are some thinkers who have influenced you? 
OP: It started with Camus, which I started reading in high school. I didn’t understand a word. I picked up “The Myth of Sisyphus” in the library, and I don’t know how it got there.
I read it and read it and read it right through my undergrad. It was like a Bible — just sort of constantly going back to it.
Camus, Sartre in the literary tradition. In terms of writing fiction too, I was deeply influenced by several realist novelists, so I love Zola, Émile Zola.
In sociology, of course, my models, there were four people: Weber, Du Bois, C.L.R. James — sort of Marxist philosopher, historian, sociologist, and Eric Williams, this great historian I mentioned earlier who became a statesman. He was a classic model for me, a scholar who came back and led his country to independence and was its first prime minister.
I also have a love-hate relationship with V.S. Naipaul, a great writer, but he was a self loathing Indian man, Indian West Indian. He was weird, but he was a genius. You think someone’s a genius, but you think he’s an asshole. I read everything he wrote and so on, so I’m sure he influenced me, but he’s a bastard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge is exploring the feasibility of implementing municipal broadband for residents, according to a report released last month.
Released on March 15, the report examined the possibility of creating a city-owned “fiber-to-the-premises” broadband network. FTTP is an internet access system relying on physical fiber optic cables running from the provider to households, which is generally faster and more reliable than other internet delivery options.
The report’s completion is the latest step in a yearslong campaign by advocates and policymakers to bring municipal broadband in Cambridge.
If municipal broadband is fully implemented by the city, the report estimates a necessary upfront investment of $150 million under “relatively conservative assumptions.” The report noted that partnering with a private company would decrease these costs.
The report also outlined four potential business models for the new broadband network. One option is full city ownership and operation, in which a public entity would build the FTTP and provide service.
Two other plans would have the city build the physical network, while private companies would provide internet service. The report’s fourth option is a public-private partnership, in which a private company would build and operate the new network with city oversight.
Former City Manager Louis A. DePasquale ordered the report, which was produced by CTC Technology & Energy and Rebel Group. Calls for the report originated in large part from concerns over high prices resulting from Comcast Corporation’s 80 percent share of the current Cambridge network market.
In an interview, City Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 described herself as “a big fan of municipal broadband.”
“You wouldn’t have a modern city without providing water to everybody, so we shouldn’t have a modern city without providing broadband to everyone,” she said. “And should it really be the domain of the private sector? I don’t think so.”
Kristen L. Roberts, a spokesperson for Comcast, wrote in a statement that the company provides fast broadband services to “every neighborhood and every street in the City of Cambridge.”
“Removing barriers like lack of devices and digital skills training should be where the city steers its digital equity investments, rather than into duplicative networks run by a local government with many other pressing issues to address,” she wrote. “Comcast will continue working with the many community organizations committed to solving for barriers to broadband adoption so we can get every Cambridge resident connected and close the digital divide.”
Roy P. Russell — co-founder of Upgrade Cambridge, an advocacy organization raising public awareness and support for municipal broadband — said the organization is not “ready to step back at all” following the release of the report.
“If we have to step up and make a lot of noise with public input and so on, then we certainly can,” he said.
Russell said he believes the city missed an opportunity to incorporate more public input in the report, adding that city discussion on municipal broadband is “still very opaque.”
“The study was done in relative secrecy. That was one of our main complaints about it,” he said. “It’d be great to have a group of interested community members that were involved in the process.”
Nolan said she spoke with a local resident who raised concerns over the cost that the city would pay for municipal broadband, but Nolan said she believes the price tag is worth the benefits of the service.
“I don’t mind spending that much money for municipal broadband because I know we’re spending that much money just to build one school building,” Nolan said. “It is, I think, proof-positive that it is a well-spent investment for us to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Weld Boathouse, one of Harvard’s two crew boathouses, welcomed rowers back to its historic space last week after more than a year of renovations.
The boathouse — home to the Harvard-Radcliffe rowing teams as well as recreational and intramural rowing — has not seen a renovation this large since its construction in 1906.
Renovations, which began in July 2022, were completed by contractor Consigli Construction and architecture firms Bruner/Cott Architects and Peterson Architects. The interior space was renovated to include a new team locker room, coaches’ offices, and training space.
Harvard Athletics spokesperson Darin A. Wong wrote in an emailed statement that “the majority of the funding was from donor philanthropy.”
The exterior renovations include changes to the boathouse’s stucco, windows and doors, and the replacement of the terracotta roof. The project also enhanced the electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems. This summer, new docks will be installed to replace the aging wooden planks.
“It’s like someone turned on the sun in here,” said Liz O’Leary, the Harvard-Radcliffe women’s heavyweight crew head coach, pointing to new, clear windows in the newly designated training room.
“They’ve done a spectacular job,” she added. “The space hasn’t changed, but the use is much more functional, much more efficient — and that’s great — but without losing the character.”
Kelly A. Evans ’10, the assistant Harvard-Radcliffe heavyweight crew coach, concurred with O’Leary.
“To see this boathouse restored and set up to provide both a state-of-the-art experience for future generations of Radcliffe women while sort of staying true to the history and tradition of the Radcliffe experience is really cool,” she said.
Still, there were some obstacles to bringing the 22,000 square foot building into the 21st century.
Construction on the boathouse required Harvard to adhere to preservation restrictions due to its listing on the State Register of Historic Places, as well as its location on the Charles River Basin Historic District, which is in the National Register of Historic Places.
The project faced some pushback late last year when the Charles River Watershed Association advocated for public access to the boathouse, citing Chapter 91 of the Massachusetts Public Waterfront Act — which states that private constructions on the Charles must “serve a proper public purpose.”
The renovations to Weld Boathouse will be followed by a remodeling of Newell Boathouse, its counterpart across the Charles and home to Harvard men’s crew. During the renovations to Weld, the College’s rowing teams shared Newell, and while Newell is under construction, the teams will share Weld.
Despite the shared space, Weld Boathouse is still “a unique space in that it provides space for women and for women athletes to train to become the best versions of themselves,” Evans said.
“I feel the spirit of Radcliffe here,” said Radcliffe rower Aurelia M.M. Elliott ’26. “I feel the history — the legacy — of our team in this space, which is really empowering.”
“Just look at these walls,” added Meena S. Baher ’26, a freshman Radcliffe rower. “So many women have come before us, inside of this one space, and now we get to create the next chapter of it.”

Seventeen Harvard professors were elected to become members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, according to a Wednesday press release by the honorary society.
Since its founding in 1780, the Academy has appointed more than 14,600 members. This year, the Academy has selected a cohort of 269 individuals. The organization also conducts research across multiple disciplines, publishes a journal, and hosts events on a variety of topics.
Nancy C. Andrews, chair of the Academy’s board of directors, said in Wednesday’s press release that this year’s appointees bring “diverse expertise to meet the pressing challenges and possibilities that America and the world face today.”
The Harvard professors who will be inducted come from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Medical School, the Kennedy School, the Business School, the Divinity School, the Law School, and the Graduate School of Education.
Government professor Daniel Ziblatt, whose research focuses on challenges facing American and European democracies, said he was “greatly honored by the recognition.”
He added it was meaningful to him to be recommended by current U.S. President Joe Biden and ex-President Barack Obama, as well as other advocates of democracy.
HKS professor William C. Clark, who advocates for sustainable development, wrote in an email that he was “grateful for the privilege of joining today this awesome group in its historic mission.”
HMS professor Benjamin L. Ebert, who studies leukemia and its potential treatments, thanked his coworkers in an email, writing that his selection “reflects the work of my entire laboratory and all of our collaborators much more than my personal contributions.”
David S. Pellman, an HMS professor whose work focuses on cell division errors and their impact on evolution, also thanked his collaborators and students. He added that he hopes his work can lead to novel cancer therapy methods.
Jacob K. Olupona, an African and African American Studies and Divinity School professor who is currently studying the life of a southwestern Nigerian medicine man and chief named Lóòghò Bamatula, said the election “came as a big surprise.”
“To be a member of the Academy is not a joke at all,” he said. “I will dedicate this fellowship to my parents: my late father, my mother, who brought me to this world and who gave me a good education when I was young.”
HDS professor emeritus David D. Hall ’58, who specializes in 17th century American history, said his election comes near the end of his academic career and celebrates “a large body of work stretching back some 40 years.”
Michèle Lamont, professor of Sociology, European Studies, and African and African American Studies, whose research focuses on how an individual’s work is valued throughout different communities, said she has received more from her students “than I have given in terms of my learning.”
“I would thank them for feeding my soul and my mind,” she said.
HKS and HBS professor Amitabh Chandra, whose research facilitates innovations in medicine, lauded those who have assisted the “great scientists and artists whose work has profoundly improved human experience” who have been elected to the Academy.
“They were supported by optimistic institutions and cheerful families, friends, and colleagues, who kept the elevator open for the pokey member, drowning in paperwork and laundry,” he wrote. “As in science and medicine, election to the AAAS is really a recognition that these invisible forces are too difficult to list, and it is easier to name the individual who alighted first from the elevator.”

Harvard Art Museums hosted New York University professors Kevin McCoy and Amy Whitaker for a Thursday evening discussion on the role of blockchain — a technology that allows for the secure distribution of data through a distributed ledger — in providing equality in the art market.
The discussion was moderated by Ruth C. Streeter ’76, a 2021 Advanced Leadership Initiative fellow, and focused on recent calls to create a new, fairer model for owning art and cultural property.
The problem with the current system, according to Whitaker, is artists do not earn as much profit from their work as do the middlemen selling it.
“I’ve been proposing alternatives to resale royalties that function more as property rights, specifically, routine fractional equity and art,” Whitaker said.
After the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, McCoy said he formulated ideas on how the virtual currency platform could be used for selling digital art.
“What if Bitcoin was an artwork? What if you could take an artwork and attach it to Bitcoin? And if you did that, would it have the same properties that Bitcoin has? Would it be scarce? Would it be unique? And if so, how would you do it?” McCoy said.
McCoy also described how the Whitney Museum, in cooperation with his team, created and distributed 50 tokens for donated artwork. These tokens circulated for a period of six months, after which the museum listed the token holders “as the donors of record for this artwork.”
“We wanted to open up this institutional process — it’s usually institutional, hidden process of ownership — and essentially create a secondary market for work that is never on the market,” he said.
“This was essentially blockchain-mediated institutional critique in a way and a form of distributed social collaboration, I’d say, and I think that those two ideas — institutional critique and social collaboration — really are at the heart of blockchain technology,” McCoy added.
Rayme S. Silverberg, an attendee of the event and recent graduate of NYU, said she drove more than three hours specifically to see Whitaker, whom she described as “absolutely brilliant and very knowledgeable.”
Attendee Katie I. Lundie, an associate at venture capital firm Outlier Ventures, said the event attracted her curiosity because of her work experience.
“I think there’s all this potential for web3 and NFTs to open up the art world and create more value for the people that really matter within that ecosystem — but also with outside of that ecosystem — and I’m not sure if it's being done in exactly the right way at the moment,” Lundie said.
“And I think this talk really gives me some hope that there are people out there who are trying to understand how best to make the value flow back to artists,” she added.

Graduate students across Harvard launched a new pro-Palestine activism group called Graduate Students 4 Palestine with an event Wednesday.
The new organization will create a network for graduate students in different schools at Harvard organizing around Palestinian rights, according to Harvard Divinity School student Elom Tettey-Tamaklo, an organizer for GS4P.
“The basic idea is for there to be an institutional home for all grad students who are interested in Palestine and advocacy around Palestine, and for us to advocate with a united voice around the questions of Palestine within the University and beyond,” Tettey-Tamaklo said.
Undergraduates have long organized for Palestinian rights through the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, which provided inspiration for the graduate student group, according to organizers.
Tettey-Tamaklo said he sees value in graduate students from different schools coming together in their advocacy for Palestine.
“The uniqueness of GS4P is within each school, folks are approaching the question of Palestine from their unique perspectives,” he said.
Organizers also said they hope to use their influence as Harvard students to create change.
“The brand of Harvard garners a lot of attention, so the things that we’re doing, the things that we’re talking about, how we’re advocating for Palestine, it goes beyond the walls of the institution, and it’s such a perfect space and opportunity for us to do this work,” Tettey-Tamaklo said.
The formation of the student group comes roughly a month after “PalTrek,” a funded, weeklong trip to Palestine over spring break that aims to “introduce trekkers to Palestinian culture, history, and people, to foster understanding of the reality of life under military occupation, and to highlight the Palestinian narrative,” according to the organization’s website.
Harvard Kennedy School student Maya R.F. Alper said she believes PalTrek created a new spur of pro-Palestine advocacy among Harvard graduate students.
“Coming back after PalTrek, there’s been this renewed sense of urgency around organizing around Palestine,” Alper said. “The opportunity to be in Palestine, to hear from Palestinians in their own homes, on their own terms, in their own words about their story was incredibly powerful for me, and so I felt that call to relay those stories really urgently.”
HKS students outside of GS4P, including Alper, hosted a teach-in Tuesday to talk about their experiences on PalTrek. Though Alper is not currently part of GS4P, she said she sees value in creating a united front of pro-Palestine advocacy.
“Finding a way to bring all of the folks together — all these disparate grad students under one umbrella — is really important, since sort of the core of this kind of organizing work is solidarity and showing up for one another,” Alper said.
HKS student Kartikeya Bhatotia, who helped organize the teach-in, said he believed it was important to provide a Palestinian perspective to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the event.
According to Bhatotia, who attended PalTrek, pro-Palestine organizers are hoping to increase the representation of Palestinians on campus by aiding them during the application process and brainstorming a long-term strategy to provide resources for Palestinians on campus.
“I was a participant on the Trek, but I am now participating in the post-Trek activities because we decided that it was important to bring Palestinian voices on campus, just to have a fair representation,” Bhatotia said.

Harvard students and organizers staged a protest and “die-in” at the Harvard Art Museums Thursday to condemn the University’s connections to Arthur M. Sackler and his family, whom they charge with enabling and profiting from the opioid crisis.
More than 50 protesters called on Harvard to remove the Sackler name from all University sites and departments — including the Arthur M. Sackler Building and Arthur M. Sackler Museum. In addition, some protesters urged the school to invest in a more available supply of the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone.
The protest, which started at 12:30 p.m., took place in the atrium of the Harvard Art Museums and included chants such as “Shame on Sackler,” “Take Down the Name,” and “No More Drug War.” Protesters also dropped empty pill bottles onto the floor as bloodied paper money and palm cards rained down from the second floor balcony.
In an emailed statement Thursday, Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed the school is reviewing a proposal to dename the two buildings, which was submitted last fall by members of the Harvard College Overdose Prevention and Education Students to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Process for Denaming Spaces, Programs, or other Entities.
“The university has established a process for considering de-naming spaces, programs, or other entities. A proposal to de-name the Arthur M. Sackler Museum and the Arthur M. Sackler Building has been submitted and is currently under review,” Newton wrote.
The protesters are part of a larger group of activists who argue that members of the Sackler family who largely owned the multi-billion dollar drug company Purdue Pharma began the ongoing nationwide opioid crisis. Since 2007, local, state, and federal governments have claimed in an extensive series of lawsuits that members of the Sackler family knew Purdue Pharma’s pain relief drug OxyContin was highly addictive, but they downplayed its dangers when marketing it to doctors.
In 2020, Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to three federal criminal charges related to its promotion of OxyContin and reached a $8.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice — a move that dissolved the company. In 2022, members of the Sackler family agreed to pay as much as $6 billion in a settlement related to the opioid crisis, though they have never admitted criminal wrongdoing.
Speakers at the protest cited examples of other neighboring institutions who have cut ties with the Sackler family, including Tufts University, which in 2019 removed the Sackler name from all programs and facilities on its Boston health sciences campus.
“No family is more singularly responsible for the opioid crisis that has devastated so many lives,” Harvard Student Labor Action Movement organizer Will M. Sutton ’23 said in an address at the protest. “The Sackler family specifically targeted working class communities for opioid distribution, fostering and then profiting from the addiction of marginalized people.”
Sackler — who donated millions to Harvard in the 1980s to fund the construction of the museum — died before OxyContin came to market. Still, activists contend he helped develop marketing tactics that Purdue would later use to sell OxyContin.
“Denaming is not erasing or rewriting history — it’s acknowledging and conceptualizing it,” Clyve Lawrence ’25, a leader of the Winthrop House denaming campaign and a Crimson Editorial editor, said in an interview following the demonstration.
“We’re just trying to highlight that history in saying that it is a moral failure. It’s been a moral failure since those names were put up, and we should be very clear in future processes of naming how our community feels about it, what we can do to highlight histories that are much more positive,” he added.
The protest was organized by Harvard student activists in coordination with Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, an advocacy group founded by photographer Nan Goldin — whose works are featured in Harvard Art Museums’ private collection — that targets the Sackler family.
The demonstration comes almost five years after a similar protest, led by Goldin, demanded the buildings be renamed.
PAIN activist Harry Cullen led the crowd of protesters through a call and response statement condemning Harvard’s continued association with the Sackler family.
“We are here today to call out Harvard for supporting the Sacklers — a family of billionaires that profited off our pain for generations starting with Arthur Sackler,” Cullen said, echoed by a crowd of protesters. “Five years ago, Nan Goldin and PAIN came here to show Harvard the way to reject the Sackler legacy. Now Harvard students have brought PAIN back to repeat our demands: take down the Sackler name.
“We won’t wait another five years. To uphold the Sackler name is to launder their reputation, to be complicit in their crimes,” Cullen added.
Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow has previously said it would be “inappropriate” for the University to remove the Sackler family name from campus buildings, citing “legal and contractual considerations” as well as Arthur Sackler’s passing before OxyContin was developed and marketed.
Bridget S. O’Kelly ’23, co-president of HCOPES, said she was “shocked” by the student turnout.
“I think this is an issue that touches a lot of people,” said O’Kelly. “It was really amazing to see all the students show up and kind of put their voices and their bodies behind this movement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Foreign policy experts discussed the impact of the Vietnam War on relations between the United States and Vietnam, as well as the war’s multigenerational health consequences, at a Thursday panel held at Harvard Kennedy School.
The panel, hosted by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, included Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aid to former Vermont senator Patrick J. Leahy; Hai T. Nguyen, director of the Global Vietnam Wars Studies Initiative at the Ash Center; and Kim Korinek, a sociologist who directs the Asia Center and a project on health and aging in Vietnam War survivors at the University of Utah.
Rieser opened the talk by recounting his experiences as a young adult during the time of the war.
“I was very lucky my number was high enough that I wasn’t at risk of being drafted,” he said, referencing the 1969 draft lotteries. “But the war had a huge impact on our lives, whether you were sent to Vietnam, or enlisted in the military or in some other capacity, or just observing and witnessing what was happening every day.”
During his time working for Leahy, Rieser helped establish the Leahy War Victims Fund, which was founded in 1989 and began providing aid to Vietnam in 1991. The program offers financial and technical assistance to people with disabilities, especially those whose disabilities resulted from anti-personnel landmines, unexploded ordnances, and other repercussions of conflict.
“It was not controversial. It wasn’t political,” Rieser said. “It was really humanitarian. It was a way that we could show that we weren’t just going to turn our back forever.”
Rieser said his work involved introducing reciprocity into efforts to identify the remains of people who were killed in the Vietnam War.
“We also recognize that the Vietnamese had for years, decades, helped us locate the remains of U.S. servicemen and women who were missing,” Rieser said.
Now, he said, the U.S. is providing access to advanced DNA analysis technology — as well as archival information and artifacts brought back by U.S. soldiers — to help the Vietnamese government locate and identify the hundreds of thousands of people who were killed in the war.
Nguyen discussed his research involving the analysis of documents from the war captured by U.S. forces and the South Vietnamese army.
“The primary sources are valuable and vast, but we have to organize, categorize and index captured documents and other resources to create an advanced digital archive so that future historians can study the war,” he said.
Korinek said conversations about the Vietnam War have long been one-sided, and researchers have neglected studying the war’s impacts on Vietnamese people. Many Americans, she said, regard the war as “essentially an American drama, due to the dehumanizing image of the enemy created by the U.S. military.”
Starting in 2018, with funding from the National Institutes of Health, Korinek began a study “to examine the enduring effects of wartime experiences on Vietnam War survivors.”
Korinek has also worked to connect students at the University of Utah and Fulbright University Vietnam to study the effects of the war.
“War’s imprints on biology transcend sides and interconnect participants,” she said. “There is here a foundation for reconciliation in learning, educating, and treating enduring wounds.”
Correction: April 27, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Global Vietnam Wars Studies Initiative utilized documents captured by the CIA. In fact, these documents were captured by U.S. and South Vietnamese military forces.

As negotiations between Harvard’s clerical and technical union and the University pass their one-year mark, union employees have now gone more than a year and a half without a pay raise.
The current round of contract negotiations is the second-longest in Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers’ 34-year history. Its previous one-year contract expired Sept. 30, 2022, and HUCTW and Harvard agreed to negotiate through a federal mediator in November 2022.
The slow pace of negotiations has caused frustrations to mount within the union.
In a March 1 newsletter, the union claimed Harvard has failed to make “a meaningful move since their last offer in January” — an 11.5 percent wage increase over three years, which “doesn’t come close to addressing high inflation rates,” the newsletter stated.
“They seem like they’re just digging in their heels,” said Leslie MacPherson, a department administrator at the Harvard Divinity School.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote that Harvard “remains committed” to negotiating in good faith “with a full appreciation for the important role our HUCTW colleagues have in fulfilling Harvard’s mission and their contributions to our community as a whole.”
As the negotiations continue, union members face growing financial strain. Average rent in Boston has increased by 8.1 percent over the past year according to Zillow.
“People are feeling the pain,” said Timothy M. Conant, an access coordinator at the Harvard Kennedy School Library.
Sarah E. Hillman, an executive assistant at the Sharpe Laboratory at Harvard Medical School, said the lag in negotiations has caused “uncertainty” as she prepares to sign a new lease.
“I’m somebody who rents an apartment, and I need to commit to my landlord in May whether I’m staying or moving,” she said. “I find that challenging to do not knowing what my salary will be going into the future.”
HUCTW members said many need to go into credit card debt or dip into their retirement accounts to stay afloat.
“As an older worker, I’m concerned about my rate of pay and the value that it has as I look toward retirement,” Conant said.
Anna Taylor, an IT specialist at the Harvard-MIT Data Center, said her coworkers “are making tough choices about which bills to pay.”
The University’s last offer to the union — an 11.5 percent raise over three years — has drawn criticism from HUCTW members. In a Feb. 7 email to union members, Harvard’s Vice President of Human Resources Manuel Cuevas-Trisán wrote the offer took into account “comparative market factors, as well as the total compensation and benefits package and low attrition rates.”
He also wrote the University had tentatively agreed with HUCTW on “14 topics proposed by the Union” unrelated to compensation.
Lamont Library assistant Geoffrey P. Carens said that if the union were to accept the 11.5 percent raise, “we would lose a lot of ground.”
Elizabeth C. “Liz” Hoveland ’22, communications coordinator at Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said she believed Cuevas-Trisán’s February email was an example of union-busting by “blaming union leaders for not saying yes to have this contract.”
Newton, the University spokesperson, declined to comment on the allegation of union busting.
“The University’s latest proposal reflects our commitment to addressing the important issues that remain the focus of these negotiations through significant increases in compensation, including retroactive pay to offset the impact of inflation, and enhanced benefits support,” he added.
Since February, HUCTW has been holding informational pickets outside of Massachusetts Hall three days a week. At the picket last Tuesday, Taylor — the IT specialist — said she believed Harvard administrators know “that we’re here and we’re not going to give up.”
“I think they’re having a really positive effect,” said Hillman, the HMS executive assistant. “We have a lot of support in the broader Harvard community for the things that we’re asking for.”
On March 21, more than 250 protesters rallied in support of the union. Massachusetts State Rep. Marjorie C. Decker and Boston City Councilor Kenzie Bok ’11 both spoke at the rally.
Some HUCTW members disagree with the current picketing campaign, arguing the union should be employing a more forceful approach.
“I thought we’d be doing a bit more,” Hoveland said.
Carens said they would like the union to consider starting a strike fund.
“Personally, if we don’t get a contract offer that I can accept, I will organize a campaign against the contract,” Carens said.
Still, HUCTW members remain broadly in support of “what the union is doing,” said Conant, the HKS Library access coordinator, adding that past efforts at picketing and organizing “eventually had an effect on the University.”
HUCTW President Carrie E. Barbash said union leadership is continuing to solicit feedback from members.
“We are trying to be very careful and listening to all types of members and reaching out to particularly the members that we don’t talk to and don’t hear from as much to see, ‘What are you comfortable with? How are you feeling about this? Do you want to keep pushing? Do you want to settle?’” Barbash said.
Though frustrations with the bargaining process have grown, Conant said HUCTW will also see an increase in bargaining power.
“Think about what happens in May at the University. We’ve got graduation, we’ve got alumni, we’ve got parents coming through the campus,” Conant said. “Our platform only increases and our visibility only increases as we get farther and deeper into the spring.”

Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Clinic will enter a new chapter after the departure of its director at the end of this semester.
From an ongoing lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture regarding its laboratory inspection policies to successful advocacy efforts to allow plant-based milk alternatives to be labeled and sold as “milk,” students and staff at Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Clinic have been hard at work over the last few months.
The Animal Law & Policy Clinic has also campaigned in recent months to change policies governing the treatment of nonhuman primates in research.
The clinic co-authored an open letter to the National Institutes of Health in February, urging the agency to defund a Harvard Medical School lab over its animal research. Last month, the clinic won a lawsuit in Maryland District Court challenging the USDA’s denial of a rulemaking petition that called for improving standards for the treatment of primates involved in research.
Since its establishment by the Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Program in 2019, the clinic has aimed to improve the treatment of animals through policymaking, litigation, and other forms of legal advocacy.
Professor Katherine A. Meyer, the Animal Law & Policy Clinic’s founding director, announced last December that she will be stepping down from her position at the end of the 2022-23 academic year. The search for Meyer’s successor is still ongoing.
Meyer guided the clinic through a rapid rise to prominence, mentoring students as they pursued lawsuits against the USDA and U.S. National Park Service, as well as petitions to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
According to Law School professor Kristen A. Stilt — the faculty director of the Animal Law & Policy Program — the decision to launch the clinic was partly motivated by a “great need for really rigorous advocacy” to complement the program’s scholarly work. She also cited student interest in a clinic dedicated specifically to animal law.
“There’s no substitute for this very intensive work in-house, supervised by a clinical faculty member in this incredibly academically rich setting,” Stilt said.
The Animal Law & Policy Clinic represented Harvard Law School’s foray into what Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 called a “burgeoning field” of legal advocacy at the time of its launch.
Meyer, the outgoing clinic director, said the process of starting the clinic was “kind of easy,” as years of experience in animal law at a public interest law firm left her with a plethora of potential policy projects and litigation. As a result, she was ready to get started immediately.
“At my interview — I think — with Kristen Stilt for the job, she said, ‘What’s your vision for the clinic?’ and I pulled out a legal pad that had like 55 project ideas,” Meyer said. “I was like, ‘Go, go, go.’”
Chris Green, executive director of the Animal Law & Policy Program, said the Animal Law & Policy Clinic has sought to differentiate itself from other legal clinics — taking on heftier work than typical student projects and supporting amicus briefs.
“A lot of law school clinics — not just in the animal realm but just generally — they often will just piggyback on other work in the field,” he said. “We really didn’t want to do that.”
Green compared the Animal Law & Policy Clinic to major animal advocacy organizations, though he added that the clinic often has more freedom in choosing its projects.
“Even at a lot of the major animal protection groups, they have such broad donor bases and they have to please a lot of folks that it sometimes keeps them from being as progressive as they might otherwise be,” Green said. “Whereas we have a much smaller donor base and all of our donors really want us to have the complete liberty to swing for the fences.”
The clinic sees its role as an “incubator for new ideas,” Green said, adding that the clinic’s resources and “nimbleness” allow it to pursue its own cases and policy projects with relative freedom.
When choosing projects for the clinic to pursue, Meyer said she tries to ensure that the clinic diversifies its initiatives, as its clinicians pursue a wide variety of academic and professional interests.
Meyer stressed that she did not want the clinic to become too focused on certain areas of animal advocacy and that she instead wanted it to take on a broader scope of issues.
“I wanted to make sure this clinic was not just concentrated on advocacy to make animals be persons,” she said. “My position is there’s a lot of other work that can be done under existing laws to protect and advocate for animals.”
“I wanted to make sure that we were advocating on behalf of animals both in captivity — so research animals, zoo animals, animals used in entertainment — but also animals in the wild,” Meyer added.
Green highlighted another element of the clinic’s approach to animal law: its media strategy. The clinic — unlike some others at the Law School — has a full-time communications director.
“When Kathy first arrived, she was saying how media is such an important part of her litigation strategy,” Green said. “Often, you may actually not prevail in court, but the public attention that is generated about a case that you file is so massive that you sort of achieve the same ends anyway.”
Green said a priority of the clinic is “foregrounding” students and giving them “agency and ownership of their projects.”
Rebecca L. Garverman, a clinical fellow who was involved in the Animal Law & Policy Clinic when she was a student at Harvard Law School, discussed working on an amicus brief for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals when she was a student.
In the case, the Center for Biological Diversity — a nonprofit organization that aims to protect endangered species — challenged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s decision to refuse to classify the Pacific walrus as an endangered species.
The Center for Biological Diversity argued that the Fish and Wildlife Service had failed to consider how climate change would affect walrus habitats. In June 2021, the court ruled in favor of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“It was for the Ninth Circuit, which is a very prestigious court, and so to be able to write a brief for them as a student was mind-blowing,” she said. According to an Animal Law & Policy Clinic release, one of the judges quoted from a passage that Garverman drafted in the amicus brief during oral argument.
Third-year law student Ben T. Rankin, who has worked at the Animal Law & Policy Clinic for four semesters and one winter term, spoke about writing a petition to the Fish and Wildlife Service requesting that the West Indian manatee be classified as an endangered species.
“I was working with a number of other students in doing the scientific research that undergirds that kind of rulemaking petition, essentially,” he said. “We got that submitted after three semesters of work. It’s a 156-page document, and it’s in the Fish and Wildlife Service’s hands as of last November and we’re currently waiting on a legally required finding.”
When asked how the Animal Law and Policy Clinic has influenced his legal career, Rankin said, “It has defined it.” He added that he found a summer position as a law clerk through his work at the clinic with the Center for Biological Diversity and that he hopes to enter animal law after law school.
Clinical instructor Rachel Mathews, who worked in PETA’s Captive Animal Law Enforcement division for nine years before joining the clinic, said she enjoys helping to mentor students in the clinic.
“I love working with the students,” Mathews said. “I think the difference between a clinic and actually being in practice is that you have the luxury of really being able to focus on the educational part.”
Mathews, who worked on the clinic’s February open letter to the National Institutes of Health calling on them to stop funding Harvard professor Margaret S. Livingstone’s research with macaque monkeys, said the case was important for the clinic to address in part because it took place in “our backyard.”
In conjunction with researchers from the University of St. Andrews, the clinic published an open letter urging the NIH to rescind funding from Livingstone’s lab, alleging that the lab’s experiments involve “cruel and unnecessary treatment of laboratory animals.”
In a public statement published on Oct. 24, 2022, Livingstone said that the allegations mischaracterized research performed by her lab.
“I realize that working with animals is a privilege that requires vigilance and responsibility. To honor that, we take great care of our animals beyond what’s mandated by even the most stringent federal regulations,” she wrote.
According to Mathews, the clinic decided to go forward with the open letter after not receiving any response from the Medical School’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. She said the clinic received an acknowledgment from Harvard University administration copying Harvard Medical School, but that the Medical School itself has not responded.
“I can’t say yet what we’re doing next, but this is not the end of it,” she said. “We’re not just going to send a letter off into space, but we’re looking at other alternatives both for change within the University but also systemic change.”
As Harvard Law School’s academic year comes to a close, so too does Meyer’s tenure as clinic director — kicking off the next chapter of the clinic’s animal advocacy.
Meyer said she hopes the clinic will continue to pursue a multitude of avenues for advocacy.
“I would love to see the diversity of kinds of projects: some litigation, some policy, some legislative, some organizing. All of the different aspects going on at the same time,” Meyer said. “I’m hoping whoever comes in here will continue the clinic in a similar vein.”
She said she hopes to remain involved at the clinic in some capacity after stepping down from the directorship, such as in an advisory role.
Stilt, the faculty director of the Animal Law & Policy Program, said she sees two major opportunities for growth that she hopes the clinic will explore in the near future. In the near future, Stilt said she wants to see the clinic grow internationally.
She hopes the clinic will represent “places that have very strong traditions of their own but could benefit from a collaboration with us.”
The second area Stilt hopes to see progress in is climate change, explaining that the impacts of climate change on animal populations and agriculture are “already squarely within what the clinic is concerned about right now.”
Rankin, the third-year law student, said Meyer’s departure will leave a void at the Animal Law & Policy Clinic, adding that the next director “certainly has big shoes to fill.”
“What I’ve always found and loved about being in the clinic is that we’re able to get really personal feedback from this person who’s considered a titan in the field,” Rankin said of Meyer. “I don’t know that I would have been in the animal law space if she hadn’t been such a forceful proponent for making sure that it is really expansively conceived.”
Reflecting on the clinic’s four-year history, Green, the executive director of the Animal Law & Policy Program, quipped that if he could change one thing, he would “contact someone at MIT to see if they could clone Kathy and so we could have her a bit longer.”
“The success of the clinic is beyond our wildest dreams, honestly,” he added.

More than 50 percent of Harvard faculty who responded to The Crimson’s annual survey of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences indicated they felt Harvard should not have allowed professor John L. Comaroff — who has been publicly accused of sexual harassment and professional retaliation — back into the classroom.
The results come amid campus activism calling for the embattled African and African American Studies and Anthropology professor to resign. Allegations against Comaroff are also at the center of an active federal lawsuit against Harvard by three Ph.D. candidates in Anthropology, who allege the school mishandled years of complaints against the professor.
Comaroff has repeatedly denied all allegations that have been made against him.
The Crimson distributed its survey to more than 1,300 members of the FAS and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, including tenured and tenure-track professors, non-tenure-track lecturers, and preceptors. The survey collected demographic information and opinions on a range of topics, including Harvard’s academic atmosphere, life as a professor, and political issues.
The anonymous 124-question survey received 386 responses, including 234 fully-completed responses and 152 partially-completed responses. It was open to new responses between March 23 and April 14. Responses were not adjusted for selection bias.
The first installment of The Crimson’s survey centers around faculty views on the controversy surrounding Comaroff, as well as Harvard’s Title IX policies and procedures and departmental culture surrounding sexual harassment.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the survey findings or individual faculty responses.
Around 41 percent of respondents said they “strongly” agreed that Comaroff should not have been able to return to teaching courses, with about 13 percent saying they “somewhat” agreed. Nearly 15 percent of faculty respondents said they somewhat or strongly disagreed, with more than 31 percent saying they neither agreed or disagreed.
Non-tenure-track faculty reported higher rates of objections than tenured and tenure-track faculty to Comaroff’s return to the classroom, at about 62 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Female-identifying respondents also reported higher rates of objections to his return than male-identifying respondents, at about 67 percent to 44 percent, respectively.
Allegations against Comaroff were first made public by The Crimson in 2020, where an eight-month investigation found that at least three students had contacted Harvard’s Title IX Office with complaints about the professor’s behavior.
After two internal investigations launched after The Crimson’s reporting found that Comaroff violated Harvard’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies, FAS Dean and President-elect Claudine Gay placed Comaroff on a semester of unpaid administrative leave, after initially placing him on paid administrative leave.
His return to the classroom in fall 2022 was met with a walkout by Harvard’s graduate student union, and public outrage against the professor continued into this semester.
In an emailed statement, Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, an attorney for Comaroff, wrote that the survey results are “entirely misleading.”
“The Harvard community has not been provided with any of the factual findings of the Office for Dispute Resolution’s investigation and therefore has no basis to make responsible judgments about those findings or about the appropriateness of sanctions,” O’Meara-Costello wrote.
“Public discussion of the case has been heavily distorted by the media campaign surrounding the lawsuit against Harvard, by the Crimson’s consistently slanted editorializing, and by the vocal protests of a minority of students advocating punishment without due process,” she added.
In an emailed statement, Cara J. Chang ’24, The Crimson’s president, defended the newspaper’s coverage.
“The Crimson strives to bring our readers fair, accurate, and objective coverage, upholding the highest standards of journalistic ethics,” Chang wrote. “Our reporters and editors have done their due diligence throughout our coverage of Professor John L. Comaroff, and we stand by our reporting.”
When asked to expand on their answers in a free-response question, several faculty respondents criticized Harvard’s response to the allegations against Comaroff, with one alleging the school is “not committed to holding abusive faculty accountable.”
Another reported that they were “personally severely harassed and bullied” due to fallout from Harvard’s “severe mishandling” of the allegations.
Many respondents said they did not have enough information to judge whether Harvard’s response was too severe or too lenient, with one writing that this was “the limitation of a non-transparent system.”
Others objected to recent calls for harsher sanctions against Comaroff.
“He wasn’t found guilty. Either we agree to the system in place or not but we cannot agree with it only when it produces results we like,” one respondent wrote. “This is not [serious] and not just.”
Faculty respondents also weighed in on the University’s Title IX policies and practices more generally.
Approximately 36 percent of surveyed faculty somewhat or strongly disagreed that the University’s Office for Gender Equity and Office for Dispute Resolution were adequately equipped to handle sex and gender-based discrimination issues on campus, a 5 percentage point decrease from last year. Just over 31 percent of surveyed faculty agreed that the Office for Gender Equity and ODR were adequately prepared.
“The University is doing much better now than in the past, and still has much room for improvement,” one faculty member wrote.
But others slammed the University. One faculty member called Harvard’s policies “abominable, patriarchal and shameful,” and another wrote that Harvard’s “motivations are not about justice or reconciliation but instead the protection of themselves and the corporation.”
Just over 31 percent of surveyed faculty said they knew someone in their department — excluding themselves — who was sexually harassed, up from just under 26 percent last year. Of those who knew someone who was sexually harassed, roughly equal percentages were men and women — 49 percent and 44 percent, respectively.
Like last year, faculty in Social Sciences knew of someone who was sexually harassed in their department more than in other divisions: 51 percent of respondents in the Social Sciences division said they knew someone who had been sexually harassed, followed by 30 percent of faculty in the Science division, 29 percent in SEAS, and 24 percent in the Arts and Humanities.
Roughly 7 percent of faculty said they themselves had been sexually harassed, while 88 percent said they had not been — which resemble last year’s percentages, when 7.9 percent of surveyed faculty said they had been sexually harassed.
The Crimson’s annual faculty survey for 2023 was conducted via Qualtrics, an online survey platform. The survey was open from March 23, 2023, to April 14, 2023.
A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,310 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in February 2021 from Harvard directory information and updated in subsequent years. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS affiliations, including tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty.
In total, 386 faculty replied, with 234 filling the survey completely and 152 partially completing the survey.
To check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondents’ self-reported demographic data with publicly available data on FAS faculty demographics for the 2021-22 academic year. Survey respondents’ demographic data generally match these publicly available data.
In The Crimson’s survey, 47 percent of respondents identified themselves as male and 45 percent as female, with 2 percent selecting “genderqueer/non-binary,” 1 percent for “other,” and 5 percent for “prefer not to say.” According to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ 2022 Report, 39 percent of FAS faculty as a whole are female.
53 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey were tenured or tenure-track faculty and 47 percent were non-tenure-track faculty. According to the FAS data, 58 percent of faculty are tenure-track and 38 percent are non-tenure-track.
31 percent of survey respondents reported their ethnic or racial background as something other than white or Caucasian, with 9 percent opting not to report their race. According to the FAS data, 27 percent of faculty are non-white.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the majority of Harvard students are hitting the books in preparation for finals, Harvard golf will be playing in its biggest tournament of the year at the Ivy League Championships this weekend. The stakes of the tournament are high — not only is an Ivy League crown on the table, but a trip to NCAA regionals is as well.
Both the men’s and women's teams have had strong tournament finishes leading into the Ivy championship. Last weekend, the men won the Princeton Invitational against a field of teams similar to the ones they will face this weekend in Greenwich, Conn. The team's success is due to the depth of the group, with several golfers scoring under-par, including junior Brian Ma, who went an outstanding nine-under-par.
“​​Everyone has been stepping up to the occasion. Especially with their last two tournaments,” said Ma about the team's overall performance. “I think all of us did our part.”
This will serve them well against the strong set of Ivy teams they are set to face in Greenwich at the Stanwich Club, which has held many other professional tournaments in the past, such as the USGA Mid-Am Championship and the Wyndham Cup.
The women field a young team featuring four freshmen. Despite the team’s inexperience, it has found tremendous success this season, finishing in at least second place in all of its tournaments except for one.
In the fall season, the team finished in seventh place in the Ivy Intercollegiate. The tournament included Ivy League teams and stronger ACC teams that dominated the field, including Florida State University, UNC, Clemson, and Notre Dame.
Since then, the group has improved and is primed to have a successful tournament this weekend. The team has shown tremendous growth this season and continues to grow to its full potential.
Sophomore Catie Schernecker broke her personal best this season in the fall at the Yale Invitational, and junior captain Meiyi Yan won first place for the first time in her Ivy career at the Intercollegiate at Prospect Bay.
Despite the Crimson's recent success, winning the tournament will be no easy feat for either team — last weekend, Ma was trailed closely by two Yale golfers who both finished 7-under-par, Gabriel Ruiz and Robert You. The Yale squad will force the Crimson golfers to have its strongest tournament if they want to pull out the win.
On the women’s side, three Ivy golfers bested the top Harvard player, Charissa Shang, at last weekend’s Harvard Invitational. A Princeton, Penn, and Dartmouth golfer all went under-par while the Crimson were all on-par or above. If the team wants to continue its hot streak, all members, including the newcomers, will have to have a strong showing.
“Generally our teams and a lot of Ivy teams are interested in winning the tournament next week — but only one can,”  head coach Naree Song about the team's goals going into the tournament and the season in general.
Song was named the head coach for the Harvard women’s golf program in January after guiding the team for 18 seasons in assistant coaching positions. The Bangkok, Thailand native has been an associate coach for the Crimson since 2015 after years of playing professional golf. She even played at the U.S. Open in 2000 and retired shortly after due to injury, changing course to education and coaching.
The women are set to tee off at the Century Country Club in N.Y., while the men will travel to Conn. Both teams have had strong practice weeks at home and are eager to face off for the Ivy League crown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the UConn Northeast Challenge, Harvard track and field engineered another successful weekend. The team had two field athletes break their own previous records, as well as eight first-place finishes. Both the Harvard men’s and women’s teams currently lead the northeast region in the national rankings.
When asked about the meet, junior Lance Ward said, “Some teams we’re familiar with – it kind of felt pretty comfortable. I think we all came in there knowing exactly what we had to do, knowing what to expect. We all had quite a bit of fun this weekend, and the familiar environment of the meet kind of helped with that.”
The field athletes set the tone first for Harvard.
Sophomore Izzy Goudros got things started for the Crimson. The school record-holder for the women’s heptathlon broke the Harvard and Ivy League record yet again with a score of 5769, putting her in third place in the NCAA.
“It was definitely very exciting,” said Goudros about her record-breaking performance. “One of the goals going [into the meet] was to break that record again, to get a good mark to hopefully qualify for Nationals in Texas.  It was super fun to compete with my teammates as well, it’s the first time in a while [that] I’ve gotten to [compete] with the two other multis on the team, so that was nice having all of Harvard track by my side.”
Her teammate junior Jada Johnson followed behind, taking second place with a score of 5230, placing her fifth in the record books. Senior John Minicus broke the school record for the men’s decathlon, scoring 6878 to place second in the event.
“It was really cool to watch him do that this weekend,” said Ward about Minicus’ performance. “It was something he talked about for a while, and I didn’t doubt he could make it happen.”
Sophomore Anastasia Retsa jumped 4.05 m to win the women’s pole vault and was the only competitor to clear four meters in the event. Senior Estel Valeanu won the women’s discus with a throw of 52.57 m. Valeanu also returned on the second day to win the women’s shot put, throwing 15.29 m. In the women’s hammer throw, senior Cammy Garabian and sophomore Cara Salsberry took second and third place, throwing 62.07 m and 59.79 m, respectively.
Sophomore Kenneth Ikeji represented the men’s throwing team well, taking first place in the men’s hammer throw with a mark of 69.58 m.
On the track, the Harvard sprint team followed suit with some top finishes of its own.
The women’s 4x100 m relay team ran a time of 45.20 seconds to take second place, a time that puts them fourth in Crimson history.
The men’s 4x100 m relay ran a time of 40.23 seconds to take first place in the event. Their time puts them second in the Crimson record books, a mere .04 seconds off of the previous school record which was set early this outdoor season.
“It was exciting for sure,” said Ward about the men’s 4x100m win. “We had two new members on the 4x100m step up, both of them [were] first years. We ran it this time with them and ended up running the second fastest time in Harvard history.”
“The first fastest time we set was earlier this spring in Houston, so we are very excited about how much depth we have in that event,” Ward continued. “We have six or seven guys that could easily all step up and just knock it out of the park, so it was really exciting to be a part of that.”
Sophomore Victoria Bossong ran 53.80 seconds in the women’s 400m dash, taking first in the event. In the women’s 200 m, first-year Adaji Osaro-Igwe won the women’s 200m dash in 23.71 seconds. In the same event on the men’s side, Ward ran 20.65 seconds to also take first place.
“For the 200 [m], I think I was just having a lot of fun with that one,” Ward said in reflection about his race. “It’s my favorite event, and I drew a good lane. I was like, ‘Okay, let’s just have fun with it today.’”
In the last event of the day, Bossong returned to lead off the women’s 4x400m, along with first years Mfoniso Andrew, Jacklynn Okere, and senior Tina Martin, and the group ran a time of 3:40.30 seconds to win the event.
The Harvard women’s team currently holds half of the Ivy League records, an impressive 11 out of 22.
“Different groups are going to different places,” Ward said.  “The distance team is going to Wake Forest, and the sprints and throws groups are going to LSU – those are two really big meets, there’s gonna be some great competition, so we’re looking to run really fast times and jump far and throw far.
Part of the team will travel a few Redline stops down to MIT for the Sean Collier Invite. This meet was named in honor of the MIT police officer Sean Collier killed by the Boston Marathon bombers in 2013. This year marked the tenth anniversary of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings.
The team will also travel south to Louisiana State University (LSU) and Wake Forest University in its second-to-last weekend of meets ahead of the Ivy League Outdoor Championships.
“I think the whole team is very excited at this point,” Goudros added about the future of the season. “The energy is definitely high. We’re going to our last kind of big travel meet this weekend at LSU.
“Everything’s coming together, so we’re all looking forward to hopefully getting the triple crown. Our cross country girls won it in the fall, and we won it this indoor season, so hopefully we can do it in outdoors.”
