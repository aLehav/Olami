Three years after the success of his debut album, “+,” Ed Sheeran, the beloved British singer-songwriter, has returned with “X” (pronounced “Multiply”). Notorious for quaint, acoustic songs dripping with emotion, Sheeran maintains his fundamental identity in this second outing. However, it is quite clear that Sheeran has taken pronounced creative risks—he balances his traditional guitar pieces and overbearing vocals with mainstream rhythms, while discussing more personal events in his songs. These choices have given rise to a bold, refreshing album that displays Sheeran’s versatility and maturity.
“X” elevates Sheeran from his folkish roots into more mainstream pop. This is most apparent in the lead single, “Sing,” an upbeat, peppy track produced by Pharrell Williams. Many have already likened “Sing” to Justin Timberlake’s solo debut single, “Like I Love You,” and the comparison is justified. “Sing” presents a more confident Sheeran who employs R&B and hip-hop-inspired, funky rhythms. The stellar vocals are expected of Sheeran, but the expanded use of percussive instruments and the more rabid techno feel of the song mark a welcome departure from Sheeran’s previous album.
Despite the novel influences, Sheeran also incorporates many of the core elements that made “+” a success. Numerous songs in the album follow the traditional Sheeran formula—rich vocals accompanied by soft guitar riffs—that fans have come to expect. However, the context of the songs have definitely changed: three years later, Sheeran has matured not only as a musician, but also as an individual, and this transition is well reflected in his sophomore album. Whereas the songs in “+” seemed more impersonal, Sheeran drew from real-life experiences in writing the songs for “X,” revealing a more private side of his life, battling loneliness in “I’m A Mess” and desperation in “Bloodstream.” In these narratives, Sheeran channels his raw emotions and this gives the overall album a greater impact.
Indeed, as a collection, Sheeran’s album paints a portrait of an artist questioning his work and his surroundings as he experiences heartache and loss. The most scathing of these songs is “Don’t,” a song about an anonymized significant other who cheated on Sheeran. “I never saw him as a threat / Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course,” Sheeran explicitly reveals in one of the verses. “Don’t” is no exception; other songs such as “I’m A Mess” and “Bloodstream” continue this theme of heartbreak and disorientation. Despite a consistent theme, each song is musically unique—“I’m A Mess” relies heavily on Sheeran’s powerful voice, whereas “Don’t” and “Bloodstream” make use of more upbeat rhythms with a diverse array of instruments and subtle techno mixes, building off Sheeran’s work in “Sing.”
After a slew of such pessimistic songs, Sheeran returns to the positive qualities of redemption and love in the closing tracks. This is most apparent in what is easily the highlight of the album, “Afire Love.” Drawing from his experiences with his grandfather’s battle with Alzheimer’s, Sheeran arranges an impressive song that reflects his versatility as a musician. He begins with a quiet and reflective voice as he sings, “Things were all good yesterday / And then the devil took your memory.” The pounding percussive instruments are prominent over Sheeran’s somber voice. As the song progresses, however, Sheeran begins to appreciate his own memories of his grandfather and recognizes the support and love of his family. This realization marks a decisive shift—Sheeran’s voice increases in volume and is accompanied by background vocalists and a diverse range of string instruments. The song ultimately concludes in an enthralling fashion with collective repetition of “All of my family rise from their seats to sing Hallelujah.” The use of the loop station is especially effective in this conclusion as it allows Sheeran to add impressive vocal embellishments.
Of course, no Sheeran album is complete without ballads and “X” does not disappoint. In particular, “Thinking Out Loud,” a dreamy ballad about growing old with a significant other, follows the footsteps of previous Sheeran classics such as “Kiss Me” in celebrating the magic that is love—“I’m thinking out loud / That maybe we found love right where we are.” Sheeran has revealed in interviews that “Thinking Out Loud” is his favorite song on the album, and it is easy to see why. The emphasis is placed on Sheeran’s lyrics and vocals, in stark contrast to (and balancing) the funky rhythms of “Sing.”
Sheeran’s “X” is a bold, ingenious album that builds off the success of his debut album in surprisingly innovative ways. Sheeran excels at what most other artists are wary of—he explicitly opens his life to the public eye by using direct experiences as influences for his songs. In doing so, Sheeran has crafted a masterful record that will be remembered as a pivotal transition in the development of his musical career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alt-R&B is very much in vogue these days. Just ask any hipster, and they’ll tell you—perhaps somewhat disgruntledly—that in 2014, ambient reverb tunnels, trendy percussive minimalism, and silky-smooth falsettos just as at home in the Top 40 as they are on urban radio stations and underground music blogs. The three-letter prefix “alt” denotes not only musical experimentalism and modernity in the decades-old genre, but also signals a broadening of the demographic of people who make (and possibly intake) it. There’s a reason The Awl called the term “a nice way of saying it’s R&B that white people like.” To be sure, there is certainly no dearth of black artists producing what’s become the new lifeblood of any urbane twenty-something’s apartment party mix (Frank Ocean, Dev Hynes, Solange, etc.). However, there’s no denying that the scene is expanding, including musicians who look nothing like the ‘80s R&B legends to whom they pay homage. They’re white guys with swooshy hair, university degrees, and impressively firm grasps on their most inner feelings. Most visibly, that’s James Blake, the male two-thirds of The xx, Sam Smith, and, if you know your stuff, Tom Krell of How To Dress Well.
Krell is distinguished even among this diverse group. Though often overlooked, his 2010 debut, “Love Remains,” was a dreamy, distortion-licked innovation that in many ways set the stage for the movement to mainstream that alt-R&B is now enjoying. His newest, “What Is This Heart?,” is a highly accomplished progression that retains the authenticity of his previous two albums while honing a radio-friendly approachability. How To Dress Well could be on the precipice of a major breakthrough in the genre that he helped prime the music world to embrace.
Among the aforementioned signifiers of this new age soul music—the minimalism, the techno production undertones, and the velvety vocals—there is another hallmark: deep, unflinching introspection. It’s something that Krell, a Ph.D. candidate in Philosophy, can be counted on to bring to any HTDW record. It’s evident in the album’s first track, a disquieting, stripped-down narrative of personal relationship strife (his mother, father, and two brothers get named-dropped) loosely handspun around folksy strumming and faint piano tinkling. With lyrics like “There’s no design, no God, / Just the future and my mother’s broken heart,” “2 Years On (Shame Dream)” is heady, moody, plucky, and might just leave the listener needing a cigarette break after its three-minute-and-49-second expanse. But that’s How To Dress Well in a nutshell. Krell’s music is largely self-directed: therapeutic, cathartic, and alarmingly unguarded. It wouldn’t work if not for the fact that the songs shimmer with such sleek and enticing iridescence on the surface. That phenomenon is emblemized by the likes of “Repeat Pleasure,” probably the band’s most radio-ready track, and “Face Again,” a real gem of synth-wobbling production.
Then again, when it comes to the freshness and immediate charm of the production, all of “What is this Heart?” sparkles. That’s due in no small part to the contributions of Rodaidh McDonald, whose Midas-touch production has helped propel the careers of British indie pop darlings The xx and King Krule. Particularly standout tracks include “Words I Don’t Remember,” a divinely ordained marriage of ‘90s DJ cut-and-paste and Maxwell-smooth delivery, and the soaring, almost industrial-sounding synths of “What You Wanted.” It’s the accessible quality of the production and mixing that keeps the album from veering into the esoteric, a problem that occasionally arose with the incomprehensible vocal distortion of 2010’s “Love Remains.”
The only time that the album truly falters is when it becomes so flooded in Krell’s sentimentality that it leaves the listener squinting for dry land. Make no mistakes, among How To Dress Well’s most alluring elements is its devotion to melancholic, always brutally honest emotion, but 55 minutes of moments like “Repeat Pleasure”’s falsetto cry of “even broken my heart will go on!” can yield an album that at times threatens to implode under the weight of its own inward-facing gaze. It also doesn’t help when the likes of “See You Fall” (long at three minutes and thoroughly uninteresting) and “Very Best Friend” (“You’re my baby want you to have it all / Want you to have my baby please don’t be appalled”) are thrown into the mix. With these blips forgiven, however, “What Is This Heart?” is a major triumph not only for HTDW, but also for alt-R&B, a genre so wide-reaching and gloriously diverse that it almost defies classification under a single masthead, but for all of its variety and mass appeal owes quite a bit to Tom Krell’s cutting sentimentality.
