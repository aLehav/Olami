Senior Paris K. Ellsworth ’15 is not playing it safe with his directorial debut, Samuel Beckett’s “Endgame.” While searching for the right script, Ellsworth saw Beckett’s revolutionary play “Waiting for Godot” on Broadway, which inspired him to further investigate the works of the Irish avant-garde writer. “‘Endgame’ seemed too good to be true for the college setting,” he says, highlighting the play’s absurdist, irreverent humor. The 80-minute one-act play will run May 1-9 in the Loeb Experimental Theater.
An example of “Theatre of the Absurd,” an experimental form of drama that dominated Europe in the 1950s and ’60s, “Endgame” presents unique challenges to the director and the cast in their quest to use the play’s ambiguous areas to make the audience think critically. “You can analyze the play all you want, and everyone will have a different interpretation,” Ellsworth says. The witty repartee exchanged between the blind tyrant Hamm (Joshuah B. “Soup” Campbell ’16) and his servant Clov (Dan S. Milaschewski ’17) and between Hamm’s dustbin-inhabiting parents Nagg (David A. Sheynberg ’16) and Nell (Ema H. Horvath ’16) will rely heavily on comedic timing to keep audiences entertained even when the thematic content of their dialogue verges on abstract. Beckett even acknowledges this dynamic in Hamm’s line, “The whole thing is comical, I grant you that. What about having a good guffaw, the two of us together?” Hamm and Clov’s ensuing antics aim to encourage the audience to join them in this pursuit.
Under Ellsworth’s careful instruction, cast members Campbell, Milaschewski, and Sheynberg seek to bring the same ecstatic energy they demonstrated in more elaborate productions like Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 2015 “¡Oops!...Madrid It Again” to a more intimate performance. Horvath rounds out the four-person cast, over whose members Ellsworth long deliberated. “[It seemed like it might be] impossible to find the right actors,” Ellsworth says. “I wanted them all mentally involved right away—not to just tell them what to do.” According to Ellsworth, the poetry, metaphors, and symbolism the play contains force the cast to spend more time rehearsing each scene than might be necessary in a more traditional production. Despite the lengthy process, the cast’s enthusiasm for the material is evident in their on-stage presence. Campbell adds, “Absurdist humor appeals to my sensibilities—you never know where the banter is going until you get there.”
The cast points out that “Endgame” features a particularly minimalist style in part because Beckett originally wrote it in French, a language in which he had not yet achieved total fluency. Campbell, who read the play in both English and French prior to beginning rehearsals, said that the two versions differ mainly in the pace of dialogue delivery. “The turns of phrase in the quick back-and-forth are slightly different—the play is really quite musical, and the rhythm differs across the French and the Irish-inflected English.”
“Endgame” seeks to baffle and intrigue audiences, while piquing their interest in a lesser-known style of dramatic production and showcasing the talents of its small-but-powerful cast and its inexperienced-but-dedicated director. The cast hopes that Beckett’s unusual, offbeat humor will both challenge and entertain audiences.

The lights go up on a scene that seems typical enough: Two high-school friends now in their late twenties, wearing heels and tight dresses, stumble onstage into the penthouse suite of a hotel. The opening scenes of the play chronicle an amped-up night out that later degenerates into a dark comedy as three old friends reunite the night before a mutual friend’s wedding. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Company’s production of “Bachelorette,” which runs April 24 to May 5 in Farkas Hall, features evocative performances by a polished cast that tell a story far deeper than that of a mere bachelorette party.
“Bachelorette,” written by Leslye Headland, has a script full of comedic dexterity, which the cast executes particularly well in the first half of the show when the tone is significantly lighter. The first scene opens with revelry as the two girls, Katie (Hannah Ades ’18) and Gena (Yasmeen E. Audi ’15), are joined by a third friend, Regan (Elise M. Baranouski ’16). The suite they occupy belongs to the absent bride-to-be, Becky (Rachel C. Talamo ’18); Regan is her maid of honor and has invited Katie and Gena, who were not invited to the wedding. The conversation between the three women takes a turn into acute jealousy and malicious gossip. The script’s comedy is both funnier and darker than that found in the extensive “bridesmaids” chick-flick genre, though it deals with the same material. In time, the play adds depth to the pettiness, and all three women navigate the threshold between jealousy and humor with believable chemistry.
Intermittently consuming copious amounts of narcotic substances, the girls reveal loaded moments from their pasts. All have hidden agendas that propel them towards the jealousy shown on stage, and each actor accomplishes a blending of comedy and the darker underlayer of their character fairly seamlessly. In the second scene, Regan’s acquaintances Jeff (Sam A. Hagen ’18) and Joe (Kennedy F. Q. Edmonds ’17), join her and Katie upstairs. The emotional complexity of the play builds in a conversation between Katie and Joe, while the sexually tense dynamic between Regan and Jeff adds a different dimension. All four actors successfully convey the unvoiced currents of this scene to bring the play into a realm beyond that of its largely comedic opening.
The production elements of the show work cohesively to enhance its impact. The set design is minimalist—the only nonessential element is a large bouquet of roses—but nevertheless delicately artistic. The staging, while not particularly innovative, utilizes the layout of the set effectively in order to enhance the dynamics among the characters. In particular, the lighting is fundamental in intensifying the impression of key moments in the dialogue, which coincide with tension-packed beats of silence.
The cast features stellar performances all around. Baranouski is compellingly dislikeable in her role as the cold-hearted manipulator, while Ades skillfully conveys her character’s increasing emotional instability, making her role more complex than that of a funny drunk girl.  Hagen plays the part of a scheming smooth talker to the hilt, while Edmonds increases the relevance and perceived stakes of the play when his character reveals stories from his past to Katie. The performances of Audi and Talamo, particularly in the climactic scene, also feature polished yet raw emotions ranging from tenderness to anger.
The theme of female friendships fueled by jealousy and bitterness is familiar turf for plays and literary work, but this production takes both the comedic and darker aspects of these themes and pushes them into extremely evocative territory. Ultimately, the result is a show that is a thrilling emotional roller coaster for the audience, accomplishing both comedic levity and emotional depth with remarkable ease.

Charged with heart-wrenching emotion and earnest appreciation for the wonder of life, “Middletown,” which runs April 24 to May 2 on the Loeb mainstage, excels both as an engaging production and as a broadly resonant contemplation of humanity itself. What begins as a comical tour through a comfortable, generic town characterized by nothing more than a pleasant sameness and mediocrity quickly becomes a reflection of the subtle but ever-present existential anxiety that underlies everyday life.
The play revolves around the lives of several ordinary citizens of Middletown: Mary (Taylor Kay Phillips ’15), a woman who is soon to become a mother; John Dodge (JJ S. Longcroft ’15), a handy-man between jobs and searching for human recognition; and an alcoholic mechanic (Aidan C. Campbell ’17), filled with unrealized ambition. The cast portrays each character with intensity, realizing them with distinct individuality by paying special attention to their distinct parts, such as John’s rapid hobby switching or the town police officer’s way of remembering the identities of the townspeople by recalling their addresses. In doing so, the actors emphasize relatable pieces of each character.
The first act begins slowly. It plods along, alternating between metaphysical musings and quips on the absurdity of modern life. While the writing of the production itself is witty, the play’s brand of existential humor would likely have fallen flat without each cast member’s quick and smooth delivery, which ensured laughs from the audience. At one point, Campbell talks about his volunteering at the hospital, saying, “It was part of a plea deal, but then again, what isn’t?” While this might sound like a facile or trite joke, Campbell’s natural delivery of the line, combined with a strong sense of cohesion with his cast members, makes these quips sound more like natural musings than contrived platitudes trying to masquerade as comedy.
The production team’s creative choices shine in the second act, when musings about the wonder of life are replaced by each character’s fight against the inescapable feeling of loneliness. The stage, which extends to the audience’s seats, brings a sense of intimacy to the production as actors come and leave through the same exits used by the audience. The cast uses this proximity to their advantage, almost interacting directly with the audience. This further breaks down the emotional barriers between the actors and the audience, making the production feel more like a real event and less like a play, a technique that is especially effective in the more dramatic second act. The original music, composed by Samuel C. Pottash ’16 for the production, emulates quiet, atmospheric ’90s guitar-driven indie rock. While largely bland, the soundtrack occasionally hints at complexity through undertones of anxiety, which feel appropriate for the setting and sameness of “Middletown” and fit in with the show’s ethos.
However, what truly shines about this performance is the earnestness of its acting. As the mechanic, Campbell delivers a powerful and self-aware performance about his own failures in life, his desire for human connection, and his own modest ambitions. His wish to just “calmly know love on Earth” is conveyed with such raw vulnerability and emotion as to lend credibility to something that sounds like a mere platitude. Likewise, Longcroft’s performance as John is wrenching in its sincerity. He succeeds in showing John’s self-awareness, both of his own simplicity and his failures. As John contemplates his desire for human recognition with total openness and frankness, it is utterly impossible to not empathize with his character.
Middletown” is a play that could very easily have fallen into the trap of triteness, of poorly delivered philosophical musings that everyone has wrestled with, failed to resolve, and simply decided to mask forever. Instead, the production, by putting these emotions and questions into context through powerful acting in the context of a well-constructed and engaging set, gives them a voice. In a world where it has become gauche to acknowledge the need for human connection and childlike to wonder about the sublime beauty of life, this production of “Middletown” takes the risk to address these questions head on and with authenticity.

My freshman year, I dabbled. I knew I wanted to major in math, so why not shop around first? I took classes exclusively in fields I’d never touched before, and it was addictive. I did it again sophomore year: complex analysis, road to the White House, computational linguistics, jazz harmony, history of sexuality. Each class was exciting and new.
At some point, I realized my concentration requirements weren’t adding up. I switched to economics, then to applied math, and finally to government, after seriously considering linguistics, music, and philosophy along the way.
Why was this a choice I had to make?
At this school, we’re often reminded of former University President Lowell’s scholarly ideal: “to know a little of everything and something well.” We think of it as a justification for the general education system, but in 1910 it meant something different. It ushered in the new system of concentrations, in response to the rise of skills-oriented colleges like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Lowell worried that Harvard’s well-rounded scholars were economically useless, so he forced them to pick a track and stick to it. Colleges around the nation followed suit.
A century later, it’s high time we consider whether this is a good policy.
I don’t particularly want to know one thing very well. I want to have adequate working knowledge of just about everything. I want to know enough that I can engage with your passion, whatever it is, and bring my perspective to the table in an informed way.
If it were optional to pursue a concentration—and it should be—I would decline and I would advise most students to do the same.
First, some practical points. Only 27 percent of college graduates work in a field related to their major, less than the 30 percent who will likely work in jobs that don’t yet exist. To the extent that your major is correlated with your income, this is mostly selection bias: those drawn to major in math are similarly drawn to work in finance. Barring pre-professional tracks, your choice of major should not noticeably impact your life prospects.
More importantly, academia is in desperate need of cross-pollination. The concentration system, along with the graduate school system it feeds into, fosters tribalism. If all you know is economics, it’s all too easy to dismiss sociology as methodologically flimsy or unnecessary. Institutional barriers beget intellectual barriers.
This endangers progress. When everyone contributing to a field has been fed through the same pipeline, who will question the orthodoxy? Who will propose a new lens through which to view an old problem? Some of the greatest breakthroughs of human thought have come from a synthesis of concepts previously deemed unrelated.
Many fear a loss of autonomy for their fields—most commonly, an invasion of the humanities by the sciences. This fear is not unfounded. Empirical discoveries have a tendency to be overhyped, overstretched, over-applied. The quantum nature of reality has no bearing on international politics. Merely because poems are composed of phonemes doesn’t mean we need a lecture on glottal stops in a course on Keats.
But often the breakthroughs in one field can inform the assumptions of another. A better understanding of human decision-making should certainly temper our belief in the brand of hyper-rationality taught in economics courses. And the explanatory power of biological evolution must constrain the scope and nature of religious doctrine. We should not fear intellectual outsiders. We should welcome them with healthy skepticism.
On a personal level, though, there’s another reason I’d rather dabble than delve. Looking at the world through a wide-angle lens reminds me that the compartmentalization of knowledge into discrete fields is a human convenience. The borders are porous. Everything—everything!—is derived from the same foundations, layered in complex, fascinating ways. The understanding that all the pieces are part of one bigger puzzle—that the world is a coherent, unified, intelligible whole—is life-affirming, awe-inspiring, and at its core, beautiful.
Coloring in as much of that picture as possible, leaving no black box unopened—that’s why I’m here. For me at least, that’s immensely more satisfying than the marginal returns from a fourteenth math class.
So when I tell you I switched to the major with the fewest requirements, I’m not being as cynical as you think. You might even consider doing the same.

Last weekend, Harvard College put itself on display for admitted students during its annual Visitas weekend. While the breadth of opportunities prospective students were able to consider was undoubtedly impressive, we believe it is not particularly reflective of what life is like at Harvard. As far as weekends at Harvard go, Visitas is far from typical, and students should know that at Harvard they will not typically shuttle between events starting every hour on the hour. Still, the most crucial takeaway for admitted students is that even a normal Harvard weekend is reason enough to spend four years of college here.
Even though Visitas is unlike any normal weekend here, its current structure is valuable. Visitas provides a necessary resource for admitted students as they make their college decisions, allowing them to get a feel for what life at Harvard could be like, and what activities and opportunities their Harvard experiences might include.
At their heart, however, weekends at Harvard are the best time for students to take advantage of Harvard’s greatest resource: fellow students. Weekends here are about spending time with incredibly thoughtful and interesting friends. To us, Harvard is where people get together and support their friends at plays and concerts before going out to social events with extracurricular groups on a Friday or Saturday night. It’s where you can win an all-expenses paid trip to Puerto Rico that leaves the next morning with a $10 raffle ticket at a party in Lowell House. Those of us not lucky enough to be relaxing by a Puerto Rican beach on Sunday spend three hours at brunch with friends, eating waffles with the Harvard crest on them.
Harvard is where Sunday night dinners meander well past their ostensible 7:30 end time, after which the true Harvard Sunday night experience begins in Lamont Library, where everybody ends up in the cafe together eating pastries, drinking coffee, and working on papers and problem sets. And of course, we all get together to watch Last Week Tonight or Game of Thrones on the free HBO streaming service available to all students.
Everything that makes Harvard special centers around the community of people who live here. As Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana told the Class of 2018 at their convocation last fall, the Harvard experience should be "transformational," not "transactional." The best way to have that transformational experience is to take advantage of the incredible professors, teaching fellows, Harvard employees, and classmates who care about us as people and foster our personal and intellectual growth.
While Visitas undoubtedly gave admitted students an introduction to some of the organizations to which we devote so much of our time , it is far from a typical weekend. We love Harvard because it has become our home. We hope you make the right decision and make it yours too.

My grandmother taught me how to be “black woman”.
Out loud, she taught me that being black woman meant making the best caramel cake in the entire congregation. I remember that lesson perhaps the most clearly. Poking my head into her room every fifteen minutes for a couple of hours, nervously tugging my uncomfortable pantyhose around my chubby thighs, asking “Is the cake cool enough to ice now Grandma? I know I just asked but it’s been, like, forever.”
Being black woman meant sitting on the itchy carpet of our living room every Sunday (silently weeping) while she carefully worked a comb through my tangled curls. She taught me through tea parties, long flowered dresses, big church hats, and fake pearls. Through afternoons spent clipping the ends off of string beans, through “I know it’s an awful lot of sugar, what else do you think is gonna make it taste good?”, through fans wagging in church pews, through attitude as spicy as her collard greens, and through taking no shit, from no one, never. She taught me through speaking up, holding her place in line, getting what she asked for, being hard, and being heard. Basically, my grandma taught me badassery.
And there are things my grandma taught me quietly. I learned from my grandma that being black woman meant a whole lot of tears. I learned the quiet, loving rage with which she replied to every letter she received from any of her sons in prison.
Being black woman, my grandma taught me, meant building an empire. Seven-children strong, dressing beautiful black babies in pure white bonnets and teaching them royalty, having them photographed often, even and especially when she could not afford it, swearing all of her matriarchal queendom into existence, and watching the neighborhood swallow black baby after beautiful black baby. Watching systems of oppression steal from her what she fought every day to build.
On Monday, Freddie Gray was laid down to rest.
I think of my Grandma in her deaconess uniform. I didn't know her back then, but she used to be almost six feet tall, judging by the photographs. I think of the too many black folks my grandma laid to rest, the too many funeral services she had to wag her fan at, the too many funeral hymns she knows by heart.
I heard it so often from my grandma, and from my mom, and from so many beautiful, regal black women in my life that it never seemed strange to me. “If anyone hurts you, I will be in prison the next day.” That unquestionable rage, that’s black woman.
A while ago, a lot of posters were put up on dorm doors with lines from poems that I can’t help but assume many of the inhabitants of those dorms never bothered to read. One was “Not an Elegy for Mike Brown” by Danez Smith, in which Smith says, “& isn’t that what being black is about?/ not the joy of it, but the feeling/ you get when you are looking/ at your child, turn your head,/ then poof, no more child./ that feeling, that’s black.”
I don’t understand all that much about black femininity. I worry, often at poetry slams, that I’m not doing this whole “black woman” thing right. Then again, if I am getting something right about this whole “black woman” thing, it is the worry.
When black people get killed, my white Facebook friends from home get to be upset about riots. They get to post videos of black people weeping, and shouting, and setting shit on fire and call it foolishness, quietly tsk-ing their tongues and shaking their heads from the safety of their dorm rooms. They get to believe the newscasters and feel bad for all those poor, poor windowpanes and police cars and doorknobs that are clearly the main victims of police brutality. Meanwhile, I’m starting to look a lot like my grandma, rocking silently in front of my laptop as she did in front of the radio, or the stove, waiting for all her babies to come home.
On Monday, I went to a reading by Claudia Rankine for her newest book, “Citizen: An American Lyric” which is a very important book about living through a lifetime of racist microagressions, and how those microagressions are the same violence that leads to black people being killed, and the astonishing rates of violence against black transwomen, queer people of color, and people of color in general. She was introduced by two white women, both of whom talked about their sorrow over this terrible “year” of injustice. When black people get killed, white people get to talk about this “year” of injustice. This one year.
I was expecting Claudia Rankine, the author, to be a fierce, relentless, lighthouse of a woman. Like my grandma, like what I understand of black femininity. But as I watched her speak about this book to a completely packed room of people of whom about six were people of color, I was generally dissatisfied by the gap between the voice I heard in her writing and the catering, pleasant, “giving all these white academics a space to laugh while a photo of a lynching is on the screen,” voice I heard in the room. I started to think about my grandma, and how she used to be six-feet-tall, and I understand how age and arthritis work but I also understand the weight of constant trauma on a black woman.
My grandma is old, y’all. She’s a gentle, lovely lady. She is also fiery as hell. If I talked to her about Freddie Gray, or the list of black men and boys who have been killed by cops this year, she could give me a list as many times longer as she is older than one year. If I talked to her about Mya Hall, or the long list of black trans women who have been killed by cops this year, the long list of black people of all other genders who have been killed by cops this year, the angry, fiery tears she would hold back, the clenched jaw—
That. That’s what my grandma has taught me about black feminism. And I don’t think my grandma condones all this “black violence” against all these inanimate objects. But I also don’t think she gives a shit. Her babies are dying.

Publishing at Harvard has almost as long a history as the University itself.
Harvard College became home to the first printing press in the American colonies in 1641, when the school’s first president, Henry Dunster, married the widow of Massachusetts’ first printer. In 1913, the Harvard Corporation established Harvard University Press, the University’s publishing house. Since then, the press has published the works of such scholars and writers as T.S. Eliot, John Rawls, Toni Morrison, and E.O. Wilson.
Yet despite its long history, Harvard’s venerable press today faces a period of profound transition common across the American publishing industry. To continue to fulfill its mission as it begins its second century, Harvard University Press is rethinking and modernizing the methods of academic publishing while maintaining its traditional standards for the works that carry the Harvard name on their spines.
NOT FOR PROFIT
While stagnant print sales, pricing disputes with online vendors, and the shuttering of independent bookstores over the past decade have placed pressure on commercial publishers’ bottom lines, Harvard University Press has the freedom to publish for purposes other than profit. HUP operates according to a different economic logic than commercial publishers: The press is endowed and under the jurisdiction of the University Provost’s office as a part of the larger non-profit corporation of the University.
“For-profit publishers face the challenge of satisfying shareholders, while our biggest challenge is to ensure that we publish works of the highest enduring scholarly value,” Director of Harvard University Press William P. Sisler wrote in an email.
“The audience for our books can range from the hundreds of thousands to a few thousand,” Sisler wrote.
Sharmila Sen ’92, executive editor-at-large at HUP, said that the press’s reason for publishing any particular book is largely independent of the size of the audience it will reach.
“Finely argued, technical, specialist books will have an audience in the hundreds. And that’s fine, because a lot of works in scholarship that have gone on to change the world began as very academic ideas that only a select few people understood or were willing to grapple with,” she said. “But their impact is now felt around the world.”
“HUP is one of the few presses that straddles the difference between trade publishing and academic publishing,” said Steven Mintz, professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin and author of The Prime of Life: A History of Modern Adulthood, published by HUP this year. “It’s one of the few presses that both has a rigorous academic review process and can reach a larger readership.”
Still, sales of academic books are difficult to predict, he said.
“Sometimes books are caught by the cultural breeze, and they connect with a broader readership; they speak to where the public is—and sometimes they don’t,” he said. “If you’re expecting to make a profit, you’re doomed to disappointment.”
HUP’s largest-ever sales success was the English-language translation of Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” which reached number one on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list in 2014.
Most of the books published by HUP, however, sell in far smaller quantities to more academic audiences, but the press increasingly seeks to publish for a broader readership base, both in terms of interest and geography.
Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, a professor of English literature at Oxford University whose book "The Story of Alice: Lewis Carroll and the Secret History of Wonderland" will be published by HUP later this spring, said he imagines an audience of average readers rather than scholars for his book.
“This isn’t an academic study,” he said.
Other authors also emphasized the need for academic publishers to seek markets outside the world of higher education.
“I really don’t believe that professors should write only for themselves,” said Peter Brown, professor emeritus of history at Princeton who published with HUP this year.
Beyond publishing for audiences outside of its traditional academic base, HUP is also expanding into new markets on a global scale: It is the first American academic publisher to have an office in South Asia.
“We view our presence in South Asia as part of our mission as a global publisher to ensure that our books reach the widest possible audience,” wrote Susan Donnelly, HUP’s director of sales and marketing, in an email.
Donnelly added, “In order to make our books as accessible as possible to this readership, we offer certain titles...in special editions for the South Asia market at a lower price.”
STAMP OF APPROVAL
In recent years, self-publishing has become both more common and more profitable for writers. In a 2011 letter to shareholders about Kindle Direct Publishing, Amazon’s self-publishing platform, Jeffrey P. Bezos, CEO of Amazon, wrote, “Even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation.”
But despite the paradigm shift brought about by the rise of self-publishing, HUP has maintained the traditionally high standards and rigorous review process of an academic press.
“The standards are very high, and it’s important that they be high, because after all, these books carry the Harvard name on their spines when they go out into the world. They have to match the reputation of this university,” said editor Sharmila Sen.
Once an author submits his or her work, it is read by at least two anonymous peer reviewers, to whose comments the author must present a written response. HUP’s Board of Syndics, comprised of members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the professional schools, must then give the book final approval, according to Sisler.
The Harvard name attached to a writer’s work also offers HUP’s authors the kind of institutional backing that self-published authors forego.
“It means a great deal, especially to a young scholar, to be published by Harvard, because it's an old and well-known press with high standards,” said University professor Helen H. Vendler, who has published with HUP since 1963.
While self-publishing has opened the field of authorship to anyone with a laptop, HUP works primarily with academics. Many Harvard faculty publish with HUP—the summer 2015 catalogue includes books by Vendler, History of Art and Architecture professor Robin Kelsey, and English professor Gordon Teskey—though Harvard faculty do not receive any official preference from HUP, according to Sisler.
Despite the primarily academic background of the writers the press publishes, Sen emphasized that in her work as an editor she seeks the broadest possible authorship.
“I work very hard to seek people out, especially people who are doing interesting work in emerging fields or in other countries,” she said. “One of the things I really believe in is that diversity and a global perspective are important in scholarship today.”
For his part, Peter Brown, the Princeton history professor emeritus, affirmed the continued importance of academic publishers as guarantors of quality in a diverse, expanding information economy.
“Good academic books really feed people. They can stimulate people’s imaginations, they can form them,” he said. “If good academic books aren’t published…it’s as if we’re feeding our imaginations on Twinkies.”
A DIGITAL AGE
As self-publishing has expanded over the last decade, digital publication has also become vastly more widespread, and digital formats have left their own profound mark on the American publishing industry. By 2014, e-books accounted for 27.2 percent of adult trade book sales, according to the Association of American Publishers. And now, like other publishers, HUP is seeking new opportunities in this increasingly digital world.
“We see digital formats as an important means of reaching readers and furthering scholarship,” Sisler wrote.
In September 2014, HUP launched the digital version of the Loeb Classical Library, a collection of over 500 volumes of Greek and Latin texts with facing-page translations that the press has published since 1934.
“Partly that was to make it searchable…and partly just to give access in a world where digital resources are clearly—if not taking the place of place of printed books—at least living side by side. For people who live through their iPhones or tablets or computers, having the Loeb be available there was something we wanted to do,” said Richard F. Thomas, Harvard Classics professor and trustee of the Loeb Classical Library. He added that he considers the digital library a success so far.
However, Thomas and others also express reservations about new technologies. For a series whose mission is to preserve the past, rapidly evolving digital formats can be frighteningly impermanent, he said.
“[The digital library] doesn’t remove the need for libraries to be collecting and archiving. With the Loeb, we’re going to have to be careful of time, so that the platform and the technology are able to evolve over time and still be accessible,” said Thomas.
For her part, Helen H. Vendler said she is skeptical of the applicability of digital formats to academic books.
“It's not clear, given the expense of publishing a book and the problematic future of e-books...what the future will look like.  I can't imagine a life without books one can handle and consult with ease,” she said.
Given the mix of problems and potential advantages Thomas and Vendler said they see offered by new reading technologies, the future of scholarly publishing in the digital age remains an open question.
“Academic presses help to push knowledge forward and to record and distribute our intellectual accomplishments in robust, handy, and durable forms,” said Kelsey, the HAA professor who will be published by HUP this spring. “I sure hope they can find ways to thrive in the era of digitalization.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 29, 2015, at 5:52 p.m.
This year’s freshman formal, which will take place Wednesday on the Science Center Plaza, will feature an “incidents tent” near the main event for students seeking medical treatment, according to formal co-chair Gretty Garcia ’18.
Traditionally held in Boston, organizers decided to hold the annual event on campus in anticipation of concerns from Boston hotels about liability risks that could arise from hosting the formal. In addition to the introduction of the incidents tent, the location change resulted in several other security and financial shifts for this year’s iteration of the event, said Garcia and fellow co-chair, Wyatt M. Robertson ’18.
Garcia and Roberts, along with members of the First-Year Social Committee, have been planning the formal since late November, Garcia said. But without a hotel host to help with logistical planning, they have seen an increased workload in preparing for the event, according to Katherine W. Steele, the College’s director for freshman programming. Steele oversees the event alongside the FYSC.
Though security measures will be similar to last year, private hotel security will be replaced by the Harvard University Police Department and Securitas, according to Steele.
“We had a meeting with Securitas and HUPD and they really do have our best interest in mind,” Garcia said. “HUPD was super supportive and they really do want us to have a good time.”
The new “incidents tent” will also potentially treat intoxicated students, preventing a trip to University Health Services, Garcia said.
Tickets for the event will cost $25 per person, a decrease from last year’s price of $30. According to Robertson and Garcia, several students have expressed curiosity as to why ticket prices are still so high, despite expected savings from the lack of fees for a hotel rental and transportation into Boston.
Still, Garcia and Robertson said expenses associated with hosting the event on campus abound. Costs include renting the dance floor; paying for HUPD and Securitas presence; hiring an electrician; food; decorations; and music, according to Garcia and Robertson. The tent alone cost about $2,500 to rent.
“A lot of money goes toward the deejay, who is from Kiss 108 and one of the most prominent deejays,” Robertson said, “which is expensive because he is bringing all his own AV equipment and lighting and music and everything.”
The deejay, Dave Casanave, was also the deejay for last year’s formal, Steele said.
“One thing that was FYSC’s goal was to make the event as inexpensive as possible for everyone,” Steele said. “They don’t want anyone to feel like going to the formal is not possible for them, but there are these costs we have to deal with.”
Steele said the FYSC hopes ticket sales will break even with the costs of the formal. She said she hopes about 1,200 students will attend.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that paying for CrimsonEMS presence was a cost for the freshman formal. In fact, CrimsonEMS is a volunteer, free service.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an ever-changing legal market, more than 96 percent of Harvard Law School’s class of 2014 is employed, continuing a years-long trend that, Mark A. Weber, the assistant dean for career services at the Law School, said he thinks will persist when the class of 2015 crosses the stage in May.
Employment numbers, published on the Law School’s website, for the class of 2014 track employment 9 months after graduation, and are mostly consistent with figures for the classes of 2013 and 2012. Once again, the total employment rate hovered around 96 percent and the majority—60.92 percent—of Law School graduates moved on to work at law firms, earning a median salary of $160,000.
This median salary at law firms—which is also the median, but not average, salary for all 2014 Law School graduates—does not represent additional “bonus” pay, according to Weber.
“Somebody could be making anywhere from a 10 to 25 thousand dollar bonus, so you’re getting closer to 200 thousand dollars right out at school,” he said.
Behind law firms, judicial clerkships were the second most popular form of employment for the class of 2014, earning a median income of $60,000 as clerks.
The average salary for a 2014 Law School graduate is $120,983, a slight uptick from previous years.
The Law School and the University provided funding to a larger number of recent graduates from the Class of 2014 than previous years. For the class of 2014, 30 students, or 5.12 percent of students, received funding from Harvard, as opposed to 22 and 19 students in the classes of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Weber said that this change represents an increase in the number of students who received a “nominal” amount of funding in addition to other forms of employment.
“In all of those cases, they had other employment, but we still had to treat it as being law school funded,” he said.
Because of this increase in Law School and University funding, Weber said the number of students in public interest employment went up. In the class of 2013, 43 students were employed with jobs classified as “public interest”; in the class of 2014, 60 students went into this kind of work.
Still, while some numbers shifted with the class of 2014, Weber said it is “remarkable that the numbers are so similar on a year to year basis.” For the class of 2015, who will graduate soon, Weber said this is good news.
“When they’re graduating, and getting their diploma, the vast majority of our students know what they will be doing,” he said.

Claudine Gay, a professor of Government and African and African American Studies, will become the divisional dean of social science for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on July 1.
Gay joined the Government Department in 2006 and is currently its director of graduate studies. She received her Ph.D. from that department in 1998. Prior to joining the Harvard Faculty, Gay spent six years in the department of political science at her undergraduate alma mater Stanford University, where she received tenure.
Gay said she made the decision to take on the position within the past 10 days, after making considerations about her family. Now, she said she is focused on learning more about the position from colleagues within the division.
“Right now I am very focused on just listening and learning from my colleagues, and through that I am coming to a better sense for what some of the challenges are,” Gay said.
She will replace Sociology professor Peter V. Marsden, who has held the position since 2010 and is now stepping down at the end of his five-year term. Gay will become the fourth dean to lead the Social Science division, which was established in 2003 under then-FAS Dean William C. Kirby, and the first woman to lead the division.
The division includes 10 departments and degree committees as well as numerous museums, institutes, and research centers. The departments include Government, Economics, and History, some of the largest in FAS.
“[Gay] has been a trusted adviser on faculty and decanal searches, serving on or chairing many review and search committees,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in the press release. “As divisional dean, Professor Gay will continue her efforts to strengthen the faculty and advance our teaching and research missions.”
Janet Browne, chair of the History of Science department, said that Gay’s background will serve the Social Science departments well.
“She brings with her a different set of communities from Harvard, which is a benefit,” she said, mentioning her position as a Government professor.
Government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere said that he was optimistic about her deanship.
“She wants to integrate research and teaching more and has a real commitment to diversity in the faculty, as well as a strong sense of equity and fairness,” he said, “and I am sure those will be brought to bear.”
“She will bring great energy, imagination, and judgment to the office,” Marsden wrote of his successor in an email.
Gay was elected to the Faculty Council, the highest elected body in FAS, in April and is currently scheduled to begin that term July 1 as well, though at this point Gay said that “there are many details that still need to be sorted out” and that she “would most likely step away from the Faculty Council position.”

As part of the Economics Department’s Seymour E. and Ruth B. Harris Lecture Series, Stanford economics professor Susan Athey lectured on new methods of including machine learning in econometrics late Tuesday afternoon.
Athey’s lecture focused on the wide variety of applications that machine learning—the use of algorithms to analyze and draw predictions from data—could have on everything from online analytics with search engines and auctions to isolating causal effects in medical trials.
Athey is the economics of technology professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, where she currently researches the design of auction-based marketplaces and the economics of the internet. She was a professor of Economics at Harvard between 2006 and 2012.
In recent years, Athey has furthered her research by doing analytics and experiments with technology firms. She described her experience working with Microsoft as “like getting another PhD.”
During her time with various tech firms in applying machine learning to analyzing search engines and online auctions, she said she found a significant lack of fellow economists working in her research field.
However, Athey explained that she believes that economics and econometrics combined with machine learning could improve data analysis for these tech firms.
“Data is the domain of machine-learning people,” Athey said. Data that is analyzed without careful consideration of the methods used to calculate error could generate less accurate results, she added.
“It is really important to not just throw in this machine-learning method off the shelf,” Athey warned.
The Seymour E. and Ruth B. Harris Lecture Series is managed by the Economics Department and invites distinguished academics to lecture on topics that would interest professional economists, according to former department chair John Y. Campbell, who helps organize the series.

Reggie Love, President Barack Obama’s “body man” for more than four years, shared personal anecdotes from his time staffing the President during a speech at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday.
In an event moderated by Institute of Politics spring fellow Jay Newton-Small, Love reflected on lessons learned at Obama’s side as his personal aide, during which time he was responsible for “everything from [Obama’s] wallet to his personal device, briefing books, to making sure his luggage gets to the plane to the car to the hotel, to making sure he eats three meals a day,” Love said.
While working as a staffer, Love, a former Duke basketball player, said he developed a unique friendship with the President over the sport, even earning the nickname as the President’s “little brother.”
“What we’ll do is we’ll have the President play basketball with local firefighters and police officers in a morning game, and we’ll earn their respect and their vote,” Love said, recounting one experience of shooting hoops in New Hampshire.
Love also spoke about an episode where he lost the President’s briefcase, leaving it in Florida while on a campaign trip to South Carolina. He listed a series of mishaps and reiterated the idea of persevering through obstacles.
“I have a whole list of mistakes that were made, everything from pages of speeches being left out of binders, the teleprompter operator falling asleep, to the teleprompter glass breaking,” Love said.
One audience member asked Love how he was able to separate his personal and professional relationship with the President, while another thanked him for offering a human image of Obama.
While reflecting on the amount of media the President watches, Love recounted a particularly interesting email he received one night while working the White House.
“He consumes so much. I remember one day I got an email at one o’clock in the morning in the White House from the President of the United States and he says: what’s up with these ‘Buried Life’ guys,” Love said, referring to the television show on MTV.
A witness to many of the political accomplishments over the President’s tenure, Love emphasized the importance of remaining grounded in the community in understanding issues.
“None of these issues are won or lost on CNN,” he said. “These issues are won or lost in churches, or living rooms, town hall meetings, and places like here.”

Dozens of students gathered on the steps of Langdell Hall on Tuesday night for a brief vigil commemorating the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Md.
The vigil, organized by the Black Law Students Association and the Harvard Ferguson Action Coalition, consisted of two speakers and spanned from 9:45 to 10 p.m. in order to coincide with the 10 p.m. city-wide curfew announced by the mayor of Baltimore following the governor of Maryland’s declaration of a state of emergency.
Gray, a 25-year-old black man, died in police custody on Sunday after having suffered a spinal cord injury following his arrest on April 12. The aftermath of his death resulted in an outbreak of riots and violence in the streets of Baltimore, calling for an end to police brutality.
“We’ve gathered here today just to ask for peace,” said Leland S. Shelton in the opening remarks of the vigil. Shelton is a Law School student, member of BLSA, and resident of Baltimore who helped organize the event.
“Peace is what we ask our police officers, those who have sworn to serve and protect, those who we have sworn to keep the peace,” said Shelton. “It’s ironic because those same people are the ones who have been harassing and brutalizing us.”
Several students at the vigil held banners with phrases like “End White Supremacy,” “Your Peace is Violence,” and “Can You Breathe?”
“This is not just about Baltimore city, or Ferguson, or Staten Island,” said Shelton, adding that he thinks police brutality is a phenomenon that affects communities across America.
BLSA collected donations during the vigil and intends to send the contributions to bail funds and food pantries in Baltimore. Shelton indicated that they will also be benefitting the organization Baltimore United, which provides bail and legal support in the area.
The riots, which have been widely covered by the press, have seen the destruction of private property, looting of local businesses, and vandalization of police cars.
“It’s real funny to watch these streets you grew up in destroyed,” said Calvin Young, a second year student at Harvard Business School.  “But it’s just as tough to see young people who grew up in these streets just like yourself, angry and upset because of oppression that they’ve felt forever.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On paper it seemed like Dartmouth (14-10, 5-2) had pulled off a major upset against the Harvard (19-7, 5-2) men’s tennis team. The No. 45 Big Green beat the No. 34 Crimson, 4-3, at the Boss Tennis Center at Dartmouth, leaving both schools tied for second place in the Ivy League behind champion Columbia.
However, the scores don’t tell the full story.
Dartmouth gained an early advantage after opening the afternoon with two straight doubles wins. Sophomore Brian Yeung and freshman Jean Thirouin gave Harvard their only doubles win of the day by defeating their Big Green opponents, 6-4.
“Dartmouth had a tremendous fraternity crowd out there…. There’s a large home court advantage,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “We lost the doubles point by the closest of margins, and we’ve been actually losing the doubles points by bigger margins, so I was very proud of their efforts.”
The Crimson rallied and fought back from behind, proceeding to garner three straight victories in the singles matches. Yeung proceeded to notch another win for the Crimson by beating his singles opponent Diego Pedraza, 6-4, 6-3, while co-captain Alex Steinroeder won his match in straight sets. Freshman Kenny Tao added to the winning streak by winning 7-5, 6-3, over Dartmouth’s George Wall.
“I was really proud of our guys, just disappointed in the outcome,” Fish said. “They played like heroes to get in and have a chance to win. Yes, [the loss] was disappointing, but boy, their efforts were tremendous to come so close. Hats off to Dartmouth, we did everything we could but sometimes the ball just bounces the other way.”
Despite junior Nicky Hu’s solid efforts, the Big Green recaptured the momentum when Hu was bested by Chris Kipouras. Hu managed to take the first set, 6-4, but fell in the next two, 6-2, 6-4. Hu was even ahead, 4-1, in the third set, but luck fell Dartmouth’s way and the Big Green triumphed in the end.
“Nicky played tremendously,” Fish said. “[But] it was just a Dartmouth game where every close shot that the guy could escape with, he did. It was excruciatingly close, one of the most exciting matches I’ve been in involved in.”
Finally, co-captain Denis Nguyen – ranked No. 1 at Harvard and No. 43 nationally– fell to another ranked opponent: No. 54 Dovydas Sakinis, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, which resulted in a victory for the Big Green. Nguyen holds a 17-12 overall record in singles.
Nguyen and three other teammates—Steinroeder, Shaun Chaudhuri and Henry Steer—played their last regular season matches for the Crimson on Saturday. The four seniors have aided Harvard successfully in its quest for a trip to the NCAA tournament for the past three years and hope to solidify a fourth straight NCAA appearance. Nguyen became the Crimson’s first All-American since 2005 at last years NCAA Tournament with an appearance in the men’s singles semifinals.
“I think we have a really good team, a really talented team, and I definitely think we can get another year,” Steer said.
The Crimson’s NCAA bid is still at-large but the bid seems to be in their favor. Although this loss against the lower ranked Dartmouth will impact their rankings, an early season win against the now-ranked No. 3 Minnesota should be enough to offset this loss.
“It was a tough day but a kick in the pants really gets us fired up for NCAAs,” Steer said. “If we can pull it all together – and I’ve seen flashes of it through the season – we can definitely try and make a run.”

For those who who are already planning on studying indoors and crave some good non-Lamont cafe food once in a while, there is might be exciting news for you. Last week, Chipotle announced that it will be introducing delivery services, to the excitement of every person worldwide. Since it’s no secret that Harvard students already love Chipotle, we anticipate that this week’s announcement that Chipotle will now deliver right to your door will be an absolute game-changer... possibly.
For this new endeavor, Chipotle has partnered with the on-demand delivery service Postmates - the same company Starbucks announced earlier this year will be ferrying your Iced, Half Caff, Ristretto, Venti, 4-Pump, Sugar Free, Cinnamon, Dulce Soy Skinny Latte direct to dorm rooms and classrooms (and everywhere else that students purposely or accidentally fall asleep) near you.
Although it seems like a dream come true, especially for Quadlings who are closer to Anna’s Taqueria in Porter Square, this luxury is accompanied by a steep surcharge that doesn’t normally justify the added convenience  According to some estimates, including a delivery tip this service could cost anywhere from an extra $11-14 for an $8 burrito (aka the equivalent of 2 to 2.5 burritos from Felipe’s, depending on how wisely you select your ingredients). Also though an email conversation with customer service did note that “[they] do deliver in Cambridge,” the Postmates website doesn't always show that Chipotle delivers to Harvard addresses.
Some of you might be thinking, “is it even worth it?” But there are several situations, however, in which it will be socially acceptable to splurge and cough up the cash (or rather, venmo your more responsible friends who don’t regularly lose their wallets at final clubs and under mounds of unfinished laundry). Namely: when sick to the point where you would willingly sacrifice your firstborn for a burrito (or twelve) in bed, and on days when even your trusty Bean Boots can’t compete with a record-breakingly brutal winter snowfall.
Until the service becomes active, many questions remain: will they deliver to Lamont cafe and usurp the questionable sushi as the overpriced desperation-mode meal of choice? Will they deliver to your hideout in one of the Harvard yard igloos you are avoiding your responsibilities from? Will they partner with Uber so your driver will arrive with burrito in hand? We might not be thrilled about the pricetag and we’re still not happy that it closes at 10 pm everyday , but as the end of the semester approaches and our level of self-control decreases daily, we are certainly looking forward to finding out.
