With the heavens experiencing an electric storm, indie rock band Young the Giant brought their own artful, psychedelic lightshow as a backdrop to churning rock riffs and pop beats. Having traveled north from New York, the group of five originally from Orange County lit up Boston’s harborside Blue Hills Bank Pavilion on Sept. 14 with a continuation of their tour, “Home of the Strange,” named after their newest album. Silhouetted against a flame-red rising sun, the entertainers for the evening strode onto stage and struck their starting poses. It’s only appropriate that halfway through their hopscotch across the country, the band opened with the energetic yet searching single “Amerika,” from their 2016 album.
Warmed up by crowd-pleasing guest artists Cold War Kids and Joywave, few in the crowd were lounging around in the intimate space of the Pavilion; most everyone was up and soon swaying to the rhythms. Out came the dancing frontman Sameer Gadhia, tambourine in hand, and dressed in a charismatic faded-yellow boiler suit. Whoops ricocheted off the auditorium’s walls.
Backlit by ultraviolet, the call-and-return “hoos” and “ahs” relaxed into the brooding opening of “Something to Believe In” before bursting into a chorus [that cried out for those tired of hollow ideals. The striking triangular screen behind the stage beat forth the elliptical imagery of psychedelic space eclipsing the figure of a lone man. Such care for stagecraft could only be expected from a band that in March of this year came out with a neon-lit VR video for their track “Silvertongue.”
Between the opening numbers, they kept the audience teased with edgy guitar plucks that belie the fraught questioning and political undertones of their newest LP. The bright yellow light bathed the audience as the band swung from their fresh songs into a track from the band’s debut album, “I Got.” And Gadhia went on to show off his distinctive vocal nimbleness in shifting across different styles, from shaking out low jazzy notes to soaring to astonishingly high ethereal lilts.
YTG also knew how to cut sound with suspense. In the dark, noisy guitars raged as loud as a cathedral organ; the stage lights flashed like visual sirens. Just before the bass took us careering towards a crash, the darkness broke as we dove into the narrative of “Mr. Know-It-All.” Outside of the charging verses and sparkling bridge sections, guitar riffs and the band’s signature electronic sounds whined wistfully up and down in dreamy accompaniment. With swirling orange graphics that depicted a voyage through space in the background, the band self-assuredly transitioned through a multiverse of pop and rock sounds in a single hit.
Gadhia the showman made a heady dedication to all the dreamers who want to get out of their tiny town and come to a city like Boston. YTG jumped into one of their earliest tracks “Cough Syrup” for a mid-concert climax, a song kitted out with a Panic-at-the-Disco-like chorus and clap-along bridge. Doostzadeh on bass and Comtois on drums plunged deeper than they do in the studio, while the sunnier guitar riffs remained as a complementary overlay.
Shuffling cosily together in the far-right corner of the stage, the members rolled swiftly into a calm interlude which the hyped-crowd try to have patience for. For the fans who enjoy the band’s “In the Open” series—alternative, chill renditions of their songs shot on tour—it was the perfect moment to feel connected to the band. One of the striking features about such a pretty famous group who have been touring for around 10 years now is their relatability and affinity with the crowd. The pared-down sounds of “Strings” unfolded perfectly, creating an intimate moment for those who were ready for it. But the radio-rock lovers did not have to wait long before the flashlights swooped up and the drums thundered in, returning us to high-tempo thrill.
The resounding vibrations of the bass evoked the ominous footsteps of an approaching giant. In the stark red-and-black space, two diamond-shaped eyes stared out from the back of the stage as we tore towards the end of the set. It is left to the lead single from their second album, “Mind Over Matter,” to round off the performance with starry, synthy sounds.
YTG bid all farewell, leaving the crowd whooping for more. Finally, they returned for a spectacular finale comprising their rockiest numbers. A purple, sparkle-festooned blazer appeared at the back of the stage, Saheem threw it on, and suddenly the audience was swaying to the anthemic “Silvertongue.”

The previous season of “The Mindy Project” ended with its characters panicking about commitment.  The cold and beautiful Anna was struggling to settle down with her boyfriend Jeremy. Colette and Karen were engaged until the former bailed at the engagement party. And Mindy Lahiri—the show’s dramatic and emotional center—finally got her long-awaited marriage proposal, only to stare ambiguously at the camera as if something was missing.
And as the sixth and last season premieres with “Is That All There Is?” the group dynamic on “The Mindy Project” starts to enter uncharted territory. The characters have already reached the turning points of their plotlines and are established in supposedly happy relationships. There’s a lot of a change and worry for the future, but fans will be glad to hear that “Is That All There Is?” still retains everything that makes “The Mindy Project” distinctive.  The one-liners are reliably funny. The quality of acting is consistent with past seasons. And the fifth season’s frantic sequence of “I do” and “I don’t” continue seamlessly: Jeremy asks Anna to move in with him. Colette and Karen are broken up and struggling to become friends. Tamra is trying to become pregnant via IVF, and worries about the expectations of parenting. And Mindy, of course, is struggling with her newfound marriage.
It seems that Mindy’s reconciliation with settling down will be a season-long theme. “I think I’m just used to spending so much time by myself that I forgot how to share it with anyone else,” Mindy pleads to her husband, Ben. The characters have grown up and (mostly) gotten what they wanted.  Now, with just a season remaining, all “The Mindy Project” can do is explore the aftermath.  Is that all there is, indeed.
It’s still early to pass judgement about the entire season, but the plotlines that creator and star actress Mindy Kaling sets up in the premiere have promise.  Ever since the pilot, Mindy has held an idealized concept of marriage—but this rom-com fantasy may be overturned in the ensuing season by Mindy’s own inertia. In one particular scene, Ben gets excited to make Mindy leftover soup. But it’s a domestic gesture that is completely lost on her, partially because it’s a dramatic shift in lifestyle for a girl who tore through Season One drunk and wearing sequins.
Meanwhile, Jeremy has also found love after five seasons of waiting. He has gone through more personality changes than Mindy, but his latest iteration—idiosyncratic, bourgeois, innocent—gives him both strong roots and avenues for future plotlines.  If the premiere is any indication, however, Kaling will tread gently with crafting Jeremy’s arc, careful to avoid a “Gossip Girl”-level drama in its last season.
Episode One is kind to its characters, kind in a way that is typical of the show’s past and promising for its future. The characters still have problems, but there is also room for imminent resolution—and thus a concisely wrapped-up season. The anthem of the episode, Fontella Bass’s “Rescue Me,” may well be the anthem of the season: The words talk about helplessness, but the upbeat R&B tune says anything but. The truth is that Mindy Lahiri is going along as she always has, facing new problems with her familiar spirit. Mindy won’t need rescuing at all, and neither will “The Mindy Project.”

I once thought that there was nothing as fantastic as “Gossip Girl,” but that was before I watched its predecessor: “The O.C.”  The only thing better than rich teens spending their parents’ money and dating in New York is rich teens doing the same thing in California.
Josh Schwartz’s first teen drama premiered in 2003, when many of us were just reaching double digits. But to this day, it has remained a cult classic for Millennials. When it first came out, the series convinced millions of young people to listen to Death Cab for Cutie and thrust its lead actors into a world of fame. The show was so popular that it was even parodied on “Saturday Night Live” and profiled by the Crimson.
The plot centers around Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie), an underprivileged teenager from Chino, California, who escapes jail time for stealing a car and is generously welcomed into his public defense lawyer’s beautiful home in Newport Beach. Ryan moves into the family and  instantly befriends their comic-obsessed and misanthropic son Seth. However, Ryan’s troubled past instantly draws prejudice from his new community, particularly when he becomes involved with it girl Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton).
If you’re looking for any depth, don’t. Like most teen dramas, the show attempts to address serious issues like drugs, pregnancy, sex, and depression, but ultimately, it never makes a statement. Its characters’ irrationality and self-destructiveness can make it difficult to empathize with them. Marissa Cooper is the finest example of this. She blames drinking and drug abuse on her parents’ turbulent relationship without any real exploration. Though it makes little sense, it makes for highly entertaining TV.
The show’s other highlight is the strong relationships it depicts between the teens Seth and Summer as well as Seth’s parents Sandy and Kirsten. These two couples are similar in that they’re opposites: The men are neurotic and insecure and the women are passionate, wealthy and beautiful. On paper, this combination might sound awful (and it can be), but the actors have great chemistry and impart humor to a show with too much angst. In fact, I dare you not to smile at some of the sweeter moments. The fact that one of these portrayals is of an older, married generation adds more depth, allowing more maturity and varied solutions to conflicts.
Ultimately, “The O.C.” succeeds because of its twisting, ridiculous plot lines and various successful portrayals of relationships. Its soundtrack and beautiful setting only add to its great list of qualities. Be forewarned, this show is as vacuous as they come. But if you have access to Hulu and love drama, this is your time to tune in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A temple draws us to God, and a kitchen draws us to the stove. What is our gaze directed to when we step into the sonic space of music? We often conceive of space as a parameter we inhabit. However, space inhabits us as much as we inhabit it. For example, it only makes sense that the organization of a Harvard student’s dorm room is such that the desk, bed, and drawer the most accessible parts of the room. Thus, in the creation of the dorm room, the space inherently draws the student towards that desk, bed, and drawer.
What of sonic space, then? Just as the dimensions, furniture, and flow of a room draw us to its original purpose, sound is a type of space, one with timbre, rhythm, and time organizing the listener’s experience. Some sounds draw us towards focus: white noise machines, gentle piano-solo music, cocktail jazz. Some sounds draw us to exercise: driving beats from hip hop or EDM. What, however, are we being drawn to when an artist takes their music in a dramatically different direction? When Bruno Mars drops “Uptown Funk,” when Taylor Swift releases “Look What You Made Me Do,” or when Bon Iver imagines “22, A Million”?
I will run with this last example, Bon Iver, to claim that when we are faced with an artist’s stark change in sound, their music often surrenders a static definition of genre, and takes up a more dynamic one. It presents a dynamic genre-ness that is defined less by sonic properties and more by the culture and values that shaped it. The significance of this dynamic definition of musical genre is that it surrenders the effort of serving a singular, insular purpose, and instead opens a dialogue across artistic spaces.
Bon Iver had been known in the indie-alt circle for their imagery of natural spaces. Song titles like “Perth,” “Minnesota, WI,” “Hinnom, TX,” “The Wolves,” and “Wisconsin,” paint vivid pictures of outdoor landscapes and the solitary openness one can experience in them. The instrumentation is adorned with acoustic timbres and tight, simple harmonies. Vast landscapes are depicted by expansive reverb and long resonances. Thus, it came as a shock to many when the group released their latest album, “22, A Million,” in 2016. The acoustic timbres were gone. Vocals had been processed and cut through digital harmonizers and samplers. Reverb was tight, making the sounds feel close and punchy. The titles were void of any dialect that would be found outside of an online chat-space. For instance, “22 (OVER S∞∞N),” “10 d E A T h b R E a s T ⚄ ⚄,” and “715 - CR∑∑KS,” are the opening tracks of the album.
Do we conceive of this as the new Bon Iver? Per the latest Taylor Swift slogan, are we being told that the old Bon Iver is dead, and cannot come to the metaphorical phone? If Bon Iver is a sonic construction of acoustic guitars and mountain ranges, then perhaps so. However, “22, A Million,” does not kill off these effects, but rather, translates them to organize a new, more digital, sonic space. The geographic imagery and expansive acoustic resonances create a greater sense of “vastness.” This vastness is not lost in the digital electronica of “22, A Million.” Rather, it is translated onto the digital landscape. Instead of the quiet, removed fields of Minnesota, WI, we find ourselves in an equally, if not even more, removed space of the deep web, where one might encounter virtual glyphs like “21 M◊◊N WATER.” Rather than expansive, cold, resonant piano chords, we hear the chilling, lonely, but large vocals of a single Justin Vernon, copied and pasted onto seven different pitches through digital harmonization. Geography of the natural earth is replaced by the geography of the internet. Yet the vastness remains, and is even amplified.
What does this say about genre and the music we enjoy? Seeing beyond the physical sonorities and looking to the intentions behind them allows us to see music as a product of a living, breathing, ever-shifting, human being. Though Bon Iver suddenly came forth last September with a radically new sonic outfit, our reaction does not need to engender alienation or distance from them. If anything, we understand Bon Iver’s “vastness” much more now that it has come into another artistic space. This column will explore difference and “new-ness” through the medium of sound and music. The goal is to find, and fall in love with, encounters with the unfamiliar. Even more so, to love these encounters without refusing the familiarity and history that formed us, though it may seem so different from what we are faced with.

As evidenced by numerous Hollywood franchises, making sequels is hard. How much of what worked in the previous film should be replicated? Should it even be replicated? Should the film submit to the expectations of the audience or subvert them? Matthew Vaughn’s “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” clearly grapples with these questions. The director makes it obvious that he is overly eager to recapture the magic of the first film, and the result of that desperation is a film that celebrates its predecessor’s unique humour and stylized violence, but has little substance beyond that. The good news is, at least the humour and violence are still working.
“Golden Circle” does not know what kind of story it is trying to tell. It dabbles in a little bit of everything, but fails to make any clear, pointed statements. At the beginning, it seems that the central conflict is the protagonist Eggsy trying to balance his domestic life with his spy life, but that plot line gets immediately dropped when the action starts, and is only picked up every once in a while at the story’s convenience. Halfway through the film, however, the director gives up the efforts altogether, and informs the viewer that instead of balancing two different lives, Eggsy is actually struggling just to establish a life outside the spy world. The confused viewer is further disturbed when, towards the end of the film, the director suddenly starts to make social commentary by including a US president that is something of a satire of Donald Trump.
Fortunately, while the overall story is pretty senseless, the humour that is scattered around provides good distraction. This is much to the credit of the film’s ensemble of charismatic actors. Channing Tatum’s big scene as Tequila was entertaining, fun, and delightful, even if his accent does slip every now and then. Jeff Bridges’ Champ was good ol’ Jeff Bridges—funny, cool and extremely charming. Pedro Pascal’s Whiskey is the coolest guy with a lasso you’ll ever see. Julianne Moore was wonderfully unhinged, and her appropriately campy performance was much less distracting than Samuel L. Jackson and his Mike Tyson-inspired lisp in the first movie. The surprise star of the film, however, was Elton John. A bizarre take on himself, Elton comfortably embodies the deranged humor that defines “Kingsman”. The one new character that fell a little flat was Halle Berry’s Ginger. Not given much to do, she never gets the chance to fully match up with Mark Strong’s Merlin. Some viewers might also be disappointed to find out that the ad campaign for the film grossly exaggerated the presence of these new characters. Pascal is the only one given the appropriate amount of screen time, with Bridges’ and Tatum’s roles not amounting to much more than fun cameos.
The biggest takeaway from this film, however, are the stunning action sequences. Vaughn has an unparalleled ability to capture actions that have not yet before been seen on film. The camera is never static during fights. It flies and whirls across the viewer’s field of vision, changing perspectives and shifting frames. However, the movement is never distracting. It is a wholly immersive experience that takes its audience to and through the middle of the fight. Comedic beats are sprinkled perfectly throughout the violence, unlikely weapons are used in the unlikeliest of ways, and gruesome deaths are brought about by absurdly brutal means. On the surface, Vaughn manages to preserve much of what made “Kingsman” so successful the first time around.
“Golden Circle” is by no means a perfect movie: Character arcs take a back seat to the entertainment, background stories are shoddily put together, and plot points happen not because of the characters’ motivations but because the movie needs them to happen. That said, it is still a surprisingly pleasant viewing experience. Although not up to par with its predecessor, there is still something so refreshing about the world of “Kingsman” that makes it unlike any other franchise. Its humor, its camp, its action, its violence—a welcome deviation from the many self-serious blockbusters of today. Go into the theater with minimal expectations and let yourself be taken for a ride. “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” is a film of very little substance but a whole lot of fun.

After I hand the young woman a poker chip as compensation, she leads me through tables of patrons, palm readers, and burlesque dancers to reach a velvet-draped private room. We settle onto the couches as live jazz from the main stage drifts through the curtains, our bodies separated only by a table adorned with a crystal ball, a broken rosary, and tarot cards. There, she inquires about my literary preferences, opens her leather book of poetry, and begins to read.
This is “The Poetry Brothel,” an event that brings out the mysticism and magic of poetry by performing it in the setting of an early 20th century bordello. The show itself brings together disparate acts in order to create an atmosphere of chaos and hedonism. At the beginning of the event, guests sit and receive an introduction to the various poetic “whores” before purchasing the chips that serve as currency in the Brothel. The evening alternates between mainstage events—including dancing, aerial acts, and spoken word performances—and periods where patrons are expected to circulate the room, trading their chips for tarot and palm readings and private poetry sessions with a “whore” of their choice. The show’s elements were on their own captivating, but unwieldy transitions and confusing emceeing made for an altogether incoherent event.
“The Poetry Brothel” used OBERON’s space to the fullest in an attempt to create an immersive experience for the patrons. Along the edge of the stage were merchandise for purchase and trinkets that followed the show’s eclectic, vintage, and mystical theme. The “Madame” of the brothel, as well as Mr. Charlie, the emcee, sat on that edge alongside a charcoal artist in a bowler hat, making bawdy jokes and conversing with each passerby. The actors filled the room: in the back at a full bar, on the balcony, and in fabric-sectioned lounge rooms for private readings. With the help of a well-placed spotlight, they read poetry while jauntily perched atop the bar and balcony as the aerial artist danced overhead. Stations of fortune tellers and roaming poets soliciting guests for their readings filled what floor space was left over. There were spectacles everywhere an audience member looked, and it was nearly impossible to lose interest.
In addition to the staging, the actors delivered strong performances: the burlesque was dark and provocative, the jazz was appropriately salacious, and the poetic identities of the “whores” were exceptionally well-developed and executed. The actors spoke with passion and clearly knew their characters well, cracking off-the-cuff jokes about their assumed identities. However, the show lacked meaningful cohesion. There was very little flow of events, and 45 minutes had passed before guests fully understood the system of currency. This particular showing had also been branded as a “Twin Peaks”-themed special, so much of the humor was indiscernible from weird, random, too-persistent inside jokes. The transitions, conventions, and emceeing were overall confusing and obscure.
One of the few unifying threads of the evening was the overtly political statements that punctuated the show, from the introduction of several “whores” as genderqueer to a mid-show public service announcement on the importance of consent in any sexual encounter. Statements condemning modern society and the current administration wove through the event in every dimension. Poets delivered passionate rejections of gender and sexual norms, and the emcee sarcastically encouraged the audience to spend their money before the United States reverted to a barter system. At times, this emphasis on inclusivity created a self-aware undercurrent of earnestness that seemed to contradict an otherwise shockingly lawless experience.  The effort by “The Poetry Brothel” to create a unique literary experience had strong subparts, but fell flat because of an overall lack of clarity and contradictions in tone. Arthouses of all kinds have historically been hotbeds of political deviance, and for the creators of this show, this came along with other aspects of bordellos, taboos and all.

The six fictions—which include a love story between two refugees, an exploration of time in a post-Brexit U.K., and a four-person narrative coming-of-age tome—that made it through to the final round of Britain’s most prestigious literary prize are: “4 3 2 1” by Paul Auster, “History of Wolves” by Emily Fridlund, “Exit West” by Mohsin Hamid, “Elmet” by Fiona Mozley, “Lincoln in the Bardo” by George Saunders, and “Autumn” by Ali Smith. The Chair of the judges, Baroness Lola Young, introduces the list on the Man Booker Prize’s website as “Playful, sincere, unsettling, fierce: here is a group of novels grown from tradition but also radical and contemporary... the ways in which they challenge our thinking is a testament to the power of literature.” Paul Beatty’s win for “The Sellout” in 2016, the first time an American won the prize, raises the question of whether the inclusion of talent from across the pond is resulting in the Americanization of the award.
No stranger to surprise selections, the Man Booker Prize judges of 2017 have omitted Pulitzer Prize winner, National Book Award winner, and bookmaker’s favorite “The Underground Railroad” by U.S. writer Colson Whitehead from their shortlist, leaving fellow Americans George Saunders, Paul Auster and Emily Fridlund in contention for the £50,000 award. Whitehead lost out to debut novelists like Cornell professor Emily Fridlund. She is in the running with the anguished bildungsroman “History of Wolves,” about a 14-year-old from a crumbling religious cult struggling to transition to life in the ordinary world. The likeliest winner, George Saunders, is also making his debut as a novelist, although he has already received much acclaim for his short stories, one of which landed him the inaugural Folio Prize in 2013. His highlighted work of this year, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” constructs a narrative around Abraham Lincoln’s grief for his deceased son, a grief so powerful that it confines the spirit of the boy to liminal purgatory or “bardo.”
Completing the U.S. contingent of nominees is Paul Auster with “4 3 2 1,” a near-900-page experimental novel that narrates the life of a boy named Archibald Isaac Ferguson. With British bookmaker Ladbrokes, a British-based gambling and betting company, favouring the better-known Auster over Fridlund, the former still stands an outside chance of winning with odds of 5 to 1. While the more seasoned novelists tend to have better odds, bets must be placed cautiously, for eminent writers such as Zadie Smith, previous Booker winner Arundhati Roy, and Jon McGregor did not make it to the shortlist.
Young responded to discussion of writers’ nationalities with the statement, as quoted in The Guardian, that “nationality is not an issue in terms of how we decide on a winner—it’s what is in our opinion the best book in these six.” Commentators have nevertheless paid increasing attention to the issue following a rule change in 2014 that permitted a writer from any country to be nominated so long as their work was published in the U.K. and widely available in English. Previously the award had been restricted to authors from the U.K., the Republic of Ireland, and the Commonwealth.
The award may still highlight U.K. talent anyway. British author and fellow debut novelist Fiona Mozley is both seen as a surprise and in good standing to win with her gothic noir, “Elmet”, set in the rolling hills of Yorkshire. Hailed as a “scarred, black gem” by Guardian reviewer Mark Blacklock, the “lyricism” could win it for the novel. Meanwhile, Ali Smith, a Scottish author who made the final cut, is less highly favoured with her post-Brexit fiction, “Autumn.” Perhaps the more universally relevant theme of displacement accounts for Pakistani-English writer Mohsin Hamid’s “Exit West” much better odds. His creation is set in a nameless city filled with refugees who can slip through time and space in a genre-transcending work.

“If I could, I would scream for an hour straight. I just don’t have the stamina. That’s why I make my music,” said Max O. Lesser ’19.
On the evening of Sept. 22 in WHRB’s Recovery Ward concert space, Lesser performed a set of previously unreleased pieces under his nascent noise punk outfit lucretius. Lesser is also currently playing in the rock group Cold Jacket. The experimental and tortured sound of lucretius contrasts with Lesser’s previous projects, according to the singer.
Lesser, an English concentrator planning a secondary in Philosophy, named his solo project after the Epicurean philosopher Lucretius. In explaining the style of lucretius Lesser used the words of the philosopher himself: “From the very fountain of enchantment, there arises the taste of bitterness to spread anguish amongst the flowers,” Lesser said.
Due to the nature of Lesser’s electro-punk-noise sound, the music was custom-fit to the voice of the evening’s vocalist, Claire Dickson ’19. An accomplished jazz, pop, and R&B singer and composer, and a member of the band Foxpack, Dickson’s collaboration with lucretius is a departure from her usual work. Dickson described her own vocal contributions as largely spontaneous.
After the show, Dickson reflected on the unique perspectives that unconventional sounds bring to the table. “It’s really about the sound. It’s not about melody, or rhythm, or these elements we normally associate with music,” she said. “We’re just exploring the very basic elements of music, the sound. The sounds are helping me get into this mood that’s very enveloping.”
In a seemingly spontaneous outburst towards the middle of the show, during a song, an audience member got up and proceeded to yell tortured screams while writhing in pain. He and the man sitting in front of him then rose and began to scream, jumping around rocking their heads in agony. Towards the end of the set, the first man sprang onto the performance space and began to dance expressively to the music, and was later joined by Lesser.
The two screaming men, Jack Corbett ’19 and Cole M. Thompson ’19, admitted that their contribution to the performance was planned, as both are members of Cold Jacket, for which Lesser is the keyboardist. Corbett said that the lucretius performance was a departure from what he, Thompson, and Lesser would do in Cold Jacket. “We have more of a classic band set-up rather than production on computer.”
Thompson anticipated that lucretius might garner some negative responses. “Anything that’s new that your brain hasn’t heard before, it’s going to throw you off. I just think that performance was so unique and so creative, it’s like nothing you’ve ever heard,” he said.
Friday’s concert was a collaborative project between lucretius and the on-campus art collective Philth Haus. Known for their bold and evocative art installations, Philth Haus’s unsettling decorations paired well with lucretius’s music. The set-up consisted of three tall blocks illuminated by two black lights.
In front of the foremost block sat Philth Haus’s creative director, ANDRA (Philip A.N. Chowdry ’19), clad in sunglasses and heels, covered in small paper rectangles and used cigarettes. Past Chowdry’s feet sat a bowl of milk, and a trail of honey led down the length of a tarp. Lesser crouched below that foremost block, and Dickson sat on a taller one near the back. Chowdry felt that his installation related to lucretius’ music in a few key aspects. “Religion, holiness, and opacity being atrocity,” he said.
After an hour of live broadcast on WHRB, the music went silent and Dickson announced to the room that the performance was over. The audience members, still processing the music, waited a few seconds before applauding for Lesser, Dickson, and Chowdry.
Updated September 25, 10:50 p.m.: A previous version of this article stated that Max O. Lesser '19 is enrolled in a dual degree program with the New England Conservatory. Lesser is no longer enrolled in the program.

In Paris last spring, my friend took me to a bookstore called Présence Africaine. Named for the African studies magazine and publishing house that owns it, it is tucked away on an unassuming corner in the Latin Quarter. (I had been expecting, as she had said, a “library”—but it turned out that, having just walked out of a French class, she had confused the French word “librarie” for the English “library.”) In a corner of the store, I struggled to decipher the first pages of “Black Skin, White Masks” in Frantz Fanon’s original French. Fanon starts with a description of the black man who visits the colonial “métropole” France. “The black man has two dimensions,” Fanon writes. On the one hand, he will be treated as a “demigod” among his compatriots if he knows France, if he speaks “French French,” and if he can talk about what he saw in Paris. On the other, in his interactions with Europeans, he will be ever-so-vigilant not to slip up and reveal his accent. The colonized, he writes, “is elevated above his jungle status in proportion to his adoption of the mother country’s culture standards,” not least the language—and the right and respectable way of speaking that language, namely unaccented, proper European. “To speak,” he says on the importance of language, “means to be in a position to use a certain syntax, to grasp the morphology of this or that language, but it means above all to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization.”
How is learning a language akin to supporting the weight of a civilization? According to Fanon, language is a “cultural tool”—its mastery promises upward mobility, but premises a perverse denial of self. This bargain reveals itself when you realize the effort it takes to master someone else’s tongue as if it is your own. Supposedly, anybody can learn a language. You might even expect that mastery of its grammar and vocabulary will grant you insider status. Or, understanding that language is subtler than that, you might think that perfecting your accent, understanding cultural references, and wearing the right clothes might give you an “in.” Here, “language” can refer to more than its literal meaning: How do speech and writing change to adapt to environments of business? Academia? At Harvard? The burden of adapting typically falls on the individual, rather than the environment. Think of an immigrant in a foreign country, struggling to integrate, or even a Harvard junior mirroring the mannerisms of a finance recruiter.
Standing in line in the airport in Rome, en route to Paris, I noticed a group of American boys who looked about my age. They noticed that they were some of the few people in line not speaking French, because in their Greek-lettered hoodies and conspicuous voices they joked to themselves “oui,” “non,” and “I don’t speak French.” During my time in Europe, people noticed that I was different without my having to announce it to them. Even as I stayed out of the way and even gave my best attempt at speaking French (from years of study), people called me “nihao” and “konnichiwa.” Worse, they followed me around until I had to hide in stores and flip them off from within, and harassing my friend and me to the point that we found alternate routes home. Smaller incidents too—someone asked me three times if I really did speak French, then finally said, “Wow, good for you!” before still handing me the English menu.
Of course, Frantz Fanon was writing about black people in the colonial context. He was writing about the experiences of the colonial subject, who faced harsher restrictions on upward mobility. I enjoy the privileges of a student at an elite university. But his writings tell me something I often wonder about. Try as you might, you still may not successfully integrate, even after learning the language. “Talking the talk and walking the walk” is not an ultimate solution. Fanon talks about phenomena that I, and many who identify as minorities, experience on a daily basis. As Fanon observed in 1952—and as is true even today—people ask, “How long have you been in France? You speak French so well.” Even when you are saying everything right—not only pronouncing and spelling words right, but also referring to the right films and books—you are plagued by the doubt that something might “give you away.” My parents applaud my mastery of the English language because it opens up opportunities unknown to them. If this is true, what still troubles me is that when we go anywhere as a family, people will always, ever so minutely—almost unnoticeably—slow their speech to speak to us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Debuting fresh works and repositioning classics, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston opened four new exhibits on Sept. 24 in the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art.
“Seeking Stillness” brings together meditative works of art from many cultures and times, ranging from an Italian Renaissance painting of Christ to a 21st-century Chinese sculpture of a metallic rock. Its three rooms present nature as a vessel for contemplation and art as a method of finding peace. Two early John Cage piano pieces, written as dance music for his partner Merce Cunningham in 1948, float through the gallery. This is the first time the MFA has included music as part of an exhibition.
Edward Saywell, Chief of Exhibitions Strategy and Gallery Displays, related “Seeking Stillness” to the MFA’s recent exhibition of art speaking to social issues. “‘Seeking Stillness’ is no less powerful than ‘Political Intent,’ in that the artists are ones that still help us see and make sense of the world around us today,” Saywell said.
In one of the rooms in “Seeking Stillness,” a space half-partitioned off from the rest of the exhibit illuminates Rosso Fiorentino’s painting “The Dead Christ with Angels” (about 1524–27), as if in a chamber for meditation.
Kenzo Okada’s 1966 oil painting entitled “A Story” sets the tone of the room entitled “Process” with its muted blue and beige shapes reminiscent of landscapes. A Mayan paint container, a conch shell carved both to fit in a palm and to resemble one, serves as a reminder of the presence of the artist’s hand throughout the exhibition. The last room, “Places,” surrounds visitors with mountains. The modern chrome colossus “Artificial Rock #85” (2005) by Zhan Wang, along with Ming Dynasty drawings of mountains, explore the tranquil effects of mountainous forms in Chinese culture.
In a darkened room, the installation “Joan Jonas: Ice Drawing,” a video of the artist sliding ice atop ink on a white surface is projected through hanging crystals. Drawing its connection to the melting icebergs on earth, the video silently comments on the drama of climate change.
From the juncture between “Seeking Stillness” and its neighboring exhibition “Mark Rothko: Reflection,” Jonas’s installation is also within view; Saywell recommended that viewers stand in this spot to take in painting, sculpture, and video stemming from nature.
“Mark Rothko: Reflection” features eleven Rothkos and a Rembrandt. The paintings summarize the development of Rothko’s art from early twirling shapes and horizontal lines to the large swaths of black paint he created for a nondenominational chapel.
The exhibit places Rothko’s “Thru the Window” (1938–39), which has never been shown in the United States before, next to Rembrandt van Rijn’s “Artist in his Studio” (about 1628). Elliot Boswick Davis, John Moors Cabot Chair of Art of the Americas at the MFA, said that the MFA curators asked, “What can we do at the MFA Boston that no other museum can do?” This pairing shows two self-reflective scenes of artists at work. Davis said the exhibit aims to convey in Rothko’s work what Rothko admired in Rembrandt’s: “connecting with everyday people and hitting the high marks of the breadth of human emotion.”
Cambridge-based artist Annette Lemieux debuted her exhibition “Mise en Scène” after receiving the MFA’s 2017 Maud Morgan Prize. Lemieux is currently a senior lecturer in the Visual and Environmental Studies department at Harvard. Her art repurposes iconic images from films that she watched as a child. A life-sized version of the soap carving from “To Kill a Mockingbird,” suspended reproductions of the balloon from “M,” snapshots from the opening credits of “Fahrenheit 451,” and blacked-out prints from Charlie Chaplin’s “The Great Dictator” are just a few of the film-inspired objects in the installation. Lemieux set some of the pieces in front of the wallpaper of her childhood house, creating a dreamscape synthesized from many sources.
“They were based on films that stayed with me, that I saw when I was very young, that were very mentally visceral,” Lemieux said.
Lemieux’s manipulation of the images associated with issues of censorship, government, mental illness, and class might resonate with today’s political climate. However, she said that her art transcends the present. “My art has always dealt with these issues that are ever-present in our life,” Lemieux said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a five-year hiatus, critics and listeners alike have awaited the Killers’ next move. In the years following “Battle Born,” an underwhelming and oddly angsty album, their fans (called “Victims”) have seen lead singer Brandon Flowers go solo (which he recently admitted was to give the band a break from performing), guitarist Dave Keuning and bassist Mark Stoermer opt to produce in the studio rather than play on stage, and Flowers’ wife, Tana, reveal her PTSD from an abusive childhood to the online Mormon community.
And the Killers basked in the anticipation. Flowers called their fifth LP “the closest thing we’ve done to ‘Sam’s Town,’ the album many consider to be their all-time (and perhaps unbeatable) best. He told NME, “Our new songs feel heavier than anything we’ve ever done.”
Released on Sept. 22, “Wonderful Wonderful” attempts to do too much. It’s a love song to Flowers’ wife, a dialogue about what it means to be a man, an eager yet self-conscious comeback, a sly opportunity to boast. That is not to say the album is completely disappointing. Their experimentation with funky beats and edgy themes succeeds in “Tyson vs Douglas” and “Run for Cover,” even if it sounds try-hard in the others. But the release tries to simultaneously play catch-up from years lost and release a deeply personal emotional buildup, the combination of which ultimately exhausts the album.
This is most evident in “Out of My Mind.” What could’ve been a heartfelt ballad to Tana Flowers is instead taken as a chance to name-drop big artists with whom they have performed: “Went back to back with Springsteen / You turned and rolled your eyes / So I told you about McCartney / And that's a heavy name to drop.” The last line consciously recognizes its bravado but not quite enough to rectify it, making the song less genuine and muddling its meaning.
The album’s title track is vastly different but almost as confusing. It opens with a synthesized horn, a rumbling drum, and distant, discordant beeping—yes, the Killers have long specialized (and largely succeeded) in the strange and obscure, but “Wonderful Wonderful” does nothing to tie the album together other than reference its cover art when Flowers begs, “Keep your ear to the shell.” (What are we even listening for?) It could have opened new territory for a kind of performance art but instead sets unclear expectations for the tracks that follow.
“Run for Cover” and “Tyson vs Douglas,” however, have star potential. The band originally wrote the former for their third studio album, “Day & Age,” but have since refined the lyrics to feature the Killers’ first overt political references, from corrupt senators to “fake news.” The song infuses the sound of the 2000s Killers in a nostalgic yet refreshing way: The electric guitar opening is reminiscent of their hit “Somebody Told Me” but with a more electronic and upbeat flair, and the drums fuel the melody’s synth-infused energy in classic Killers fashion. In “Tyson vs Douglas,” a vulnerable confession masked as an ode to the historic boxing match, Flowers worries about the fall of icons, including himself. He adopts Tyson’s perspective after his notorious defeat: “And I think of me / Feelin’ the slip again / Don’t wanna fall.” This bittersweet number is Flowers’ beautifully edgy and raw admittance that he can too clearly see the end of the Killers approaching, and it taints the rest of the album with a sense of panicked passion.
The album ends in a question: “Have All the Songs Been Written?” After a self-consciously experimental tracklist, the Killers seem to already know the answer. The song is a cheesy ending that reveals the band’s desperate hopes that one of their tracks will bring them back on top. It is also their last chance to strut, featuring a guest solo from British guitarist Mark Knopfler and a title suggested by Bono.
The excitement of the band’s reunion is palpable, but it does not go without a cockiness that suggests that they are well aware of their track record. “Wonderful Wonderful” is too grandiose to be intimate but too reminiscent of their poppy, post-punk melodies to cover new ground. It is undoubtedly the Killers’ most personal album to date, but it looks like the Victims will still be waiting for the band’s big comeback.

Perhaps there is some attempt at irony or a deeper message about hedonism in the new music video for Zayn Malik’s song “Still Got Time” featuring PartyNextDoor, but for the most part this music video is just a three-minute demonstration of what goes on at a party.
Shot in Malik’s home in April, the video was filmed by director Calmatic during an actual “rager” thrown by the singer. It opens with Malik smoking a suspicious-looking cigarette and drinking a glass of beer as hordes of people invade his expensive-looking home. He wanders around in a haze observing the people around him doing shocking things that one would never do at a party such as kiss, dance, smoke, and drink. Perhaps the hazy and grainy footage is supposed to give the viewer the impression that they are attending, but for the most part the shaky, faded film looks like the at-home footage of an early ’90s vintage that my parents have on our DVR.
Occasionally, Malik’s meanders are interrupted by shots of scantily clad girls dancing around a pole while Malik conveniently gets tattoos and haircuts within the comforts of his own home. Some of his guests tastefully trash his home by skateboarding down his stairs, considerately vomiting into his toilet or simply passing out on his floor while smoking joints. From time to time, he will serenade them with his lyrics: “You still have time”—maybe to remind us that this party is actually about the human condition. He eventually ends up sprawled in a teepee in his yard with other guests getting stoned. At this point, the footage changes to technicolored videos of people flying over tables of the party, zooms in on footage of bodies engaging in sexual acts or else rewinds footage of people smoking.
The video culminates with many people finally crashing and taking a well-deserved break from their debauchery. The next morning Malik emerges from the building out of his ridiculously pristine white curtains to observe the damage while coughing profusely after a night of excessive smoking. To counteract this, he lights up once again, surveying his lawn strewn with rubbish. Out of nowhere, a capuchin monkey crawls across his shoulders as a blowup crocodile randomly turns into a CGI reptile that crosses his lawn. The video ends with Malik smiling knowingly at the monkey.
While its attempts at being provocative and glamorous are duly noted, this video is pretty standard and unexceptional. It seems as if Malik is trying too hard to maintain the “cool” status amongst his ex-bandmates in One Direction. Watch this video if bored or if you like watching videos of smoke. Ultimately, you are better off reading the Youtube comments below, because reading comments from One Direction fans calling out Zayn for defecting is so much more entertaining.

In 2007, Harvard University made history when it named Drew G. Faust as its first female president. This commendable feat, however, pales in comparison to the 381 years of white presidents who, until Faust’s election, had also been all male. Now, 10 years later, the University should consider other ways to defy historical precedent once again by assembling a diverse pool of candidates.
A number of alumni groups and organizations have already called for the prioritization of candidates who come from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. As the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard notes, the University President has a large impact on the future of international academia and relations. The presidential selection thus affects more than our own academic community. The Harvard president serves as the role model for higher education in general and can influence the attitudes and decisions of other academic institutions. President Faust set precedents in her advocacy for expanded accessibility in higher education, and many other peer institutions have subsequently followed suit.
Harvard’s president also exerts a degree of political power, as Faust demonstrated when she testified before Congress to lobby for increased federal funding for biomedical research. Current political issues such as the revocation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, criticism of affirmative action, violence in Charlottesville, and the resurgence of white nationalism in America highlight the importance of finding a candidate committed to Faust’s diversity initiatives. We encourage the presidential search committee to spare no expense to ensure that its candidate pool is as diverse as possible.
Over the past few years, Harvard’s Admissions Office has already demonstrated a serious commitment to the diversity of the student population on campus. The class of 2021 is notably one of the most diverse that Harvard has seen. These changing demographics underline the need for a candidate pool that reflects the diversity of the student body. If our University prides itself on cultivating a spirit of inclusivity and belonging, considering primarily white-male candidates would be antithetical to this spirit.
Of course, the search committee’s first priority must be the qualifications of the candidate. Broadening the search to untraditional places, however, may indeed provide a more competitive pool.
Unfortunately, Harvard has struggled with diversifying its presidential searches in the past. The University has historically focused internally, drawing primarily from its faculty body. This approach limits the possibility of a president from an underrepresented background, as the overwhelming majority of the Harvard faculty is white and male.  We would encourage the search committee to continue to expand its net, looking in less convenient and obvious places for other possible candidates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This season, Monday Night Football said hello to a new face, as Beth Mowins recently became the first woman to call an NFL game on national television. I remember seeing the announcement and thinking, “It’s about time.” The rosy bubble, though, didn’t last long. It was only a matter of time before the criticism poured in: Mowins is shrill. Mowins has an “annoying voice.” Mowins just doesn’t belong on MNF.
The backlash to Mowins’s speech serves as a jarring reminder whenever I get carried away imagining my own voice booming through the stands. If you’re a woman on sports TV, it doesn’t matter what comes out of your mouth, because there will inevitably be something you’re doing wrong: Your voice is too loud, your lipstick is too bright, your laugh is too shrill. Since women like Mowins have reached the big leagues—national television—you’d think the real struggle would be over. But it’s only the beginning—a wider audience means more opportunity for these hateful fans to speak up.
Every sports fan hates at least one commentator, especially the ones on national television. Every sports fan despises the work of at least one journalist. But never, ever does it get as personal as it does when the commentator or journalist in question is a person of color, an LGBT person, or a woman. Or all three. How many people in the crowd at a game think I don’t belong in a men’s locker room? How many players in the men’s locker room, even, think I shouldn’t be there with a mic in their faces?
As it stands today, sports coverage skews heavily towards men’s games. It’s commendable and inspiring that women’s sports often have far more diverse players, coaches, and commentators, but unfortunately those aren’t mainstream games. Men’s sports are considered “the league,” without qualification, as opposed to “the women’s league.” There are many problems with the culture of men’s sports, but for representation to be visible on the average sports fan’s TV or radio, it has to take root in the men’s game. For those roots to be strong, the sports community needs to support and rally around the women, people of color, and LGBT people calling games and hosting intermission shows. I don’t doubt that there are “good people” in sports fanbases, but if you’re a sports fan with privilege and you believe that representation is important, it’s just as much your job to stand up for it as it is mine.
Perhaps it’s hard to understand the magic of seeing and hearing people like you in press boxes. If you’re like me, and you’ve enjoyed sports without being good enough to play, then you turn to people off the field in your search for people like you. And when you can’t see yourself in anyone in the stadium, you step away from the game. That’s what turned me away from sports for a while in high school. After all, when I can actually see brown girls in music and film, why waste my time and energy on a product that doesn’t care enough to reflect me as anything but the host being talked over or the cheerleader who never speaks? Having a woman on your show who’s not actually a part of the conversation is pandering that I can see through. All I ask—and all sports fans of marginalized communities all over the world ask—is that those who broadcast the game acknowledge that I exist.
When I see that effort, I’ll become a dedicated member of your audience. How’s that for a deal? Sports gets its money, and I get the magic again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The striking Ken Burns series on the Vietnam War has excavated painful memories of arriving in Cambridge as a college freshman in 1974 when U.S. combat troops were still facing enemy fire in Southeast Asia.
I didn’t stand out much among the best and the brightest but as far as I knew I was the only student whose father had died in battle in Vietnam. He was an officer leading an infantry battalion, shot through the heart just after the 1968 Tet Offensive, leaving behind a widow and six kids.
My father, Lieutenant Colonel Mortimer L. O’Connor, one of 16,899 combat casualties that year, was buried at West Point on a cold and rainy April morning, just six years before I first walked into Harvard Yard. Back in those days, no one reflexively thanked soldiers or their families for their service. A pall of shame and silence settled over the conflict. The cathartic Vietnam Memorial, with its black wings of carved names rising from the earth of the Washington Mall, was years away.
After the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, U.S. troops had begun returning home in a massive withdrawal. The last draft call had taken place in late 1972. By the time I arrived on campus—the only student from my public high school class to attend Harvard—passionate protests of the war, which had resulted in the occupation of University Hall, had given way to disco mixers.
But even at Harvard, occasional reminders of the war intruded on student life, like receiving my notice to register for the draft on my 18th birthday and walking to the Cambridge City Hall Annex near Central Square. The registrar widened her eyes in disbelief at a Harvard student showing up for his card rather than burning it. She shook her head, causing ashes from her Chesterfield to fall to the counter as she gathered up the forms.
Periodic headlines about Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops advancing on Saigon landed like mortar rounds on my freshman routine of attending classes, washing dishes at Adams House, playing basketball at the Indoor Athletic Building (now the Malkin Center), and partying in Wigglesworth B.
Just below my window was Dexter Gate. Every time I passed beneath the lintel to head to Adams House to scrub pots, I read the inscription: “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.”
The kitchen at Adams House, full of working class Irish kids from Cambridge and Charlestown, seemed more my kind than the undergrads whose plates we washed. Many had brothers or uncles or cousins who had seen combat in Vietnam. They spoke openly of their sacrifice. Over the course of the Vietnam War, six young men from Charlestown died in the conflict. Sixteen from Cambridge. Harvard lost 22, but I never heard them mentioned.
Sitting alone on a battered couch in the Freshman Union—now the Barker Center—in the spring of 1975, I watched TV news reports of the fall of Saigon. Airlifts carried U.S. troops, civilians, embassy personnel, and South Vietnamese allies from rooftops in the capital to waiting naval vessels in the South China Sea. Sailors pushed helicopters, tottering like giant praying mantises, off the flight deck to make room for more.
The wrenching images stirred emotions I didn’t understand and couldn’t share.
A week later, a letter came in the mail informing me that I had won a scholarship established by Henry Kissinger with funds that came with the Nobel Prize he had received for his role in the peace accord. I got the impression the press would be notified. No one called.
ROTC had been booted off campus six years earlier. The indifference of Harvard culture towards the military seemed complete. But there was more. Not long after the fall of Saigon, a section leader joked that the Vietnam War had at least, “taken care of the riff-raff.”
I stood up in the overheated room in Robinson Hall. “My father died in Vietnam,” I said. The instructor seemed mortified.
“I didn’t know,” he said. “I didn’t know.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The committee tasked with selecting Harvard’s next president convened in Cambridge Sunday evening for a closed-door meeting to discuss the search.
Between regular sessions of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers—Harvard’s two highest governing bodies—the 12 members of the Corporation and the three Overseers who comprise the search committee gathered to consider who will succeed outgoing University President Drew G. Faust.
As they left another Loeb House meeting on an unseasonably warm Monday morning, several search committee members declined to comment on the subject of Sunday’s meeting. William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow and the search committee chair, declined to comment. When informed that The Crimson wanted information about Sunday’s meeting, University Treasurer and Corporation member Paul J. Finnegan ’75 demurred.
“I bet you do,” he said.
Historically, presidential search committees have taken a number of steps to keep their deliberations confidential. In 2001, then-candidate Lawrence H. Summers, Faust’s predecessor, arrived at his formal interview with the search committee through a service elevator to avoid the press.
Earlier this month, Corporation member Susan L. Graham said that the search remained in “information-gathering mode,” as it solicits and reviews ideas from Harvard affiliates on who should ascend to Faust’s position once she departs in June. Since then, the committee has unveiled the members of a student advisory committee that will weigh in on the search. The group already appointed faculty and staff advisory groups over the summer.
Economics department chair David I. Laibson ’88 said that social science department heads will meet with a member of the search committee later this week. In past searches, members of the search committee have met with department chairs over breakfast to gauge faculty opinions.
On Monday morning, Corporation members filed into Loeb House, briefcases in hand, to examine the University’s finances. According to former Corporation member Nannerl O. Keohane—whom billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein replaced over the summer—half of the Corporation members, in addition to outside experts, serve on a finance committee, which typically meets Monday mornings on the weeks Harvard’s decision-makers come to town.
“They’re nominated and chosen by the Corporation, but they join the meetings so that we have deeper expertise,” Keohane said of the outside specialists in an interview in April 2016.
The finance committee meeting came less than a week after Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. Narvekar released what he called a “disappointing” 8.1 percent return on the University’s investments. Narvekar attended Monday’s meeting, as did Overseer and search committee member Tracy P. Palandjian ’93.

Harvard Yard and Radcliffe Quad saw three separate laptop thefts from first-floor student rooms over the weekend, including one in which the burglarized suite was occupied at the time.
Steven G. Catalano, spokesperson for the Harvard University Police Department, notified University affiliates of the incidents in an advisory email sent around 2:30 p.m. Monday. According to the email, the police are still investigating the thefts, and are currently unsure of whether the incidents are connected.
The two incidents in the Yard, which houses most of College’s freshman class, occurred in suites on the first floors of Straus and Mower Halls on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. In both of these incidents, the offenders “opened or pushed in screen windows” and took laptops that were on desks near the windows, according to the advisory.
The theft in the Quad occurred on Sunday in Pforzheimer House’s Comstock Hall, according to Catalano. The offender entered two rooms in an occupied suite and left with two laptops and a wallet, according to the alert. None of the suite occupants noticed the theft taking place.
Adam Gordon ’21, who had his laptop stolen from his room in Straus, said he was gone for only few hours and had left his laptop on his desk, as he had normally done in the past.
“I came back, and I had work due, so I went to grab my computer, and where I had it on my desk, it was missing,” Gordon said. “I thought it was a cruel joke from my roommates at first.”
After looking around, Gordon said he and his roommates found that their screen window was loose, several leaves had fallen from a plant near the window, and that Gordon’s headphones were unplugged outside the window. Gordon said he and his roommates had not secured the safety lock on the window in order to cool down the temperature of the room.
Though Gordon reached out to HUPD, he said he has accepted that his laptop most likely will not be returned and plans to be more vigilant in the future.
Catalano advised students to keep their doors locked at all times, to not allow strangers to enter residence halls, and to keep property away from windows.

UPDATED: September 28, 2017 at 2:16 a.m.
The Harvard Graduate Council elected seven students to its executive board Monday evening and discussed ways to respond to President Donald Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Dana Rassas, a Kennedy School student, and Payum Noshiravan, an Extension School student, were elected as the body’s Chair for Advocacy and Chair of Events. Nabil B. Arif, Tas Islam, Hanes Roberts, Kelley E. Menjivar Ramirez, and La’Toya P. Jackson were also elected to vice-chair positions.
During her candidacy speech, Rassas, a Palestinian national who worked for the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, discussed bringing her experiences in “consensus-building” to her role on the Council.
“I worked in a position where I brought different people from different backgrounds to move forward,” Rassas said, “Part of what I think I can do very well is that I channel different opinions and I can get...people and bring them to a table they usually don’t agree to sit at.”
Noshiravan emphasized his prior experience with the Harvard Graduate Council and managing the body’s events.
The council’s representatives are chosen by each of the twelve graduate schools’ student bodies. Each graduate school is permitted one vote on issues before the council. Annual elections for each executive board position are split between the fall and the spring semesters.
During the second half of the meeting, Council President Kevin Tian circulated a draft statement responding to Trump’s recent decision to end DACA, an Obama-era program that provides legal protections and deportation relief to undocumented young people.
“None question the contributions ‘DREAMers’ have made on our campus and none should question the place they deserve to have at this institution,” the statement reads, referring to undocumented minors that would be protected under the proposed Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, a bill that never passed in the U.S. Congress, but later became to the framework for DACA.
The draft statement, which criticizes the DACA repeal as “unnecessarily harsh,” will likely be voted on before the body’s next meeting in two weeks, according to Tian.
“Anyone can submit a comment or a revision, and we can proceed to an e-vote on the finalized portion,” Tian said, “This is definitely a very early working draft, and is obviously very open to input from all of you.”
“Since we are missing some members of the council [tonight], I would like to have everyone present and signing for this document,” Tian added.
During the meeting, Council members also approved a preliminary $33,000 budget for the coming fiscal year to fund the body’s initiatives and events, including the recurring Masquerade Ball and the “Lectures that Last” series.

Outgoing Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem Mazen is exploring a bid to represent Massachusetts’s 3rd Congressional district, according to Federal Election Commission paperwork filed on Sept. 21.
Mazen, who has served two terms on the Council, recently filed a statement of candidacy that would have him running a campaign to fill the seat of retiring House Rep. Niki Tsongas. According to the paperwork, Mazen would run the campaign out of Andover, Mass. He is one of several candidates who has expressed interest in the open Congressional seat.
“I hear from residents who are renewing their participation in community building — across racial, socioeconomic, and town lines,” Mazen said to the Boston Globe. He teased an October 1 announcement “regarding my upcoming campaign plans at the Andover Town House.”
Mazen is the president and co-founder of Jetpac, an organization which seeks to prepare youth and minority candidates to run for office, as well as “empower minority communities through targeted training and civic education programs.” He is also first Muslim elected official in Massachusetts.
When asked about the race to fill the City Council seat he’ll be leaving behind, Mazen said he supported some of the candidates, but was overall discouraged by the lack of student participation in Cambridge politics. Mazen is one of three City Councillors stepping down ahead of November’s municipal elections.
“We’re talking about races that would change if only 100 students from each class voted, even only a handful” he said. “I won my first race here by 6 votes.”
In order to increase student participation and political engagement, Mazen said he thinks that politicians need to speak to the issues young people care about, as well as encourage civic engagement.
“Students could register here every odd year, and vote local every even year, or when they go home” he said. “There’s lots of way for them to participate.”

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana all but refused to discuss a proposal to forbid membership in Harvard social groups in an interview Monday afternoon.
This summer, a committee charged with re-evaluating Harvard’s year-old social group penalties released an interim report recommending that “fraternities, sororities, and similar organizations” be “phased out” by May 2022. If approved, this ban will replace the College’s current social group policy, which—starting with the Class of 2021—bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain fellowships.
During the Monday interview, Khurana, who co-chairs the committee that recommended the ban, declined to comment on whether he supports a social group ban and did not answer questions about how the committee formulated its proposal. The committee will release its final report at the end of the month, and University President Drew G. Faust will have the final say over the recommendations.
The Crimson reported this summer that the proposal to phase out social groups received just seven votes from the 27-member committee, making it only the third-most popular option considered.
Khurana did not answer a question asking how the committee’s third choice became its formal proposal.
“A leak such as the one that happened, which breaches the confidentiality agreement, can have a serious ripple effect on future committees at the University,” Khurana said in reply. “In light of staying true to the confidentiality agreement which we all agreed to, I’m not going to speak to the process by which the committee’s work is being done.”
Khurana said the committee remains “deeply hurt” by the fact that one or more of its members released “confidential information” to The Crimson.
The committee’s report did not mention the two options that received the most votes in its interim report. The most popular option—which garnered 12 votes–suggested Harvard form a new committee to monitor the school’s final clubs, while the next-most popular option (which earned 11 votes) involved banning all Harvard organizations that select members on the basis of race, sex, or socioeconomic status.
Asked why these options were left out of the report, Khurana did not directly respond.
“I will continue to adhere to the confidentiality agreement that all committee members agreed to,” Khurana said. Over the course of the interview, Khurana repeated that statement almost 10 times.
Khurana gave the same answer to a question asking why the committee did not choose to recommend either of the other options.
He declined to comment on whether the committee communicated with Faust or members of the Harvard Corporation during its deliberations. Asked whether he has a plan to implement a social group ban should Faust approve it, Khurana again said he could not violate the confidentiality agreement of the committee.
“The purpose of a confidentiality agreement like this is that each committee member can feel free to speak in an unhindered way without concern that their perspective or point of view will be taken out of context, and to ensure that every question can be asked,” he said.
Khurana displayed a similar reticence when asked about a Faculty motion explicitly designed to kill the College’s social group policy. Computer Science professor and Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 filed the motion, which declares the College shall not “discipline, penalize, or otherwise sanction students” for joining “any lawful organization,” in August 2017.
Professors are slated to discuss the motion at the monthly Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting on Oct. 3, and will vote on the proposal at their next meeting in November. The Faculty debated the College’s penalties at length last year.
Asked whether he believes the Lewis motion, if passed, will invalidate the College’s social group penalties, Khurana declined to comment. Khurana also did not say whether he would continue to pursue the College’s social group policy, or something similar, if Lewis’s motion passes.
“I am personally committed to creating an environment where every student is treated with respect and dignity,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Cambridge City Council agreed unanimously earlier this year to redevelop the Foundry Building outside of Kendall Square, the city manager appropriated $30 million to complete the project at the body’s meeting Monday night.
Cambridge obtained the 53,000-square-foot building from Alexandria Real Estate in 2012, and initially planned to sell the property to developers. However, facing resistance from Council members including Nadeem Mazen and Dennis J. Carlone—who both advocated to turn the building into a public space for Cantabrigians—the Council reevaluated its use of the building.
The City originally allocated $6 million towards the Foundry Building, but subsequently realized that redevelopment would require a budget of upwards of $30 million, according to a city policy order.
Mazen said the Council began seriously considering a re-working of the plan for the Foundry Building late last year. After citizens and officials formed the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority in November 2016, the group drafted a plan with a larger budget for the building that would provide educational programs to Cambridge residents, particularly in science, arts, and mathematics.
“All the Councillors and I were in favor of appropriating more money,” Mazen said.
The plan will be rolled out in two parts, one of which was presented at the City Council meeting Monday night. According to a document by the City Council and the CRA, the three-level building is “124 years old and has not received significant investment since 1982” and must be renovated before educational programs can begin.
With this increased budget, Mazen said the Foundry Building would be better able to reach its potential.
“This is a much more holistic, much more responsible, and much more impactful project now that the money is equal to the types of challenges and the types of community impact in the space that we were originally promised,” Mazen said.
Also at Monday’s meeting, the Council took feedback on the newly-marked bicycle lanes throughout the city. Mazen said that drivers or businesses that value parking space may be unhappy with the increased number of separated bike lanes.
“Tonight we heard some business owners saying, ‘Hey, this isn’t good for us, we wanted that parking space, we wanted the old way of doing things,’” Mazen said.
However, Mazen said the pushback has been minimal compared to the number of residents who have advocated for a more bike-friendly city.
“Although we’ve had two or three emails saying, ‘Hey, I’m not happy with the way we’re doing things,’ we’ve also literally gotten hundreds of emails from residents saying, ‘This is the way to go; we’ve been waiting years, if not decades, for this,” Mazen said.

Amidst both rain and heat, the Harvard women’s tennis team opened its fall season at the Harvard Fall Classic this weekend with a day one sweep and strong showings throughout.
“The Classic is always a great tournament,” sophomore Lexi Milunovich said. “We ended up having a very strong weekend as a team, and we got to have a lot of match play in while playing at home.”
The Classic featured seven East Coast teams besides the Crimson—Air Force, Boston College, Boston University, Buffalo, Delaware, Georgetown, and Connecticut.
Harvard junior Erica Oosterhout came back from a 0-1 deficit to take her first singles match against UConn senior Yelyzaveta Pletnyeva, 1-6, 6-4, 10-8. The comeback win contributed to the Crimson’s solid opening day, in which the team went undefeated in each of its 12 matches against BU and the Huskies. Oosterhout was also unbeaten in her three singles matches over the weekend, prevailing over Air Force sophomore TJ Fumagatti and Delaware sophomore Brooke Pilkington in two sets each.
“The first day...the team had to play at different times, which was kind of tough, and we did a great job supporting each other,” Milunovich said.
Despite not having played as a team since April, Harvard showed no rust on its opening day. The Crimson’s smooth sailing on Friday also featured singles and doubles shutouts against the Terriers, the former by sophomore Irene Lu, and the latter by captain Annika Ringblom and sophomore Jenna Friedel.
“Our opponents were tough, but we competed very hard,” Friedel said. “And we had the support of our teammates behind us, so that always helps out a lot. We came out with a lot of good energy, and found a way to win.”
Sophomore Natasha Gonzalez also emerged from the Classic undefeated in her singles matches, winning all three. She dispatched Delaware junior Draga Sabotic, 6-2, 6-0, in her final match on Sunday, and shares the team’s best record for the season (3-0) with Oosterhout.
“[Gonzalez and Oosterhout] both fought really hard and competed very well this weekend,” Friedel said, adding that their success came from the hard work and training of the past week.
The New England weather forced Harvard’s team, amongst others, to play both inside the Murr Center and outside.
“There are always going to be tough conditions, whether it be wind or match-time delays,” Milunovich said. “We’re going to be playing outside against Yale [for the Yale Bulldog Invite from Oct. 6-8], so it’s good that we got two out of three days outside.”
“Altogether, I don’t think it impacted any of our play,” added Friedel.
While the Fall Classic is an opportunity for the team as a whole to prepare for the rigors of the long tennis season, it’s especially handy for the Crimson’s freshmen to acclimatize to college play. First-years Jenna Moustafa, Anna Li, and Neha Gupta each had at least one dominant singles win. Li’s victory over BC sophomore Micayla Casella, 6-2, 6-1, was Harvard’s lone win against the Eagles in a singles match.
“They’re all strong players, and work hard in practice. [During] the match you could really see they all fought, and were there for us as well, cheering,” Milunovich said of the Crimson’s freshmen.
Also promising was the doubles pair of Gonzalez and Oosterhout; the duo won all three of its matches. Their 6-4 victory against Air Force junior Elizabeth Barnickel and Fumagatti was particularly nail-biting, and Milunovich emphasized how “mentally strong” Harvard’s tandem was throughout the game.
Not every match during the Classic was perfect, of course. The Crimson had a less than ideal record on Sunday against BC and the Blue Hens, going 4-5 in singles and 2-2 in doubles. While freshman Lia Kiam partnered with Gupta for a doubles win against Delaware, she dropped her singles match to Blue Hens freshman Sarah Whited, 1-6, 5-7. Milunovich fell to Sara Komer of Delaware, 4-6, 3-6. But Harvard isn’t too worried.
“The fall is all about seeing what we need to improve on and getting ready for the spring,” Friedel said. “As a whole, we can only take away positives from this weekend.”
Milunovich agreed, saying that the team is not yet looking ahead to what could be a second consecutive Ivy League title.
“Obviously, we’re excited, and we want to do it again,” she said, “[But] the goal is mostly to get a lot of individual match play in, to get experience, so that we peak in the spring.”

On Saturday, Harvard football expected to play four quarters against Brown. Really, the Crimson (1-1, 1-0 Ivy) played three.
After 45 minutes of action, Harvard led 38-2. Thanks to sloppy defense and several onside kicks, the Bears (1-1, 0-1) closed the margin for a 45-28 finale. But only gambling addicts were paying attention to the final score.
For the Crimson, the blowout result came as a relief and a revelation. A relief, because Harvard players had undergone a difficult week following a spinal injury to freshman Ben Abercrombie. A revelation, because the victory over the Bears came after a disheartening loss to Rhode Island.
ALABAMA ROOTS
The Harvard roster lists two defensive backs from Alabama.
One is Abercrombie. On Oct. 16, the freshman suffered paralysis in a game at Rhode Island. Medics rushed him to a hospital, and his parents flew up.
Abercrombie’s prognosis remains uncertain. Yesterday, a local newspaper reported the hope that Abercrombie will be able to breathe on his own this week. No one knows what long-term prospects Abercrombie faces.
The other defensive back from Alabama is Tanner Lee. Last year, he led the Crimson with four interceptions. Given the similarities between Lee and Abercrombie, it’s easy to imagine why the freshman’s injury might affect the senior personally.
On Saturday, with emotions swirling, Lee played perhaps the game of his career. The high point came the first quarter, when Lee anticipated a double-slant route. He grabbed the pass and sprinted 39 yards to the end zone.
In the first half, Lee was a major reason why Brown converted one of 10 third downs. On the Bears’ second possession, Lee defended a third-and-18 by standing up a receiver after 17 yards. With 4:30 left in the second quarter, the safety snuffed out another third down by busting a screen pass.
Lee was only part of a stifling effort. Captain Luke Hutton racked up eight tackles. Afterwards, he attributed the intensity to Abercrombie’s injury.
“We don’t get scholarships, Hutton said. “That’s not our incentive. Our incentive is that we love to play the game. We love the guys in the room. Anytime something happens to someone, because of that love that we have for one another, you’re going to come out with a lot of emotion.”
THERE GOES JOE
Ryan Fitzpatrick, now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was the last freshman quarterback to start for the Crimson. Sixteen years passed before coach Tim Murphy felt confident enough to trust Jake Smith, another rookie, with the keys to the offense.
At Ithaca High School in Michigan, Smith won three state titles and set school rushing records with 1,772 yards and 34 scores. He also starred as a basketball point guard.
Against the Bears, Smith displayed a soft teach and hit targets in the hands. He finished five-of-seven for 72 yards.
“The bottom line is that Jake had performed the best as quarterback in practice over the last two weeks,” Murphy said. “If you look at how relatively sluggish we’ve been, by high Harvard standards, over the past three or four games, we felt like we needed a jolt.”
Five minutes into the second quarter, however, Murphy had seen enough. He inserted fifth-year senior Joe Viviano, the expected starter. In the season opener, Viviano had missed deep balls and taken five sacks. Something must have snapped, because at Harvard Stadium, he was a man possessed.
Viviano took over on the Crimson’s two-yard line. Immediately, he zipped an 11-yard pass to senior tight end Jake Barann. Then came darts to junior wide receivers Henry Taylor (31 yards, down the sideline) and Adam Scott (27 yards, across the field).
All told, the drive spanned 98 yards and four minutes. Viviano finished the afternoon with a red-hot line, completing 11 of 13 throws for 150 yards.
“It was just my gut decision that, based upon the first couple series, Joe would give us the best opportunity to maximize our chance of winning this game,” Murphy said. “It’s hard to quantify, but [the competition] has made him a better quarterback.”
BOOKER CHECKED IN
Junior running back Charlie Booker III was so good Saturday that his lone mistake occurred because no one could tackle him.
Four minutes before halftime, Booker rumbled into a scrum of defenders. The Bears wrapped him up but couldn’t topple him. After several seconds of grappling, senior defensive end Richard Jarvis ripped out the ball.
On the afternoon, Booker carried the ball 13 times for 77 yards and two touchdowns. Last week, he scorched the Rams for 139 yards on 13 rushes.
“I’m just reading everything, doing what I feel like I’m supposed to do,” Booker said. “It’s mainly my teammates carrying me through there.”
Capable backups wait in the wings. Against Brown, freshman running back Aaron Shampklin scored his second career touchdown. Meanwhile, junior rusher Noah Reimers averaged 6.4 yards per carry in mop-up duty.
Absent from this list is senior Semar Smith, who is out for the season after a practice injury. He was slated for foot surgery last week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 26, 2017 at 7:31 p.m.
From strong winds and currents on Saturday to clear skies on Sunday, the Crimson teams competed in a medley of weather conditions this past weekend. The mixed forecast translated to mixed results.
The Harvard sailing teams competed in the NEISA Singlehanded Championships, Amanda Trophy, and the Hood Trophy, with the women’s team winning the B Division over the course of the whole regatta. The NEISA Singlehanded Championships and the Amanda Trophy were both held at Roger Williams University, while the Hood Trophy took place at Tufts.
The team battled strong currents and winds of 10 to 13 knots on Saturday but enjoyed milder weather on Sunday. One Crimson sailor who benefitted from the light weather conditions on Sunday was Jessica Williams, who finished in twelfth place with 122 points in the A Division of the NEISA single-handed championship.
“I actually did better [on Sunday] than [Saturday], Williams said. “It was light wind if you just kept track of the current. Then it was easy to do well.”
At the Amanda Trophy, Lucy Wilmot and Alejandra Resendiz cruised towards victory with 18 points in the B-Division, leading the women’s team to an overall third place in the regatta and an impressive win over MIT, the University of Rhode Island, and Brown by two points each.
The success of the Crimson women’s sailing team is especially impressive considering some challenges that the team has faced over the past months.
“We lost one of our top women’s laser sailors this year, so that was a little bit hard,” Williams said. “We did the best we could this semester—we don’t really have a lot of time to train. But it was pretty good considering that we have not sailed lasers for that long this semester.”
At the 35th Professor Stedman Hood Trophy, the co-ed teams of Taylor Ladd and Kirstin Anderson competed in the A division along with Nick DiGiovanni, Nicholas Karnovsky, and Catherine Tang in the B division. At last year’s interconference regatta, the Harvard sailing team competed against 18 other teams and placed sixth overall. This year, the Crimson team saw improvements with fifth-place overall finish.
Members of the Crimson men’s team also found success this weekend, with junior Jackson Wagner winning race nine of the NEISA Singlehanded Championships and placing fifth in race eight, along with team members Andrew Puopolo and Jonas Nelle, who placed third and fourth respectively in the race. This regatta was a marked improvement for Poupolo, who finished eighth overall this year, compared to 14th and 13th his freshman and sophomore years.
Yet, as with the women’s team, the men’s team had to adjust to the challenges of the mixed weather throughout the weekend.
“This weekend, there were two competing weather patterns. One side of the port had a lot less current than the other side of the port,” Puopolo said. “And with some of the races, there was a lot more wind on the other side, so it was quite challenging.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
A previous version of this article incorrectly misquoted Andrew Puopolo as having referenced “ports.” The correct quote should read “one side of the course” instead of “one side of the port.”
