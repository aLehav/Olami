DETROIT—Detroit. For many people, the name conjures up the American auto industry. For others, it recalls pictures of abandoned buildings or news of the city’s recent bankruptcy. But for me, Detroit has always meant home. It is the city where I was born, and while I no longer live there, it is a city to which I remain fiercely loyal.
I go back to visit Detroit often—I visited over winter break, and then again right after spring final exams. While I made a potentially questionable decision in booking a 6:00am flight for the day after my last exam, the trip, during which I visited family friends and saw many of the city’s most famous attractions, turned out to be very enjoyable.
Detroit is often used as a metonym for the auto industry or as an example of urban decay. But neither of those alone can define Detroit. Yes, Detroit is the center of the American auto industry, and yes, Detroit certainly has many problems to confront (not the least of which is its bankruptcy). But underneath it all, Detroit is beautiful, Detroit is historic, and Detroit is coming back.
Whether it’s the exquisitely hand-painted lobby ceiling of the Fisher Building or the huge mural of Michigan in the Guardian Building, Detroit’s art and architecture is enough to make even the most cloyed of travelers take a step back in admiration. What’s more, the city’s rich history extends far beyond the reach of the automobile - it is also the birthplace of the American pharmaceutical industry, Motown music, and techno. It’s the best hockey city in America and has impressive cultural attractions, from a phenomenal art museum to more theaters than anyone can count.
And despite the city’s well-publicized troubles, Detroit has plenty of optimists and plenty of people who are dedicated to helping the city come back. You can sense the city’s resurgence in the neon sign on Woodward Avenue that reads “Nothing Stops Detroit,” in Quicken Loans founder and billionaire Dan Gilbert’s revitalizations of historic buildings, in the message “Proud to be in Detroit” written on the trucks owned by the Whole Foods in Midtown, and in the throngs of people from around the Detroit area who show up to buy groceries and food at Eastern Market every Saturday.
Detroit’s struggles are well documented, and there is no disputing that the city is going through tough times. But, despite its reputation, Detroit is a great city, and it is on the rise again. It is where I was born, and that’s something of which I’ll always be proud.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Margaret A. “Maggie” Williams, who has served as a close advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton for more than 20 years, including as manager of Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, will be the new director of the John F. Kennedy School of Government’s Institute of Politics, the school announced Thursday afternoon.
Williams will replace C.M. Trey Grayson ’94, who is leaving the post to return to his native Kentucky, where he will serve as the president of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. The first black woman to hold the position, Williams will begin work in Cambridge this summer.
“I have long been impressed with the focus on politics and that focus being...from young people,” Williams said. “I’m profoundly honored to be working with people that I think are going to run the world.”
Williams is no stranger to the Institute of Politics—she spent time at the Institute as a fellow in 2005 and has served on its senior advisory committee in recent years.
In 1992, Williams joined the Clinton White House as then-First Lady Hillary Clinton’s chief of staff, becoming the first black woman to do so.
“She is just incredibly passionate about trying to support and reinforce activities for the next generation,” said Kennedy School Dean David. T. Ellwood ’75. “She has believed deeply in public service her whole life.”
Ellwood, who called Williams a “bold and innovative leader,” added that he and the other members of the committee tasked with selecting the next director thought “she was a perfect fit.”
In addition to Ellwood, the committee was composed of Kenneth M. Duberstein, chair of the IOP senior advisory committee and former chief-of-staff to President Ronald Reagan, professor of public policy Iris Bohnet, and Elaine L. Chao, former U.S. Secretary of Labor and a member of the IOP senior advisory committee.
Williams noted that that the Institute’s greatest strengths is its bipartisan mission.
“I think one of the biggest attributes of the IOP is that it’s bipartisan, because that’s the way great politics work,” she said. “The more we can bring people together across party and ideological lines…. That’s what the IOP is all about.”
Before delving into any initiatives, Williams said she will spend the first few months as director listening to students.
“I think the most important thing for me to do right away...is to sit and listen to the constituency that I’m trying to serve and then to think how I can bring that to them,” she said.
Williams is currently a partner at Griffin Williams Critical Point Management, a communications consulting firm she co-founded in 2005.
Williams graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C., with a B.A. in political science in 1977 and also holds a M.A. in communication philosophy from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
